Fungal species can survive in virtually all biotopes on earth, as they have been identified in water and soil, and on plants and animals. Part of their success comes from the ability to use different reproductive strategies, which provide increased flexibility for diverse environmental requirements. Fungal species can produce sexual cells and/or asexual cells in distinct reproductive structures. Some fungi are able to reproduce both sexually and asexually depending on the circumstances, while others display one mode of reproduction, only. Sexual reproduction and recombination allows the repair of naturally occurring mutations and results in new genotypes and phenotypes that allow for natural selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, asexual reproduction provides the ability to disperse numerous genetically identical mitospores, without the metabolic costs of sexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>Aspergillus niger </italic>is an ascomycetous fungus that is considered to reproduce through asexual spores, only. Since <italic>A. niger </italic>is used as a host for the production of homologous and heterologous proteins and commercially important compounds (such as citric acid), the potential presence of a sexual cycle is highly significant for strain improvement. Recent analysis of the <italic>A. niger </italic>genome has revealed the presence of a full complement of genes related to sexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It was therefore suggested that there could be a latent sexual potential in <italic>A. niger</italic>. A similar observation applies to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus </italic>and <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>, both only known to reproduce asexually, so far. Comparison of the two genomes to the genome of <italic>Aspergillus nidulans </italic>(please note that the holomorph is correctly named <italic>Emericella nidulans</italic>, but is hereafter mentioned as <italic>A. nidulans</italic>), which has a known sexual cycle, suggests that both <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>and <italic>A. oryzae </italic>may be capable of sexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has yet to be determined whether genes related to sexual reproduction in supposedly asexual fungi are functional.</p><p>Dioxygenase genes with homology to mammalian prostaglandin synthase (PGS) have been connected to the formation of oxylipins in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. Dioxygenase genes and oxylipins are linked to reproduction as they regulate the balance between sexual and asexual sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The goal of this study was to investigate whether or not oxylipins and dioxygenase genes related to sexual reproduction are also present in the asexual fungus <italic>A. niger</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RP-HPLC analysis</title><p>A crude extract of <italic>A. niger </italic>N402 biomass was incubated with 18:2 and the reaction mixture was extracted with SPE and analyzed on RP-HPLC.

Also, a small peak of methyl 13-hydroxy octadecanoate was present in the GC chromatogram. In the GC/MS analysis of the corresponding non-hydrogenated monohydroxy fatty acids as TMS ethers of methyl ester derivatives, three peaks were visible in the GC chromatogram.

The reaction with [U-<sup>13</sup>C] 18:2 showed that these compounds were produced from a mixture of exogenously added and endogenously present 18:2.</p><p>The presence of 5,8-diHOD, lactonized 5,8-diHOD, 8-HOD and 10-HOD, but not the presence of 8,11-diHOD were reported in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and related to sexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, in the present study 8,11-diHOD was one of the oxylipins formed by <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. During the preparation of this manuscript, a study was published showing that the asexual fungus <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>also produced 5,8-diHOD, 8,11-diHOD 8-HOD and 10-HOD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This indicates that <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. nidulans </italic>and <italic>A. fumigatus </italic>all produce the same oxylipins.</p><p>Analysis of the <italic>A. niger </italic>genome revealed that this fungus contains three putative dioxygenase genes, <italic>ppoA</italic>, <italic>ppoC </italic>and <italic>ppoD</italic>. A <italic>ppoB </italic>homologue was not present. <italic>A. niger </italic>transformants lacking the <italic>ppoA </italic>or <italic>ppoD </italic>gene were not altered in their ability to produce oxylipins and sporulation. A reduction in conidiospore formation was observed in the <italic>ppoC </italic>multicopy strain. In contrast, in <italic>A. nidulans ppoA</italic>, <italic>ppoB </italic>or <italic>ppoC </italic>were found to be connected to oxylipin production and to modification of sexual and asexual sporulation. Deletion of <italic>ppoA</italic>, <italic>ppoB </italic>or <italic>ppoC </italic>was demonstrated to reduce the level of 8-HOD, 8-HOM and 8-HOM, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. But a later study showed that deletion of <italic>ppoA </italic>led to a reduction of 8-HOD and 5,8-diHOD formation and that elimination of <italic>ppoC </italic>reduced 10-HOD formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The removal of <italic>ppoB </italic>did not alter oxylipin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, deletion of <italic>ppoA </italic>or <italic>ppoB </italic>from the <italic>A. nidulans </italic>genome increased the ratio of asexual to sexual spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Elimination of <italic>ppoC </italic>on the other hand, significantly reduced the ratio of asexual to sexual spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Absence of a phenotype for the disruption strains of <italic>A. niger </italic>for <italic>ppoA </italic>and <italic>ppoD</italic>, could suggest that they are non-essential or that they in fact have the same function. Future studies into these genes should include construction of double-disruptants. The inability to isolate <italic>ppoC </italic>disruptants might suggest that this is an essential gene in <italic>A. niger </italic>even though this is not the case in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and could possibly indicate significant differences in the role of these genes in different fungi. When linoleic acid was added, all strains showed reduced asexual sporulation compared to the wild type, suggesting that addition of linoleic acid could not be compensated for when the production of the different Ppo's is altered in <italic>A. niger</italic>.</p><p><italic>A. niger </italic>PpoD had deviating amino acid residues in the vicinity of the proximal His domain and did not contain the proline knot motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This motif targets plant proteins to oil bodies and it has been demonstrated that fungi target such proteins to oil bodies as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, the proline knot is predicted to facilitate the formation of an antiparallel &#x003b1;-helix or &#x003b2;-strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>A. niger </italic>PpoD likely differs from the other Ppo's in its three dimensional structure It could be argued that the presence of <italic>ppoD </italic>instead of <italic>ppoB </italic>in <italic>A. niger </italic>is related to the reproductive differences between <italic>A. niger </italic>and <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. However, this seems unlikely since the genomes of <italic>Aspergillus clavatus</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus oryzae </italic>and <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic>, all not known to reproduce sexually, do contain <italic>ppoB </italic>homologues. Additionally, <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, a fungus belonging to the same class as the <italic>Aspergilli</italic>, contains <italic>ppoD </italic>and also does not contain <italic>ppoB</italic>, but is able to produce sexual spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Expression analysis of <italic>A. niger ppoA</italic>, <italic>ppoC </italic>and <italic>ppoD </italic>shows that these genes are expressed and their expression levels depend on the fungus' developmental stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It should be noted that <italic>A. niger </italic>is heterothallic and requires mating between two isolates with different mating types. Despite the fact that <italic>A. niger </italic>appears to contain all the genes required for a sexual cycle, until now, no sexual cycle has been observed for <italic>A. niger </italic>on any of a broad range of growth conditions (Paul Dyer, personal communication). In contrast, <italic>A. nidulans </italic>is a homothallic species in which both mating types are present in a single strain and can therefore cross with itself. This difference might hint towards different strategies for regulation of sexual and asexual development. Studies of these genes in other homothallic and heterothallic Aspergilli, could demonstrate whether this is a general difference between homothallic and heterothallic species. This could include the presence or absence of expression of specific dioxygenase genes.</p><p>Strictly asexual species are considered an evolutionary endpoint, and truly asexual species are thought to be extremely rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Sequencing of fungal genomes and comparative analysis of sexual and asexual species show that fungi that have long been considered asexual organisms, may have a latent potential for sexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, the presence of sex related genes alone, does not confirm sexual reproduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that <italic>A. niger </italic>produces the same oxylipins and has similar dioxygenase genes as <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. Even though, the functionality of these genes remains as yet to be proven, their presence could point towards the existence of sexual reproduction in <italic>A. niger </italic>or a broader role for the gene products in physiology, than just sexual development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>All chemicals used were commercially obtained and of analytical grade.
