The holoenzyme of PP-2A consists of the scaffold A subunit, the catalytic C subunit and the regulatory B subunit. The scaffold subunits, PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, provide a platform for both C and B subunits to bind, thus playing a crucial role in providing specific PP-2A activity. Mutation of the two genes encoding PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; leads to carcinogenesis and likely other human diseases. Regulation of these genes by various factors, both extracellular and intracellular, remains largely unknown. In the present study, we have conducted functional dissection of the promoter of the mouse PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene. Our results demonstrate that the proximal promoter of the mouse PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene contains numerous cis-elements for the binding of CREB, ETS-1, AP-2&#x003b1;, SP-1 besides the putative TFIIB binding site (BRE) and the downstream promoter element (DPE). Gel mobility shifting assays revealed that CREB, ETS-1, AP-2&#x003b1;, and SP-1 all bind to PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene promoter. In vitro mutagenesis and reporter gene activity assays reveal that while SP-1 displays negative regulation, CREB, ETS-1 and AP-2A&#x003b1; all positively regulate the promoter of the PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene. ChIP assays further confirm that all the above transcription factors participate the regulation of PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene promoter. Together, our results reveal that multiple transcription factors regulate the PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are the most important regulatory mechanisms modulating functions of more than one third of the total cellular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Olsen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, mutations in both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms of the scaffolding subunit result in compromised binding to the regulatory or catalytic subunit of PP-2A. As a result, the functional scaffold subunits are diminished or substantially reduced and the specific PP-2A activity is compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Janssens1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Statistical analysis revealed that the P value is less than 0.05 when each mutant promoter was compared with the wild type promoter. Thus, mutation of either AP-2&#x003b1; site causes statistically significant change in the PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).

Gel mobility shifting demonstrates that AP-2&#x003b1; from both ARPE-19 and FHL124 nuclear extracts binds to the oligo containing the wild type AP-2&#x003b1; (1) binding site. Nuclear extracts prepared from ARPE-19 cells (Lane 1 to 5) and FHL124 cells (Lane 6 to 10) were incubated with &#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP-labeled oligo-nucleotide containing wild-type AP-2&#x003b1; binding site under various conditions shown in the figure. The reaction mixtures were then separated with 5&#x00025; native PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film for overnight.

The P value was calculated by comparing the activity difference between each individual mutant promoter with the wild type promoter, or between the mutant promoter with both AP-2&#x003b1; sites mutated with the wild type promoter in the same type of cell.

The nuclear extract from ARPE-19 cells displayed a relatively weak binding to SP-1/SP-3 oligo (lane 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) compared with the extract from FHL124 cells (lane 7 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Nevertheless, this binding is specific in both types of cells because it can be completely competed off by the cold SP-1/SP-3 oligo (lane 1, 8 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) but much less competition (lane 9 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) or very little competition (lane 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) was observed with the mutant oligo. Addition of the anti-SP-1 antibody (lane 5 and 11 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) or anti-SP-3 antibody (lane 6 and 12 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) but not normal IgG (lane 4 and 10 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) into the binding reactions between labeled SP-1/SP-3 oligo and the nuclear extracts from the two types of cells induced the supershifting band. Similar binding pattern was observed with SP-1/SP-3 oligo and nuclear extract from mouse &#x003b1;TN4-1 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that SP-1/SP-3 also regulates PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene. To determine the nature of the SP-1/SP-3 regulation on PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene, we mutated the SP-1/SP-3 binding site within the core promoter of PP2A-A&#x003b1;, and compared the relative luciferase activity between the two constructs with either wild type or mutant SP-1/SP-3 binding sites in both ARPE-19 and FHL124 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, mutation of the SP-1/SP-3 binding site led to 17 to 18&#x00025; increase in the PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter activity as assayed in both types of cells. The P value for this difference is less than 0.015 when the mutant promoter was compared with the wild type promoter in the same type of cell assayed. Thus, mutation of SP-1/SP-3 site causes statistically significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). To confirm this negative regulation, we also conducted co-transfection analysis of the luciferase reporter gene activity in the presence of the exogenous SP-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>) or exogenous SP-3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>, expression of the exogenous SP-1 induces a dose-dependent decrease in the luciferase activity in both ARPE-19 cells and FHL124 cells, and this down-regulation is statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.001). Mutation of the SP-1 site in the PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter abolished this dose-dependent response (data not shown). On the other hand, expression of the exogenous SP-3 induced a slight decrease in the luciferase activity in both ARPE-19 cells and FHL124 cells, which is not statistically significant since the P value is larger than 0.05. In addition, expression of the exogenous SP-1 led to some down-regulation in the expression of the endogenous PP2A-A&#x003b1; in both types of ocular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>).

Indeed, in vitro mutagenesis and luciferase reporter gene activity assays revealed that this SP-1 binding site exerts negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6C and 6D</xref>), which is different from its action in other target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Dynan1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of the exogenous SP-1 expression vector into both retinal pigment epithelial cells and lens epithelial cells induces dose-dependent decrease of the PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter activity and also downregulates expression of the endogenous PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene in these cells, further confirming that the SP-1 binding site within the core promoter acts as a repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of the exogenous SP-3 expression vector into the two types of cells also lead to negative control, which seems not statistically significant.</p><p>Outside of the core promoter of the PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene, three well-conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements are identified: one ETS-1 binding site localized from &#x02212;202 to &#x02212;192, one CREB binding site found from &#x02212;373 to &#x02212;362, and two AP-2&#x003b1; binding sites localized from &#x02212;321 to &#x02212;312, and from &#x02212;84 to &#x02212;76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Depending on the target genes and interacting partners, CREB, ETS-1 and AP-2&#x003b1; may act as either positive regulators or repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Pufall1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Eckert1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, gel mobility shifting assays with nuclear extracts from ARPE-19 or FHL124 cells reveal that both ETS-1 and CREB can strongly bind to the cognate <italic>cis</italic>-elements, indicating that these <italic>cis</italic>-elements are functional. <italic>In vitro</italic> mutagenesis and reporter gene assays demonstrate that both ETS-1 and CREB binding sites in the proximal promoter of the PP2A-A&#x003b1; play very important role. Mutations of the ETS-1 and CREB sites individually lead to a loss of 58&#x00025; and 43&#x00025; promoter activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g004">4C</xref>). Mutation of both sites at the same time causes additional lose of the proximal PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter, suggesting that both ETS-1 and CREB have some synergistic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). Besides the ETS-1 and CREB binding sites, there are two copies of AP-2&#x003b1; binding sites in the proximal promoter. The AP-2&#x003b1; (2) site localized between &#x02212;84 to &#x02212;76 is more conserved than the other AP-2&#x003b1; (1) site localized within &#x02212;321 to &#x02212;312 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistent with this conservation is the effect they displayed on the reporter gene activity. When mutated, the promoter with the mutant AP-2&#x003b1; (2) loses about 15&#x00025; promoter activity. In contrast, mutation of the AP-2&#x003b1; (1) causes about 10&#x00025; lose in the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Mutation of both AP-2&#x003b1; sites leads to a total of 18&#x00025; loss in the PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter activity, also indicating the partial synergistic action between the two AP-2&#x003b1; sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g006">Figs. 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g008">8A</xref>). In both retinal epithelial cells and human lens epithelial cells, the enhancement of transcription by ETS-1, CREB, and AP-2&#x003b1; was further confirmed by the co-transfection study in which a dose-dependent response of the reporter gene activity was observed for each factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g004">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g005">5D</xref>). Moreover, expression of each exogenous transcription factor also displays similar mode of action to the endogenous PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g004">4E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g005">5E</xref>). Thus, in vitro mutagenesis and co-transfection assays demonstrate that all three <italic>cis</italic>-elements act as enhancers in the PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter. This conclusion is further confirmed by ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007019-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate that the PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter, though lacking the TATA box, contains the putative BRE and DPE elements mediating the basic regulation by the general transcriptional factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Butler1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and the enhancer elements (ETS, CREB and AP-2&#x003b1;) mediating the advanced control by the cognate <italic>trans</italic>-factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; Plays A Critical Role in the Assembly of the Functional PP-2A</title><p>As a major eukaryotic phosphatase, the normal function of PP-2A is essential in maintaining the organism homeostasis and preventing various pathological conditions such as cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Moorhead1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Wang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Ruediger4">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. PP-2A exists as either a heterodimeric core enzyme including the scaffold A subunit and catalytic C subunit, or a heterotrimeric holoenzyme consisting of the core enzyme plus one of the regulatory B subunits, thus providing temporal and spatial specificity of PP-2A activity within tissue cells of different organisms.</p><p>Since both C and B subunits bind to the A subunit, the normal function of the scaffold A subunit plays a critical role in the assembly of either core enzyme or holoenzyme of PP-2A to govern its specific activity. This conclusion is derived from numerous studies. First, interruption of the function of the scaffold subunit by the small t antigen inhibits PP2A activity. The virus-encoded small t antigen (ST) of DNA tumor viruses SV40 and polyomavirus can exclusively bind to PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Walter2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Janssens2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> in the HEAT repeats 3 to 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Yang1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Chen1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result of this binding, the phosphatase activity of the PP-2A core enzyme, but not the holoenzyme, was inhibited by the t antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Scheidtmann1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Reudiger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Ruediger5">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that varying the ratio of PP-2A core enzyme to holoenzyme causes significant biological consequence. Binding of the t antigen to PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; stimulates MAPK activation and induces cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Sontag1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and eventually cell transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Hahn1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Second, mutations in the gene encoding PP2A-A&#x003b1; leads to abolished PP-2A activity. Calin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Calin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> described four cancer-associated mutations in the PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene: Glu64-Asp in lung carcinoma, Glu64-Gly in breast carcinoma, Arg418-Trp in melanoma, and a deletion mutant missing residue 171 to residue 589 in breast carcinoma. Reudiger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Ruediger4">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that these mutations greatly interrupt the interactions of the scaffold subunit with either B subunit alone (Glu64-Asp and Glu64-Gly), or with both B and C subunits (Arg418&#x02013;Trp, and the deletion mutant), thus abolishing specific PP-2A activity and leading to tumor formation.</p><p>In addition, the normal expression level of PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene plays an essential role in the assembly of functional PP-2A. It has been shown that both A and C subunits are expressed in similar levels in normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Ruediger4">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in about 43&#x00025; brain tumor patients (Gliomas), PP-2A activity was significantly lower than that found in the normal brain tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Colella1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This decrease in PP-2A activity is neither derived from changed expression of the catalytic subunit of PP-2A nor from mutations of the PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; subunits but a 10-fold downregulation in the expression of PP2A-A&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Colella1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. What accounts for the downregulation of PP2A-A&#x003b1; in these brain tumors remains to be further explored. Nevertheless, our demonstrations that the proximal promoter of PP2A-A&#x003b1; contains multiple <italic>cis</italic>-elements including the binding sites for ETS-1, CREB, AP-2&#x003b1; and SP-1, and that these <italic>cis</italic>-elements are all functional provide some clues. The downregulated expression of the PP2A-A&#x003b1; gene found in the gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Colella1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> may be derived from the changed expression levels and functions of the related transcription factors. In this regard, it is worth to mention that ETS-1 is closely involved in gliomas development. ETS-1 protein is not only differentially expressed in astrocytes and astrocytoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Kitange1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> but also regulates various targets such as Egr-1, cathepsin B and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator besides PP2A-A&#x003b1; in gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Fleischman1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. A reduced expression of PP2A-A&#x003b1; has also been observed in other cancer cells such as breast cancer MCF-7 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007019-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and prostate cancer cells (Li et al. unpublished data). Our preliminary studies suggest the reduced PP2A-A&#x003b1; expression is derived from changed expression levels of one or more transcription factors.</p><p>In summary, our characterization of the PP2A-A&#x003b1; promoter lays a foundation for the further exploration on why PP2A-A&#x003b1; is differentially expressed in the different types of cancers. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms governing PP2A-A&#x003b1; expression will contribute fundamental knowledge to the understanding of the PP-2A functions in carcinogenesis and also other human
