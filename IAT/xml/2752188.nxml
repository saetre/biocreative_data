Small molecule inhibitors of Kinesin-5, developed as potential anti-cancer drugs, arrest cell in mitosis and promote apoptosis of cancer cells. We performed a genome-wide siRNA screen for enhancers and suppressors of a Kinesin-5 inhibitor in human cells to elucidate cellular responses, and thus identify factors that might predict drug sensitivity in cancers. Because the drug's actions play out over several days, we developed an intermittent imaging screen. Live HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B were imaged at 0, 24 and 48 hours after drug addition, and images were analyzed using open-source software that incorporates machine learning. This screen effectively identified siRNAs that caused increased mitotic arrest at low drug concentrations (enhancers), and vice versa (suppressors), and we report siRNAs that caused both effects. We then classified the effect of siRNAs for 15 genes where 3 or 4 out of 4 siRNA oligos tested were suppressors as assessed by time lapse imaging, and by testing for suppression of mitotic arrest in taxol and nocodazole. This identified 4 phenotypic classes of drug suppressors, which included known and novel genes. Our methodology should be applicable to other screens, and the suppressor and enhancer genes we identified may open new lines of research into mitosis and checkpoint biology.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin-5 (also known as Kif-11, Eg5 and KSP), is a plus-end-directed, tetrameric motor protein required for establishing spindle bipolarity during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Blangy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Sawin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

In clinical trials, as hoped, K5Is do not cause neurotoxicity, but they do cause severe bone marrow toxicity, and it is not yet clear which patients, if any, will benefit from treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Jackson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. To facilitate success of these drugs, it will be necessary to discover effective combination therapies, and/or identify particular cancer genotypes that respond well. This will require deeper understanding of cell responses. To this end, we sought to identify genes for which partial or full loss of function makes cells either more resistant (suppressors) or more sensitive (enhancers) to drug treatment.</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) technology provides an efficient strategy to systematically test the role of individual genes in the response of live cells or model organisms to drug treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Bartz1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Swanton1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However, most RNAi screens in human or <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells have used assays where cells are fixed or lysed at a certain time point to obtain a readout, which limits the amount of data that can be obtained.

Here, we report a simple intermittent live cell imaging method for scoring cell cycle and cell death phenotypes in living cells, and its use to find suppressors and enhancers of a Kinesin-5 inhibitor. We used this method to screen a library of siRNAs targeting the full human genome, and further characterized the strongest suppressors using time-lapse imaging. We found several expected genes, and others that may reveal new cellular systems involved in how the mitotic spindle responds to drug perturbation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa H2B-GFP cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Kanda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> were grown at 37&#x000b0;C under 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum and 1&#x00025; penicillin streptomycin (Gibco).

We hoped to find proteins that modified cell responses to the drug at the level of mitotic arrest, and also at the level of apoptosis following mitotic arrest, though in practice our screen was more effective for finding the former. The concept was to pre-treat cells with siRNAs targeting one protein, then to add drug at either a low concentration, scoring for enhancement of the drug effect, or at a high concentration, scoring for suppression. We elected to omit a no drug arm to save on reagents, and distinguished true enhancers from siRNAs that scored without drug in follow-up assays. The drug response plays out over several days in unsynchronized cells. At &#x0223c;24 hours after adding drug there is a peak in mitotic arrest, and at &#x0223c;48 hours a peak in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Shi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Orth1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore sought an assay that allowed scoring the response at multiple time-points.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Strategy for Assay Development</title><p>We chose high content cell imaging to read out our screening assay, an information rich method that facilitated monitoring of multiple phenotypes. We then considered whether to perform a fixed endpoint or time-lapse assay. Typically, an imaging screen for mitotic phenotypes would be performed as a fixed endpoint assay in microplates with immunofluorescence staining for DNA and indicators of mitotic arrest and perhaps also apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Rines1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The advantage of this method lies in ease of image analysis; with antibodies to different cell-cycle states, classification of cell phenotypes is straightforward. However, fixed endpoint imaging would limit our ability to quantify both the mitotic arrest and apoptosis responses, since they are separated by &#x0223c;24 hours. Other potential drawbacks of a fixed endpoint immunofluorescence assays include the cost of antibodies as well as potential loss of weakly adherent mitotic cells and distortion of cellular structures during fixation. Hence, a live cell time-lapse assay is, in principle, ideal for characterizing the effects of siRNAs that perturb cell division. However, time-lapse imaging across a whole genome screen is technically challenging. One approach was a miniaturized RNAi delivery system, in which cells were plated onto individually spotted siRNA transfection mixes, resulting in localized solid-phase transfection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Neumann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this approach required specialized instrumentation and time-consuming analysis techniques, and generated enormous amounts of data.</p><p>We developed a compromise strategy, intermittent live cell imaging. By imaging the same wells at several time points, we benefited from the ability to score the same wells immediately before drug, during peak mitotic arrest (&#x0223c;24 hours in drug) and peak apoptosis (&#x0223c;48 hours in drug), but can still use relatively standard image collection and analysis methods developed for fixed cells. This sparse time-lapse strategy should be useful for any assay where cell responses play out over a few days.</p><p>HeLa cells were chosen for the assay because they are easily transfected and a line expressing Histone H2B-GFP was available (Kanda et al., 1998, kind gift of Randy King, HMS). The cell phenotypes we needed to score have unique nuclear morphologies (interphase nuclei vs. mitotic chromosomes). Recent advances in computational methods have proven effective at using a single nuclear channel to quantify these phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Jones1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Jones2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. One disadvantage of H2B-GFP is that the expression level is not constant from cell to cell, so intensity measures cannot be readily compared between cells, as they can for DNA staining with DAPI or Hoechst.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Image analysis</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows examples of our image analysis methods.

In bipolar mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), condensed chromosomes line up in a metaphase plate, displayed as bright oblong objects under the microscope. Cells arrested in mitosis from treatment with K5I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) or knockdown of certain siRNAs, have a characteristic monopolar spindle phenotype as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Mayer1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, a monopolar mitotic cell displayed a characteristic spotted texture due to misaligned chromosomes. This property is quantified by top descriptors such as small form factor (defined as 4&#x0002a;pi&#x0002a;Area/Perimeter<sup>&#x02227;</sup>2), due to the rough edge resulting from chromatin radiating from the cell center, and large standard deviation of intensity, caused by chromosome condensation and overlap in the z-dimension.</p><p>Interphase nuclei display relatively uniform intensities, a property that allows straightforward detection by the descriptors with 95&#x00025; accuracy. While larger intensity variations are observed between monopolar cells due to their slightly elevated focal plane, the accuracy of the descriptors is between 75&#x02013;90&#x00025; depending on image quality. Although bipolar mitotic spindles were another major phenotype observed in the screen with highly accurate descriptors, its classification was omitted due to uncertainty introduced by the relatively short duration of this phenotype.</p><p>Some cell density variation was observed after cells were plated with the Matrix WellMate. The distribution followed a Gaussian distribution slightly skewed to the right. The cell count cut-off for the step function in our formula to calculate Enhancer/Suppressor scores was set to 100, which excluded 251 (1.2&#x00025;) and 362 (1.7&#x00025;) low cell count wells from the enhancer and suppressor arms of the whole genome respectively.</p><p>To classify the phenotypes produced by each siRNA and to rank genes for further follow-up, data from CellProfiler were used to calculate Enhancer or Suppressor scores for each siRNA as described in detail in Materials and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>.

For secondary screening, we decided to follow up on genes in the top 2&#x00025; of the Enhancer score list and bottom 2&#x00025; of the Suppressor score list.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g004">Figure 4</xref>, siRNAs that caused an increase in the number of monopolar spindles were easily identified. Cells treated with 60 nM K5I alone showed little difference to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref>), while a hit phenotype demonstrated extensive monopolar metaphase arrest followed by apoptosis at subsequent time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g004">Figure 4E, F</xref>). To save time and money, we did not run a no-drug arm in the primary screen. Thus, many of our preliminary &#x0201c;enhancers&#x0201d; were expected to be siRNAs that cause mitotic arrest even in the absence of drug.

We chose these 90 siRNAs based on their relatively strong enhancer phenotypes. siRNAs for 38 of the 90 genes were found to cause arrest of cells in mitosis in the absence of K5I treatment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007339.s002">Table S1</xref> for details). We also tested individual siRNA duplexes and pools for these 90 genes with a second, structurally diverse Kinesin-5 inhibitor from Merck Serono, used at sub-threshold concentrations, and found very similar results to our primary K5I results, confirming the specificity of the enhancer effect with respect to drug mechanism: for 87 out of 90 genes at least one siRNA duplex scored positive with both K5I inhibitors (30 out of 90 had one common positive siRNA duplex, 35 out of 90 had two common positive duplexes, 18 out of 90 had three common positive duplexes, and 4 out of 90 had four common positive duplexes.</p><p>Among the genes targeted by siRNAs that score as K5I enhancers, we found numerous genes involved in regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis. Some of these, including PLK1, STK6 (Aurora A Kinase, AURKA), SGOL1 (shugoshin), CDCA5 (sororin), CKAP5 (cytoskeleton associated protein, CH-TOG), and KIF11 (the target of our test drug), caused some increase in the fraction of cells in monopolar mitotic arrest with siRNA knockdown alone. These are all proteins known to play essential roles in mitosis, which, if completely knocked down, should on their own cause very strong mitotic arrest. Thus, while they score as K5I enhancers in the screen, they are better thought of as essential mitotic proteins. We surmise that the siRNA knockdown is incomplete in most cases, and that low drug concentrations have an effect on mitotic phenotype that is additive with partial loss of protein. This consideration complicated analysis of the enhancer siRNAs, and we therefore prioritized K5I suppressor siRNAs for further analysis.

This experiment appeared to cleanly divide the genes into two classes, those that strongly suppressed both taxol and nocodazole in addition to K5I, and those that only suppressed K5I. All the annotated SAC genes suppressed all the drugs, as expected. Two other genes scored with this phenotype, PMAIP1 and NPC2, and these were also notable for very short mitotic arrest durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The 3 true suppressors (category III) failed to suppress taxol and nocodazole. A number of category II genes failed to suppress taxol and nocodazole, including all those that less effectively suppressed K5I mitotic arrest as scored by duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), but also two that strongly suppressed K5I, TRIM28 and EFTUD2. On the basis of this extra data, we divided category II into two, SAC defect (all drugs) and SAC defect (K5I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Mechanistic implications</title><p>An important caveat in discussing any of the new genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g008">Figure 8</xref> is the question of specificity. Although we tried to select for on-target effects by requiring at least 3 out of 4 oligos to score, we suspect some of our hits may still be false positives. Further work, including monitoring protein levels after knockdown and rescue with RNAi-resistant transgenes, is required to more rigorously test their specificity.</p><p>In the SAC defect (all drugs) category, we recovered 4 known SAC genes: TTK (Mps1 kinase), BUB3, BUB1B, and MAD2L1. We missed a few other well-annotated SAC genes, including MAD1, presumably because the knockdown was insufficient in our time window. Two other genes scored with the same phenotype, NPC2 and PMAIP1. NPC2 is an endosome protein implicated in cholesterol transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Liscum1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, and PMAIP1 (also known as NOXA) is a BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein that stimulates apoptosis by interacting with Bcl2 related proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Shibue1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of its possible role in linking mitotic arrest to apoptosis, we performed limited follow-up work on PMAIP1/NOXA. Different siRNA oligos for this gene exhibited different strengths of phenotypic effect as suppressors of mitotic arrest. In addition to knocking down PMAIP1 protein levels, we noted that the two siRNAs (#2 and #3) that inhibited mitotic arrest most effectively also caused partial knockdown of Mad2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007339.s001">Figure S1</xref>), though they did not affect expression of another checkpoint protein BubR1 (data not shown). Thus it is possible that the K5I suppressor effect of the PMAIP1 siRNA reagents are due to an off-target knockdown of Mad2 by the PMAIP1 siRNAs. Consistent with this, the seed regions of the PMAIP1 siRNA#2 and #3 each share sequence identity with different 7 nucleotide stretches of the MAD2L1 3&#x02032; UTR mRNA sequence (RefSeq NM_002358.3). siRNA seed region matches to 3&#x02032; UTR regions are associated with RNAi off-targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Birmingham1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Jackson2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The SAC defect (K5I only) category was unexpected, and the gene annotations provide little in the way of mechanistic clues. DONSON is, by sequence, the probable ortholog of the Drosophila gene humpty dumpty, which has been implicated in control of DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Birmingham1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. RPS25 is a ribosome subunit, and thus might be a false positive. EFTUD2 is annotated as a spliceosome component. Knocking down these proteins appears to suppress SAC activation by K5I, but not by taxol or nocodazole, yet they do not rescue spindle bipolarity, at least by the criterion of promoting cytokinesis. This exclusivity for K5Is could be the result of a more weakly activated SAC by K5I, or that the SAC is activated in a different way, that requires extra proteins to block the cell cycle relative to taxol and nocodazole activation of the SAC. It is also interesting that K5Is do not target the microtubules themselves, perhaps resulting in SAC-dependent arrest that is unique at the molecular level compared to microtubule targeting drugs.</p><p>Category III, the true suppressors, were particularly interesting from a spindle assembly perspective. This phenotype requires that the cell assemble a normal bipolar spindle even though Kinesin-5 is inhibited, or alternatively, this class might by due to increased drug efflux or metabolism. KIFC1 (also known as HSET), a mitotic kinesin that works opposite to Kinesin-5, was expected with this phenotype, since previous work has demonstrated that loss of KIFC1 function can rescue spindle bipolarity when Kinesin-5 function is compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Mountain1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The strongest suppressor was CBX1, a heterochromatin protein. 45&#x00025; of cells that entered mitosis underwent cytokinesis in cells treated with this siRNA pool in the presence of 1 &#x000b5;M K5I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). This value can be compared to &#x0003c;1&#x00025; cytokinesis in K5I alone, and 3&#x00025; for TTK siRNA (a strong Category II hit) in K5I. We tentatively speculate that CBX1 is required for some aspect of kinetochore or chromokinesin function that normally helps pull the two half-spindles together. When this function is absent, the forces that collapse the spindle in K5I are reduced. Another strong suppressor, HINT1, is an enzyme with phosphoramidase activity that is a tumor suppressor, and has been implicated in DNA damage repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007339-Mountain1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps this protein also influences the spindle via effects on chromatin structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Summary</title><p>Our intermittent imaging approach was effective for identifying siRNA enhancers and suppressors of K5Is that act at the level of spindle assembly and mitotic arrest, and should be useful for other cell cycle related screens. It was less effective at identifying genes that influence apoptotic responses, perhaps because we were not able to develop a specific score for apoptosis using H2B-GFP imaging. Characterization of siRNAs that score as K5I enhancers was complicated by the fact that many of those siRNAs had some mitotic phenotype on their own, in addition to acting as enhancers of drug action. However, the enhancer siRNA hit list is strongly enriched in genes with mitotic functions, and may reveal other genes not previously implicated in spindle bipolarization. Our K5I suppressor siRNAs broke fairly cleanly into 4 phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007339-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Current RNAi technology is sufficiently prone to false positives that we make no claims as to specificity of our hits. Even genes for which 4/4 individual siRNA duplexes scored as hits must be viewed with suspicion until confirmed by other methods. For example, the possibility that PMAIP1 scored as a hit due to off-target knockdown of Mad2 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007339.s001">Figure S1</xref>) is a case in point. We also acknowledge that we surely missed many genes as false negatives Presumably, our screen selected for proteins that turn over rapidly and/or whose effects on their pathway are highly dose-sensitive. Still, we recovered about half of the well-documented SAC genes, and the only known true K5I suppressor gene (KIFC1), in the expected phenotypic categories. Thus, we are confident that at least some of our others hits are worthy of further exploration, and will open up new avenues of research into spindle organization and the SAC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007339.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>(0.15 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007339.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007339.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>List of genes with at least one out of four oligos confirmed in the same assay as used for the primary screen.</p><p>(0.06 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007339.s002.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the staff of ICCB-Longwood Screening Facility and members of the HMS mammalian RNAi screening community for helpful advice and encouragement.
