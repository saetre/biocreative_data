In FBD, a C-terminal 34 amino acid (aa) peptide of BRI<sub>2</sub> accumulates as amyloid, leading to severe amyloid angiopathy of the brain and spinal cord with perivascular amyloid plaque formation, parenchymal plaques affecting the limbic areas, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, neurofibrillary tangles of hippocampal neurons and periventricular white matter changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Plant1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Neuropathological examination of patients with FDD shows diffuse brain atrophy with a particularly severe involvement of the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and white matter, as well as the presence of very thin and almost demyelinated cranial nerves, and widespread amyloid angiopathy in the small blood vessels and capillaries of the cerebrum, choroid plexus, cerebellum, spinal cord and retina. In FDD, parenchymal compact plaques are consistently absent, whereas neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the major histological finding in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Vidal2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Holton1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>BRI<sub>2</sub> is physiologically cleaved, at the C-terminus, by furin, a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease, producing a 23 aa soluble C-terminal fragment. FBD and FDD are due to mutations in the <italic>BRI<sub>2</sub></italic> gene located on chromosome 13q14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Vidal1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Pittois1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In FBD, a single base substitution at the stop codon of <italic>BRI<sub>2</sub></italic> generates a longer open reading frame, resulting in a larger, 277 aa precursor (BRI<sub>2-ABri</sub>, compared to the 266 aa long normal protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Vidal1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In FDD, a decamer duplication in the 3&#x02032; region of the <italic>BRI<sub>2</sub></italic> gene, right before the stop codon, leads as well to the production of a longer, 277 aa protein (BRI<sub>2-ADan</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Vidal2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The genetic defect is different, but the outcome is the same: the generation of a longer 34 aa C-terminal fragment, ABri in FBD and ADan in FDD, which accumulates as amyloid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Vidal1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several neuropathological features are common to FBD, FDD and Alzheimer's disease (AD): amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), accumulation of complement proteins and their pro-inflammatory activation products, including iC3b, C4d, Bb, and C5b-9, neurofibrillary pathology and hyperphosphorylated tau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Holton1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Holton2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Rostagno1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

It has been shown that BRI<sub>2</sub> binds APP in a region comprising the extracellular juxtamembrane domains of both proteins, in a cis fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Matsuda1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Matsuda2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Fotinopoulou1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This interaction leads to interference on the physiological processing of APP: BRI<sub>2</sub> restricts the docking of &#x003b3;-secretase to APP and the access of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-secretases to their cleavage site on APP itself. The overall result of this interaction is the reduction of the amyloidogenic processing of APP, without a direct inhibition of the general activity of the secretases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Matsuda1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. BRI<sub>2</sub> maturation is required for this function. In fact, only mBRI<sub>2</sub> (and not the immature precursor) binds mature APP and inhibits its processing on the plasma membrane and in endocytic compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Matsuda3">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Matsuda et al have further shown that BRI<sub>3</sub>, a member of the BRI family, binds and inhibit the action of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-secretases on APP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Matsuda4">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Others have argued that the BRI<sub>2</sub>-23 wild type C-terminal peptide, released from BRI<sub>2</sub> by furin/furin-like cleavage, can inhibit A&#x003b2; aggregation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Kim2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The interaction between these two amyloidogenic proteins can be of interest, especially for the design of new therapeutic strategies for AD and FBD/FDD. To this end, the processing of the BRI<sub>2</sub> precursor, both in the wild type allele and its mutant form must be understood. Transgenic mice bearing the British or Danish mutations have been generated, and are under investigation as models of dementias and cerebral amyloid angiopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Pickford1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Vidal4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. A transgenic FDD model which over-expresses the Danish mutant form of BRI<sub>2</sub> shows amyloid deposition in the walls of blood vessels of the cerebrum and cerebellum, parenchymal amyloid deposition and reactive gliosis, ADan amyloidosis and some signs of cerebellar ataxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Vidal4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Transgenic over-expression of human mutant genes has been extensively used to generate mouse models for human neurodegenerative disorders due to the need of over-expressing enough amount of the mutant protein in order to observe a phenotype. It is however possible that some disorders may, at least partially, be due to loss of function rather than a gain of toxic function due to mutations. If this were the case, a transgenic approach would be counterproductive. Therefore, we have reasoned that models reproducing the genetics of human pathologies may be worth studying since they may unveil important disease mechanisms that a transgenic approach may miss or, possibly, hide. Thus, we have generated a genetically faithful model of FDD by introducing the pathogenic human mutation in the mouse BRI<sub>2</sub> gene by a knock-in technology. Here, we describe the generation of this Knock-In murine model of FDD (FDD<sub>KI</sub>) and its initial characterization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background for several generations (at least 15).

Western blot analysis of these samples shows three phenomenona. 1) A common, major band of about 32 kDa is readily visible in all three samples. This band corresponds to the post-furin cleavage mature BRI<sub>2</sub> (mBRI<sub>2</sub>) polypeptide because mBRI<sub>2</sub> is identical regardless of whether it is derived from the wild type or the mutant precursor protein. 2) A much less abundant protein of &#x0223c;33 kDa which is visible in the wild type and <italic>BRI<sub>2</sub><sup>ADan/wt</sup></italic> sample but not the <italic>BRI<sub>2</sub><sup>ADan/ADan</sup></italic> lysate. This band corresponds to the wild type, immature BRI<sub>2</sub> precursor (imBRI<sub>2</sub>). The absence of this band in the <italic>BRI<sub>2</sub><sup>ADan/ADan</sup></italic> neurons is attributable to the fact that these cells have both BRI<sub>2</sub> alleles mutated. 3) As expected, the <italic>BRI<sub>2</sub><sup>ADan/wt</sup></italic> sample expresses all three BRI<sub>2</sub> polypeptides, i.e. wild type imBRI<sub>2</sub>, BRI<sub>2-ADan</sub> precursor and mBRI<sub>2</sub>.

This Knock In model is strategically different from the conventional genetic approach to cerebral amyloidosis. Traditionally, mouse models for human dementias are based on a transgenic approach in which human mutant proteins that cause familial forms of dementia are over-expressed under the control of brain-specific promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-LaFerla1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-McGowan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Price1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This approach has both limitations and advantages. The potential limitations are linked to the fact that these models are genetically incongruous with the human diseases. These dementias have an autosomal dominant way of transmission and affected subjects have a wild type and a mutant allele. On the contrary, the commonly used animal models over-express, from an artificial promoter, several copies of a mini-gene coding the mutant protein. The mutant gene is therefore expressed in a spatio-temporal manner different from the natural alleles and in cells with two copies of wild type alleles. However, transgenic approaches have successfully reproduced cerebral amyloidosis in mice, and the reproduction of those lesions is one of the main parameters used to endorse an animal model as representative of the human disease. The opposite is true for a Knock In approach. In this genetic paradigm, the pathogenic human mutation is inserted in the mouse allele. Thus, the Knock In mouse is genetically faithful to the human pathology. However, the Knock In model may not successfully reproduce the amyloid lesion in the mouse. The model that we present here is a clear demonstration of the above-mentioned assumptions. A comparison of the FDD-KI model that we have created with the FDD transgenic model generated by Vidal et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Vidal4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> illustrates the superior power of a transgenic approach as far as the reproduction of amyloidogenic lesions are concerned.</p><p>In spite of this limitation, we believe that there is some merit to a Knock In approach. Human familial dementias may have a pathogenic component due to loss of function caused by the mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Bentahir1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-DeStrooper1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Wolfe1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Shen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007900-Saura1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. This component may participate to the pathogenic process together with a gain of toxic function due to amyloidosis. A loss of function phenotype would be hidden by a transgenic approach for two reasons: 1) the two endogenous wild type alleles can support synthesis of sufficient amounts of functional wild type protein: 2) the over-expression of a partial loss of function mutant protein may augment rather then decrease that function, as may happen in the disease. It would be erroneous to assume that the absence of obvious neuropathological lesions (such as plaques, NFTs and/or neuronal cell loss) indicate absence of clinical pathology. Functional deficits may underlie the very first clinical manifestations of neurodegenerative diseases, and memory deficits may be caused not by gross anatomical changes but by subtle dysfunctions of the neuronal network. In this framework, determining the absence of neuropathological lesions in FDD<sub>KI</sub> mice is intrinsically important. The behavioral characterization of this mouse model will test this hypothesis. In addition, the FDD<sub>KI</sub> mouse will be useful to clarify the change of trafficking or processing of Danish mutant of BRI2 protein without potential artifacts due to over-expression in transgenic models. Finally, the FDD<sub>KI</sub> mouse will be instrumental in studying the interaction between mutant BRI<sub>2</sub> and APP <italic>in vivo</italic> and how the Danish mutation affects the inhibitory role of BRI<sub>2</sub> on APP processing <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Erhan Ma for the help in the genotyping and PCR procedures on the ADan KI mice; we thank Dr. Susan Newbigging MSc, DVM, DVSc at the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics, 25 Orde Street, Toronto ON M5T 3H7; we thank Dr. Bernardino Ghetti for the helpful discussion.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0007900-Deleersnijder1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deleersnijder</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Cortvrindt</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Poirier</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Tylzanowski</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>1996</year><article-title>Isolation of markers for chondro-osteogenic differentiation using cDNA library subtraction.
