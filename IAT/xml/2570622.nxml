No overt defects were observed in the mutant E3.5 or E4.5 embryo or its ability to proliferate in culture, suggesting that <italic>Bptf</italic> embryos undergo a normal initial specification and proliferation of the ICM, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm. However, mutant embryos exhibit diminished proliferation post-implantation as shown by defects in size of both extra-embryonic and embryonic tissues and decreased phosphorylated histone H3 staining. A histological analysis of mutant embryos at E6.5 and E7.5 revealed that they develop a VE but do not form a primitive streak or differentiate mesoderm. To investigate the causes of the defect in gastrulation, we monitored the expression of key markers prior to and during gastrulation in the embryo. As anticipated we failed to observe expression of primitive streak markers <italic>T, Foxa2, Gsc, Fgf8</italic> or the posterior localization of <italic>Nodal</italic> and <italic>Cripto</italic> expression.

Defects in the DVE/AVE were confirmed by observing significantly reduced expression of the markers <italic>Cer1, Hex1, Lefty1</italic> and <italic>Hesx1</italic> in E5.5 and E6.5 embryos. Defects in <italic>Gata6</italic> expression at E5.5 suggest that the defects in DVE specification are accompanied by general defects in VE specification.

Our unbiased analysis of gene targets by microarray revealed many potentially Bptf-dependent differentiation pathways. Most relevant to this study include the regulation of the cell cycle and the differentiation of mesoderm and endoderm lineages, specifically the VE and DVE. The underlying cause for these defects could largely be due to the loss of chromatin associated complexes like the NURF chromatin remodeling complex. In the case of NURF the defects could be direct, as a remodeling activity at the promoter of genes necessary for cellular proliferation and differentiation, or indirect through the deregulation of master regulators of development like the homeobox-containing transcription factors. Moreover the underlying mechanism of Bptf action as a co-activator of some genes and a co-repressor of others is unclear. Further studies of nucleosome positioning and chromatin structure in mutants should clarify these possibilities.</p><p>In addition to system-wide defects with <italic>Bptf</italic> deletion, there could be specific defects in individual signal transduction pathways within the embryo or in the ability of the embryo to receive growth signals from the extra-embryonic tissues or the surrounding decidua. To identify potential Bptf-dependent signaling pathways we focused on its role in specifying the DVE. The pre-gastrulation embryo uses three well-known signaling pathways, the WNT/&#x003b2;-catenin, FGF/MAPK and Nodal/Smad pathways, to establish A-P asymmetry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000241-Tam1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

In support of this hypothesis, we showed that Bptf is required for the regulation of endogenous promoters and Smad responsive promoter elements in ES, P19 and MCF10CA1 cells in tissue culture. Smad-dependent gene targets include those essential for cell proliferation (<italic>p21</italic>) and those essential for DVE function (<italic>Cer1, Lefty1</italic>) and primitive streak (<italic>T, Fgf8, Gsc</italic>). Moreover, pulldown assays showed that components of the NURF complex have direct interactions with the Smad transcription factors and it is recruited to the promoters of Smad regulated genes under conditions of activation. Taken together, our data suggest that Bptf can directly regulate Smad regulated genes, likely through the functions of the NURF remodeling complex, via recruitment by the Smad transcription factors (It is also possible that other as yet unidentified Bptf-containing complexes distinct from NURF function in this pathway). To address the possibility that the effects on the Nodal/Smad pathway are indirect we monitored the expression of key components of the pathway in embryos.

Curiously, more reabsorptions were observed during the dissections than could be accounted for from the death of the homozygous <italic>Bptf<sup>XG023</sup></italic> embryos. To investigate if the origin of the increased lethality was caused by a parental <italic>Bptf<sup>XG023</sup></italic> heterozygous contribution, we crossed heterozygous to wild type males and females in combinations and examined all embryos from E10.5 to E18.5. From these experiments, we observed an increased number of reabsorptions when the mother was heterozygous compared to the wild type controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000241.s026">Table S1A</xref>, b&#x02013;d).
