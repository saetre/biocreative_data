Postnatal mitochondrial biogenesis involves multiple signaling and transcriptional regulatory pathways that control the coordinate expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial structure, metabolism, and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b01">1</xref>]. Recent evidence points toward a transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;), as an integrator of the molecular regulatory circuitry involved in the transcriptional control of cellular energy metabolism, including mitochondrial function and biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b02">2</xref>].

Subsequently, two additional PGC-1 family members were identified, PGC-1 related coactivator (PRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b03">3</xref>] and PGC-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b05">5</xref>]. PGC-1&#x003b1; serves as a direct transcriptional coactivator of nuclear and nonnuclear receptor transcription factors involved in cellular energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b06">6</xref>]. PGC-1&#x003b1; is distinct among most coactivators in that it exhibits a tissue-enriched expression pattern and is highly inducible by physiologic conditions known to increase the demand for mitochondrial ATP or heat production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b07">7</xref>]. PGC-1&#x003b1; is enriched in brown adipose tissue (BAT), heart, slow-twitch skeletal muscle, and kidney&#x02014;all tissues with high-capacity mitochondrial systems. The expression of the gene encoding PGC-1&#x003b1; is rapidly induced by cold exposure, short-term exercise, and fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b15">15</xref>]. These latter observations suggest that PGC-1&#x003b1; is involved in the physiologic control of energy metabolism.</p><p>Several lines of evidence, based on the results of overexpression studies, indicate that PGC-1&#x003b1; is sufficient to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and regulate mitochondrial respiratory capacity.

Second, forced expression studies in adipogenic and myogenic mammalian cell lines demonstrated that PGC-1&#x003b1; activates mitochondrial biogenesis through a group of transcription factor targets including nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and -2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), key transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b08">8</xref>]. Third, studies in primary cardiac myocytes in culture and in the hearts of transgenic mice have demonstrated that overexpression of PGC-1&#x003b1; promotes mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b16">16</xref>].

Collectively, these results indicate that PGC-1&#x003b1; is sufficient to drive mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><p>Recent evidence also implicates PGC-1&#x003b1; in the homeostatic control of systemic energy metabolism.

To this end, we have established and characterized mice with targeted deletion of the <italic>PGC-1&#x003b1;</italic> gene. Our studies of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrate that PGC-1&#x003b1; is not absolutely required for prenatal viability including mitochondrial biogenesis.

Quantitative morphometry of the electron micrographs confirmed that the cellular volume density of soleus mitochondria was significantly lower in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/+</sup> controls independent of changes in the myofibrillar component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030101-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Consistent with a defect in mitochondrial biogenesis, we found a reduction in the expression of nuclear genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial electron transport (cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase IV) and oxidative phosphorylation (beta subunit of ATP synthase) in soleus muscle of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/+</sup> controls. In addition, the expression of Tfam, a known PGC-1&#x003b1; target involved in mitochondrial DNA replication/transcription, was diminished in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> soleus, providing one potential mechanism for defective mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030101-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In contrast to the results with soleus, no significant differences in mitochondrial ultrastructure or volume density were noted in heart or BAT of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished data).</p><p>To determine whether mitochondrial function was altered in the skeletal muscle of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, mitochondrial respiration rates were measured using tissue strips prepared from soleus muscle. In soleus of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, a significant defect in state 3 (ADP-stimulated) respiration, but not state 2 (basal), was detected using succinate as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030101-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). State 4 respiration rates (in the presence of oligomycin) were also similar between the genotypes, indicating that the coupling of respiration to ATP production was not significantly altered in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These results are consistent with the modest but significant reduction in mitochondrial volume density.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Altered Skeletal Muscle Function in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Mice</title><p>The abnormality in mitochondrial number and respiratory function in skeletal muscle led us to further evaluate the skeletal muscle phenotype.

Since the groups did not differ on the times it took to turn around and climb to the top of 60&#x000b0; and 90&#x000b0; inclined screens, the differences on the inverted screen test suggest that impaired strength rather than deficits in coordination were responsible for these differences.</p><p>To further evaluate the skeletal muscle phenotype, exercise capacity was assessed in the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

The same result was obtained with younger PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, i.e., at 3.5 mo of age (unpublished data). To quantify aerobic exercise capacity, VO<sub>2max</sub> (maximum oxygen consumption, measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute) was measured with the treadmill-running protocol using indirect calorimetry. VO<sub>2max</sub> was significantly lower for the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (120.9 &#x000b1; 2.0 ml O<sub>2</sub> &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) compared to PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/+</sup> controls (141.6 &#x000b1; 2.1 ml O<sub>2</sub> &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030101-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). To directly evaluate muscle fatigability, the force response to repetitive stimulation of isolated soleus muscle was determined. The capacity to generate force following a series of tetani is dependent upon mitochondrial ATP production.

Echocardiographic screening studies of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at ages 4&#x02013;6 mo did not reveal any significant differences in chamber sizes or ventricular function compared to WT controls (unpublished data). Cardiac functional and metabolic reserve was evaluated using exercise echocardiographic stress testing (EST). Given that the exercise capacity of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is diminished, a series of preliminary treadmill exercise studies were performed to define a reasonable exercise duration for run-to-exhaustion to be used as a target duration for the EST. Based on the results of these studies, an EST regimen was performed in which PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/+</sup> control animals were exercised for a duration of 60 s to match the predicted average for the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (ages 6&#x02013;8 mo).

Under basal fed conditions, the livers of the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice appeared grossly normal and did not exhibit histologic abnormalities (unpublished data).

Forced expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; triggers mitochondrial biogenesis by activating a complex circuitry of factors including NRF-1, NRF-2, and the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor &#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b32">32</xref>]. However, gain-of-function strategies cannot determine whether PGC-1&#x003b1; is essential for critical energy metabolic processes including mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Using targeted gene deletion in mice, we show here that PGC-1&#x003b1; is not essential for normal embryologic development or the fundamental events of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, several lines of evidence support the conclusion that PGC-1&#x003b1; is necessary for the programs that regulate postnatal mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism, processes that equip the organism for the energy metabolic rigors of the postnatal environment. First, mitochondrial volume density is diminished in slow-twitch skeletal muscle of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Second, mitochondrial respiratory capacity is modestly but significantly altered in skeletal muscle and liver of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Third, the growth of heart and soleus muscle, tissues with high reliance on mitochondrial energy production, is blunted. Fourth, control of body fat mass is abnormal in the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Finally, PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice do not respond normally to a variety of physiologic and dietary stresses known to increase oxidative energy demands. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that PGC-1&#x003b1; is necessary for the terminal stages of mitochondrial maturation necessary to meet the energy demands of the postnatal environment.</p><p>Extensive phenotypic analyses demonstrated that mice lacking PGC-1&#x003b1; are unable to cope with physiologic stressors relevant to postnatal survival. For example, a skeletal muscle phenotype was unveiled in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice under conditions in which energy supply becomes limiting. This was most clearly demonstrated by the profound abnormalities exhibited by PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with exercise-to-exhaustion and repetitive muscle stimulation studies. Similarly, cardiac performance of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was compromised following severe exertion. This effect was largely due to an abnormal heart rate response. The basis for the observed abnormalities of cardiac heart rate, including a blunted response to &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation, is unknown, but could be related to the effects of late-stage growth arrest and corresponding derangements in energy metabolism on sinus node function. PGC-1&#x003b1; was first identified as a coactivator in BAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b02">2</xref>]. Indeed, we found that exposure of the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to cold, another relevant physiologic stress, resulted in an untoward drop in core body temperature consistent with an abnormality in thermogenesis despite normal cold induction of UCP-1 mRNA in BAT. Studies with a &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic agonist confirmed that the peak oxygen consumption rate in thermogenic tissue is diminished in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. We propose that the thermogenic phenotype is related to reduced capacity for mitochondrial respiration in BAT. Interestingly, this phenotype was only evident during a rather narrow window of postnatal life. Animals at an older age did not exhibit cold intolerance, possibly due to the insulating properties of increased body mass. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of PGC-1&#x003b1; as a key transducer of physiologic stimuli to the control of energy metabolism.</p><p>The observation of fasting-induced hepatic steatosis is another example of the inability of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to respond to postnatal environmental metabolic demands. Following short-term starvation, we found that the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed marked hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation. Further analysis revealed that palmitate oxidation rates were reduced in hepatocytes isolated from the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which would predispose to lipid accumulation. Surprisingly, the reduction in fatty acid oxidation rates in PGC-1&#x003b1; null hepatocytes was not due to altered expression of PGC-1&#x003b1;/PPAR target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. However, mitochondrial respiratory rates were diminished. In addition, we found that triglyceride synthesis was abnormally activated, and the expression of genes encoding SREBP-1c and SCD-1, key proteins in the hepatic lipogenic pathway, failed to be appropriately down-regulated in fasted PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The mechanism involved in this latter finding is unknown. Indeed, the relative contribution of increased triglyceride synthesis rates to the steatotic phenotype cannot be fully discerned from our data, given that this response could reflect the direct effects of PGC-1&#x003b1; deficiency on target genes or a secondary compensatory response to hepatocyte fatty acid accumulation. Consistent with the former possibility, recent evidence indicates that PGC-1&#x003b1; coactivates the nuclear receptor FXR, a negative regulator of SREBP-1c expression and triglyceride synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b33">33</xref>]. We conclude that reduced hepatocyte mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and possibly activation of lipogenic programs, result in hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation in the context of increased hepatic delivery of fatty acids such as occurs with fasting.</p><p>We found that after 18 wk of age, female PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit a mild but significantly abnormal weight increase associated with increased fat stores. Lean mass was unchanged at the time points examined. With further aging, a modest but significant increase in body fat was also noted in male PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished data). The basis for the observed abnormalities in weight control is unknown. We did not find differences in food intake or activity levels in female PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. It is possible that a reduction in systemic energy utilization, related to the mitochondrial dysfunction, leads to increased fat mass and weight gain in the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Interestingly, an association between <italic>PGC-1&#x003b1;</italic> gene polymorphisms and obesity in humans has been recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b26">26</xref>]. Clearly, future studies of male and female PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in pure-strain backgrounds over a range of ages will be necessary to fully investigate the observed abnormalities in weight control and fat distribution.</p><p>We did not find evidence for glucose intolerance or insulin resistance in the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals on standard chow. Moreover, female PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were more glucose-tolerant and insulin-sensitive than PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>+/+</sup> controls when consuming a high-fat diet. These findings are surprising, given the results of several recent studies demonstrating reduced expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; in human diabetic skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b34">34</xref>]. It is certainly possible that compensatory metabolic regulatory mechanisms have been activated in the PGC-1&#x003b1;-deficient mice, accounting for this observation. Alternatively, PGC-1&#x003b1; could serve as a coactivator of factors that mediate diet-induced insulin resistance. Consistent with this notion, we and others have shown that mice lacking the PGC-1&#x003b1; target PPAR exhibit resistance to diet-induced glucose intolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b36">36</xref>].</p><p>Histologic surveys of the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice revealed ultrastructural abnormalities in the central nervous system. Inspection of sections prepared from the brains of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice revealed patchy areas of microvacuolation in the pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex, accompanied by a mild increase in the number of astrocytes in the basal ganglia. The basis for this interesting but relatively nonspecific finding is unknown. It is possible that PGC-1&#x003b1; plays an important role in lipid metabolism related to membrane synthesis. Alternatively, the normal process of cellular debris turnover could be altered due to a defect in the energetics of the microglial component of the central nervous system. Although overt neurologic dysfunction was not apparent in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice during the first 6 mo of life (no group differences were found on five of six sensorimotor tests), the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed clear deficits on the inverted screen test. These deficits are likely due to impaired muscle strength in the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but contributions by peripheral or central nervous system determinants (or both) could be contributory. Moreover, evidence of altered emotionality from the 1-h locomotor activity test also suggests the possibility of altered brain function in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. It will be of interest to determine whether the neurologic abnormalities contribute to the systemic metabolic abnormalities of the PGC-1&#x003b1; null mice.</p><p>During the preparation of this manuscript, Lin et al. reported an independent mouse line in which the PGC-1&#x003b1; gene was targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b37">37</xref>]. Phenotypic comparison of the our PGC-1&#x003b1;-deficient line with that of Lin et al. reveals a number of similarities and several interesting differences. Both PGC-1&#x003b1;-deficient lines exhibit cold intolerance, reduced hepatocyte respiration rates, and neurologic lesions. However, a number of interesting differences are notable. First, in contrast to Lin et al., the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice described here do not exhibit any postnatal mortality. Second, we did not find evidence for a defect in gluconeogenesis based on fasting blood glucose levels (unpublished data). In addition, whereas Lin et al. found an abnormal expression profile for CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein &#x003b2; and &#x003b4; and the gluconeogenic genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase at baseline and with fasting in the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we did not (unpublished data). Third, we found evidence for an age-related increase in body fat in PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (females earlier than males), whereas Lin et al. identified a male-specific resistance to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. We have also found that male PGC-1&#x003b1;-deficient mice are somewhat protected against diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>). However, we observed that the insulin-sensitive phenotype of the female PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice occurred in the context of normal weight gain with high-fat diet. These latter results indicate that the insulin-sensitive phenotype of PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice cannot be fully explained by a lean phenotype. Of interest, mice lacking the nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor &#x003b1;, a known target of PGC-1&#x003b1;, exhibit resistance to diet-induced obesity similar to that of male PGC-1&#x003b1; null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030101-b38">38</xref>]. Fourth, the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice described here exhibit a dramatic fasting-induced hepatic steatotic phenotype, whereas the Lin et al. mouse does not. Fifth, Lin et al. found a neurologic phenotype in males characterized by hyperactivity, whereas the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice described here show reduced locomotor activity. However, it should be noted that we did not study activity levels over an extended period of time in males as did Lin et al., so it is possible that our findings reflect an emotional disturbance that manifests only when the animals are placed in a new environment. Finally, we report significant skeletal muscle and cardiac functional abnormalities (although the report by Lin et al. did not address these phenotypes, so this may not represent a true difference). </p><p>The reasons for the interesting differences between the two PGC-1&#x003b1;-deficient mouse lines are not clear. It is possible that distinct genetic backgrounds related to hybrid strains confer different degrees of secondary compensatory responses. In addition, the incompletely penetrant postnatal mortality noted in the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice reported by Lin et al. could have resulted in a selection bias toward greater levels of compensatory responses in liver and other tissues in the surviving group. It is also possible that the method of gene targeting led to different phenotypes. Lin et al. generated PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice by Cre recombinase-mediated excision of exons 3&#x02013;5 in oocytes. The PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice described here were generated by a targeting event that involved a 3&#x02032; homologous recombination leading to an insertion of the targeting vector including an extra exon 3 between exons 5 and 6. The exon 3 insertion, which was confirmed by RT-PCR, results in a mutant transcript that encodes a truncated protein. We were unable to detect normal transcript containing an exon 5&#x02013;6 border, indicating that the targeting was accurate and complete. In addition, we could not detect full-length or smaller PGC-1&#x003b1; proteins by Western blotting. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the sensitivity of the immunoblotting was not high enough to pick up a small amount of mutant (truncated) PGC-1&#x003b1; protein that could have some activity, given that it would contain nuclear receptor-interacting domains and the amino-terminal activation domain. If small amounts of PGC-1&#x003b1; activity are present in the mice reported here, it could explain some of the observed differences between the models. However, the bulk of data presented here support the conclusion that the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice described are completely deficient in PGC-1&#x003b1;. Future direct comparison of the two mouse lines in pure background strains will be of interest.</p><p>In summary, this body of work provides evidence that PGC-l&#x003b1; is critical for the adaptive responses necessary to meet postnatal energy demands. Our results also suggest a broader role for inducible transcriptional coactivators such as PGC-1&#x003b1; in transducing cellular signals triggered by physiologic and developmental cues to the transcriptional control of energy metabolism and other dynamic cellular processes. In this regard, the inducible coactivator PGC-1&#x003b1; serves as a transcriptional &#x0201c;booster&#x0201d; to augment the capacity of downstream metabolic pathways critical for metabolic maturation and postnatal growth. Indeed, although PGC-1&#x003b1; null mice survive in the protected environment of the laboratory, our results indicate that in the rigors of a typical external environment, PGC-1&#x003b1; would be necessary for survival. Lastly, we propose that the PGC-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice should serve as a useful murine model to investigate the role of altered energy metabolism in obesity, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and diseases of the heart, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Targeting the PGC-1&#x003b1; gene in mice</title><p>A BAC genomic clone containing the murine <italic>PGC-1&#x003b1;</italic> gene, isolated from an Sv129 genomic library, was obtained from Incyte Genomics (Palo Alto, California, United States).

Each enclosure was surrounded by a frame containing a 4 &#x000d7; 8 matrix of photocell pairs, the output of which was fed to an on-line computer. The system software (Hamilton-Kinder) was used to define a 33 cm &#x000d7; 11 cm central zone and a peripheral or surrounding zone that was 5.5 cm wide with the sides of the cage being the outermost boundary. This peripheral area extended along the entire perimeter of the cage. Variables that were analyzed included the total number of ambulations, as well as the number of entries, the time spent, and the distance traveled in the center area as well as the distance traveled in the periphery surrounding the center. The total number of ambulations and rearings were recorded. For the inverted screen test, mice were placed on a wire mesh grid (16 squares per 10 cm) and the screen was inverted to 180&#x000b0;.

Each animal was placed in the middle of the screen with its head oriented down and was timed for how long it remained on the screen and how long it took to climb to the top of the screen. For the inverted screen test, mice were placed as above and then the screen was inverted to 180&#x000b0;. A maximum score of 60 s was given if an animal did not fall; (2) Platform test: Each mouse was timed for how long it remained on an elevated (47 cm above the floor) circular platform (1.0 cm thick and 3.0 cm in diameter). A maximum score of 60 s was assigned if the mouse remained on the platform for the maximum amount of time or if it could climb down on a very thin pole that supported the platform, without falling; (3) Ledge test: Each mouse was timed for how long it could maintain its balance on a 0.75-cm wide Plexiglas ledge without falling (60 s maximum). A score of 60 s was also assigned if the mouse traversed the entire length (51 cm) of the Plexiglas ledge and returned to the starting place in less than 60 s without falling; (4) Walking initiation test: Each mouse was placed in the middle of a square outlined by white cloth tape (21 cm &#x000d7; 21 cm) on a smooth black surface of a large tabletop.

All measurements of oxygen consumption took place at an elevation of 150 m (ambient P<sub>BAR</sub> = 745 torr). Animals were placed into the metabolic chamber for 3&#x02013;5 min to allow the system to equilibrate. Mice were then induced to run up an 18&#x000b0; incline at a speed of 40 m/min using a shock grid in the rear of the chamber. The speed was increased by 5 m/min every 2 min until the animals were unable to continue. Maximal effort was determined when oxygen uptake did not increase with power output and subsequently the mouse failed to maintain effort.

Upon removal, the muscle was suspended in a Krebs solution aerated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The muscle and Krebs solution were suspended within a water bath maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C, and the muscle was anchored to a Grass (West Warwick, Rhode Island, United States) isometric force transducer (model FTO3C). Muscles were stimulated to contract with a Grass stimulator (model S88) generating a field stimulus through electrodes located at both ends of the muscle. Force-voltage (maximal force at about 100 V) and length-tension relationships were determined using single twitch stimuli. The stimulator then delivered repeating trains of stimuli at one per second at 40 Hz for 2 min. Each train lasted 330 ms, and were digitally recorded using MacLab (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States). Fatigue resistance was calculated as the ratio of the force generated by the last tetanus divided by the highest force generated multiplied by 100 to give the percent of force generation that remained after the fatigue protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4a12"><title>Exercise echocardiography</title><p>Adult female mice (6&#x02013;8 mo old) were exercised on the motorized treadmill using the run-to-exhaustion settings described above for 60 s or until exhaustion, whichever came first.
