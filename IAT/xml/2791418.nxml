Despite its numerous roles, few of its substrates have been identified. To better characterize the roles of the yeast Ste20p kinase, we developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical genomics screen to identify its substrates. When applied to 539 purified yeast proteins, the screen reported 14 targets of Ste20p phosphorylation. We used the data resulting from our screen to build an <italic>in silico</italic> predictor to identify Ste20p substrates on a proteome-wide basis. Since kinase-substrate specificity is often mediated by additional binding events at sites distal to the phosphorylation site, the predictor uses the presence/absence of multiple sequence motifs to evaluate potential substrates. Statistical validation estimates a threefold improvement in substrate recovery over random predictions, despite the lack of a single dominant motif that can characterize Ste20p phosphorylation. The set of predicted substrates significantly overrepresents elements of the genetic and physical interaction networks surrounding Ste20p, suggesting that some of the predicted substrates are <italic>in vivo</italic> targets. We validated this combined experimental and computational approach for identifying kinase substrates by confirming the <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of polarisome components Bni1p and Bud6p, thus suggesting a mechanism by which Ste20p effects polarized growth.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein phosphorylation is a central post-translational modification in signal transduction; underscoring its importance is the observation that roughly 2&#x00025; of eukaryotic genes encode kinases, and roughly one-third of all intracellular proteins may be phosphorylated on at least one residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Hanks1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Zolnierowicz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent studies have combined these approaches with the examination of evolutionary conservation and interaction networks to better understand kinase-substrate relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Beltrao1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.While such approaches have expanded our knowledge of kinase-substrate relationships, it is clear that many remain unidentified or uncharacterized by current methods.</p><p>Bioinformatics techniques are increasingly employed to help identify kinase-substrate relationships, usually by characterizing the phosphorylation motif (i.e. describing the sequence at the site of phosphorylation) associated with a given kinase. For example, the amino acid preferences at the phosphorylation sites of a given kinase can be determined with a peptide library screen (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Rennefahrt1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>) and encoded in a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). Alternatively, it may be possible to characterize the phosphorylation motif with a regular expression (e.g. &#x0005b;ST&#x0005d;P.&#x0005b;RK&#x0005d; for CDK). Thus, any protein can be assessed for the likelihood that it can be phosphorylated by a specific kinase, based on whether its sequence possesses a likely phosphorylation site of the kinase. Since phosphorylation motifs are often highly degenerate, approaches based on these motifs rely on sophisticated machine learning techniques to increase the accuracy of substrate prediction; nevertheless, these approaches have proven most effective for the few kinases with the least degenerate motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Wong1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Saunders1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent approaches take into consideration repeat occurrences of a phosphorylation motif within a protein sequence. Modeling the propensity for such clusters of phosphorylation motifs results in improved accuracy for the prediction of CDK substrates, for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Chang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Moses1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies raise the question of whether considering the co-occurrence of different motifs will also result in more accurate prediction of substrates for kinases with degenerate phosphorylation motifs.</p><p>Even in cases where phosphorylation motifs can be readily identified in putative substrates, the motifs do not generally provide sufficient information to unambiguously identify the physiologically relevant kinase. It has been recognized that sequence features that are independent of the actual phosphorylation site are often crucial for the phosphorylation of a substrate, including features that enable binding of the substrate to the regulatory domain of the kinase, binding of kinase and substrate to the same scaffold protein, or co-localization in the cell of kinase and substrate due to independent interactions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Zhu2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Bhattacharyya1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>). Moreover, it has been recognized that kinases often bind substrates at a second site, distal to the active site, and that these docking interactions are largely responsible for kinase-substrate specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Remenyi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings suggest that a predictor that takes into consideration such distal motifs, in addition to putative phosphorylation motifs, could produce more accurate predictions of kinase-substrate relationships.</p><p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Ste20p kinase (SGDID&#x02236;S000000999) is the founding member and prototype of the Ste20/PAK family, a large family of kinases ubiquitous in the genomes of all eukaryotes (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Bokoch1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Dan1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>).

A genetic interaction reflects a functional relationship between two genes determined by the level of some phenotype observed in the double mutant compared to the levels observed in the single mutants. We defined a network wherein each yeast gene is represented by a node and an edge is created between two genes if they are known to genetically interact (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). For any node, the Genetic Interaction Neighborhood (GIN) is the set of nodes connected to it by an edge. The GIN of every gene in the network was tested for significant overlap with the set of predicted Ste20p substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008279-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Indeed, the GINs of genes that genetically interact with <italic>STE20</italic> tend to overlap more significantly with the predicted substrates compared to the GINs of all other genes in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008279-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <italic>P </italic>&#x02248;5.45&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, Mann-Whitney test, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Given the expectation that <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates of Ste20p should share Ste20p's genetic interactions, the observed overlap between the predicted substrate set and the GINs of Ste20p's genetic interactors suggests that the <italic>in silico</italic> predictor exhibits <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance.</p><p>We next performed an analogous analysis based on physical interactions. Here we say a physical interaction exists between two proteins if they have been shown to physically interact directly or indirectly as part of the same complex. We thus defined a network where an edge was placed between two proteins if they are known to physically interact (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). For any node, the Physical Interaction Neighborhood (PIN) is the set of nodes connected to it by an edge.

The physical interactors examined include, for example, the scaffold proteins for Ste20p-related signaling complexes such as Bem1p (SGDID&#x02236;S000000404) and Cdc24p (SGDID&#x02236;S000000039).</p><p>Although only one of the Ste20p PINs (i.e. the neighborhood of Cdc28p (SGDID&#x02236;S000000364)) significantly overlaps the set of predicted substrates (adjusted <italic>P </italic>&#x02264;0.05, Fisher's exact test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008279.s010">Table S6</xref>), the 29 PINs tend to have lower overlap <italic>P</italic> values than the PINs of the other proteins in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008279-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; <italic>P </italic>&#x02248;8.29&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, Mann-Whitney test, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Bni1p is a large protein (1,953 residues) which was previously shown to be a phosphoprotein <italic>in vivo</italic> whose phosphorylation is reduced in a <italic>ste20&#x00394;</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Goehring1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. It comprises a N-terminal Cdc42p binding domain and three C-terminal regions characteristic of the formin-family of proteins, which together constitute the actin-assembly machinery. These C-terminal regions include the Formin-homology 1 and 2 (FH1 and FH2) domains, and a C-terminal tail region (COOH) that includes two domains: the Bud6-binding domain (BBD) and a <italic>cis</italic>-inhibitory Dia-autoregulatory domain (DAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008279-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Given the functional importance of the C-terminal domains, we expressed subclones composed of the FH1, FH2, and COOH domains as GST-fusion proteins and repeated the <italic>in vitro</italic> Ste20p kinase assays. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008279-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, phosphorylation was observed in the constructs containing the COOH region, but was not observed in constructs in which it is absent. Thus, Ste20p phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> occurs within the region of Bni1p responsible for binding Bud6p.</p><p>Next, we sought to validate that Bud6p is phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by Ste20p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008279-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). While the domain organization of Bud6p is not as well-defined as for Bni1p, it has been determined that the C-terminal region (519&#x02013;788aa) is involved in dimerization as well as binding Bni1p and actin, whereas the N-terminal region (1&#x02013;166) is required for proper Bud6p localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Jin1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. We thus subcloned Bud6p to determine which regions are phosphorylated by Ste20p <italic>in vitro</italic>. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008279-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, weak phosphorylation is observed in the N-terminal fragment, a stronger signal is observed in the uncharacterized middle region, and no phosphorylation is observed in the region involved in dimerization or binding to actin and Bni1p. Thus, while Ste20p phosphorylates Bni1p in the region responsible for Bud6p binding, it does not phosphorylate Bud6p in the region responsible for binding Bni1p.</p><p>We used mass spectrometry to identify <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites for Bud6p. Using standard procedures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Rigaut1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we identified <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation of a TAP-tagged Bud6p fusion protein on two residues: serine 327 and serine 342. These two residues are found in the middle fragment, which was phosphorylated by Ste20p <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008279-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, Bud6p is a phosphoprotein <italic>in vivo</italic> and the phosphorylation on residues Ser327 and Ser342 correlates with the phosphorylation of the same region by Ste20p <italic>in vitro</italic>. Given that the region of Bni1p which is phosphorylated by Ste20p is required for viability in the absence of <italic>CLA4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Goehring1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, we asked whether the same is true for Bud6p.

While the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of Bud6p phosphorylation remains to be determined, the substrate predictor correctly suggested that direct phosphorylation of polarisome proteins by Ste20p occurs <italic>in vitro</italic>, and thus presents opportunities for directed investigation of the activation mechanism of this complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We developed a strategy to aid the discovery of substrates for any given kinase and demonstrated its utility with the yeast Ste20p kinase. In particular, we tested &#x0223c;550 proteins in a biochemical screen for <italic>in vitro</italic> substrates of Ste20p. The results were used to generate an <italic>in silico</italic> predictor of Ste20p substrates. Cross-referencing the predicted substrates against known genetic and physical interactions highlighted polarisome components as likely targets of <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation by Ste20p. Of these components, Bni1p and Bud6p were shown to be phosphorylated by Ste20p <italic>in vitro</italic>. The phosphorylation was mapped to a region of Bni1p which is genetically associated with <italic>STE20</italic>, and which binds to Bud6p. <italic>In vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites were identified on Bud6p, but the physiological relevance of these sites remains unclear.</p><p>The decision to screen proteins coded by essential genes was made to address the shared essential function of <italic>STE20</italic> and <italic>CLA4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Cvrckova1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We reasoned that if the phosphorylation of a single substrate is responsible for the synthetic lethality of the <italic>ste20&#x00394; cla4&#x00394;</italic> mutant, then the gene coding for that substrate may also be essential. We thus screened roughly half the complement of yeast essential genes, selected on the basis of GO annotations that we assumed might overlap with known functions or localizations of Ste20p and Cla4p. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008279-t001">Table 1</xref>, 10 of 14 substrates phosphorylated by Ste20p were also phosphorylated by Cla4p. It remains to be determined whether any of these substrates may be responsible for the shared essential function of Ste20p and Cla4p. While the identification and mutational analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites on these substrates should yield insight into this question, our results also suggest the phosphorylation of Bni1p is related to this essential function.</p><p>Our approach to kinase-substrate identification can complement and support various other methods currently used to identify kinase substrates. For instance, an <italic>in vitro</italic> screening approach using protein microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Ptacek1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> has identified 70 substrates for Ste20p, 11 of which were also tested in our screen. We confirmed a 36&#x00025; recovery of chip-identified substrates in our screen, which is generally consistent with observed differences between related high-throughput assays and with the observation that different approaches to identify physical, genetic, and biochemical interactions are complementary to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-vonMering1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This earlier study also employed a pattern-searching algorithm to identify predictive phosphorylation motifs for each of the tested kinases. It succeeded in identifying phosphorylation motifs for 11 of the 87 kinases tested, suggesting these are kinases with strict phosphorylation site requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Ptacek1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Though they did not identify a Ste20p phosphorylation site motif, our multi-motif predictor of Ste20p substrates exhibits an estimated three-fold improvement, over screening randomly selected proteins, in the rate of substrate identification. This substrate enrichment is especially significant since the predictor is based on a screen of only 539 proteins. Thus, our approach improves upon previous efforts to capture sequence motifs that predict substrate status.</p><p>This improvement is likely due to the fact that our predictive approach does not rely on strict phosphorylation site requirements, but rather a set of sequence motifs that are not restricted to describing the phosphorylation site and can therefore predict substrates by other means. We reasoned that, while no individual sequence feature may be sufficient to identify Ste20p substrates, the combination of relevant motifs may allow for substrate prediction with a higher degree of accuracy.</p><p>Our approach identified 23 motifs that were then used in a na&#x000ef;ve Bayes classifier to assign a posterior probability of being a Ste20p substrate to each member of the proteome. Amino acid preferences at the phosphorylation sites of human Ste20p-related kinases have been specified via position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Rennefahrt1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and some of the motifs identified in this study capture the predominant preference for basic amino acids at positions N-terminal to the sites (i.e. K..HS and R.S..H). Moreover, we showed that integrating the PSSMs with our motifs does not improve the accuracy of our Ste20p substrate predictor. This suggests that our motifs sufficiently capture the preferences specified by the PSSMs that are useful for predicting Ste20p substrates. It remains to be determined how these motifs participate in specifying Ste20p phosphorylation, whether via <italic>cis</italic> effects through a docking interaction with Ste20p, or <italic>trans</italic> effects through binding with a Ste20p-associated scaffold such as Bem1p, Ste5p (SGDID&#x02236;S000002510), or Far1p (SGDID&#x02236;S000003693). Though the molecular functions of the motifs are not yet clear, our analyses showed significant associations between the set of predicted substrates and genes/proteins that are already (directly or indirectly) associated with <italic>STE20</italic>. Thus, although the predictor is based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemistry and primary structure of proteins, employing multiple evolutionarily-conserved selective motifs seems to result in biologically relevant substrate predictions.</p><p>While the predictor remains a tool for identifying a biochemical relationship between a kinase and its potential substrates, providing biological context, for example by pathway analysis, suggests hypotheses that physiologically relate predicted substrates to kinases. While pathway analysis reveals that the predicted Ste20p substrate set appears consistent with known roles of Ste20p, the analysis also suggests a potential role for Ste20p in vesicle-mediated transport, which is supported by the observation that the human Ste20p-related kinase Pak1 plays a role in regulating vesicular-based transport in human fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Dharmawardhane1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, a role for Ste20p in carbohydrate metabolic processes is supported by the observation that Pak1 phosphorylates and activates phosphoglucomutase-1 (PGM; Ensembl&#x02236;ENSG00000079739) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Gururaj1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The biological or <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the predicted substrates was also evaluated using the genetic and physical interaction networks surrounding Ste20p. Combining genetic and physical interaction data with biochemical data has been shown to be an effective means of evaluating and assigning biological relevance to observed phosphorylation. For instance, the NetworKin methodology employs several types of data in order to assign thousands of identified <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites to the roughly 500 human kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Linding1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In that framework, genetic and physical interactions are used to evaluate possible kinase-substrate relationships. Here, we employ a similar approach to evaluate substrates that have been predicted computationally. The analysis focused on genes/proteins that are closely linked to <italic>STE20</italic> in the genetic and physical interaction networks, reasoning that these are the most likely to represent strong candidates for biologically relevant associations with the kinase. Indeed, <italic>STE20</italic> interactor GINs tend to overlap more significantly with the predicted substrate set compared to the GINs of other genes in the network. Analogously, Ste20p interactor PINs tend to overlap more significantly than other PINs with the predicted substrate set. The interaction neighborhood analyses therefore support the hypothesis that the predicted substrates represent candidates for <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation by Ste20p.</p><p>Large-scale screens and bioinformatics analyses are a great source of novel biological hypotheses, and our analyses led to the hypothesis that Ste20p phosphorylates components of the polarisome complex. Here, we confirmed that Bni1p and Bud6p are phosphorylated by Ste20p <italic>in vitro</italic>, but that the other two components are not. Spa2p was assigned a high posterior probability of being a Ste20p substrate and is also present in many Ste20p interactor neighborhoods. It may therefore represent a false prediction. However, it is also possible that there are additional requirements for Spa2p phosphorylation by Ste20p that are not present in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. Nonetheless, our predictive method resulted in the identification of two novel substrates for Ste20p phosphorylation.</p><p>The Ste20p phosphorylation of Bni1p occurs in the C-terminal Bud6-binding domain (BBD). It has been previously shown that expression of a <italic>bni1</italic> construct lacking this BBD region is unable to rescue the synthetic lethality of a <italic>bni1&#x00394; cla4&#x00394;</italic> mutant, and therefore the transformed mutants exhibit a terminal phenotype similar to that of <italic>ste20&#x00394; cla4&#x00394;</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Goehring1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. The phenotypic similarity between strains lacking the region of Bni1p phosphorylated by Ste20p and those lacking Ste20p altogether suggests that phosphorylation of this region occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> and is required in the absence of <italic>cla4&#x00394;</italic>. As its name implies, this region also binds the other polarisome substrate of Ste20p, Bud6p, indicating the potential for sophisticated regulatory coordination. Though the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of Ste20p phosphorylation and the coordination of the phosphorylation of Bni1p and Bud6p in the regulation of polarized growth remain to be determined, our predictive approach to substrate identification has provided a framework for further investigation.</p><p>Phosphorylation is a key modification involved in signal transduction, and thus participates in many of the dynamic processes of the cell. Despite this importance, identifying the detailed architecture of phosphorylation networks remains a challenge. Here, we have described a combination of biochemical genomics and bioinformatics to identify potential new substrates for the Ste20p kinase in yeast. We have confirmed experimentally that our approach predicts valid <italic>in vitro</italic> Ste20p substrates, and leads to greater insight into the functions of this kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs and GE Healthcare.

However, the peptide can still be assessed for the likelihood that it is a Ste20p substrate based on the presence/absence of predictive motifs in its sequence.</p><p>Rather than using standard leave-one-out cross-validation where in each iteration, a different (positive or negative) learning example is not used to generate the predictor, we only left out positive examples. A random selection of 100 proteins from the negative set (&#x0223c;20&#x00025;) was set aside for testing the predictors resulting from the different iterations. We cross-validated in this way due to the computationally intensive process of deriving selectivity ratios for the thousands of motifs discovered by Teiresias during each iteration.</p><p>We experimented with different parameter values and used the overall performance, estimated with the area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve (AUC), of the resulting predictors to guide the selection of optimal parameter values for the final predictor. For example, the selectivity ratio threshold controls the number of motifs that are used by the predictor, since the smaller the threshold the more motifs that will have selectivity ratios above the threshold, and all motifs that pass the threshold are used. While using more motifs increases the possibility of false positives (i.e. a reduction in specificity), since it becomes more likely for any sequence to contain an occurrence of any predictive motif by chance, the sensitivity of the predictor improves (data not shown). For different parameter values, we estimated the AUC of the resulting predictors using the variation of leave-one-out cross validation described above. The parameter values that result in larger AUCs are better. The optimal parameter values used to build the final predictor are described above.</p><p>To integrate the amino acid preferences at the phosphorylation sites of Ste20p-related kinases, we obtained the PSSMs for Pak1, Pak2 and Pak4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008279-Rennefahrt1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

For any given serine or threonine (S/T) in a sequence <italic>t</italic>, the PSSM score is defined as the sum of the <italic>x<sub>ij</sub></italic> values corresponding to the observed amino acids flanking the S/T.
