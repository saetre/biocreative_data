Mammalian glycolipid transfer proteins (GLTPs) are potential regulators of cell processes mediated by GSLs and display a unique architecture among lipid binding/transfer proteins. The GLTP fold represents a novel membrane targeting/interaction domain among peripheral proteins. Here we report crystal structures of human GLTP bound to GSLs of diverse acyl chain length, unsaturation, and sugar composition. Structural comparisons show a highly conserved anchoring of galactosyl- and lactosyl-amide headgroups by the GLTP recognition center. By contrast, acyl chain chemical structure and occupancy of the hydrophobic tunnel dictate partitioning between sphingosine-in and newly-observed sphingosine-out ligand-binding modes. The structural insights, combined with computed interaction propensity distributions, suggest a concerted sequence of events mediated by GLTP conformational changes during GSL transfer to and/or from membranes, as well as during GSL presentation and/or transfer to other proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Structures of glycosphingolipids bound to glycolipid transfer proteins reveal a sphingosine-in or -out binding depending on their acyl chain structure; these conformational changes suggest a mechanism for glycosphingolipid transfer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Malinina L, Malakhova ML, Kanack AT, Lu M, Abagyan R, et al.

The liganding site consists of a sugar headgroup recognition center that anchors the ceramide-linked sugar to the protein surface and a hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the hydrocarbon chains of ceramide. Comparative structural analyses, including crystallographic B-factor distributions of apo-GLTP and the LacCer-GLTP complex, suggest that liganding of the glycolipid most likely occurs via an adaptive recognition process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040362-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. A cleft-like gating mechanism, involving conformational changes to two interhelical loops and one &#x003b1; helix, appears to facilitate entry and exit of the lipid chains in the membrane-associated state when the GSL headgroup is attached to the sugar headgroup recognition center.</p><p>An important feature of the GLTP hydrophobic tunnel is its ability to expand to accommodate the GSL ceramide moiety. In the case of the 18:1 LacCer-GLTP complex, the 18-carbon oleoyl and sphingosine chains of LacCer reside side by side within the hydrophobic channel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040362-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. However, naturally occurring mammalian glycolipids typically have acyl chains with lengths ranging from 16 to 26 carbons with occasional monounsaturation. To test the conformational properties and accommodation limits of the GLTP hydrophobic tunnel, we synthesized glycolipids (LacCer or galactosylceramide &#x0005b;GalCer&#x0005d;) containing short acyl chains (e.g., octanoyl and dodecanoyl), medium unsaturated acyl chains (e.g., linoleoyl), as well as long, physiologically relevant unsaturated acyl chains (e.g., nervonyl), and we structurally characterized their complexes with GLTP. To elucidate conformational changes caused by the sugar headgroup binding in the GLTP, we also structurally characterized the complex between GLTP and the model compound <italic>n</italic>-hexyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glycoside, which, unlike GSLs, has a single, very short hydrocarbon chain lacking an amide linkage.</p><p>The present structural studies provide definitive evidence for a novel GSL-GLTP complexation mode characterized by a difference in the accommodation of the ceramide lipid chains but not the sugar headgroups. Chief among the differences is bending of the sphingosine chain, causing outward projection from the hydrophobic tunnel. Comparative analysis of all GSL-GLTP structures reveals that the hydrophobic tunnel consists of two functionally distinct compartments, enabling GLTP to accommodate GSL acyl chains of different lengths and conformational restrictions. Equally importantly, our findings suggest a concerted sequence of events during GSL liganding, in which the sphingosine chain is the last part of the glycolipid to enter GLTP and the first part to leave GLTP during interaction with membranes. Interaction propensity distribution computations indicate a potential GLTP interface for interactions with other proteins and/or membranes, which coincide with a region of the proposed GLTP gate mediating GSL binding and release.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Nonpolar Nature of GLTP Hydrophobic Channel Promotes Occupancy by Nonpolar Lipids</title><p>Our original structural characterization of GLTP revealed two noteworthy features of the hydrophobic tunnel that encapsulates the GSL hydrocarbon chains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040362-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. First, the tunnel is highly nonpolar. No water molecules reside in the channel, which is lined by the side chains of nonpolar phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and alanine residues, together with a few valine and proline residues. Second, a large portion of the tunnel is conformationally adaptable and expands during GSL acquisition to accommodate the hydrocarbon chains. Moreover, localized in the lower part of the hydrophobic tunnel of apo-GLTP (i.e., glycolipid-free GLTP) is an extraneous hydrocarbon molecule that contains at least six carbon atoms and is clearly observable in electron density maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040362-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

Assuming that this proposition is correct, we hypothesized that GSLs with short acyl chains should occupy the channel in a similar fashion as 18:1 LacCer. To test this hypothesis, we cocrystallized GLTP with LacCers containing 8:0 octanoyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">Figure 10</xref>A) and 12:0 dodecanoyl acyl chains. The use of these two LacCer species, which have shorter acyl chains than LacCers in mammalian cells, provided an investigative tool to gain insights into how GLTP accommodates GSLs with different acyl structures.</p><p>Surprisingly, the binding mode of 8:0 LacCer to GLTP (GSL colored cyan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">Figure 10</xref>B) resembles that of the 24:1 GalCer-GLTP complex (GSL colored green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), rather than 18:1 LacCer-GLTP complex (GSL colored lavender in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040362-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). This outcome occurred despite the octanoyl acyl chain being short enough so as not to hinder the sphingosine chain from occupying the hydrophobic tunnel. The sphingosine-out alignment results as a consequence of the narrow bottom of the hydrophobic channel being occupied by a short extraneous hydrocarbon chain (colored silver in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">Figure 10</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">10</xref>C). In the 8:0 LacCer-GLTP complex, the extraneous hydrocarbon chain consists of ten carbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">Figure 10</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">10</xref>C), so it would compete for the tunnel region with the sphingosine chain if the latter took the &#x0201c;in&#x0201d; position. Therefore, the sphingosine chain bends, and stays outside (cyan colored lipid chain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">Figure 10</xref>C), and can be observed bridging to the tunnel of the neighboring GLTP in the crystal-related cross dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040362-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A).</p><p>Similar behavior was observed in the 12:0 LacCer-GLTP complex, with an extraneous hydrocarbon being found in the same location as in the 8:0 LacCer-GLTP complex. In the case of 12:0 LacCer, the five terminal carbons of the dodecanoyl acyl chain are disordered in the crystal, suggesting insufficient hydrocarbon length to displace the extraneous hydrocarbon, which blocks the sphingosine chain from entering the tunnel.

Because the sphingosine-out conformation can be directly observed in four out of five of our GLTP-GSL complexes and is implicated in a recently reported GM3-His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;tagged bovine GLTP complex, in which the last ten of 18 carbons of the GM3 sphingosine chain are unobservable because of disorder &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040362-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, the sphingosine-out conformation appears to be preferred by GLTP.

If sphingosine entry into the upper tunnel compartment is obstructed by either the presence of extraneous hydrocarbon or by steric hindrance created by the acyl chain itself, then the sphingosine chain stays out. Thus, both compartments of the hydrophobic tunnel play critical and essential roles in accommodating the acyl and sphingosine chains of ceramide and determining the final equilibrium localization of the sphingosine chain.</p><p>Disordering of the GLTP N terminus provides a potential mechanism for controlling access to the hydrophobic tunnel via a portal located in the narrow bottom compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040362-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). N-terminal disorder, observed in all our structures, decreases considerably when GLTP complexes GSL. The net result is that leucine L4 is positioned to act like a cork to plug the entrance to the portal. It is noteworthy that stacking (3.4 &#x000c5; separation) between histidine H7 of the N terminus and H29 at the beginning of the 1&#x02013;2 loop (between helices 1 and 2) is observed in all our GSL-GLTP complexes. The ordering effect of this stacking interaction on the N terminus of GLTP appears to enable the corking action of L4, which is further stabilized by van der Waals interactions with the terminal methyl of the GSL acyl chain near the channel bottom.

Contributing to this dominance by the acyl chain is the proposed oriented entry of the ceramide through the cleft-like gate, most likely necessitating that GLTP accommodate the acyl and sphingosine chains in sequential fashion. The sphingosine-in mode is favored when the acyl chain is just long and flexible enough to enter the narrow bottom (region 2) of the channel and fill it without creating steric hindrance for entry of the sphingoid chain. In other words, both chains fit optimally into the available channel space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>The sphingosine-out mode is favored for GSL with long acyl chains (&#x0003e;19 carbons), because the tunnel length is limited and the acyl chain must bend in serpentine fashion to be accommodated within the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In this case, sphingosine entry into the same channel is obstructed. Short acyl chains (&#x0003c;13 carbons) are not long enough to enter the narrow bottom compartment of the GLTP hydrophobic channel and displace embedded extraneous hydrocarbon chain. The result is steric hindrance to the entry of sphingosine into the channel, thereby favoring the sphingosine-out binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">Figure 10</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040362-g010">10</xref>C). Thus, there is a limited range of chain lengths that enable a stable, tight fit of the acyl chain in the GLTP tunnel without interfering with the entry of the sphingosine chain, and ensuring a sphingosine-in binding mode.</p><p>In essence, the sphingosine-out conformer in GSL-GLTP complexes is analogous to monoacylation of a soluble protein, except that the exposed hydrocarbon segment of sphingosine (10&#x02013;12 methylenes) is even shorter than protein acylation achieved by myristoylation (14:0) or by palmitoylation (16:0) events.

Because apo-GLTP displays a relatively weak protein/membrane-binding propensity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040362-t002">Table 2</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040362-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, it can be expected to readily partition on and off the membrane surface. Nonetheless, the rapid lateral diffusion rates of lipids in fluid-phase membranes and the confinement of the glycolipid ligand to a membrane surface would likely enhance the capacity of GLTP to associate with a glycolipid molecule among other membrane lipids.

At this stage, there is an increased interaction propensity centered about the cleft-like GLTP gate that is surrounded by aromatic surface residues (e.g., W142, W96, Y153, Y157, Y207, Y81) and a half dozen lysine residues, which are known to interact favorably with membrane interfaces &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040362-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040362-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, thereby potentially facilitating gate-membrane interactions, including the outward movement of the &#x003b1; helix 6. We anticipate that the opening of the gate in the membrane-associated state facilitates entry of the acyl chain into the hydrophobic channel of the GLTP. The accommodation limits of the hydrophobic tunnel, illustrated by the crystal structures of the GSL-GLTP complexes, strongly suggest that sphingosine is the last lipid part to enter GLTP and, most likely, the first to depart GLTP upon interaction with a membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Functional Implications</title><p>Among known lipid binding/transfer proteins, the GLTP topology is unique.

Finally, our observation of crystal-related cross dimerization in the crystal structures of several sphingosine-out GSL-GLTP complexes suggests that the ceramide lipid chains of GSLs most likely enter into and egress from GLTP in a defined stepwise manner.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Protein expression and purification.</title><p>The open reading frame (ORF) encoding human GLTP was subcloned into the pET-30 Xa/LIC expression vector (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, United States), enabling cleavage of the amino-terminal His<sub>6</sub> and S-tags, as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040362-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

Emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 420 nm using GLTP concentrations (1 &#x003bc;M) with an optical density of less than 0.1 at 295 nm to avoid the inner filter effect. Measurements were performed under constant stirring by addition of small defined aliquots of GSL dissolved in ethanol (1 mM) to a fixed volume of protein. Rapid equilibration of the fluorescence emission signal was observed (2&#x02013;3 min) with no additional change observed by additional incubation up to 20 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Crystallization and x-ray data collection.</title><p>Crystals of glycolipid-GLTP complexes were obtained by cocrystallization of protein with glycolipid using the hanging drop technique.
