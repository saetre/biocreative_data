Initiation of pol III transcription requires the evolutionarily conserved pol III initiation factor TFIIIB. TFIIIB is the molecular target of regulation by tumor suppressors, including p53, RB and the RB-related pocket proteins. However, our understanding of negative regulation of human TFIIIB-mediated transcription by other proteins is limited. In this study we characterize a RNA pol III luciferase assay and further demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic> that a human homolog of yeast Maf1 represses RNA pol III transcription. Additionally, we show that Maf1 repression of RNA pol III transcription occurs via TFIIIB, specifically through the TFIIB family members Brf1 and Brf2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA polymerase III</kwd><kwd>TFIIIB</kwd><kwd>Maf1</kwd><kwd>Brf2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1.

RNA pol III is the largest of the eukaryotic polymerases and has the greatest number of subunits, yet its transcriptional products are untranslated RNAs that are usually smaller than 300 nucleotides in length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. The genes transcribed by human RNA pol III may be further subdivided according to promoter structure, which may be entirely gene internal (type 1 and 2) or external (type 3), and basal transcription factor requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. Recruitment of RNA pol III is a consequence of specific transcription factor complex assembly on the different classes of promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>.

All three polypeptides are necessary and sufficient to reconstitute TFIIIB activity in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. In humans, TFIIIB activity is more complex, as at least two forms of TFIIIB activity have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. Transcription from gene internal promoters, such as tRNA genes, requires a TFIIIB complex comprised of TBP, Brf1 and Bdp1, whereas expression from gene external promoters, such as the U6 snRNA gene, require a TFIIIB complex containing TBP, Brf2 and Bdp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>.</p><p>RNA pol III activity is intimately linked to growth conditions and is tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle; RNA pol III activity is low during mitosis, increases slowly through G<sub>1</sub> and reaches its maximal activity during the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>.

Specifically, the tumor suppressors p53, RB, p130, and p107 have been demonstrated to inactivate RNA pol III transcription through physical associations with TFIIIB subunits at different stages of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>.</p><p>Maf1 has been identified as a global repressor of pol III transcription in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref> for a review. The repressing activity of Maf1 was originally proposed based, in part, on the observation that <italic>maf1</italic> mutant yeast cells have higher levels of mature tRNAs, as compared to wild-type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. Subsequently, yeast Maf1 was shown to be required for down-regulation of RNA pol III transcription during the growth cycle and in response to nutrient limitation, DNA damage, oxidative stress and a variety of drug treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. Hence, conditions that cause inhibition of cell proliferation, at least in yeast, appear to activate different signaling pathways that converge on Maf1 and regulate its repressing activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>. It has been determined that two important targets of yeast Maf1 repression are the TFIIIB subunit Brf1 and RNA pol III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. Yeast Maf1 co-precipitates with Pol III and Brf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref> and recombinant Maf1 has been shown to inhibit tRNA transcription <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. Recently, it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Maf1 by protein kinase A and protein phosphatase 2A respectively, regulate the cellular localization of Maf1 and hence its ability to repress transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. Putative Maf1 homologs have been identified in a variety of organisms, including humans, and it has been speculated that the function of Maf1 will be conserved from yeast to man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. The Maf1 orthologs are highly conserved; containing three regions (termed A, B, C) with a high degree of sequence similarity, but with unknown function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. Only recently has a role for human Maf1 in RNA pol III transcription been described, whereby Reina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref> demonstrate that human Maf1 represses RNA pol III transcription from type 1, 2, and 3 promoters <italic>in vitro</italic> and that endogenous Maf1 associates with Brf1 and the largest subunit of RNA pol III via co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays.</p><p>In contrast to yeast, there are at least two forms of human TFIIIB, each requiring different TFIIB family members for transcription from the different classes of RNA pol III promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>. Thus, we sought to determine if a putative human homolog of yeast Maf1 functions as an <italic>in vivo</italic> repressor of gene internal RNA pol III transcription through the TFIIB family member Brf1, and whether human Maf1 would be able to also repress gene external RNA pol III transcription through the TFIIB family member Brf2, which does not have a functional homolog in yeast.</p><p>Here we report that a human homolog of yeast Maf1 represses RNA pol III transcription from both gene -internal and -external promoters through TFIIIB using an <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA pol III luciferase assay.

Results</title><sec><title>Transcription from gene internal (VAI) and gene external (U6) promoters can be monitored in HeLa cells using a dual luciferase assay</title><p>RNA pol III transcribes both gene- internal and external promoters as exemplified by the VAI (a prototypical tRNA-like promoter) and human U6 promoters, respectively. Previously, most of our understanding of the mechanisms of RNA pol III transcription has come from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays utilizing nuclear or whole cell extracts prepared from mammalian cells grown in culture. Although this methodology has been invaluable for understanding RNA polymerase III transcription and in the subsequent identification of transcription factors, the major limitation is our inability to investigate the regulation of RNA pol III transcription in intact mammalian cells. Therefore, we sought to develop and characterize a reporter assay that could be used to study RNA pol III transcription from gene &#x02013;internal and &#x02013;external promoters in intact mammalian cells.</p><p>To determine if we could monitor gene external RNA pol III promoter activity <italic>in vivo</italic> we PCR amplified the human U6 promoter from human genomic DNA as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. This human U6 promoter contains both a proximal sequence element (PSE) and TATA box located upstream of the transcription start site and was ligated into pGL3-basic, lacking both promoter and enhancer sequences, resulting in pGL3-U6. pGL3-U6 was transiently transfected into HeLa cells yielding higher luciferase activity, as compared to the empty pGL3 vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Addition of increasing amounts of pGL3-U6 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity. These results are in agreement with a recent report demonstrating that both the human and mouse U6 promoters can drive luciferase expression in a promoterless pGL4.10 plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>. To examine whether expression of the luciferase reporter in HeLa cells could be driven by a gene internal RNA polymerase III promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, we utilized the well studied VAI gene, a prototypical tRNA-like promoter. The VAI gene has canonical A and B box promoter elements located downstream of the transcription start site. The VAI gene was PCR amplified from pADVantage and ligated into pGL3-Basic, yielding pGL3-VAI which was transiently transfected into HeLa cells and demonstrated a dose response increase in luciferase activity, as compared to the empty pGL3 vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Taken together these data suggest that gene-internal and -external RNA pol III promoter activity may be monitored in HeLa cells using this luciferase assay.</p><p>Previously, the issue has been raised as to whether RNA pol II can transcribe RNA pol III promoters in short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>. Hence, we sought to determine if the observed luciferase activities from luciferase vectors driven by RNA pol III promoters (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) were specific to RNA pol III transcription. We generated a mutant pGL3-U6 expression construct (pGL3-mtU6) with previously characterized mutations in both the PSE and TATA box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref> and tested its ability to express luciferase in transiently transfected HeLa cells. As depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B, mutations in the PSE and TATA box of the human U6 promoter abolishes luciferase activity in HeLa cells, as compared to luciferase activity driven by the wild type human U6 promoter. We also determined the specificity of pol III transcription from the human pGL3-VAI construct by generating a previously characterized deletion mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref> lacking both the canonical A and B box promoter elements of VAI. This construct was subsequently tested in our luciferase assay, and as expected, deletion of the A and B boxes severely inhibited VAI transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C).</p><p>To ensure that our RNA pol III luciferase assay was indeed measuring RNA pol III and not cryptic RNA pol II activity, we tested whether this RNA pol III luciferase assay followed the classical alpha-amanitin sensitivity profile established for eukaryotic DNA dependent RNA polymerases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>. We observed that pGL3-U6 luciferase activity was not affected at low doses of alpha amanitin (3ug/ml), but transcription from a RNA pol II-like promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>(pGL3-mtTATAU6) was decreased at 3 ug/ml (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). Also, transcription from pGL3-VAI was not inhibited at 2 ug/ml alpha amanitin, whereas transcription from pGL3-mtTATAU6 was severely inhibited 2 ug/ml alpha amanitin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E).</p><p>To determine if we could artificially terminate RNA pol III transcription in our system, we inserted a prototypical RNA pol III termination sequence, a tandem oligo containing 6T residues downstream of the human U6 promoter, but upstream of the Kozak consensus translation initiation site of the luciferase coding sequence of pGL3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>. The insertion of a run of six T residues severely inhibited luciferase activity from the pGL3-U6 promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F), as compared to wild-type pGL3-U6. These results differ from Rumi et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref> who were unable to demonstrate that the insertion of a RNA pol III termination signal downstream of the human U6 promoter and upstream of the luciferase start ATG significantly inhibited RNA pol III transcription. A potentially important difference is vector construction. Rumi et al inserted the EGFP shRNA sequence between the human H1 promoter and the RNA pol III terminator sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>. Using TESS: Transcription Element Search Software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, we determined that the EGFP shRNA sequence contains putative RNA pol II transcription factor binding sites which may serve to enhance cryptic RNA pol II transcription from the human H1 promoter in the pGL4.10 utilized by Rumi et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>.</p><p>Taken together (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F) these data suggest that our RNA pol III luciferase assay can specifically and effectively monitor transcription from prototypical gene- internal and -external RNA pol III promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Maf1 represses RNA pol III transcription in HeLa cells</title><p>To determine if the putative human homolog of yeast Maf1 is indeed a repressor of human RNA pol III transcription, we sub-cloned human Maf1 (Genbank accession number NM032272) from HeLa cDNA into p3XFlag-CMV-7.1 and transiently co-transfected the construct with pGL3-U6 into HeLa cells. By western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A), the 3XFlag-tagged Maf1 construct expresses at detectable levels in HeLa cells, as compared to HeLa cells transfected with the empty Flag vector. Interestingly, we routinely observed a doublet, indicated by asterisks, when expressing Flag-Maf1 in HeLa cells (lane 2 Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). We speculate that the observed upper band is a phosphorylated form of Maf1, consistent with the properties of Maf1 in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> and a recent report regarding mammalian Maf1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>. To determine if Maf1 is indeed phosphorylated, we treated the FlagMaf1 expressing HeLa nuclear extract with calf intestine phosphatase for various times and analyzed the samples by anti-Flag western blot. We demonstrated a loss in the upper band and a proportional increase in the lower faster migrating band (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). As of yet, it is unclear if this observed dephosphorylation of human Maf1 plays the same important role in the regulation of RNA pol III transcription recently observed in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>.</p><p>To determine if human Maf1 is a repressor of RNA pol III transcription, like its yeast counterpart, we performed transient transfections and demonstrated that increasing concentrations of Maf1 inhibited both U6- and VAI-driven luciferase activity in a dose- dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). Taken together these luciferase data suggest that human Maf1 is an inhibitor of both gene internal and gene external RNA pol III transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> and these data are in agreement with a recent report demonstrating Maf1 regulation of human RNA pol III transcription using nuclear run on (VAI) and RNA protection (U6) assays <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Repression of RNA Pol III transcription by Maf1 occurs through the TFIIB family members Brf1 and Brf2</title><p>Desai et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> identified a two step mechanism by which yeast Maf1 represses RNA pol III transcription: (1) inhibition of TFIIIB assembly at the promoter and (2) inhibition of RNA pol III recruitment to TFIIIB already assembled on promoters under conditions which favor cellular growth repression. To elucidate whether human Maf1 represses RNA pol III transcription by a similar mechanism, we attempted to overexpress the TFIIIB subunits Brf1 and Brf2 to determine if this would alleviate repression of RNA pol III transcription by human Maf1. Overexpression of human Brf1 in HeLa cells co-expressing human Maf1 alleviates the observed repression of RNA pol III transcription from the VAI promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). We are able to restore RNA pol III activity in the Maf1 repressed HeLa cells to activity levels similar to that observed in the control HeLa cells by the overexpression of Brf1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). These results suggest that inhibition of VAI transcription by human Maf1 occurs via the TFIIIB subunit Brf1, suggesting a similar mechanism to that observed in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. Furthermore, Reina et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref> demonstrated Maf1 physically associates with Brf1 and the RNA pol III subunit RPC1 by co-immunoprecipitation assays.</p><p>Yeast cells do not utilize gene-external RNA pol III promoters of the type that require Brf2 for transcription in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Thus, it is not known whether Brf2, like Brf1, is a molecular target of Maf1 repression. To address this question, we tested whether transient overexpression of Brf2 can rescue U6 promoter-driven luciferase activity in HeLa cells co-transfected with Maf1. Co-transfection of human Brf2 with Maf1 could only restore activity to approximately 50% of the control luciferase activity observed in the control HeLa cells not transfected with the Maf1 construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Although we were able to alleviate Maf1 repression of U6 transcription nearly 50%, by the co-expression of GFP-Brf2, we were never able to restore U6 transcription levels to those seen in the control HeLa cells transfected with the U6 promoter and the vector expressing only the Flag epitope. Currently, we cannot rule out the possibility that overexpression of a GFP-Brf2 fusion is not as efficient at rescuing Maf1 repression. Alternatively or in addition, the U6 promoter may be more sensitive than the VA1 promoter to other effects of Maf1-dependent repression. To further investigate the mechanism by which Maf1 represses U6 transcription we sought to determine if Brf2 and Maf1 could co-localize in HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Maf1 interacts with Brf2 in HeLa cells</title><p>To date there have been few reports depicting the dynamics of TFIIIB by immunofluorescence in living mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>. Recently, Chen et al investigated the physical association of the TFIIIB subunit TBP with chromosomes during the cell cycle, and determined that TBP stably associates with the condensed mitotic chromosomes, despite the known inactivation of TFIIIB and the inhibition of RNA pol III transcription that occurs during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>.</p><p>There is little experimental evidence depicting the physical localization of human TFIIIB and known repressors of RNA pol III transcription. Hence, we sought to determine if our epitope tagged TFIIIB subunit Brf2 and the RNA pol III repressor Maf1 constructs were able to localize to the nucleus. FlagBrf2 was transiently transfected into HeLa cells and localized to the nucleus, as judged by propidium iodide staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). In contrast to the localization patterns of FlagMaf1 and FlagBrf2, the vector expressing only the Flag epitope showed primarily cytoplasmic staining with little or no signal in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, FlagMaf1 and GFP-Brf2 were co-transfected into HeLa cells where they co-localized. Both the Brf2 and Maf1 constructs localized to the nucleus as judged by DAPI staining (data not shown).</p><p>To further elucidate whether Maf1 physically associates with Brf2 we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either the empty Flag vector or FlagMaf1 and nuclear extract was prepared. After incubation with M2 Flag agarose, the immunoprecipitates (IP) were extensively washed and the precipitated complexes were eluted using Flag peptide. The complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and we immunoblotted using an anti-Brf2 antibody (CSH 1228), as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. We find that FlagMaf1 specifically interacts with endogenous Brf2, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lane 6), as no Brf2 was detected in the anti-Flag alone IP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lane 5). This suggests that human Maf1 interacts with the TFIIIB subunit Brf2, but these experiments do not provide insight whether this is a direct or indirect interaction. To discriminate between these two possibilities we expressed and purified recombinant Flag/HTBrf2 and GSTMaf1 in <italic>E. coli</italic>, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Using a GST pull-down assay, we demonstrate that Maf1 interacts directly with the TFIIIB subunit Brf2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, lane 2). Taken together co-localization, co-immuno&#x000ad;precipitation, and GST pulldown assays strongly suggest that human Maf1 exerts its ability to inhibit RNA pol III U6 transcription through direct interaction with the TFIIIB subunit Brf2.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>In this study we have constructed RNA pol III type 2 and 3 promoter fusions to the <italic>Photinus pyralis</italic> luciferase gene that enable RNA polymerase III transcription to be monitored<italic> in vivo</italic>. We demonstrate specific monitoring of transcriptional activity from both gene internal and gene external RNA pol III promoters (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A through 1F). Although the use of the luciferase gene fused to prototypical RNA pol III promoters to monitor both type 2 and type 3 RNA pol III transciption <italic>in vivo</italic> is novel, the ability of RNA pol III to generate functional mRNAs has been documented in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>. It has been demonstrated that the human VAI promoter can drive expression of the Tat gene <italic>in vivo</italic> and that this VA-Tat RNA synthesized by RNA pol III is scanned for translational initiation, despite being uncapped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>. Examination of the luciferase coding sequence in pGL3 Basic reveals several regions with a run of four or more T residues which could potentially be used as termination signals by RNA pol III. However, it has been demonstrated that some RNA pol III transcripts such as rabbit tRNA<sup>lys</sup>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tRNA<sup>lys</sup> and the yeast tRNA<sup>ser</sup> transcripts contain internal stretches of T residues indicating that a cluster of T residues are not always sufficient for efficient termination by RNA pol III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>. This was clearly demonstrated in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> 5S RNA which requires a G + C rich sequence, surrounding a cluster of T residues for efficient termination by RNA pol III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>. To ascertain if we were indeed measuring RNA pol III transcription we inserted a putative termination signal for RNA pol III, a run T residues downstream of the U6 promoter, but upstream of the start ATG of the luciferase gene of pGL3-U6, which inhibited luciferase expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F).</p><p>We also provide experimental evidence that a human homolog of yeast Maf1 is a repressor of type 2 and 3 RNA pol III transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D) using an <italic>in vivo</italic> luciferase assay. These results are in agreement with Reina et al's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref> report that, human Maf1 inhibits RNA pol III transcription from both gene internal and gene external promoters using <italic>in vitro </italic>nuclear run on and RNA protection assays. We have confirmed that over expression of the TFIIB family members Brf1 and Brf2 alleviate Maf1 repression from gene internal and gene external RNA pol III promoters, respectively, suggesting that human Maf1 exerts its repressional activity, at least in part, through the TFIIIB complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We have further identified a mechanism by which Maf1 represses U6 transcription by identifying a physical association, using co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, with the TFIIIB subunit Brf2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, Reina et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref> were not able to detect a physical association between Maf1 and Brf2, using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed/translated Brf2 and there was no mention if the authors had attempted to detect a Maf1 and Brf2 association using the co-immunoprecipitation assay utilized to discern the Brf1 and RPC1 interaction with Maf1.</p><p>Although a role for Maf1 repressing human RNA pol III transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> has been recently demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, our work presents further insight into the mechanism of repression <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that interactions with the TFIIIB components Brf1 and Brf2 also play a role. Potentially, the interaction of Maf1 with Brf2 may be weaker than that with Brf1.</p><p>It is currently unclear whether phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of human Maf1 plays a critical role in the regulation of RNA pol III in a manner similar to that observed in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. We also provide in this report evidence that human Maf1 is a phosphoprotein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). It has yet to be discerned if the human homologs of the PP2A, PKA and Pkc1 will play similar roles in regulating human Maf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. Using the NetPhos prediction software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, we have identified putative phosphorylation sites in Maf1 for PKC, PKA, Akt, Clk2, CK1, CK2, GSK3, CDC2, and Erk1, potentially placing Maf1 in a wide variety of signal transduction pathways, allowing Maf1 to transduce signals and thereby regulating RNA pol III transcription under a variety of growth conditions. As there are at least two forms of human TFIIIB, each requiring a different TFIIB family member for initiation from gene internal (Brf1) and gene external (Brf2) promoters; it is plausible that these different kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) may exert differential effects on these different TFIIB family members.</p><p>The generation of the <italic>in vivo</italic> FlagMaf1 construct and the characterization of an <italic>in vivo </italic>RNA pol III luciferase assay will be invaluable tools to help elucidate the signal transduction pathways Maf1 interacts with to exert its regulation on RNA pol III transcription.</p><p>Finally, the characterization of an <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA polymerase III luciferase assay provides an advantage to study the mechanisms of both gene &#x02013;internal and &#x02013;external RNA pol III transcription in intact mammalian cells. This assay will allow us to monitor RNA pol III activity under a variety of conditions, including: DNA damage, oxidative stress, mitogenic stimulus, and environmental toxins. This methodology will become an invaluable tool to rapidly screen compounds for their ability to inhibit or stimulate RNA pol III transcription. Thus, this RNA pol III luciferase assay could be used as a high through put screening method to identify and characterize pharmacological compounds capable of inhibiting deregulated cellular growth, a hallmark trait in variety of cancers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. Chris Bazinet, St. John's University for reagents.
