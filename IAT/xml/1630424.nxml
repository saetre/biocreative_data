There is a lack of effective drugs for its treatment and in some cases the pain is resistant to the strongest analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hyperexcitability of damaged sensory neurons, as a result of injury to and/or demyelination of their peripheral axons, is thought to initiate the processes that lead to most neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Hyper-excitable neurons can fire spontaneously, causing spontaneous pain, or become hypersensitive to otherwise innocuous mechanical and thermal stimuli giving rise to allodynia (noxious responses to innocuous stimuli) and hyperalgesia (increased perception of noxious stimuli) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Injured sensory neurons undergo major changes in gene expression that have been catalogued in microarray studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Altered expression of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), which underlie the electrical excitability of nerve and muscle, has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Ectopic activity in damaged neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and neuropathic pain behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] have been shown to be sensitive to the VGSC blocker, Tetrodotoxin (TTX). Sensory neurons express multiple subtypes of TTX-sensitive and TTX-resistant VGSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 subunits is down-regulated, whereas only Na<sub>v</sub>1.3, a TTX-sensitive channel, is up-regulated following peripheral nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 is expressed throughout the embryonic nervous system but is down-regulated in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Coinciding with the re-expression of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 channel in injured neurons, the voltage-gated sodium currents recover from inactivation fourfold faster than that in uninjured neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This is thought to be a direct result of expression of Nav1.3 as it possesses similar inactivation kinetics when expressed in cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Rapid recovery from inactivation could allow damaged nerves to fire at higher frequencies than otherwise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that mis-expression of VGSCs and in particular the re-expression of Nav1.3 is an important factor contributing to the hyperexcitability of injured neurons. Several pieces of evidence support this hypothesis. Firstly, the ectopic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and mechanical allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] associated with nerve injury has been shown to be sensitive to TTX. Secondly, Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which reverses neuropathic pain behaviour, reverses Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 up-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Finally, intrathecal administration of antisense oligonucleotides directed against Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 mRNA reverses neuropathic pain behaviour and restores the inactivation kinetics of VGSC to that of uninjured neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 is a good target for analgesic drug development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, a recent study using a different antisense oligonucleotide sequence directed against Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 failed to reverse neuropathic pain behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Here we describe the generation of 3 Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 mutant mouse lines to test the hypothesis that Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 has a causative role in nerve-injury-induced chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our data shows, contrary to expectation, that Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 is neither responsible nor necessary for ectopic activity and neuropathic pain behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We used a genetic approach to investigate the contribution of Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 to setting pain thresholds, to the hyperexcitability of injured neurons and neuropathic pain behaviour in mice. We generated a floxed Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 mouse, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a&#x02013;b</xref>) and used a deletor mouse strain expressing Cre recombinase before E4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to generate a conventional global null mutant (Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 KO), (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). To confirm deletion of Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 we used RT-PCR to amplify sequences between exons 2 and 10, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>. Sequencing of the PCR product from the Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 KO brain confirmed the deletion of 221 bp representing the floxed exons 4 and 5, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>).

Rapid recovery from inactivation could allow damaged nerves to fire at higher frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

We therefore measured ectopic discharges from teased fibres of the damaged (L5) and spared (L4) 24 hours after surgery in Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 KO and WT mice. L5 spinal nerve ligation induces spontaneous activity in L4 as well as L5 myelinated fibres, though the percentage of active neurons in mouse appears to be less than that in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The percentage of spontaneously active fibres from L5 DRG was three fold higher than that from L4 DRG, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), which is similar to earlier results in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Mice in both conditional knockout strains developed a profound mechanical allodynia soon after surgery that was not different from that of littermate controls (floxed Na<sub>v</sub>1.3), (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>), confirming our results using the conventional global KO. We conclude that Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 does not play a critical role in either the induction or maintenance of neuropathic pain behaviour.</p><p>Our results can be explained as follows; the level of Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 expression in sensory neurons following injury is estimated to increase by about 1.4&#x02013;2 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] which is still very small considering the almost undetectable level of Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 in adult sensory neurons. Thus the increase in sodium currents due to the up-regulated Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 is unlikely to be significant in comparison to the total sodium current before injury. The reported fast kinetics of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 current [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] suggests that the qualitative aspect of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 up-regulation may be more important than the quantitative one. Our results using the global Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 KO rule out this in stimulus-evoked neuropathic pain. This is because Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 is deleted in all cell types regardless of the extent to which they up-regulate Na<sub>v</sub>1.3, the type of cells involved (small vs large sensory neurons and DRG vs central neurons) and the sub-cellular localization of Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 (somata vs terminals). Furthermore, although some antisense studies suggest a causal role for Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 in neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the specificity of the oligonucleotides used is not absolute (of 21 bases 15 are identical to Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, 17 to Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 and 14 to Na<sub>v</sub>1.6), and another antisense study using different specific oligonucleotides has failed to confirm these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sodium channels and neuropathic pain</title><p>The role of VGSCs in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain has recently come under increasing scrutiny. Changes in neuronal hyperexcitability have not been found to correlate with changes in sodium currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of non-subtype selective sodium channel blockers in treating neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] has stimulated the search for a specific underlying sodium channel subunit against which, more potent and selective analgesics can be developed. It seems likely, however, that no single sodium channel is specifically associated with neuronal hyperexcitability in damaged nerves, but that aberrant expression of high densities of sodium channels at the damaged terminals of sensory neurons may result in hyperexcitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In support of this we have recently shown that neither Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 nor 1.8 is necessary for the development of neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 null mutants have also been shown to develop neuropathic pain normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. By contrast, it is clear that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 plays a major role in the development of inflammatory pain and subtype specific channel blockers directed against this channel may be desirable for the treatment of inflammatory pain.</p><p>The role in neuropathic pain pathogenesis of the other major VGSC subunits in DRG, Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, remains to be investigated. Because of their relative abundance it is expected that deletion of these subunits may not have a specific effect on neuropathic pain. Almost certainly the usefulness of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 or Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 blockers in treating neuropathic pain will be greatly undermined by their broad expression in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neuropathic pain may be more amenable to local treatment with broad-spectrum sodium channel blockers, rather than those targeted at a specific sodium channel subunit such as Na<sub>v</sub>1.3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of floxed Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 mouse</title><p>An RCPI-22 129S6/SvEvTac mouse BAC library was screened using a probe representing exons 4&#x02013;12. DNA from positive BAC clones was prepared and subcloned into pBluescript (BS-SKII-). Three subclones were obtained that covered Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 sequences from exon 2&#x02013;8. The construct was prepared in three steps. Firstly, the 3' arm, Neomycin cassette and one LoxP site were cloned together as follows; two oligonucleotides were cloned in BS-SKII- to form new cloning sites. One LoxP site was cloned as an EcoRI-PstI fragment from PLneo vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The 3' arm was cloned as ClaI-BamHI 7 Kb fragment. Neomycin cassette was cloned as BamHI-SalL fragment from Py6.0 plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Secondly, the 5' arm, one LoxP and the floxed exons were cloned together as follows; 7 kb fragment ClaI-SacI was cloned in BS-SKII-. A LoxP site was inserted into the BsmBI site of the genomic fragment through blunt ligation. Finally, the two halves above were cloned into a vector containing the Thymidine-Kinase (TK) cassette as follows; the 3' side was prepared as Not-ClaI fragment, the 5' side was prepared as ClaI-SacII fragment and the TK containing vector was prepared as Not-SacII fragment. All were ligated together in the same tube. Positive clones were confirmed by restriction digests and sequencing. Blastocyst injection was performed by Monica Mendelson (Colombia University). Chimeras were crossed to C57BL/6 and germ line transmission tested using Southern blotting of tail DNA derived from F1 offspring. F1 heterozygotes were crossed to FLPe deletor animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] to excise the positive selection marker.</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioural analysis</title><p>All tests were approved by the United Kingdom Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

Formalin test: 20 &#x003bc;l of 5% formalin (37% formaldehyde (BDH) diluted with 0.9% saline (Sigma)) was injected subcutaneously into the plantar aspect of a hind-paw using a Hamilton syringe and 27 g needle and animals were placed in a 20 &#x000d7; 20 &#x000d7; 20 cm Plexiform chamber. The amount of time spent licking or biting the injected paw was then recorded in 5 minute periods over the next hour. Animals were habituated to the test environment for at least 1 hr before experiments were started. Activity during the first phase, from 0&#x02013;10 mins, and the second phase, from 10&#x02013;60 mins, was then calculated for each animal.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of Neuropathic pain</title><p>Neuropathic pain was induced according to the Chung Model (ligation of spinal nerve L5).

The animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were removed and enzymatically dissociated (Dispase/collagenase; Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK). The isolated and pooled DRG neurons were plated onto poly-L-lysine coated glass coverslips and maintained in culture for 1&#x02013;2 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology and solutions</title><p>Conventional voltage-clamp recordings in the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration were made from neurones of varying sizes (corresponding to small and medium sized neurons with a maximum apparent diameter of 43 &#x003bc;m) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, California, USA) driven from a PC generating pulse protocols (Pclamp 9, Axon Instruments). The neuronal capacitance was estimated through the procedure of capacity transient cancellation, soon after attaining the whole-cell configuration. Electrodes were made from thin-walled glass (Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent, UK) and had an initial resistance of between 1.5 and 2 M&#x003a9; when filled with intracellular solution. Series-resistance compensation was set near 70% with a nominal feed-back lag of 12 ms. Recordings were filtered at 5 KHz (4-pole Bessel filter) and sampled at 10 KHz. Recordings were made at room temperature.</p><p>TTX-s and TTX-r Na<sup>+ </sup>currents were recorded in relative isolation by including pharmacological blockers of both K<sup>+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>currents in both extracellular and intracellular media. In order to distinguish TTX-s and TTX-r currents, recordings were made before and after the addition of 250 nM TTX to the extracellular solution, where the TTX-s component was subsequently derived by off-line analysis using digital subtraction. The extracellular solution contained (in mM): NaCl 43.3, Tetraethylammonium Chloride 96.7, HEPES 10, CaCl<sub>2 </sub>2.1, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>2.12, 4-Aminopyridine 0.5, CsCl 10, KCl 7.5, CdCl<sub>2 </sub>0.1. The intracellular solution contained (in mM): CsCl 130, CsF 13, EGTA (Na) 3, Tetraethylammonium Chloride 10, HEPES 10, CaCl<sub>2 </sub>1.21, ATP(Mg) 3 mM, GTP (Li) 500 &#x003bc;M. External and internal solutions were buffered to pH 7.2&#x02013;7.3 with the addition of CsOH. Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 250 nM) was locally applied and removed by gravity fed superfusion. The reagents, with the exception of TTX, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK). TTX was purchased from Alomone Labs (TCS Biologicals, Botolph Claydon, Bucks, UK).</p><p>In order to derive current density measurements, peak Na<sup>+ </sup>currents were recorded in response to a family of incrementing, depolarizing clamp-steps, filtered at 5 KHz (4-pole Bessel filter) and normally sampled at 20 KHz. The holding potential was -80 mV, and the clamp-steps were preceded by a 20 ms pre-pulse. These values of membrane potential, coupled with the presence of internal F<sup>-</sup>, were not optimal for recording TTX-r persistent Na<sup>+ </sup>current, and the TTX-r currents analysed always exhibited the voltage-dependent and kinetic characteristics of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8. Current density estimates were found by dividing the peak-current values by the value estimated for membrane capacitance. TTX-s current amplitudes were found by off-line digital subtraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Recording of spontaneously active fibres</title><p>At defined time points after L5 spinal nerve ligation mice were anaesthetised via a brief induction with isofluorane gas followed by an i.p. injection of pentobarbitone (100 mg/kg). A lumbar laminectomy was performed and the L4 and L5 dorsal roots were identified and cut close to the spinal cord. Both the ventral roots and the L4 spinal nerve were cut as far distally as possible and then the dorsal roots, ventral roots, DRGs and spinal nerves (in continuity) from L4 and L5 were carefully and quickly removed. Throughout the process of dissection the tissue was kept hydrated by regularly applying oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) aCSF solution (in millimolar: NaCl 118; KCl 4.7; MgSO<sub>4 </sub>1.2; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>1.2; NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>25; CaCl 2.5 and glucose 11) to the preparation. The tissue was then kept in oxygenated aCSF at room temperature for 30 minutes before the start of electrophysiological recording. The peripheral nerve preparations were mounted in a two chamber recording bath with the spinal nerve and DRG on one side continuously perfused with oxygenated aCSF at a rate of 10 ml/min. This solution was kept at 35 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C by running the perfusion tube through a jacket containing water heated and circulated by a thermostatically controlled water bath. The dorsal and ventral roots were sealed in the other chamber and covered in mineral oil which had been previously oxygenated with an air tube. Oil in this chamber was periodically replaced to maintain hydration and oxygenation of the dorsal root. A leak-proof partition barrier of perspex and high-vacuum grease ensured electrical isolation from the other compartment. For the purposes of electrical stimulation the end of the spinal nerve was taken up into a suction electrode with bipolar silver/silver chloride wires. Fine filaments were teased from the dorsal root using sharpened watchmakers forceps. These strands were placed over electrodes made of sliver wire coated with teflon that had been stripped away from the tip. A crushed strand from the ventral root was placed across another silver wire electrode to act as an indifferent recording. Signals from the electrodes were passed through a head-stage which was also connected to earth. From here the signal was amplified and filtered (low pass 500 Hz, high pass 5 KHz) using Neurolog equipment (Digitimer, UK). Residual 50 Hz noise was removed with a Humbug noise eliminator (Quest Scientific, Canada). The signal was viewed on a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, USA) and also recorded for off-line analysis (Powerlab and Chart 5 software, ADI instruments, UK).</p><p>Spontaneously active units were recorded in both the L5 and L4 dorsal roots. In strands with multiple ectopically firing units separation was achieved on the basis of differing amplitude, action potential shape and interspike interval. The number of conducting fibres in each strand was determined by incremental electrical stimulation of the spinal nerve whilst observing the recruitment of units on a storage oscilloscope (Gould, UK). Strands that were studied typically contained a total of 8 to 12 conducting units and around 50 to 60 units were sampled from each dorsal root. The proportion of spontaneously active units in each preparation was calculated as a percentage and then a mean obtained for all data in a group with n representing a single L4 or L5 root taken from one animal. A large proportion of units observed firing spontaneously did so in a bursting manner and so further analysis of these patterns was undertaken using specialised software (Spike 2, Cambridge Electronic Design, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Unpaired t-test was used to compare data unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Wellcome trust and the MRC for their support.
