We describe here a novel post-transcriptional block in HIV-1 gene expression in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from patients on HAART. This block involves the aberrant localization of multiply spliced (MS) HIV-1 RNAs encoding the critical positive regulators Tat and Rev. Although these RNAs had no previously described export defect, we show that they exhibit strict nuclear localization in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from patients on HAART. Overexpression of the transcriptional activator Tat from non-HIV vectors allowed virus production in these cells. Thus, the nuclear retention of MS HIV-1 RNA interrupts a positive feedback loop and contributes to the non-productive nature of infection of resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. To define the mechanism of nuclear retention, proteomic analysis was used to identify proteins that bind MS HIV-1 RNA. Polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) was identified as an HIV-1 RNA-binding protein differentially expressed in resting and activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Overexpression of PTB in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from patients on HAART allowed cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV-1 RNAs. PTB overexpression also induced virus production by resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Virus culture experiments showed that overexpression of PTB in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from patients on HAART allowed release of replication-competent virus, while preserving a resting cellular phenotype. Whether through effects on RNA export or another mechanism, the ability of PTB to reverse latency without inducing cellular activation is a result with therapeutic implications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>HIV-1 has the ability to establish a state of latent infection in resting memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. These latently infected cells represent a stable reservoir for the virus that is a major barrier to viral eradication. Understanding how this reservoir is established, maintained, and reactivated is essential for developing methods to target and eliminate these cells. Currently, many proposed mechanisms of HIV-1 latency involve a dramatic reduction in ongoing HIV-1 transcription. However, some HIV-1 mRNAs are made, and it has been unclear why the cells are unable to produce virus. This study describes the surprising observation that mRNAs encoding the viral regulatory proteins Tat and Rev are retained in the nucleus of infected resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. A cellular HIV-1 RNA-binding protein called polypyrimidine tract binding protein was shown to reverse latency when overexpressed in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. This overexpression of polypyrimidine tract binding protein was sufficient to allow release of replication-competent HIV-1 from latently infected cells without inducing cellular stimulation. These experiments suggest that multiple factors contribute to the maintenance of HIV-1 latency in vivo; however, perturbation of the level of a specific cellular protein is sufficient to overcome these blocks and allow for virus production.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lassen KG, Ramyar KX, Bailey JR, Zhou Y, Siliciano RF (2006) Nuclear retention of multiply spliced HIV-1 RNA in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.

The rest contain defective or permanently silenced viral genomes. Mechanistic studies of latency are thus complicated by the fact that latently infected cells (cells capable of releasing replication-competent virus) represent only a small fraction of the cells carrying HIV-1 DNA, which in turn represent only a small fraction of the resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell population. Mechanistic studies of HIV-1 latency must be interpreted with these caveats in mind.

We describe here a post-transcriptional block in the export of MS HIV-1 RNA that may prevent this positive feedback loop. In addition, we identify a host protein which, when overexpressed in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, can reverse latency without inducing cellular activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Nuclear Localization of MS HIV-1 RNA in Resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T Cells</title><p>In vivo, latent viral genomes are found in G<sub>0</sub> resting memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Because latency may involve aspects of the unique physiology of these profoundly quiescent cells, it is best analyzed using primary resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from infected individuals rather than transformed cell lines. However, the analysis of latency in primary cells is complicated by the fact that only a small fraction of the cells harboring HIV-1 DNA in vivo can be induced to produce infectious virus upon cellular activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The remaining cells may carry defective viruses. In the molecular analysis of HIV-1 DNA or RNA species in primary cell populations, it is not generally possible to distinguish replication-competent from defective forms. Replication-competence can only be established in separate virus outgrowth experiments. By combining data from these two approaches, inferences can be made about the biology of the small subpopulation of cells that harbor replication-competent virus.</p><p>We first analyzed the distribution of the bulk population of HIV-1 RNA molecules in highly purified populations of resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from patients on suppressive HAART regimens. Both MS and US HIV-1 mRNAs can be detected in these cells with sensitive methods &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. To understand why the presence of MS HIV-1 mRNA does not lead to Tat-mediated positive feedback amplification of virus gene expression and virus production, we first examined the subcellular localization of HIV-1 RNA in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Nuclear, cytoplasmic, and total RNA fractions were isolated from resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and an ultra-sensitive hemi-nested RT-PCR was performed on each fraction. US HIV-1 mRNAs, which have an export defect in the absence of high levels of the HIV-1 Rev protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, were retained in the nucleus of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Surprisingly, MS HIV-1 mRNAs, not previously known to have an export defect, were also exclusively nuclear in localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The same result was observed in ten patients; both US and MS HIV-1 RNAs were detected only in the nuclear fraction of primary resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.</p><p>Unspliced and spliced glyceraldehhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs were also amplified from these fractions in order to determine the quality of the nuclear-cytoplasmic separation, as well as the integrity of the isolated RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). As expected, unspliced GAPDH RNA was localized to the nucleus while the majority of spliced GAPDH mRNA was localized to the cytoplasm of resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. This confirms the efficacy of the cell fractionation, and further demonstrates that the aberrant localization of HIV-1 RNA is not due to a global defect in RNA export in these cells. Whether the RNA localization patterns observed in bulk populations of resting cells from infected donors are characteristic of the tiny fraction of cells harboring latent, replication-competent HIV-1 genomes cannot be determined from this analysis.</p><p>To determine whether nuclear localization of HIV-1 RNA is altered in response to T-cell stimulation, purified resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for various times and then fractionated. Both MS and US HIV-1 RNAs were localized exclusively to the nucleus until 48 to 72 h following stimulation when cytoplasmic HIV-1 RNAs were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The appearance of HIV-1 RNA in the cytoplasm preceded the release of virus particles into the supernatant by 24&#x02013;48 h &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of MS HIV-1 RNA-Binding Proteins in Resting and Activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T Cells</title><p>The aberrant nuclear localization of MS HIV-1 mRNAs in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could be due to the presence of a negative regulator or the absence of a positive export factor.

Recombinant PTB bound MS HIV-1 RNA and was released upon RNase digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The binding was blocked by pre-incubation of PTB with increasing amounts of non-biotinylated MS HIV-1 RNA. Binding of PTB decreased progressively with increasing ratios of non-biotinylated to biotinylated MS HIV-1 RNA. PTB binding was not decreased by a 5-fold mass excess of total yeast RNA, a non-specific competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>To determine whether differences in PTB levels in resting and activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells might be involved in the observed export defect, we first measured steady-state levels of PTB protein in purified primary resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated, activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Quantitative Western analyses indicated that PTB expression increases by at least 4.5-fold upon cell stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). PTB has four known isoforms generated by alternative splicing. Three variants produce bands of 57&#x02013;59 kDa, while the fourth variant of PTB has an apparent molecular weight of 25 kDa. Only the larger isoforms were upregulated following cellular stimulation, while total levels of the 25-kDa isoform (PTBT) decreased upon cellular stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PTB Overexpression Is Sufficient to Cause Virus Production by Resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T Cells from Infected Individuals</title><p>The direct binding of PTB to MS HIV-1 RNA, and the differential regulation of PTB isoforms with T-cell stimulation, suggested that PTB might act as a positive factor for HIV-1 gene expression.

At 72 h post-transfection, an ultra-sensitive RT-PCR assay was employed to detect the low levels of virions released into the supernatants of these cultures. In cells transfected with empty vector or PTBT, the amount of virus released was often below the limit of detection (&#x0003c;50 copies of HIV-1 RNA/ml), although occasionally a mock-treated sample would yield a very low-level positive value for HIV-1 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Because an undetectable viral RNA measurement could represent low levels of virus production and not an actual zero, we considered an undetectable viral load as equivalent to 50 copies/ml when calculating release. The low positive values may represent non-specific stimulation due to in vitro culture. Cells transfected with PTB or PTB ser-ala showed a dramatic (100- to 10,000-fold) upregulation of virus production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).

To confirm this notion, PTB- and mock-transfected cells were fractionated and assessed for nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of HIV-1 RNAs.

In fact, HIV-1 latency may not have a single mechanism but rather may result from the combined effects of incomplete blocks at multiple steps in the virus life cycle. This study defines a previously unrecognized block in virus gene expression that is unique to resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and that may be relevant to latency. Specifically, we show that MS HIV-1 RNAs are retained in the nucleus of resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. This block is particularly important because it is positioned so as to interrupt a critical positive feedback loop driven by HIV-1 Tat. We also show that overexpression of nuclear forms of the RNA-binding protein PTB can overcome this block by directly or indirectly promoting the nuclear export of HIV-1 RNAs in a manner that does not induce T-cell activation.</p><p>It is clear that HIV-1 latency is due at least in part to mechanisms that affect transcriptional initiation and elongation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b029">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b043">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;.

Since Tat acts downstream of transcriptional initiation, the failure of resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from patients on HAART to produce virus may not be the result of a general inaccessibility of integrated proviruses to the transcriptional machinery. This conclusion is consistent with recent studies of sites of HIV-1 integration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;, which are generally located within introns of active cellular genes. Taken together, these results indicate that some initiation of HIV-1 transcription does occur in infected resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and thus additional blocks operating downstream of transcriptional initiation must contribute to the absence of virion production.</p><p>One of the most important factors in the failure of infected resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to produce virions is likely to be the premature transcriptional termination resulting from the absence of Tat and associated cellular factors required for processive transcription from the HIV-1 LTR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b043">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.

Since these mRNAs should give rise to the positive regulatory factors Tat and Rev, it is important to understand why no positive feedback upregulation of HIV-1 gene expression occurs.</p><p>To address this question, we examined the subcellular localization of MS and US HIV-1 RNAs in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from patients on HAART. Both species of HIV-1 RNA were localized to the nucleus of these cells. The finding that MS HIV-1 mRNAs remain in the nucleus of resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells has not been previously reported. This result is important because it helps to explain why positive feedback does not occur and defines an additional block at the post-transcriptional level, which prevents expression of all viral protein products. This post-transcriptional block does not appear to be a global defect in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and is specific to HIV-1 RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020068-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>To understand the nature of this block, a proteomic screen for proteins binding MS HIV-1 RNA was performed using a robust approach that successfully identified many proteins previously known to bind HIV-1 RNA or to be general RNA-binding proteins. PTB was studied as a potential positive modulator of HIV-1 gene expression due to its ability to bind MS HIV-1 RNA as well as its differential regulation in resting and activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. When overexpressed in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from patients on HAART, PTB was sufficient to allow for high-level virus production without inducing cellular stimulation. This effect was specific to PTB, as other known HIV-1 RNA-binding proteins tested had no effect on virus production. The effect was also specific to nuclear forms of PTB as overexpression of PTBT, a cytoplasmic isoform, had no effect on virus production.</p><p>The delineation of this export block required the analysis of HIV-1 gene expression in primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Although many elegant studies of latency have been carried out in transformed cell lines, these cells do not fully recapitulate the profoundly quiescent G<sub>0</sub> state of the resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that harbor latent HIV-1 in vivo. This block was not detected previously because few studies have examined the localization of HIV-1 RNAs in primary resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, cells in which the levels of nuclear forms of PTB are low. Interestingly, the block can be overcome by overexpression of Tat from a non-HIV vector. In this situation, Tat-mediated upregulation of transcriptional elongation allows virus production. Thus, it may be that the nuclear export block observed in resting cells is saturable, or that it can be overcome when levels of HIV-1 transcripts increase beyond a threshold value. Partial knockdown of PTB in activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells did not affect virus production. Thus, the clinical significance of this finding is likely to be in novel approaches for inducing virus gene expression in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-infected cells (purging the latent reservoir) rather than in inhibiting virus production by fully activated cells.</p><p>Delineation of the mechanism for the nuclear retention of MS HIV-1 RNA in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and of the PTB reversal of this block, remains to be accomplished and may require the development of a more tractable system where levels of HIV-1 RNA can be more easily modulated. The nuclear retention of MS HIV-1 RNAs in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells may result from inefficient transcription by RNA pol II complexes that are not properly phosphorylated on the C-terminal domain due to the absence of Tat and associated host factors. This inefficient transcription could result in improper processing of the nascent HIV-1 mRNAs. Although HIV-1 mRNAs in resting cells appear functional by sequence analysis, assembly of downstream cellular RNA export factors may be disrupted, resulting in nuclear retention of these RNAs. PTB binds MS HIV-1 RNA and acts post-transcriptionally to overcome this obstacle and therefore allows for virus production. Whether the PTB-mediated reversal of HIV-1 latency is a direct consequence of PTB binding to HIV-1 RNA remains to be determined. Indeed, it is not possible to assert from the results presented here that PTB reverses HIV-1 latency by allowing the nuclear export of MS HIV-1 RNA. It is clear that PTB overexpression can alter the distribution of the majority of HIV-1 RNAs in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell populations from patients on HAART. It is also clear that PTB overexpression can induce latently infected cells in these populations to release replication-competent virus. However, it remains formally possible that these are two separate effects. In other words, PTB may be altering the distribution of HIV-1 RNAs in the majority of infected resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells but reversing latency through a separate, as yet unidentified mechanism. Despite this caveat, it remains clear that PTB can induce the release of replication-competent virus from resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.</p><p>Efforts to eliminate a latent reservoir have focused on strategies that induce some level of T-cell activation in order to render cells permissive for HIV-1 gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

The resulting RNA was incubated with an equimolar amount of a biotinylated oligo-dT probe coupled to streptavidin magnetic particles (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The RNA-coated beads were incubated with lyastes (50 &#x003bc;g) of purified resting or activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. RNA-binding proteins were identified by PAGE MS/MS using the mass spectrometry facility of Dr. Bill Lane at Harvard Medical School. For recombinant protein binding assays, 50 ng of protein was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Recombinant proteins.</title><p>cDNA encoding full-length PTB isoform 1 (kind gift of S. Bouyain and B. Geisbrecht) was cloned into the pT7 vector, which encodes an N-terminal poly-histidine tag followed by a Tobacco Etch Virus cleavage site. Recombinant protein was expressed in Rosetta pLysS expression hosts (EMD Biosciences), and soluble protein was purified using nickel-loaded Chelating Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The partially purified protein was cleaved using recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen), and fully cleaved protein from a reverse IMAC purification was further purified to near homogeneity using a Superdex S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined using the UV spectroscopy at 278 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Antibodies, Western blots, and immunofluorescence.</title><p>Anti-PTB was obtained from Zymed (San Francisco, California, United States). For Western blots, a 1:350 dilution of antibody was used, and for immunofluorescence, a 1:250 dilution was used. Both La and hnRNPA1 antibodies were used at a concentration of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml for Western blots. 20 &#x003bc;g of total protein were loaded per lane for Western blots. For immunofluorescence, AlexoFluor596 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States) was used as a secondary reagent according to manufacturer's protocol. OregonGreen 488 phalloidin was used for actin staining according to manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes). Nuclear staining was performed with DAPI (Molecular Probes) using ProLong Gold antifade reagent. Images were taken using a Perkin Elmer (Wellesley, Massachusetts, United States) UltraVIEW Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>T-cell purification and transfections.</title><p>Resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were isolated through a two-step purification procedure as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;.

Transfections were performed using an Amaxa Nucleofector. 2&#x02013;4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> purified CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were re-suspended in 100 &#x003bc;l/10<sup>6</sup> cell in nucleofector solution and transfected using program U-14. The number of cells used depended on the number of cells obtained after purification. Cells were cultured in 1.5 ml medium after transfection. For a given patient, the number of cells used was identical for each condition. For each transfection, 2.5 &#x003bc;g of empty vector or plasmid with PTB, PTBS-A, PTBT, or pcDNA-TAT-86 was transfected with 2.5 &#x003bc;g of plasmid phMGFP (Promega). GFP expression served as a control for transfection efficiency. For RNA-turnover experiments, &#x003b1;-amanitin was added to medium at a final concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml 24 h after transfection. Total RNA was isolated at various time points after &#x003b1;-amanitin addition. PTB and PTBT were cloned from PBMC cDNA using the following primers: 5&#x02032;ACGCGTCGACAATGGACGGCATTGTCCCAGATATAGCC3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;ATAGAATGCGGCCGCCTAGATGGTGGACTTGGAGAAGG3&#x02032;. PCR products were cloned using SalI and NotI restriction sites into the pCI-neo mammalian expression vector (Promega). PTB ser-ala was made by direct mutagenesis of serine16 to alanine in the PTB expression vector. pcDNA-TAT-86 was a gift from Dr. Avi Nath (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>T-cell co-culture.</title><p>To isolate replication competent viruses from latently infected cells after PTB transfection, transfected cells were co-cultured with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphoblasts from uninfected donors as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020068-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.
