Within the epithelium are ciliated sensory neurons, supporting cells, basal cells and microvillous cells, each of which is distinct in morphology and function. Arguably, the least understood, are the microvillous cells, a population of cells that are small in number and whose function is not known. We previously found that in a mouse strain in which the TRPM5 promoter drives expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), a population of ciliated olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), as well as a population of cells displaying microvilli-like structures is labeled. Here we examined the morphology and immunocytochemical properties of these microvillous-like cells using immunocytochemical methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that the GFP-positive microvillous cells were morphologically diversified and scattered throughout the entire MOE. These cells immunoreacted to an antibody against TRPM5, confirming the expression of this ion channel in these cells. In addition, they showed a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated non-selective cation current in electrophysiological recordings. They did not immunoreact to antibodies that label cell markers and elements of the transduction pathways from olfactory sensory neurons and solitary chemosensory cells of the nasal cavity. Further, the TRPM5-expressing cells did not display axon-like processes and were not labeled with a neuronal marker nor did trigeminal peptidergic nerve fibers innervate these cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We provide morphological and immunocytochemical characterization of the TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells in the main olfactory epithelium. Our data demonstrate that these cells are non-neuronal and in terms of chemosensory transduction do not resemble the TRPM5-expressing olfactory sensory neurons and nasal solitary chemosensory cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The peripheral olfactory epithelium in mammal is made up of four types of cells, ciliated olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), basal cells, supporting cells and microvillious cells, which together form a pseudostratified epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The olfactory sensory neurons are specialized in detecting diverse odor molecules and transmitting information to the olfactory bulb through their axonal projections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mature OSNs are ciliated bipolar neurons, with cell bodies that are located in the middle layers of the epithelium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Each of the mature OSNs sends an apical dendrite to the luminal surface where the dendrite terminates in an oval structure, the olfactory knob, bearing approximately 20 cilia where olfactory receptor proteins and the elements of the olfactory transduction cascade are localized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A single axon protruding from the basal end of the soma of the OSN penetrates the basal lamina and projects to the olfactory bulb[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The supporting cells and basal cells are not sensory cells. The supporting cells also called sustentacular cells are columnar in shape. Their cell bodies span the entire basal to apical extent of the epithelium. Their apical end is covered with long or short microvilli and their somata are located in the superficial layer of the epithelium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Sustentacular cells are thought to serve a supporting role akin to that of glial cells in the brain. The basal cells, including both globose and horizontal cells, reside basally just above the basal lamina. Amongst these there are olfactory stem cells, capable of regenerating other types of cells in the epithelium throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, OSNs, supporting cells and basal cells are distinct in morphology and function.</p><p>In contrast, the function of microvillous cells of the mammalian OE is not well understood and they appear to be morphologically diverse. Electron microscopic studies have revealed that their apical microvilli can take different shapes, lengths, and diameters while their cytoplasm can be either electro-lucent or opaque[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Some microvillar cells have been reported to project thin axons to the olfactory bulb, suggesting a second class of bipolar sensory neurons in the olfactory mucosa[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the presence of axonal processes is questioned in other studies where surveys with epithelial markers indicate that at least some microvillar cells in the OE are not of neuronal origin and do not bear axonal processes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. One possibility emerging from these studies is that there are several different types of microvillar cells, some neuronal and others epithelial in nature.</p><p>Arguably the best characterized microvillous cells are those found in the OE of fish where they act as sensory receptors that respond to water-borne odors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Recent studies have indicated that some microvillous cells in the olfactory epithelium of mammals are chemosensitive as well. Elsaesser et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]reported that a subset of microvillar cells express the transient receptor potential channel C6 and other elements of a phosphatidyl-inositide signaling pathway. These cells respond to odorants and appear to have thin axon-like processes although it is not clear whether they reach the olfactory bulb[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. More recently, we[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]provided evidence that TRPM5, an ion channel that is essentially for chemosensory transduction in taste cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], may be expressed in microvillar cells of the olfactory epithelium, suggesting that these cells are chemosensory. However, it is not yet known whether the TRPM5-expressing cells in the olfactory epithelium resemble OSNs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], solitary chemosensory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or taste receptor cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] in chemical sensing.</p><p>In a previous study we reported that in transgenic mice where the TRPM5 promoter drives the expression of GFP (TRPM5-GFP) a subset of short cells that appeared to be microvillar cells are GFP positive[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Here we use immunohistochemical methods to confirm the expression of TRPM5. We also utilize immunohistochemical methods to survey the expression of elements of the sensory transduction pathways in these microvillous-like cells. We find no expression of key transduction elements in these cells that resemble other TRPM5-expressing chemosensory cells. In a companion paper Hansen and Finger utilize electron microscopy to show that these short TRPM5-expressing cells that we call microvillous-like are indeed microvillar cells. Preliminary data has been presented in abstract forms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>GFP expression in microvillous-like cells in olfactory epithelia of TRPM5-GFP mice</title><p>Previously we reported on two distinct populations of cells in the olfactory epithelium that were GFP-positive in transgenic mice where the TRPM5 promoter drove the expression of GFP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. One population shows morphological and immunocytochemical characteristics of bipolar OSNs that reside preferentially in the lateral and ventral regions of the epithelium. In contrast, the other population of the GFP-expressing cells, which in general displayed stronger GFP expression, was found throughout the OE without apparent zonal segregation. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows an epi-fluorescence image taken of a whole mount preparation of the medial endo-turbinate of a TRPM5-GFP mouse. Because there are very few TRPM5-expressing OSNs in the medial surface of this region and because the GFP expression in the OSNs is weaker, individual GFP-expressing cells shown in the picture belong to the population of microvillous cells. A higher magnification photomicrograph is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. On average, there were 1158 &#x000b1; 205 per mm<sup>2 </sup>GFP-expressing microvillous-like cells in the OE (n = 3). Interestingly, these cells were largely confined to the sensory epithelium, and there were few such cells in the adjacent respiratory epithelium. This is in striking contrast to a distinct population of microvillar cells confined to the respiratory epithelium of the anterior nasal cavity (solitary chemosensory cells) that are thought to detect irritants[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>TRPM5 promoter-driven GFP expression in microvillous cells of the olfactory epithelium. </bold>Top left inset: a draw of a hemi-nose.

First, they were usually about 20 &#x003bc;m in length, shorter than OSNs and supporting cells and their shape varied from cell to cell resembling a flask, a bottle or a pear. Their somata were located in the superficial (apical) layer of the pseudostratified epithelium where the nuclei of supporting cells are located (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, arrowhead). Second, most of these GFP-expressing cells did not show dendritic knobs and cilia typical for the bipolar OSNs. Instead these cells showed microvilli-like processes in the apexes that displayed diverse morphology under light microscopy. In some experiments we used an anti-GFP antibody to intensify the GFP signal. Out of a total 82 cells scanned in a confocal microscope or examined, we found 58% cells showed relatively wavy processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), some with relatively fine apical processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). Eleven percent of the cells displayed a few thick processes that branched at their distal ends (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and inset for apical processes). Seventeen percent of the cells showed spreading and stiff apical processes, which could be straight and curved at their distal ends (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, G</xref> and insets). Twelve percent of the cells showed relatively short and stiff microvilli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Hansen and Finger (article in this issue) examined the apical processes using immunolabeling of a microvillus marker espin and electron microscopy. Their results show indeed GFP-expressing microvillous-like cells bear microvilli. In rare case (seven out of 2990 cells examined) we found spindle-like cells that had relatively large diameter basal processes. These cells usually displayed a cluster of apical weaving processes and their somata were located in the same superficial layer as the other short GFP cells described above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>). Third, unlike OSNs that displayed a thin axonal process extended below the basal lamina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), the TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells did not show axonal processes. In 2990 cells examined in coronal sections from three animals, none showed axons extending to the basal lamina, although about seven percent of the cells showed short basal process (arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Some cells only showed a potential initiation site of a basal process under the light microcopy (arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). The GFP positive microvillous cells thus are different from the microvillar cells that show slender axonal processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The lack of an axonal process was confirmed by electron microscopy (Hansen and Finger in this issue).</p></sec><sec><title>GFP-expressing microvillous cells are immunoreactive for TRPM5 and have a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated cation current</title><p>TRPM5 forms Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated cation channels in heterologous cells and taste receptors cells and is essential for normal taste sensation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Based on these results, it is likely that TRPM5 transduces a PLC signaling cascade, initiated by binding of tastants to G protein-coupled receptors, into an electrical response in taste cells. To determine whether TRPM5 is also expressed in microvillous cells in the OE, where it might have a similar function, we performed immunolabeling of sections of MOE with an antibody against the TRPM5[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The antibody labeled all the GFP-positive microvillous cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) in a pattern suggestive of plasma membrane expression of the TRPM5 channel. Controls consisted of the lack of fluorescence upon omission of the primary antibody or in MOE tissue sections from the olfactory epithelium of mice defective for TRPM5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>](Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). These results demonstrate that TRPM5, an ion channel known to be involved in chemical sensing was expressed in these microvillous cells.</p><p>To determine whether TRPM5 channels in microvillous cells are functional, we recorded from freshly dissociated GFP-labeled cells isolated from the olfactory epithelium of TRPM5-GFP transgenic mice. Cells were further chosen based on the presence of a stubby dendrite and obvious microvillar processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Note that in this preparation from septal olfactory epithelium, no GFP-positive ciliated OSNs were observed. With intracellular Cs<sup>+ </sup>in the pipette, step depolarizations revealed the presence of a voltage-activated Na<sup>+ </sup>current which activated at -50 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>). This current is also evident in recordings of responses to ramp depolarizations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). UV uncaging of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>activated a current of ~100 pA at +80 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D, E</xref>). This current was strongly outwardly rectifying (compare outward and inward currents in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> at times a and b), and therefore cannot be attributed to a change in the leak current across the patch. Interestingly, while the TRPM5-current recorded from mouse taste receptors cells was found to decay following activation by uv uncaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], this current was sustained. This suggests a possible difference in the inactivation of the channel in different cell types. The small magnitude of the current was consistent among all cells studied (n = 3) and could not be attributed to the UV uncaging protocol, which in control experiments generated a large response in HEK cells transfected with mTRPM5 (not shown). Thus a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated cation current is present in these microvillous cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Immunoreactivity of TRPM5 in GFP-expressing microvillous cells.</bold> A.

Most OSNs express the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit A2 (CNGA2), an ion channel subunit essential for odor-induced depolarization of OSNs through the canonical cAMP pathway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and consistent with a previous report[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the anti-CNGA2 antibody labeled the majority of OSNs. This antibody did not label the GFP-positive microvillous cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). In addition, there is a small subset of OSNs that do not express the CNGA2 and uses a different transduction pathway. These OSNs can be identified by PDE2A immunoreactivity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The anti-PDE2A antibody also failed to label any TRPM5-expressing microvillous-like cells (data not shown). Further, an antibody against the olfactory marker protein (OMP), a marker for mature OSNs that labeled the TRPM5 expressing OSNs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], failed to label microvillous-like cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D&#x02013;F</xref>). The absence of labeling of microvillar cells by the OMP antibody is consistent with a previous report[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

We conducted antigen retrieval and increased the concentration of antibodies but none of the treatments produced positive results.

Since there was no apparent axonal projection from the TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells, we investigated whether these cells receive trigeminal innvervation. Epithelial sections and strips were immunoreacted with antibodies against CGRP and substance P, two markers for the trigeminal peptidergic fibers. Most of the labeled nerve fibers were found in the basal lamina of the OE, with some processes traversing the epithelium proper. We found very few CGRP- (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) or substance P- (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) positive fibers close to the TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells. Most of the cells did not associate with immunoreactive fibers. Thus, in contrast with the innervated chemosensory cells in the respiratory epithelium, the microvillous cells display sporadic association with trigeminal fibers making it is unlikely that trigeminal peptidergic fibers carry signals from these microvillous cells. This observation is consistent with the results in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J&#x02013;L</xref>, where there is also no closely associated PGP 9.5-expressing nerve fibers coursing along or wrapping the GFP-positive microvillous cells, suggesting lack of nerve innervation of these cells in general.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Immunolabeling of trigeminal peptidergic fibers in the OE.</bold> A.

These TRPM5-expressing cells are located preferentially in the superficial layer and are scattered throughout the entire OE. Predominant morphological features include diversified apical microvilli and absence of an apparent axon. We confirmed the TRPM5 expression using transgenic mice and immunolabeling methods. Further, we showed that the TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells did not express the transduction components and markers of OSNS, CNGA2, OMP and PGP9.5, nor did they express PLC&#x003b2;2 or &#x003b1;-gustducin, which are present in many solitary chemosensory cells of the respiratory epithelium. Therefore, the microvillous TRPM5-expressing cells belong to a unique population of cells, different from other TRPM5-expressing OSNs and solitary chemosensory cells in morphology and in the expression of cell markers. The fact that TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells do not express elements of the transduction pathways from other chemoreceptors, do not have axonal processes evident under light microscopy (and under electron microscopy see accompanying article by Hansen and Finger) and are not innervated by the trigeminal peptidergic fibers calls into question the role of these TRPM5-expressing cells as chemoreceptors. Alternately, there is a possibility that these microvillous cells detect chemical stimuli and transmit their signal to surrounding cells (sustentacular and/or olfactory sensory neurons) through non-synaptic transmission. This would be analogous to type II taste cells that detect bitter and sweet compounds and transmit the signal through non-vesicular release of ATP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. If this is the case, transduction would have to be mediated by elements that we have not surveyed in this study.</p><sec><title>Microvillous cells in the olfactory epithelium</title><p>Microvillous cells have been discovered in the OE in a number of species[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Ultrastructural analyses have shown that the apical processes of microvillous cells can be rigid; finger-like; aligned in parallel with a more uniform diameter and length; more compacted forming a cone shape. Some microvilli reportedly are shorter resembling the brush cells in the respiratory epithelium, while some others resemble the hair cells in the cochlea[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Our study further demonstrates the diversity of apical processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Although it is not known whether the diversity of apical microvilli indicate functional specializations, expression of TRPM5 suggests that these cells may utilize a common signaling pathway.</p><p>In some microvillous cells, single slender axon-like processes that protrude from the basal regions of individual cells are clearly visible[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. When the cytochemical tracer macromolecule horseradish peroxidase is injected to the olfactory bulb, some microvillous cells are backfilled. The result demonstrates axonal projection and suggests that as found in fish, there is a second type of olfactory sensory neuron bearing microvilli, with distinct a morphology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast, some microvillar cells do not show axons-like processes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Immunolabeling with epithelial markers suggest that at least some microvillous cells are non-neuronal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. However, the microvillar cells described by Elsaesser et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] differ from the epithelial type microvillar cells in morphology, particularly the basal processes. Our study further documented the difference between the microvillous cells expressing the PLC&#x003b2;2 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]and TRPM5-expressing cells. In our study, the TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells did not express PLC&#x003b2;2. Further, antibodies against PGP 9.5, OMP and CNGA2 that labeled OSNs, all failed to label the TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells, strongly suggesting that the TRPM-5-expressing cells were not neurons. Thus, our study revealed further diversity of the microvillous cells in the OE.</p><p>At present, the physiological function of the epithelial type microvillous cell in rodents is not known, although there is evidence that some microvillous cells in mammals are chemosensory[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Since the TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells in mice did not express distinct cell marker and signaling proteins of OSNs and microvillous cells that possess axons, the TRPM5-expressing cells may function distinctly from the OSNs in the OE and other chemosensory neurons. One possibility is that TRPM5, which is temperature sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], functions as a thermosensor to monitor temperature of inhaled air. Further experiment will be needed to determine the physiological function of the microvillous cells and role of the TRPM5.</p></sec><sec><title>Difference between TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells in the MOE and solitary chemosensory cells</title><p>Solitary chemosensory cells are thought to constitute a diffuse chemosensory system in the nasal cavity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

Kaske et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] further found that TRPM5 is expressed in brush cells of the epithelia of respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, The authors consider TRPM5 to be an ubiquitous signaling component in chemosensory cells and TRPM5-expressing microvilli cells to be chemosensory. However, despite the expression of TRPM5, the microvillous cells of the olfactory epithelium do not express &#x003b1;-gustducin and PLC&#x003b2;2 typically found in the solitary chemosensory cells. It is unlikely that TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells utilize the same PLC signaling mechanism to detect chemicals.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study provides evidence that TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells represent a group of morphologically diversified non-neuronal cells in the olfactory epithelium of mice.
