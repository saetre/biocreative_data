How STK15 participates in all of these processes remains largely mysterious. The activity of STK15 is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and physically interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and CDC20. However, the precise roles of these modifications and interactions have yet to be fully appreciated. Here we show that STK15 associates with a putative tumor and metastasis suppressor, NM23-H1. STK15 and NM23 were initially found to interact in yeast in a two-hybrid assay. Association of these proteins in human cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cell lysates and biochemical fractionation indicating that STK15 and NM23-H1 are present in a stable, physical complex. Notably, SKT15 and NM23 both localize to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle irrespective of the integrity of the microtubule network in normal human fibroblasts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Correct partitioning of the genome during mitosis depends upon the tightly regulated function of the mitotic spindle, which is composed of centrosomes, microtubules, molecular motors, chromosomes and kinetochores. The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center in mammalian cells and the counterpart to the spindle pole body of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The centrosome in mammalian cells is composed of two perpendicularly positioned centrioles and the surrounding amorphous pericentriolar material. &#x003b3;-Tubulin and pericentrins are constitutive components of the centrosome, while other proteins, such as p53, pRB, BRCA1, BRCA2 and CDK2, accumulate at centrosomes in a cell cycle-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c4">4</xref>).</p><p>The centrosome normally duplicates once per cell cycle. This process is initiated during G<sub>1</sub> after cells pass the restriction point and is completed during G<sub>2</sub>. Centrosomes separate at G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M, migrating to opposite poles of the cell to establish the microtubule network that is required to separate condensed chromosomes during M phase. Centrosomes play a vital role in establishing spindle bipolarity, in assembling spindle microtubules and in determining the plane of cytokinesis (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c10">10</xref>). More recently, accumulating evidence suggests a more direct role than had previously been appreciated for the centrosome in cytokinesis and cell cycle progression during the following G<sub>1</sub> and S phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Centrosome abnormalities, including morphological alterations, supernumerary centrosomes and acentriolar centrosomes, have been demonstrated in most human cancer cells, including those derived from breast, prostate, lung, colon and brain (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c15">15</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c18">18</xref>). Several oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cell division cycle and mitotic checkpoint genes are required for or involved in centrosome duplication, such as Ras, BRCA1 and BRCA2, CDK2, cyclin A and ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c23">23</xref>). Like other cellular processes, protein kinases play critical roles in the centrosome duplication process. Among the centrosome-associated kinases, Aurora-A&#x0002f;AIK1&#x0002f;BTAK&#x0002f;STK15 kinase has been identified as a candidate oncogene with connections to the centrosome cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c27">27</xref>). Aurora-A&#x0002f;STK15 is overexpressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in a number of cancer cell lines, including breast, ovarian and prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c27">27</xref>), and also in breast cancer tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c30">30</xref>). Its kinase activity peaks at the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c25">25</xref>). A mutant, kinase-inactive STK15 (Stk15 K162M) abolishes the oncogenic activity of STK15 in Rat1 fibroblasts, while a mutation conferring constitutive activation (Stk15 T288D) increases the kinase activity and enhances transforming potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c25">25</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the kinase activity of STK15 is essential for STK15 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. STK15 is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation and interacts with CDC20 and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c35">35</xref>).</p><p>As a putative tumor suppressor, the <italic>nm23</italic> gene was discovered on the basis of its reduced expression in highly metastatic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c36">36</xref>). Several studies have shown that NM23 overexpression can reduce the metastatic potential of melanoma and breast carcinoma cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c39">39</xref>). Furthermore, nm23 expression, at both the protein and mRNA levels, inversely correlates with high metastatic potential in numerous human cancers, including breast, gastric, cervical and ovarian carcinoma and melanoma (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c40">40</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>nm23</italic> genes encode a protein family with eight subfamilies in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c41">41</xref>). The well characterized biochemical activities of these proteins include NDP kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c42">42</xref>), protein histidine kinase, histidine-dependent protein phosphotransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c45">45</xref>) and serine autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c47">47</xref>). Data suggest that it is the level of autophosphorylation that correlates with tumor suppression by NM23 in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c46">46</xref>). NM23 associates with the cytoskeleton through an interaction with &#x003b2;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c48">48</xref>). Awd, the fly homolog of NM23, co-localizes with microtubules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c49">49</xref>) and more recent data have indicated that NM23 may also be a component of the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c50">50</xref>).</p><p>Despite the strong evidence that STK15&#x0002f;Aurora-A&#x0002f;BTAK regulates centrosome duplication, cellular transformation and aneuploidy, little evidence directly connects this kinase with known oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Here we provide the data that STK15 interacts with the tumor suppressor NM23, both in yeast and in normal human fibroblasts. NM23 and STK15 co-fractionate in a high molecular weight complex and co-localize at centrosomes throughout the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and primers</title><p>Full-length STK15 was obtained by PCR from plasmid pcDNA3-STK15&#x0002f;BTAK (a kind gift from Dr S.

Among the positives, we found four plasmids containing the human <italic>nm23-H1</italic> coding sequence. Two different fusions were represented, which cover a common N-terminal region of NM23-H1 (three represented fusions of Gal4 to amino acids 9&#x02013;110, and another represented amino acids 2&#x02013;53). This suggests that the region of NM23-H1 between amino acids 2 and 53 binds directly to STK15. We inserted the full-length <italic>nm23-H1</italic> coding sequence into pGADGH (pGADGH-NM23-H1) and confirmed that this fusion protein also interacts specifically with STK15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f1">1</xref>). Only in combination with STK15 did colonies carrying NM23-H1 show significant &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression. Neither NM23-H1 alone nor NM23 combined with other Gal4 fusion proteins (e.g. ras) induced &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression. However, at least in yeast, the degree of X-gal staining indicated that the interaction between STK15 and Nm-23H1 was relatively weak, as compared to the positive control (pGBT8-Ras and pGADGH-Raf in this case). It was therefore essential to investigate whether these proteins physically interacted in mammalian cells.</p><p>To test whether STK15 and NM23 also interact <italic>in vivo</italic> in human cells, proteins were immunoprecipitated from IMR90 cell lysates using anti-STK15 and anti-NM23 antibodies (see Materials and Methods). The presence of NM23 and STK15 in the precipitate was examined by western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f2">2</xref>). Anti-STK15 specifically co-immunoprecipitates STK15 and NM23. Pre-incubation of the STK15 antibody with its cognate synthetic antigen coordinately abolished immunoprecipitation of both STK15 and NM23 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f2">2</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). The NM23 antiserum also immunoprecipitated NM23 and STK15, while normal mouse IgG did not bring down significant amounts of either NM23 or STK15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f2">2</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). We did detect some non-specific binding of NM23 to protein A&#x0002f;G beads; however, this is not unexpected considering that NM23 is a relatively abundant protein (lane 3). The foregoing results indicate that STK15 and NM23 associate with each other in human cells. Comparing the total amount of NM23 present in the cell and the amount precipitated by anti-NM23-H1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f2">2</xref>, lane 4, and western data not shown) to the amount of NM23 immunoprecipitated by the STK15 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f2">2</xref>, lane 2; both lanes 2 and 4 were from the same amount of cell lysate) suggests that a relatively small percentage of NM23-H1 exists in a stable, physical complex with STK15. In western blots of the anti-STK15 immunoprecipitations, we also detected another protein of &#x0223c;54 kDa, in addition to the 46 kDa protein that is predicted to be an STK15 protein derived from an alternatively spliced mRNA. We have not definitively determined the identity of the 54 kDa protein; however, the human genome sequencing project has predicted an alternatively spliced STK15 transcript that is predicted to generate a protein of this size (accession no. XP&#x0005f;009546). In contrast, we have confirmed that the &#x0223c;46 kDa band is STK15 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.</p><p>To verify the interaction between STK15 and NM23-H1, protein extracts from IMR90 cells were fractionated by FPLC. Throughout the purification, we followed STK15 by western blotting. Western analysis of the purification through Mono S, Mono Q and Superose 6 columns revealed that STK15 is present in two distinct forms, a high molecular weight protein complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f3">3</xref>, fractions 10 and 11, &#x0223c;2 MDa) and a relatively low molecular weight complex (fractions 15&#x02013;17, &#x0223c;350 KDa). NM23-H1 also shows a peak around fractions 15&#x02013;17, which exactly co-migrates with STK15 in the &#x0223c;350 kDa complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f3">3</xref>). This result supports the notion that STK15 and NM23 coexist in a protein complex <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>STK15 and NM23 co-localize at centrosomes</title><p>It has been shown that STK15 localizes to centrosomes in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c25">25</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>A). By fixing IMR90 cells in 0.5&#x00025; (w&#x0002f;v) formaldehyde, we can also detect STK15 at centrosomes during interphase in immortalized human IMR90 cells. Centrosomes were visualized by simultaneous staining with an anti-centrin2 antiserum, which locates the two centrioles in the centrosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>). The amount of STK15 at centrosomes increases as cells move from interphase to prophase, and SKT15 also becomes apparent on the mitotic spindle. These results suggest that STK15 is a centrosome component throughout the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>A), but becomes enriched at centrosomes during mitosis. NM23-H1 also localizes to centrosomes in interphase cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c50">50</xref>). At the beginning of prophase NM23-H1 accumulates at the centrosome, as judged from the increased intensity of staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>B, prometaphase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c50">50</xref>). The association of NM23 with centrosomes persists through the mitotic phase and NM23-H1 also distributes somewhat to the microtubule spindles adjacent to the centrosome from metaphase to telophase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c50">50</xref>). From late telophase to cytokinesis, NM23-H1 also accumulates at the newly forming midbody microtubules (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f5">5</xref>C in late telophase and cytokinesis cells). Interestingly, an identical distribution pattern at the midbody microtubules is also observed for STK15 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f5">5</xref>B in late telophase and cytokinesis cells). The accumulation of NM23-H1 on centrosomes coincides with the enrichment of STK15 at the centrosome and with increased STK15 kinase activity at the beginning of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c25">25</xref>).</p><p>In order to test whether STK15 and NM23 co-localize, we simultaneously labeled IMR90 cells with &#x003b2;-tubulin-FITC, NM23-TRITC and STK15-AF647 (Cy5) and visualized the localization of each protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>C). &#x003b2;-Tubulin immunofluorescence reveals interphase microtubule filaments and centrosomes. In mitotic phase, &#x003b2;-tubulin localizes both to the mitotic spindles and to the centrosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>C). NM23 and STK15 fluorescence is present together at the centrosome at all cell cycle phases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f4">4</xref>C, the right side merged lane). These results confirm that STK15 and at least some fraction of NM23 co-localize to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>STK15 and NM23 centrosomal localization is microtubule-independent</title><p>There is some evidence indicating that NM23-H1 is &#x003b2;-tubulin associated and localized through &#x003b3;-tubulin to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c50">50</xref>). In order to clarify that STK15 and NM23 do not associate indirectly at centrosomes through their separate interactions with microtubules, we treated IMR90 cells with nocodazole (see Materials and Methods), which rapidly dissipates the microtubule network in cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f5">5</xref>B and C, &#x003b2;-tubulin column).</p><p>There are several centrosome-associated proteins that localize to this structure in a spindle-dependent fashion. Of these, perhaps the most well studied is &#x003b3;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c56">56</xref>). Upon nocodazole treatment of mammalian cells, centrosomal &#x003b3;-tubulin is reduced by &#x0223c;2-fold in interphase cells and by at least 4-fold in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c56">56</xref>). Using &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-tubulin antisera, we confirmed that our nocodazole treatment dissipates the microtubule network and dramatically reduces the amount of &#x003b3;-tubulin associated with the centrosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;C). In such cells, STK15 and NM23-H1 still localize to the centrosome with the same pattern and intensity of staining seen in untreated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f5">5</xref>B and C). The result suggests that the interaction between STK15 and NM23 and their centrosome localization are microtubule-independent.</p><p>A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c57">57</xref>) showed that the centrosomal localization of a <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> homolog of STK15, Aurora-A, is microtubule-dependent. This result was obtained using a construct consisting of the only N-terminal domain of Aurora-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c57">57</xref>). However, microtubule-independent localization of Aurora-A to the centrosome was observed using a full-length Aurora-A construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c57">57</xref>). Here, we also observed that the localization of full-length STK15 to the centrosome is not dependent on microtubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf678f5">5</xref>B).</p><p>A previous study showed that STK15 associates with centrosomes only at onset of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c25">25</xref>). However, our immunofluorescence studies indicate that STK15 associates with centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. This discrepancy could arise because of the different cell types used in these studies. Here we examined STK15 in normal or immortalized human fibroblasts cells while previous studies have used human cancer cells and rodent fibroblast cells. Furthermore, different antisera and fixation conditions were used in this and in previous studies. We do, however, observe an increase in the abundance of STK15 at centrosomes in mitotic cells.</p><p>STK15 is a centrosome-associated kinase, overexpression of which in rodent or human cancer cells causes improper centrosome duplication, aneuploidy and cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c27">27</xref>). The abundance of STK15 is controlled by the ubiquitin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c33">33</xref>) and has been linked to CDC20, an APC activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c31">31</xref>). STK15 kinase activity is also controlled by PP1, a protein phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c34">34</xref>). Here we provide evidence that STK15 is associated with a putative tumor and metastasis suppressor protein, NM23-H1. These proteins physically interact and co-localize to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle in human IMR90 cells. NM23-H1 plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p><p>The interaction between NM23 and STK15 might potentially modulate either of their activities through a number of mechanisms, ranging from allosteric regulation to induced localization to enzymatic modification. We tested the latter possibility using STK15 and NM23-H1, purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Purified STK15 was enzymatically active, as judged by its ability to phosporylate a model substrate, MBP. NM23 also displayed activity as judged by auto-phosphorylation and NDP kinase activities (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf678c58">58</xref>). Neither of the purified proteins was capable of chemically modifying the other nor did mixing these proteins affect their activities towards model substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, the exact nature of the functional relationship between NM23 and SKT15 remains unknown.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf678f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> STK15 and NM23 interact specifically in the two-hybrid assay.
