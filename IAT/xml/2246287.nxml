In general, the process of organ induction begins with the formation of a specialized area of mesenchyme that acts upon adjacent epithelia to specify organ identity and subsequently dictates epithelial morphogenesis into the required form and function within the organ. The role played by inductive mesenchyme has been established using classical embryologic methods such as tissue recombination and engraftment, which have assayed the ability of spatially defined areas of mesenchyme to control morphogenesis and organogenesis. During organogenesis reciprocal interactions and signaling occur between the mesenchymal and epithelial compartments; in addition, numerous paracrine and autocrine growth regulatory pathways such as Wnt, hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Notch, and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; are also active. The inductive mesenchyme involved in organ induction goes on to form signaling centers that are involved in growth and differentiation as well as specialized functions such as branching morphogenesis. At present, our knowledge of the pathways that are active in inductive mesenchyme is limited; this may be because of the inherently small size of these mesenchyma and a lack of suitable markers. It is likely that the proportion of inductive or specialized mesenchyme within a developing organ is low, which will make it difficult to isolate sufficient material for profiling studies.</p><p>The prostate develops from the embryonic urogenital sinus in response to testicular androgens and as a result of reciprocal mesenchymal epithelial interactions (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Paracrine signaling from the urogenital mesenchyme (UGM) to the epithelium specifies prostatic epithelial identity, induces epithelial bud formation and growth, and regulates ductal branching morphogenesis (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Androgen action within the urogenital sinus mesenchyme was originally defined as being necessary and sufficient for prostate organogenesis; androgen action in the epithelia is not required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Within the mesenchyme a distinct area of mesenchyme has been defined that regulates prostatic organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This mesenchyme has been termed the ventral mesenchymal pad (VMP), based on its anatomic position. However, it appears that the VMP is part of a structure that encircles the urethra and may participate in the formation of all lobes of the prostate. Additionally, it appears that the VMP is better anatomically defined in rat than in mouse, although it can be distinguished by its restricted expression of molecules such as FGF10 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The VMP is present in both males and females, suggesting that androgens are not required for its formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], although androgens are required for prostate induction and organogenesis. The activity of molecules produced in the VMP may be indirectly regulated by androgens that control the formation of a layer of smooth muscle that is juxtaposed between the VMP and urethral epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The VMP constitutively expresses key growth regulatory molecules such as FGF10, which functions as a mesenchymal paracrine regulator of prostatic epithelia and is essential for the formation of the prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Androgens are required for the formation of the prostate, and there has been considerable interest in defining the pathways that might be involved in mediating the effects of androgens. Furthermore, because androgen receptor activity is required in the mesenchyme/stroma, this has led to the idea that androgens may act through paracrine factors produced in the mesenchyme. At present there are no molecules that are expressed in the mesenchyme which show clear upregulation by androgens, despite a range of experimental approaches. It is also possible that androgens may not directly control the expression of paracrine acting factors but may act indirectly, by controlling the interaction of inductive mesenchmye with epithelia via the smooth muscle compartment. In the developing reproductive tract there is a sexually dimorphic layer of smooth muscle that separates inductive prostatic mesenchyme (VMP) from the urethral epithelium (from which nascent prostatic buds will form). In females this layer forms rapidly and isolates the VMP, but in males the layer remains discontinuous to permit interaction of the VMP with epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It appears that the smooth muscle patterning is controlled by androgens and estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The hypothesis that androgens act via the smooth muscle compartment would suggest that androgens may not directly regulate the expression of paracrine factors in the mesenchyme. This is supported by the observation that factors such as FGF10, which are required for the formation of the prostate, are equally abundant in males and females and do not appear to be regulated by testosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The question of which genes are involved in androgen-driven growth of the prostate has led to several studies that have used arrays to examine the gene expression profile of the prostate and prostate cell lines. Such studies have used either whole prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], prostate tumor samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], or prostate cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There is limited similarity between these datasets, which probably reflects the different nature of the tissues as well as the cellular heterogeneity in some of the tissues and samples. It may be hoped that a few genes were common to all studies, or within individual studies, that might identify mediators of androgen action upon growth. However, few or none appear to exhibit such a pattern. Additionally, it may be that only a subset of cells are the target of androgen action, in which case the identification of the gene expression signature of these cells within a complex tissue may be difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This will be particularly difficult for low-abundance transcripts expressed in subsets of cells and in rare cells such as progenitor/stem cells.</p><p>It has recently become apparent that the stroma is also actively involved in neoplastic prostate growth (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). Tumor-associated stroma or reactive stroma exhibits a variety of phenotypic and functional differences relative to normal stroma (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). The tumor stroma is no longer able to restrain prostatic epithelial proliferation, but instead carcinoma-associated fibroblasts stimulate epithelial tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and stimulate tumor angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The role of stroma in prostate tumor growth is highly reminiscent of the developmental growth of the prostate, and developmental pathways have been identified in prostate tumor stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This notion of developmental pathway involvement in tumorigenesis was pioneered by Pierce several years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>We have used an unbiased approach to identify new stromal regulators of prostate growth. Our thesis was that mesenchymal factors that are involved in prostatic induction would be constitutively expressed in either males or females, as predicted by the 'smooth muscle' hypothesis described above. Additionally, we speculated that our approach might identify potential 'andromedin' molecules if they were expressed at low levels in females, because females are exposed to low (nonmasculinizing) levels of androgens <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, we thought that a highly sensitive approach would identify androgen regulated molecules at their un-induced levels in the female prostatic rudiment.</p><p>Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) we profiled a subset of urogenital mesenchymal cells that comprise the VMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The VMP is a homogenous subset of mesenchymal cells that initiates and regulates prostate organogenesis, and which can be microdissected in sufficient quantity for SAGE library construction. In addition, we constructed a SAGE library of the whole prostatic precursor, comprising the VMP, smooth muscle and urethral epithelium (VSU). By comparing the two SAGE libraries, we hoped to identify molecules enriched or restricted to the VMP while eliminating those expressed throughout all tissues (such as housekeeping genes and genes expressed in smooth muscle and epithelium). Our SAGE library comparison yielded a list of 219 transcripts, which exhibited a statistically significant enrichment in the VMP compared with the whole precursor (VSU). Most of the 219 transcripts were identified by low frequency tags in the SAGE libraries, suggesting that they were derived from low-abundance transcripts. One of the molecules we identified was <italic>Scube1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We demonstrate that <italic>Scube1 </italic>is expressed during prostate induction and branching morphogenesis, and that it is restricted to a subset of prostatic mesenchyme including the VMP. Expression of <italic>Scube1 </italic>was not affected by androgens and was observed in both males and females. Additionally, <italic>Scube1 </italic>mRNA was expressed in prostate cancer stromal cells, and was downregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts relative to normal prostate fibroblasts. We propose that the list of 219 transcripts that we have identified may contain several mesenchymal factors that are important during organogenesis and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SAGE analysis of prostatic inductive mesenchyme</title><p>To determine the transcript profile of prostatic inductive mesenchyme, we applied SAGE to a subset of the prostatic mesenchyme, namely the VMP. We constructed two SAGE libraries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>): one consisted purely of the VMP, whereas the second library (VSU) was composed of the whole prostatic precursor tissue containing VMP, smooth muscle, urethral epithelium and mesenchyme.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>SAGE analysis of prostatic inductive mesenchyme. <bold>(a) </bold>The strategy used in construction and comparison of serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) libraries to identify ventral mesenchymal pad (VMP) specific or enriched transcripts.

The VMP tissue comprised only the condensed inductive mesenchyme of the VMP, whereas the VSU library contained urethral epithelium, smooth muscle, urethral mesenchyme and VMP.

The VSU library is made from a more complex tissue than the VMP library, and as a consequence, if both libraries are sequenced to a similar depth, VMP-specific transcripts will exhibit greater abundance in the VMP-only library. Our hypothesis was that transcripts expressed in the VMP would be 'diluted' in the VSU library (because the VMP is included as a component of the VSU). This effect would be most pronounced with regard to transcripts that were present at low abundance in the VMP and very low or absent in the VSU library. By comparing the VSU and VMP libraries and selecting for the tags with a significantly higher tag count in the VMP library (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), we enriched for low abundance VMP-specific transcripts, while removing most housekeeping genes and broadly expressed transcripts. The number and frequency of tags showing a statistically significant difference between the two libraries is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>. Datapoints colored red nearest to the VMP axis represent VMP-enriched tags, and these are described further below.</p><p>We sequenced about 70,000 tags for each library, translating into 22,755 and 26,932 distinct tags for the VSU and VMP libraries, respectively. About 68% of tags were found only once in each SAGE library. A significant proportion of these single tags will have resulted from sequence errors, and thus we excluded them from most subsequent analyses. Analysis of the VMP SAGE data revealed the presence of known mesenchymal regulatory factors in prostate growth, such as FGF10, BMP4, Smoothened and androgen receptor (AR), indicating an adequate sequencing depth to identify known regulators of prostate organogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>VMP-VSU SAGE library comparison to identify inductive mesenchyme specific transcripts</title><p>Comparison of the VMP and VSU SAGE libraries yielded a list of 219 tags that exhibited a significant enrichment in the VMP library (see Additional data file 1). SAGEMAP and genomic basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) were used to assign SAGE tags to specific transcripts and genes. The smallest statistically significant difference between our two SAGE libraries was 5:0 tags in VMP:VSU libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Because an important goal of our studies was to identify mesenchymal paracrine factors, we examined our libraries for the presence of factors known to play a role in prostate development. We detected FGF10 in our VMP library, but it had four tag counts. As a consequence FGF10 was not identified as being VMP enriched in our SAGE screen, which exemplifies a limitation of our bioinformatic comparison. Although our approach identified many low abundance VMP enriched molecules, it inevitably will have missed some because of sampling error, and rare transcripts are most susceptible to sampling error. This is supported by estimation of the statistical power to determine differential expression between the VMP and VSU libraries, which indicates that at power of 0.9 differences of greater than twofold in tags of 50 and above might be detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The majority of transcripts in the VMP list are below this level, and it is likely that we have not identified all of the low abundance transcripts specific to the VMP. Although our analysis identified novel mesenchymal molecules that are involved in prostate organogenesis, it is possible that further such molecules remain to be identified.</p><p>The list of 219 VMP enriched tags/transcripts was functionally classified according to their Gene Ontology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). For approximately 11% of our list, we were unable to assign transcripts to these tags, but a number of them could represent anti-sense transcripts because they map to the 3'-untranslated region of known transcripts but in the anti-sense orientation (Additional data file 1; anti-sense tags are identified within the 219 list). We chose to focus on transcripts that encode potential growth regulatory molecules or modulators. About 5% of our list is made up of extracellular signaling molecules, whereas four tags mapped to known transmembrane receptors. We analyzed the large group of hypothetical proteins (25%) for the presence of signal peptides, transmembrane domains, and functional domains that suggested involvement in cellular signaling activity. As a result we identified a list of 17 putative extracellular or transmembrane signaling molecules that exhibited a significant enrichment in the VMP SAGE library (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Putative secreted or cell surface signaling molecules that show significant enrichment in the VMP SAGE library</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">LONG-SAGE tag</td><td align="left">VMP</td><td align="left">VSU</td><td align="left">Uni-gene</td><td align="left">Description (SAGEMAP)</td><td align="left">Genomic BLAST</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">CATTTTCTGGCAAAATC</td><td align="left">124</td><td align="left">34</td><td align="left">964</td><td align="left">Insulin-like growth factor 2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">CCTAGCCCCTCCCACCA</td><td align="left">49</td><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">7961</td><td align="left"><italic>Rattus norvegicus </italic>similar to latent transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;

In addition to intracellular molecules, there was a considerable number of extracellular matrix proteins. The VMP consists of mesenchyme that is morphologically distinct from the surrounding mesenchyme. The higher expression of some of these extracellular matrix components may be responsible for the different morphology of the inductive mesenchyme.

The UGM/urogenital stroma is a very potent tissue during both development and disease, which has been demonstrated by tissue recombination experiments. Androgen action in the UGM has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for prostatic development (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). When recombined with human embryonic stem cells, the UGM directs differentiation into mature human prostate tissue expressing prostate-specific antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, embryonic UGM has the ability to re-differentiate prostate cancer cells and to reduce tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It has recently emerged that the stroma can initiate and stimulate prostate tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and profiling of tumor stroma has identified developmental molecules such as secreted frizzled-related protein 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Because of the restricted expression of <italic>Scube1 </italic>in a small subset of cells, it would be very difficult to identify <italic>Scube1 </italic>in a profiling screen of heterogeneous tissue samples such as tumors unless it was significantly upregulated during tumorigenesis. Hence, a transcript profile of a potent tissue such as the VMP not only provides us with potential new regulators of prostate growth, but it may also highlight some that could regulate neoplastic growth.</p><p>For our analysis we used the inductive mesenchyme of a female UGT and assumed that key prostatic regulators may not be induced by testosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. We also reasoned that a highly sensitive gene profiling approach might detect androgen-regulated molecules at their 'un-induced' levels, in the event that some stromal mediators might be upregulated by androgens. Most profiling studies have focused on pathways activated by androgens to find new regulators of prostate growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, none of these studies has successfully identified molecules that satisfy the criteria of being 'andromedins'. At present no growth factors expressed in the UGM have been shown to be directly regulated by androgens. We hypothesized that key prostatic inducers are constitutively expressed in the inductive mesenchyme, regardless of testosterone levels, and that by profiling the VMP novel growth regulatory signaling pathways would be identified. We have previously suggested that molecules produced by, or in, the VMP may be indirectly regulated by an androgen sensitive layer of smooth muscle that forms a separating layer between the VMP and the urethral epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>To identify VMP-specific transcripts from our VMP SAGE data, we employed a novel strategy. We compared the VMP-only SAGE library with a more complex SAGE library of the complete female prostatic precursor (termed VSU). By doing so we specifically focused on low abundance VMP-enriched or VMP-restricted transcripts. Additionally, the ability to isolate enough inductive mesenchyme for direct SAGE library construction (without amplification or dilution with other cell types) indicates that our VMP library may contain a number of important and potent molecules that are absent or poorly represented in current datasets, because these are typically made from tissues composed of many cell types. Profiling of the VMP, which is highly enriched for growth regulatory proteins such as FGFs, yielded a number of extracellular and transmembrane proteins with putative growth regulatory or modulatory functions. The expression of many of these factors in the prostate has not been revealed by other profiling studies, which may be because of their greater cellular complexity or the use of adult tissues in which growth regulatory pathways are less active. We estimate that 30% to 50% of the molecules in the VMP list will be experimentally confirmed as being VMP enriched, based on our follow up of 30 candidate molecules. This ratio compares favorably with other profiling studies, but it is inevitable that transcripts will have been missed and that others will not be experimentally confirmed. This is likely because our studies have focused upon low abundance transcripts, which are the most susceptible to sampling error when measured using SAGE.</p><p>We identified Scube1 as a prostatic inductive mesenchyme specific molecule. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of <italic>Scube1 </italic>during prostate organogenesis is coincident with prostate induction and subsequent branching morphogenesis. In developing ventral prostates the highest concentration of <italic>Scube1 </italic>transcript was localized to the mesenchymal cells adjacent to the distal duct tips. This localization to the distal mesenchyme mirrors the localization of <italic>Fgf10 </italic>and suggests an involvement of <italic>Scube1 </italic>in ductal growth. Interestingly the Shh receptor Ptc also localizes to this inductive mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although no function has yet been described for <italic>Scube1</italic>, its family member <italic>Scube2</italic>, is reported to be involved in Shh signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].

During prostate development, Shh signaling regulates ductal growth and branching, although it is not essential for prostate induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Shh is composed of prostatic epithelium and acts as a mitogen for the prostatic mesenchyme. <italic>Scube1 </italic>expression in the target mesenchyme may be required for the mitogenic effects of Shh. Because several components of the Hh pathway are regulated by Shh, we examined whether <italic>Scube1 </italic>levels in P0 UGTs and VPs were affected by Shh treatment. We could not detect any regulation of <italic>Scube1 </italic>transcript expression by recombinant Shh or inhibition of Hh signaling with cyclopamine (data not shown). It is possible that Scube may regulate other signaling pathways because it is expressed in areas where Hh signaling is not thought to be important.

Both <italic>Fgf10 </italic>and <italic>Fgf7 </italic>are important regulators of prostate growth and neither is androgen regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is likely that there is a group of molecules important in prostate growth that are not regulated by androgens. <italic>Scube1 </italic>has not been identified in profiling studies looking for androgen regulated mediators of prostate growth, and it seems probable that <italic>Scube1 </italic>is not a direct mediator of androgen action. <italic>Scube1 </italic>specific tags are present in SAGE libraries made from mouse E16.5 UGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In the study conducted by Zhang and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] the tag count for <italic>Scube1 </italic>was lower than that in our study, and <italic>Scube1 </italic>would not have been identified as inductive mesenchyme specific, because those authors did not profile subsets of the mesencyhmal compartment. Because of the restricted expression of <italic>Scube1 </italic>in a small subset of cells and the low abundance of this transcript, it would be very difficult to identify <italic>Scube1 </italic>in a profiling screen using whole prostate organs or a complex tissue such as tumors.</p><p>We showed that <italic>Scube1 </italic>is expressed in both prostate development and prostate cancer stromal cells, which concurs with the observation that many developmental pathways are involved in tumorigenesis. The downregulation of <italic>Scube1 </italic>in CAFs compared with NPFs suggests that it may function as a tumor suppressor, although this remains to be experimentally confirmed. <italic>Scube1 </italic>is located on human chromosome 22q13, and this region is reported to be deleted in some prostate cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], which supports the notion that <italic>Scube1 </italic>may function as a tumor suppressor. The region 22q13 contains approximately 242 genes, and thus genes other than <italic>Scube1 </italic>may be acting as tumor suppressors. Also, it is not known whether the deletion of 22q13 is present in stroma or epithelia within the tumor samples. Although we do not know whether <italic>Scube1 </italic>is expressed in epithelia, there is no indication that it is expressed in epithelia during development and it appears to be absent from some prostate epithelial cell lines (Vanpoucke G, Thomson AA, unpublished data). <italic>Scube1 </italic>has not been observed in prostate cancer using whole tumor profiling studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], perhaps because it is expressed in a small subset of cells within the tumor that are not well represented in whole tumor gene signatures. The only way to identify molecules in small subsets of tumor will be to increase the efficiency of whole tumor profiles (by increasing the sampling level) or to isolate subsets of the tumors for profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We have identified tumor expression of <italic>Scube1 </italic>using a candidate-based approach, based upon its expression in a subset of mesenchyme that is known to be important in prostate development.</p><p>Our study identified several additional signaling molecules that were expressed in the inductive mesenchyme, which have the potential to act either as paracrine regulators of the prostatic epithelium or as mediators of reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal signaling during prostate organogenesis. Estradiol-induced gene 4 (E2IG4) was originally identified in a screen for estrogen responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, it is the mammalian ortholog of chicken Tsukushi, which is a BMP inhibitor that is involved in organizer induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Dlk-1 is known as a de-differentiation factor from studies of adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Its expression in prostate mesenchyme has not previously been reported, but it was observed in a SAGE screen for stromal changes in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Nell2 is a secreted epidermal growth factor family member; no function has been described for this protein, but it was shown to be over-expressed in benign prostatic hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Sprouty is a negative regulator of FGFs and its expression is reported to be decreased in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Members of the Slit, Semaphorin, and Ephrin families of proteins are best known for their role as guidance cues for axons (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]), but recent studies show that they contribute to the development of a variety of organs. Slit2 plays a key role during kidney development in positioning the site of kidney induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified <italic>Scube1 </italic>as a novel prostatic inductive mesenchyme specific molecule with potential roles in prostate development and disease. Furthermore, our VMP-specific SAGE list gives an overview of the transcriptional programs active in a key subset of the mesenchyme during prostate induction. This detailed analysis of the developmental pathways that control normal prostate morphogenesis can also provide insights into the regulatory pathways that control neoplastic growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>RNA isolation and SAGE library construction</title><p>Whole prostatic precursors (VSUs) and VMPs were microdissected from female postnatal day 0 (P0) outbred Wistar rats. RNA was extracted from 100 pooled VSUs and 90 VMPs using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). RNA quality and concentration was measured using an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA) 2100 Bioanalyser; 50 &#x003bc;g VSU total RNA and 20 &#x003bc;g of VMP total RNA were used.

During this process linker sequences and duplicate dimers were removed from the sequence data. For the VMP and P0 UGT pair-wise library comparison, a tag was tested for significance using the Audic and Claverie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and the Z-test (Statview software package, Letchworth, UK). A 95% confidence interval was applied (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Both statistical tests gave similar results. Tag to gene annotations were done using the rat Long-SAGE map reference database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. When no gene was assigned with a tag, a genomic BLAST was performed with the complete 21 base pair tag sequence (CATG-17bp tag) using the ENSEMBL rat genome browser to aid in gene assignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. When a tag gave a unique hit in the rat genome within 5 kilobases from an assigned locus, we hypothesized that the tag originated from this transcript. This manual tag mapping was verified for a number of transcripts by performing rapid amplifications of cDNA 3' ends (3'-RACE) experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].
