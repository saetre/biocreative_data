This contributes to the functional diversity required to generate extensive phenotypes from a limited genotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Paulson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Glycosylation is a crucial post- or co-translational modification of more than 50&#x00025; of all eukaryotic proteins according to database analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Apweiler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It is affected by a multitude of factors, such as cellular metabolism and the rate of cell growth. Accumulated evidence indicates that glycan structures play important roles in various contexts, including differentiation, development, fertilization, inflammation, and cell&#x02013;cell recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Lau1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Varki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Glycosylation defects in mice and their links to the development of diseases have shown that the mammalian glycome contains a significant amount of biological information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Freeze1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Lowe1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, defects in glycosylation pathways are often associated with psychomotor/mental retardation or other neuropathological symptoms as seen in most congenital diseases of glycosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Kleene1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. It is believed that specific glycosylation patterns are expressed in a cell type-specific and developmentally regulated manner. Thus, identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of glycan diversity will help to elucidate how an ensemble of glycans displayed at the cell surface governs signal transduction and cell&#x02013;cell communication via multivalent interactions with proteins.</p><p>Fucose is one of the most important glycans expressed at the cell surface. It is a deoxyhexose that is present in a wide variety of organisms. In mammals, fucosylated carbohydrate structures have important roles in a variety of biological and pathological processes, such as tissue development, angiogenesis, fertilization, selectin-mediated leukocyte-endothelial adhesion, inflammation, host immune response, and tumor metastasis, including Notch receptor family signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Becker1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Alterations in the expression of fucosylated oligosaccharides occur in several pathological processes, including cancer and atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Becker1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Fucosylated glycans are generated by fucosyltransferases (FucTs) that are responsible for the catalysis of fucose transfer from the donor guanosine-diphosphate fucose (GDP-fucose) to various acceptor molecules including oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. During early organ development, compartment formation outside the nervous system is determined by carbohydrate-dependent signal transduction between cell surface recognition molecules as elegantly shown for Notch and its cell surface binding partners Jagged/Serrate and Delta. Ligand-receptor interaction between these molecules is determined by the O-fucose-&#x003b2;1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase, Fringe, which determines the Notch-bearing cell's reaction to its binding partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Okajima1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These examples highlight the importance of carbohydrates in cell&#x02013;cell interactions outside the nervous system.</p><p>Another very important monosaccharide is sialic acid. Sialic acids are expressed as terminal sugars with a shared nine-carbon backbone in several classes of cell surface and secreted glycan molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Varki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Sialic acids provide negative charge and hydrophilicity to vertebrate cell surfaces, mask subterminal galactose residues from recognition by certain receptors, and act as receptors for pathogens and toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Varki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, In particular, sialic acids play an important role during mammalian development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Schwarzkopf1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In the nervous system, polysialic acid is nearly exclusively carried by the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Polysialylated NCAM is involved in the development of the nervous system, <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, and regeneration in the adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Kleene1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Several vertebrate proteins have been found that mediate specific recognition events involving sialic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Varki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, such as the cell recognition molecule L1, another Ig superfamily member, that specifically recognizes 2,3-linked sialic acids present on the heavily glycosylated cell surface protein, CD24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Kleene1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Kleene2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>L1 itself is one of many carbohydrate-carrying molecules in the nervous system, where it is widely expressed and involved in many aspects of neural development, regeneration and synaptic plasticity in the adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Maness1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Various human genetic disorders with prominent nervous system defects are caused by mutations in L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Kenwrick1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Cell recognition molecules at the cell surface are not only donors, but also acceptors of carbohydrates. These carbohydrates mediate interactions between recognition molecules in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> and thereby modulate their functions as receptors at the cell surface and as signal transducers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Kleene1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Modulation of these interactions occurs through finely tuned synthesis of glycan chains depending on the neural cell type and its developmental state. However, it is unknown whether these cell recognition molecules are also involved in regulation of glycan diversity at the cell surface.</p><p>Lectins are proteins which recognize specific glycan structures. Due to this property, they have been extremely useful in studying glycan variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Goldstein1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Sharon1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Glycans and lectins usually interact with lower affinities than those found for protein-protein interactions. However, lectin-glycan interactions are characterized by a significant avidity given that most lectins can bind multiple glycan moieties and do so with considerable specificity. Taking advantage of this, in the present study, we have used lectins and carbohydrate-specific antibodies to investigate the changes in glycosylation patterns on cell surfaces of neurons stimulated with L1 antibodies. We have demonstrated that L1 plays a role in modulating both sialylation and fucosylation at cell surfaces through increased expression of both ST6Gal1 and FUT9 via a phospholipase C&#x003b3;-mediated mechanism by which it enhances neurite outgrowth, cell survival and migration of neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Antibodies, lectins and inhibitors</title><p>Goat polyclonal anti-mouse, rat and human FUT9 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

In neurons treated with L1 antibody, the phospholipase C&#x003b3; (PLC&#x003b3;) inhibitor U73122, the PKA inhibitor KT5720 and the Erk inhibitor reduced both FUT9 and ST6Gal1 mRNA levels, with U73122 and Erk inhibitors having the strongest effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003841-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The PI3K inhibitor reduced FUT9 mRNA levels but not ST6Gal1 mRNA levels after L1 stimulation. In contrast to this, inhibition of CDC25 had no effect on FUT9 and ST6Gal1 mRNA levels.

This regulation may contribute to the observed changes in sialylation and fucosylation of surface glycoproteins and/or glycolipids in L1-deficient mouse brains. Activation of L1 signal transduction pathways enhances cell survival, migration and neurite outgrowth, which can be blocked by shRNA-mediated knockdown of ST6Gal1 and FUT9. A PLC&#x003b3;-dependent pathway contributes to the L1-induced increases in expression of the sialyltransferase and fucosyltransferase and to the L1-mediated neurite outgrowth and cell survival.</p><p>The central dogma of molecular biology has been revised to include glycosylation or the attachment of glycans or carbohydrates to proteins or lipids, which provides for the needed functional diversity to generate extensive phenotypes from a limited genotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Paulson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. As glycosylation is not under the direct control of the genome, it is not possible to predict a cell's glycan repertoire from analyses of genomic DNA sequences. Understanding of the importance of glycan function in the nervous and immune systems during development has only recently emerged. Relatively little attention has been paid to the regulation of their expression till now, probably because of their intricate modes of synthesis. Here, we have first shown that the expression of both sialic acids and fucose is significantly reduced at the cell surfaces of <italic>L1<sup>&#x02212;/y</sup></italic> neurons, indicating that L1 is able to modulate both sialylation and fucosylation of glycoproteins and/or glycolipids at the surface of neurons. Consistently, we have demonstrated that mRNA levels of the sialyltransferase ST6Gal1 and the fucosyltransferase FUT9 are significantly down-regulated in L1<italic><sup>&#x02212;/y</sup></italic> neurons compared with the levels in L1<sup>&#x0002b;<italic>/y</italic></sup> neurons. Moreover, we have shown that stimulation with the L1 antibody 557, which can functionally mimic a L1&#x02013;L1 <italic>trans</italic>-interaction as described for a scFv antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Dong1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> recognizing the same domain within the L1 molecule as the 557 antibody, and the stimulation with L1-Fc significantly increased the mRNA levels of the sialyltransferase ST6Gal1 and the fucosyltransferase FUT9 on the cell surfaces of cerebellar granule neurons isolated from <italic>L1<sup>&#x0002b;/y</sup></italic>, but not <italic>L1<sup>&#x02212;/y</sup></italic> mice. This finding indicates that L1&#x02013;L1 interaction modulated the sialylation and fucosylation on cell surface.</p><p>In the nervous system, the diversity of cell&#x02013;cell interactions is largely mediated by glycans and glycans appear to have been pushed to an even higher degree of sophistication. Some very unusual glycans are pivotal not only during nervous system development and regeneration but also in synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Kleene1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

In agreement with our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Appel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Dong1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, we have shown that antibodies to the cell recognition molecule L1, which mimic a L1&#x02013;L1 <italic>trans</italic>-interaction, enhance neurite outgrowth. Importantly, the anti-L1-antibody-mediated promotion of neurite outgrowth occurs only in neurons isolated from wild-type, but not L1 knockout mice. Since sialylation and fucosylation are enhanced at cell surfaces of the anti-L1 antibody-treated neurons, the specific pattern of glycosylation induced by L1 may also be an important factor in promoting neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, due to the fact that L1 stimulation can modulate sialylation and fucosylation, we have proposed that the L1-induced specific glycosylation pattern may not only influence neurite outgrowth but also contribute, at least partially, to neuronal survival and migration. In agreement with this notion, we have confirmed that L1 promotes cell survival and migration through the L1&#x02013;L1 trans-interaction mimicked by application of anti-L1 antibody 557, which can be blocked by shRNAs of transferases of sialylation and fucosylation. Thus, these observations demonstrate that L1 may be involved in neuronal survival and migration through its role in modulating glycosylation on cell surface for its specific neuronal functions.</p><p>The NCAM and L1 family of adhesion molecules are thought to trigger neurite outgrowth, axonal growth or cell migration by activation of a number of signal transduction pathways, including PLC&#x003b3;-, PI3K-, Erk- and PKA-dependent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Kleene1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Loers2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that both a PLC&#x003b3; inhibitor and knockdown of PLC&#x003b3; by shRNA reduced FUT9 and ST6Gal1 mRNA levels in L1 antibody-treated neurons. Although inhibitors of other signal transduction pathways also had effects on L1-induced neurite outgrowth and cell survival, inhibition of PLC&#x003b3; consistently resulted in strong inhibition of neurite outgrowth and cell survival in L1 antibody-treated neurons. This suggests that L1 may regulate both sialylation and fucosylation in relation to cell function via a PLC&#x003b3;-dependent pathway in neurons. Inhibition of PI3K or Erk also reduced L1 antibody-mediated cell survival, as described previously for stimulation with L1-Fc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003841-Loers1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here, we have demonstrated that L1 could modulate fucosylation and sialylation of cell surface proteins and/or lipids by regulating the expression of fucosyltransferase 9 and &#x003b2;-galactoside-&#x003b1;2,6-sialyltransferase, which in turn regulates cell survival and migration in neurons. Thus, an important insight of this study is that a distinct glycosylation pattern on the cell surface could be regulated by a specific genetic modulation, which could be applied to manipulate cell-cell communication in development or disease, leading to greater precision and specificity in drug targeting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003841.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Western blot result.
