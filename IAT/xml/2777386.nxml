Once taken up by cells, it escapes from the endocytic pathway to the cytoplasm, but here it is contained within a membrane-bound structure termed GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs). The autophagosome marker GFP-LC3 associates with GcAVs, and other components of the autophagosomal pathway are involved in GcAV formation. However, the mechanistic relationship between GcAV and canonical autophagy is largely unknown. Here, we morphologically analyzed GcAV formation in detail. Initially, a small, GFP-LC3-positive GcAV sequesters each streptococcal chain, and these then coalesce into a single, large GcAV. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Rab7 or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rab7 prevented the initial formation of small GcAV structures. Our results demonstrate that mechanisms of GcAV formation includes not only the common machinery of autophagy, but also Rab7 as an additional component, which is dispensable in canonical autophagosome formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Autophagy has become one of the leading edge subjects in science. Autophagy occurs when a cell eats some of its cellular components and digests them. These cellular components may include cytosol and organelles as well as bacteria that has invaded the cell. Thus, autophagy plays an important role in killing pathogens. Here, we introduce an anti-bacterial autophagy called xenophagy. Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GAS) enters HeLa cells and escapes from the endosome into the cytoplasm for its growth. However, autophagy kicks in and traps GAS, thus preventing its survival path. Detailed morphological observation of this process reveals several specific features which were not found in canonical autophagy. These results provide key information about not only anti-bacterial autophagy, but also canonical autophagy.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, also known as Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GAS) is a common pathogen that causes a variety of acute infections including pharyngitis, skin infections, acute rheumatic fever and life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Cunningham1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Following bacterial escape into the cytoplasm, GAS is engulfed by a unique structure named GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. GcAVs acquire lysosomal enzymes leading to GAS degradation.

Autophagy involves the formation of a specialized membrane structure, the autophagosome, which is a spherical structure enclosed by two lipid bilayers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Yoshimori2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The GcAV is considered an &#x0201c;autophagosome-like&#x0201d; structure because of several characteristics shared with autophagosomes. Both structures are labeled with the auophagosomal marker GFP-LC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. LC3 is the mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8, one of over 30 autophagy-related Atg proteins identified in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Kabeya1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Its carboxy terminus is conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine by a ubiquitination-like reaction, and this modification leads to LC3 localization on the autophagosomal membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Ichimura1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, the formation of both structures depends on Atg5, another protein essential for autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Mizushima1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In Atg5 knockout cells, few GcAV are formed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, we showed that the protein complex containing Atg5, Atg12 and Atg16L acted as an E3-like enzyme during LC3 lipidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Fujita1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesize that both GcAV formation and autophagy require this protein complex.</p><p>Despite these similarities, there are several important differences between autophagosomes and GcAVs. The diameter of autophagosomes is 0.5 to 1.0 &#x000b5;m, but GcAV measure nearly 10 &#x000b5;m across <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, majority of canonical autophagy is currently thought to non-selectively take up cytosolic components, but GcAV formation is highly specific for GAS sequestration. Thus, although they share some common mechanisms of formation, these two processes are distinct physiologic phenomena.</p><p>The autophagic machinery has recently been implicated to play a role in several host-pathogen interactions and host defense which included <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, <italic>Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and <italic>Shigella</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Andrade1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Yano1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Gutierrez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Ogawa1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Deretic1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> has the ability to survive within the phagosomal compartment by interfering with phagosome maturation in <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-containing vacuoles (MCVs), but the autophagic pathway can deliver MCVs to the lysosomal degradative pathway for eventual pathogen elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Gutierrez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, ligation of a Toll-like receptor (TLR) at the cell surface leads to its internalization and subsequent recruitment of the autophagic machinery to TLR-containing phagosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Sanjuan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the dynamic processes regulating vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion during GcAV formation are largely undefined. In this paper, we morphologically characterize GcAV formation and identify several mechanistic events that occur during GcAV biogenesis. In particular, we show that Rab7 is required for the early phase of GcAV formation. Based on these findings, we develop a membrane dynamic model of GcAV formation and its relation to canonical autophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Small GcAVs coalesce to form a large, terminal GcAV</title><p>GAS internalized into HeLa cells eventually come to be contained within membrane delimited intracellular structures called GcAVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. We wished to morphologically characterize GcAV formation in greater detail. HeLa cells expressing GFP-LC3 were infected with GAS, fixed 0.5 h after infection, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. A number of different GcAV morphologies were seen that we subcatergorized into four types as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000670-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;D</xref>): type A, a linear chain-like structure; type B, aggregates of GAS-containing vacuoles with a clear GFP-LC3 boundary between each cocci; type C, a larger aggregate of GAS-containing structures with a partially discontinuous inner boundary; and type D, a semi-spherical structure lacking a clear inner boundary. The frequencies of these different structures changed as the time of infection increased. At 0 h, type A was the most frequently observed, but the number of type A structures decreased with time. Conversely, type D structures increased with time from less than 10&#x00025; of GAS containing structures to nearly 50&#x00025;. The observed frequencies of structure types B and C were intermediate, suggesting that these morphologic forms are developmental intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000670-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To confirm this hypothesis, we performed time-lapse imaging of the membrane dynamics in living cells. Several linear chain-like GcAVs (type A) assembled into a collection of grape-like GcAVs (types B), and the boundary between the GAS chains then gradually disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000670-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, as seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000670.s001">Video S1</xref>, two GAS-containing structures fused to form a larger structure with the appearance of type C structures. We next performed immunoelectron microscopy to analyze the nature of structure type D in greater detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000670-g003">Figure 3</xref>). HeLa cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 were infected with GAS and after a 2-h infection, cells were fixed and subjected to immuno electron microscopy (EM) analysis using anti-GFP. GAS was surrounded by single membrane labeled with anti-GFP. Furthermore, these images show that the membrane encompassing the smaller GcAVs is lost upon formation of the larger structures. Taken together, these results indicate that GcAV formation is mediated by the fusion of GAS-containing structures into large, membrane-enclosed compartment.</p><fig id="ppat-1000670-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000670.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Time-dependent morphological changes in GcAVs.</title><p>HeLa cells expressing GFP-LC3 were incubated with GAS for 1 h and fixed at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 h after infection, followed by DAPI staining to visualize GAS.

We expected decreased formation of large GcAV and an accumulation of small GAS-containing structures in Rab7(T22N)-expressing cells, but there was quite little accumulation of GFP-LC3 signal around GAS, indicating that LC3 recruitment to GcAV or GcAV formation is defected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000670-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). GcAv formation was not substantially affected in cells overexpressing WT Rab7 or a GTPase deficient mutant (Q67L) (data not shown).

Each bacterium is enclosed by a membrane and these structures fuse into a membrane-bound structure to form a large spherical GcAV. Rab7 is involved in the early phase of GcAV formation, though it may play a role in later stages as well. The final phase of GcAV formation is the appearance of a semi-spherical large GcAV enclosed by a single membrane. However, because each bacterium is enclosed in a membrane, the generation of a border composed of a single membrane requires the loss of the internal membranes surrounding each GAS. An identical phenomenon is observed during canonical autophagy when the double-membrane lined autophagosome is converted into the single membrane enclosed autolysosome. Additionally, as in canonical autophagy, the inner membrane of the GcAV becomes degraded following the acquisition of lysosomal contents including lipases. Indeed, we previously showed that GcAVs fused with lysosomes during the late stages of their formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, GcAV formation is a highly complex process involving dynamic membrane rearrangements. It is likely that the physiochemical properties including associated proteins govern the size and structure of the terminal GcAV, but the precise factors governing this structure are unknown.</p><p>We identified the precursor structure of the GcAV, and it is a membrane-bound organelle very similar to the isolation membrane of canonical autophagy. Both structures are labeled with LC3 and Atg5, and, although the exact composition of the isolation membrane remains unclear, it is possible that these two structures are identical or, at the very least, share a number of common lipid and protein components.</p><p>One key difference between GcAV formation and canonical autophagy, however, is the specificity of the process, and it is likely that GAS recognition factors are incorporated into the nascent GcAV. Additionally, multiple membrane bound structures are recruited to a GAS chain, and they coalesce to form a larger structure encompassing all of the bacteria. The recruitment and fusion of these vesicles into a larger GcAV may proceed without specific adaptor molecules, or, conversely, another organelle (e.g. lysosomes) may mediate the fusion of two or vesicles simultaneously. In either case, the membrane fusion event is similar to that leading to autophagosome formation. In autophagy, isolation membranes undergo two distinct fusion events: the closing of the isolation membrane during autophagosome formation, and the fusion between autophagosome and lysosome. Therefore, both of our alternative hypotheses are possible and consistent with events known to occur during autophagy. Indeed, we occasionally observed two morphologically distinct membrane structures connected in serial EM sections, consistent with ongoing fusion events.</p><p>Interestingly, inactivation of Rab7 impaired GcAV formation and as a result, intracellular survival of GAS increased. The impact of Rab7 inactivation to the GAS killing is milder than that of the Atg5 knock out, but it may be due to impairment of other cellular process because Rab7 is also involved in broad range of physiological responses through the regulation of endocytosis. Or in the presence of intact canonical autophagosome dependent protein sequestration, some unknown bacterial killing system other than autophagy might be induced to compensate for GcAV function. Members of the Rab family including Rab7 are involved in membrane fusion events throughout the secretory and endocytic pathways. During GcAV formation, however, the pre-fusion intermediate structures did not accumulate in cells expressing the Rab7 dominant-negative mutant. Thus, Rab7 may be necessary for the generation of the precursor membrane structure. However, we observed comparable amounts of GFP-Atg5 associated with GAS in cells expressing the Rab7 dominant-negative mutant, and this event presumably occurs later in GcAV formation. In canonical autophagy, Rab7 is not required for autophagosome formation, but it is essential for the fusion of lysosomes and autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Jager1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Gutierrez2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, if GcAV formation largely recapitulates autophagy, the role of Rab7 in the early stages of GcAV formation may be more complicated than simply mediating precursor formation. Alternatively, Rab7 may be involved in the stabilization of precursor vesicles and/or its delivery to GcAV immediately prior to their association with GAS. The presence of Rab7 on GAS-containing structures during the early phases of GcAV formation is consistent with this possibility. We should also stress the possibility that Rab7 is also involved in the later steps of these processes, such as fusion of isolation membranes, homotypic fusion of small GcAV, fusion between GcAV and lysosome, although our experimental system was unable to directly demonstrate the defects in these subsequent events. Further analyses of the composition and formation of GcAV and all precursor structures will help refine these models.</p><p>In this report, we have further characterized the morphologic features and membrane fusion events associated with GcAV formation. We demonstrated that GcAV formation, while similar to canonical autophagy, has several unique features. The GcAV pathway likely represents a Rab7-dependent evolutionary variation on canonical authophagy to sequester and degrade microorganisms that have evolved strategies to escape from lysosomal degradation. Further studies will identify the mechanism of not only GcAV formation but also of canonical autophagy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>GAS (<italic>S. pyogenes</italic>) strain JRS4 (M6&#x0002b; F1&#x0002b;) was grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (BBL, Cockeysville, MD, USA) supplemented with 0.2&#x00025; yeast extract (THY) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Nakagawa2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa cells, HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Kabeya1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> or GFP-Atg5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000670-Mizushima1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, NIH3T3 cells and 293A (Invitrogen) were maintained in DMEM &#x0005b;Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) containing 9&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, CA, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen)&#x0005d; in a 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C.
