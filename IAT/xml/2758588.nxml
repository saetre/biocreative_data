Previously we reported that a fraction of Tec1 protein is sumoylated on residue lysine 54 in normally growing cells. Here we describe regulation and functional consequences of Tec1 sumoylation. We found that activation of Kss1, the MAPK that directly activates Tec1, results in a decrease in Tec1 sumoylation and a concurrent increase of Tec1 transcriptional activity. Consistent with a role of sumoylation in inhibiting Tec1 activity, specifically increasing sumoylation of Tec1 by fusing it to the sumoylating enzyme Ubc9 leads to a dramatic decrease of Tec1 transcriptional activity. Invasive growth is also compromised in Tec1-Ubc9. In contrast, fusing sumoylation-site mutant Tec1, i.e., Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>, to Ubc9 did not significantly alter transcriptional activation and had a less effect on invasive growth. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for regulated sumoylation as a mechanism to modulate the activity of Tec1 and validate Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation as a useful approach for studying protein sumoylation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>All cells have the capacity to make appropriate responses to signals perceived from their environment.

Although MAP kinases can phosphorylate a range of cytosolic substrates to execute their functions, their main effects in regulating cell development are achieved via activation of specific transcription factors. Thus understanding how transcription factors are controlled by MAP kinases is critical for a clear elucidation of MAP kinase signaling mechanisms. Previously, we demonstrated that Tec1, a transcription factor controlled by a MAP kinase Kss1 in yeast, is modified by a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We were interested in whether the modification is regulated by the activation status of Kss1 and what functional roles sumoylation of Tec1 may have in regulating signaling outcome of the Kss1-mediated invasive pathway. It has been technically difficult to address these questions however, partly due to a lack of a stimulus that can be conveniently used to specifically stimulate Kss1 but not any other MAP kinases. Consequently, whether sumoylation could serve as a mechanism for Kss1 to modulate the transcriptional activity of Tec1 is still unknown.</p><p>To obtain a system in which Kss1 is the only MAP kinase that is predominantly activated, we utilized the substantial component sharing between the Kss1-mediated invasive pathway and the Hog1-mediated high-osmolarity pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Breitkreutz1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In response to an increase in osmolarity, cells activate an enzyme cascade that leads to activation of Ste11, a MAP kinase kinase kinase which is the direct upstream kinase of both Ste7 in the Kss1-mediated invasive pathway and Pbs2 in the Hog1-mediated high-osmolarity pathway. It has been shown that removal of Pbs2 can lead to specific activation of Ste7 and consequently activation of Kss1 by hyperosmolarity stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Shock1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-ORourke1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Hao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

This approach has been successfully used in our previous study to demonstrate sumoylation of Tec1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, treatment by 0.5 M KCl led to a rapid and substantial inhibition of Tec1 sumoylation, as evidenced by a more than three-fold decrease in the ratio of sumoylated Tec1 versus non-sumoylated Tec1, about 15 minutes after salt treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The decrease of sumoylation correlated very well with an increase of Kss1 activity, as revealed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphor-Kss1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting an inhibitory role of Kss1 on sumoylation of Tec1. It is possible that the rapid inhibitory effect of salt treatment on Tec1 sumoylation is purely due to an alteration of osmolarity <italic>per se</italic> and would occur with or without Kss1 activation. In that case, treatment of wild type cells instead of the <italic>pbs2&#x00394;</italic> mutant with the same concentration of salt should similarly repress Tec1 sumoylation.

To test this model, we sought to examine the effects of enhancing Tec1 sumoylation. A prediction is that enhancement of Tec1 sumoylation would lead to further repression of Tec1 transcriptional activity and consequently would impair invasive growth. In order to specifically enhance sumoylation of Tec1 but not any other SUMO targets, we employed a recently developed approach named <underline>U</underline>bc9 <underline>f</underline>usion <underline>d</underline>irected <underline>s</underline>umoylation (UFDS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Jakobs1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Niedenthal1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In this approach, a fusion protein between a substrate and the SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9 is used to direct sumoylation of the substrate.

A similar fusion between the sumoylation site mutant Tec1<sup>K54R</sup> and Ubc9 was constructed as a control to assess whether UFDS directed sumoylation occurs on the known endogenous sumoylation site on Tec1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We then examined sumoylation of fusion proteins via immunopurification and immunoblotting with antibodies against SUMO, FLAG, as well as Ubc9.

The ratio of signals from sumoylated proteins versus non-sumoylated proteins (the Flag blot) increased even more in the Tec1-Ubc9 fusion. Importantly, sumoylation of Tec1-Ubc9 mainly occurs on the authentic sumoylation site Lys54 of Tec1, as the sumoylation signal is much diminished in Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This is especially apparent in the blot probed with Ubc9 antibody that can detect both sumoylated and non-sumoylated species of the fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007456-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007456.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation (UFDS) of Tec1.</title><p><italic>A</italic>, whole cell lysates from <italic>tec1&#x00394;</italic> cells transformed with plasmids that express triple-FLAG-tagged Tec1, a Tec1-Ubc9 fusion, a Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 fusion, or the parent vector were immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG resin and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-SUMO, anti-FLAG, or anti-Ubc9 antibodies.

One common function of sumoylation is regulating protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Johnson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Tec1 requires dimerization with Ste12 to be functional, thus it is possible increasing sumoylation of Tec1 might impact its interaction with Ste12. To test this, we immunopurified Flag-tagged Tec1-Ubc9, and Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 fusion proteins and probed the purified samples for co-purified Ste12. For immuno detection of Ste12, the cells used for immunoprecipitation also expressed an N-terminal poly-Myc tagged version of Ste12 (18-Myc-Ste12). 18-Myc-Ste12 was used because the multiple epitopes enhance detection and it has been shown previously that the tag does not affect activity of Ste12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Zeitlinger1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Both fusion proteins were able to pull down Ste12, and there was no decrease in the amount of Ste12 that co-purified with Tec1-Ubc9 as compared with Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These data indicate that increased sumoylation displayed by Tec1-Ubc9 does not alter its interaction with Ste12.</p><p>We then examined whether signaling output is affected by increased sumoylation of Tec1. For this purpose, we first measured the transcriptional activity of Tec1-Ubc9 using the <italic>FRE-lacZ</italic> reporter as before. Strikingly, Tec1-Ubc9 exhibits nearly no <italic>FRE-lacZ</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The lack of transcriptional activity of Tec1-Ubc9 apparently is not due to the fusion of Ubc9, as a similarly constructed fusion protein Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 has only slightly decreased <italic>FRE-lacZ</italic> activity as compared to wild type Tec1. To examine whether inhibition of <italic>FRE</italic> transcription by Tec1-Ubc9 has any biological consequence, we compared the invasive growth of Tec1, Tec1-Ubc9 and Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9. Consistent with the results from transcription assays, invasive growth is significantly diminished in Tec1-Ubc9 cells but was decreased to a less extent in Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). To examine whether Tec1-Ubc9 has any dominant-negative effect on wild type Tec1, we compared the <italic>FRE-lacZ</italic> activity in wild type cells that express either an empty vector or Tec1-Ubc9. Interestingly, Tec1-Ubc9 displayed a slightly inhibitory effect on wild type Tec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007456-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).

By taking advantage of the unique behavior of <italic>pbs2&#x00394;</italic> cells, which display hyperosmolarity-stimulated specific activation of Kss1, we demonstrated that Tec1 sumoylation is regulated by Kss1. Specifically, we demonstrated that activation of Kss1 leads to a significant decrease in Tec1 sumoylation. Using the recently developed UFDS (Ubc9 fusion dependent sumoylation) strategy, we also showed that specifically enhancing Tec1 sumoylation dramatically inhibits its activity. Together, our study provides evidence that the Kss1-regulated decrease of Tec1 sumoylation serves as a mechanism for activating Tec1.</p><p>What could be the mechanism by which Kss1 regulates the sumoylation level of Tec1? One possibility is that Kss1 can directly phosphorylate Tec1 and phosphorylation targets Tec1 for desumoylation. It has been demonstrated previously that Tec1 can be phosphorylated by Fus3, the MAP kinase of the pheromone signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Bao1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Chou1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Bruckner1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, but whether Tec1 is also a substrate of Kss1 remains to be determined. Another possibility is that Kss1 might have a regulatory role for the machinery that controls Tec1 sumoylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is not without precedent that a MAP kinase can regulate the activity of enzymes critical for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifications. For instance, it has been reported previously that JNK can regulate the activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Gao1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The possibility that Kss1 may inhibit the main components of the sumoylation pathway such as Ubc9 is unlikely, however. Under the same condition that we detected stimulus-dependent decrease of Tec1 sumoylation, the global level of protein sumoylation is increased (Irqeba and Wang, unpublished observation), indicating that Kss1 does not have a general role of inhibiting protein sumoylation.</p><p>One often utilized strategy for studying the function of protein sumoylation is determining the consequences of diminishing or enhancing the sumoylation level of the protein. Identifying and mutating the acceptor lysine residues is one of the commonly used approaches for blocking sumoylation. However, certain limitations are associated with this approach. For instance, a number of modifications such as ubiquitination, acetylation and methylation can occur on lysine residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Kruse1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore it is not necessarily appropriate to attribute the phenotype of a sumoylation site mutant solely to a change in sumoylation. A complementary approach is to examine the consequence of enhancing the sumoylation level of the protein. Inactivating desumoylating enzyme(s) is commonly used for that purpose. However, sumoylation of many substrates would be affected by this approach, since there exist only very limited numbers of desumoylating enzymes. For instance, in budding yeast, Ulp1 and Ulp2 are the only two known desumoylating enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Li1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Li2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, and Ulp1 is responsible for most of the desumoylating events. Inhibiting Ulp1 will increase the sumoylation level of many substrates in addition to Tec1. The recently developed Ubc9-fusion dependent sumoylation (UFDS) overcomes the limitation, and can be used to specifically enrich the sumoylation of a specific substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Niedenthal1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Using this approach, we showed that specifically enhancing Tec1 sumoylation dramatically inhibits its transcriptional activity. The behavior of Tec1-Ubc9 and Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 provided some useful insights as to how sumoylation may inhibit Tec1 activity. Since nearly the same amounts of non-sumoylated species of Tec1-Ubc9 and Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 are present in the cells, the dramatically different signaling phenotypes of cells that express Tec1-Ubc9 and Tec1<sup>K54R</sup>-Ubc9 must originate from the sumoylation of Tec1-Ubc9. This notion is supported by our data that Tec1-Ubc9 can dominantly inhibit Tec1 activity.</p><p>How would sumoylated Tec1-Ubc9 inhibit transcription? One possibility is that it recruits transcriptional repressors to the promoter regions that are controlled by Tec1. To test this possibility, we examined the signaling behavior of Tec1-Ubc9 in cells that lack known Tec1 repressors Dig1 and Dig2. However, the inhibitory effect of Tec1-Ubc9 on signaling cannot be relieved by deletion of either <italic>DIG1</italic> or <italic>DIG2</italic> genes (data not shown). It is still possible that other more general transcriptional repressors such as histone deacetylases might be recruited. Future work will be directed to identify the proteins that might specifically interact with sumoylated Tec1-Ubc9, and to test whether these unknown proteins might play important roles in determining the signaling output of invasive pathways.</p><p>Ste12 is also sumoylated and its sumoylation is stimulated by pheromone treatment, a condition that activates both Fus3 and Kss1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus the regulation of Ste12 sumoylation appears to be different from that of Tec1. It would be interesting to understand why sumoylation of these two related transcriptional factors are regulated differently by their upstream kinases. Distinct from Tec1, the principle sumoylation site on Ste12 has not been identified yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007456-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Future work should be directed to identify Ste12 sumoylation site(s) and examine the functional consequences of inhibiting Ste12 sumoylation (via Lys-to-Arg mutation of the sumoylation site). Conceivably, once the sumoylation site on Ste12 is identified, the UFDS approach could also be applied to examine the functional consequences of Ste12 sumoylation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
