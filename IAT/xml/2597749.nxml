A<sub>1</sub>RHz mice had a behavioral profile similar to WT mice perinatally exposed to caffeine. Furthermore, it appeared that the mother's genotype, not offspring's, was critical for behavioral changes in adult offspring. Thus, if the mother partially lacked A<sub>1</sub> receptors the offspring displayed more hyperactivity and responded more strongly to cocaine stimulation as adults than did mice of a WT mother, regardless of their genotype. This indicates that long-term behavioral alterations in the offspring result from the maternal effect of caffeine, and not a direct effect on fetus.

The total worldwide consumption of caffeine (irrespective of source) has been estimated to approximately 70 to 76 mg/person/day. Interestingly, the levels of caffeine intake in countries such as Sweden and Finland reach more than 400 mg/person/day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Fredholm1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Although health consequences of ordinary caffeine consumption are probably minor there are concerns about caffeine intake during pregnancy and lactation. It is notable that in contrast to alcohol and tobacco consumption during pregnancy, approximately 70&#x00025; of expectant mothers continue to drink beverages containing caffeine at normal or near normal rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Olsen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Bracken1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Human and animal studies have shown that high caffeine intake represents a risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes and teratological consequences in offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Klebanoff1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Cnattingius1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. There are many animal studies on the effect of caffeine intake by dams, and often rather high doses of this substance (&#x0003e;50 mg/kg) have been studied. It is therefore important to note that the behavioral effects of caffeine are characterized by a biphasic dose-effect relationship. At low to moderate doses (50 to 300 mg, i.e. 1 to 3 cups of coffee), caffeine induces a central stimulation in humans, eliciting feelings of wellbeing, alertness, energy and ability to concentrate. In contrast, the subjective effects induced by caffeine at higher doses (300 to 800 mg) are characterized by negative feelings such as anxiety, nervousness and insomnia, a condition sometimes referred to as &#x0201c;caffeinism&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Nehlig1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In laboratory animals the behavioural effects of caffeine are also biphasic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Daly1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, low doses (&#x0003c;25 mg/kg) of caffeine are similar to psychomotor stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine, whereas at higher doses caffeine has effects that are similar to a diverse set of other agents such as benzodiazepine-inverse agonists and phencyclidine (PCP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Mumford1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In low doses, which are the most relevant to human use, caffeine effects are exerted by antagonizing brain adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors with secondary effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Fredholm1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. There is little evidence that these doses produce teratological effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Nehlig2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. One concern about early exposure to low or modest doses of caffeine relates to hyperactivity in late adolescence or adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Linnet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Early exposure to psychostimulant drugs may lead to a phenomenon called &#x0201c;neuronal imprinting&#x0201d; where a drug may have effects that are not necessarily immediate but manifest later in life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Andersen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Relating to the fact that the rewarding properties of all psychostimulants, including to some extent caffeine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Daly1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, are a result of actions of the drugs on the mesolimbic dopamine system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Feldman1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, early exposure to caffeine might also produce late consequences e.g. in the reaction to other psychoactive drugs.</p><p>It is often tacitly assumed that the reason that psychoactive drugs have long-term behavioral consequences is due to the affected fetal brain. However, it is clearly also possible that the drug affects maternal physiology or behavior in such a way that there are long-term consequences in the offspring. It will always be difficult to discriminate between these two possibilities when only drug administration is used. We therefore wanted to see if aspects of the effects of caffeine could be mimicked by genetic targeting of one of the adenosine receptors, since this might allow a separation into maternal or filial effects.</p><p>The present study was designed to further assess the behavioural status, including motor functions and psychomotor activation of adult animals whose mothers were exposed to caffeine during pregnancy and lactation and their response to the psychostimulant cocaine. The rationale behind testing the response to another psychoactive stimulus in these animals is that caffeine, itself a motor stimulant, might be expected to change the motor activity in response to cocaine. Some neurochemical measurements were also made. We found that some effects of perinatal exposure to caffeine were mimicked in mice heterozygous for adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors, which have half the normal number of such receptors. This is relevant because regular human consumption of caffeine leads to the blockade of about half of the body's A<sub>1</sub> receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Perinatal caffeine exposure</title><p>Adult WT mice, 8&#x02013;10 weeks of age, were perinatally exposed to 0.3 g/l caffeine in the drinking water given to the dams from GD1 to PND21.

In most, but not all of these earlier studies, perinatal caffeine in doses similar to those we used caused a slight hyperlocomotion of the offspring even in the absence of a drug challenge.

The mechanisms underlying the behavioral features associated with caffeine, and psycho-stimulants in general, are believed to be related to the activation of dopamine (DA) receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine system (notably in the nucleus accumbens).

We cannot rule out that also shorter periods of caffeine treatment before the pregnancy could have effects, but most data on humans suggest a complete return of physiological functions after cessation of caffeine use, for reference see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Fredholm1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In female mice, we found no evidence that long term oral caffeine intake in the doses given here alters overall activity, or the location of activity (central vs. peripheral), which may be somewhat related to anxiety following a period of caffeine exposure (Eriksson, Yang, Salmi and Fredholm, unpublished data). Furthermore, we did not observe any gross alteration in maternal behavior in the caffeine treated dams. We therefore favour the hypothesis that maternal caffeine use during a critical period of fetal development is the most important.</p><p>In practically all previous studies on perinatal caffeine effects, the focus in the discussion has been on the fetus. Indeed, caffeine readily crosses the placenta without metabolism and partially enters breast milk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Grosso1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The human fetus and newborn infant is exposed to caffeine for a prolonged period of its early life as liver enzymes which metabolize caffeine are not present until eight months of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Grosso1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is clearly also possible that the relevant action is on the mother.

However, to completely differentiate between maternal and fetal actions in this period will be virtually impossible when examining drug administration, which by necessity must be through the mother. This is why we tried to find a genetic model that could mimic some aspects of exposure to caffeine.</p><p>The present data show that several features of perinatal caffeine administration, notably the enhanced response to cocaine, can be mimicked by deletions of the A<sub>1</sub> receptor, a known target of caffeine, whereas it was known since before that deletion of both copies of the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor had the opposite effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Chen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. We also found that the deletion of only one of the copies of the A<sub>1</sub> receptor gene, resulting in approximately half the number of receptors in cortex and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Johansson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> but also in regions of more direct relevance here (present data), enhanced the response to cocaine. By contrast, deletion of one of the copies of the A<sub>2A</sub> gene reduces the response to cocaine (Jiang-Fan Chen, personal communication) albeit not to the same extent as removal of both copies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Chen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It is important to note that the A<sub>1</sub> heterozygous mouse still responds to adenosine, but approximately twice as much of the agonist is needed for the same response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Johansson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Johansson3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Such a parallel shift of the dose-response is also achieved by caffeine at concentrations close to the K<sub>d</sub> for the antagonist (10&#x02013;30 &#x000b5;M), concentrations that are attained by the doses of caffeine used in the present experiments.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that the effect of caffeine on the behavior of the offspring was (at least partially) mirrored by the A<sub>1</sub> receptor deletion, whereas the stimulatory responses of caffeine are generally dependent on the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-ElYacoubi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Ledent1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> although A<sub>1</sub> receptors contribute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Ferre1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Kuzmin2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-KarczKubicha1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Halldner1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that the effect is not simply due to psychostimulant actions where A<sub>2A</sub> receptors are very important, but that some other features must be involved. It is probably relevant that we have previously demonstrated that the ability of a low dose of caffeine to cause reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior could be mimicked by A<sub>1</sub>-, but not by A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Kuzmin3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, even though A<sub>2A</sub> antagonists per se tend to produce at least as large increases in locomotion that do A<sub>1</sub>R antagonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Kuzmin2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-KarczKubicha1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Svenningsson1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although a link between the perinatal caffeine use and dopaminergic mechanisms is possible the above data and considerations suggest that the relationship is not simple. Whereas the blockade of A<sub>2A</sub> receptors has been linked to psychostimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-ElYacoubi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Ledent1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, blockade of A<sub>1</sub> receptors may instead be related to enhanced glutamatergic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Fredholm1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Johansson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.Our examination of various neurochemical parameters did not provide any direct evidence for a major disruption of the dopaminergic pathways involved in psychostimulation. We did find an elevation of preproenkephalinA mRNA levels in caudate-putamen. Enkephalin-expressing neurons project to globus pallidus, a brain region that has been demonstrated to be smaller in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Swanson1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The potential association between perinatal exposure to caffeine and ADHD in later life needs to be further evaluated. The precise mechanisms underlying the behavioural enhancement in the mouse offspring therefore remains to be explained. It was also not the major focus of this study.</p><p>Instead the aim was to use the genetic model to try to elucidate whether the enhancement of cocaine responses in the offspring was due to a primary effect on the mother or the fetus/pup. The approach we used with a genetic study makes it possible to investigate this aspect, which would not be possible using drugs (since it is impossible to administer psychoactive drugs only to the dam and not to the fetus, and vice versa). The results very clearly indicate the first possibility. Thus, if the mother partially lacked A<sub>1</sub> receptors, the offspring displayed hyperactivity during habituations and responded more strongly to cocaine as adults, regardless of their own genotype. Also, the offspring of wild type mothers showed no behavioral changes, even if they themselves lacked A<sub>1</sub> receptors (i.e. their fathers lacked A<sub>1</sub> receptors). The apparent lack of importance of the fetal brain A<sub>1</sub> receptors is supported by other evidence. Even if adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors are present, albeit sparse, in the embryonic brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Rivkees1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, these receptors appear to be poorly coupled to G proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-den1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. A maternal effect of caffeine related to adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor signalling was also shown in a recent study where adenylyl cyclase inhibition by an adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist was decreased only in the mother but not the fetal brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Leon1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>What changes that occur specifically in the pregnant mice that brings about the long-lasting behavioral effects we demonstrate here in the offspring is not known, and will need consideration in future studies. Our experiments performed on the second generation of mice whose grandmother was A<sub>1</sub>R Hz but mother a WT still showed increased response to stimulation with cocaine compared to the WT mice whose both mother and grandmother were wild types. This indicates that long-term behavioral alterations in the offspring may greatly depend on a maternal effect of caffeine and not a direct effect in the fetus, and that some epigenetic effect may be involved.</p><p>Epigenetic change to the genome (e.g. in DNA methylation) not only determine the phenotype of the offspring but can sometimes be passed on to the second generation. These processes of transgenerational passage of changes in genomic DNA methylation can occur in both female and male lineage, as the transmission is only via the gamets and can equally apply to sperm and ova <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Pembrey1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, epigenetical transmission from father or mother could have the effects on the developmental responses in the offspring. In our study, we have controlled for the mother's and grandmother's genotype in A<sub>1</sub>R Hz offspring but not for the father's or grandfather's genotype. There were two reasons for not considering the paternal genotype. Firstly we wanted to relate our findings to the exposure of mouse dams to caffeine. Clearly paternal effects can not be very important here. Secondly we noted in a separate study that life-long exposure (including perinatal exposure) to caffeine did not cause behavioral changes in the male but did in female mice (Salmi P, Fredholm BB unpublished data).</p><p>In summary, we found that adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous offspring had a behavioral profile of hyperactivity quite similar to normal mice exposed perinatally to caffeine. Furthermore, it appeared that the genotype of the dam, not the offspring, was critical for behavioral changes in adult offspring. We hypothesize that perinatal caffeine, by acting on adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors in the mother, appears to be responsible for the long-lasting behavioral changes in the offspring. It should be remembered, however, that at this point it is not possible to conclude whether the long-lasting behavioral changes observed here are detrimental or beneficial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Three types of mice were used: <italic>adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor knock-out</italic> (A<sub>1</sub>R KO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003977-Johansson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>mice heterozygous for the adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor</italic> (A<sub>1</sub>R Hz) and <italic>C57BL/6 mice</italic> (wild type, WT).

The first set of animals received 0.3 g/l caffeine and the second was given tap water only, and served as control. The exposure time ranged from gestational day (GD) 1 to day 21 of lactation, i.e. postnatal day (PND) 21. That is why the term &#x0201c;perinatal&#x0201d; is here used to denote the period of pregnancy and the 21 days after birth. The offspring was analyzed with behavioral tests at two months of age.</p><sec id="s4c1"><title>Behavioral evaluation</title><p>All behavioral tests were performed during the light period between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. The animals were separated into groups based on exposure (caffeine, water, A<sub>1</sub>R Hz from A<sub>1</sub>R Hz mothers) and stimulation (cocaine or saline). Males and females were analyzed separately (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6&#x02013;25 mice in each exposure group, selected randomly from 2&#x02013;4 independent litters).

The rotarod test, including the training session, was performed during the first day. Mice were allowed to rest the next day, and on the third day two open field habituation sessions were performed. The challenge with cocaine, preceded by another habituation session, was done on the fourth day. For this purpose the mice from each exposure group were divided into two sets, one stimulated with cocaine, the other receiving saline. A<sub>1</sub>R KO and their WT littermates were also analysed according to the 4 day protocol explained above.</p><p>Regarding adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous mice, and their wild type littermates, four different groups of offspring were tested: 1) wild type mice born to an adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous mother, 2) adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous mice born to an adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous mother, 3) adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous mice born to a wild-type mother, and 4) wild type mice born to a wild type mother.

The open field arena was equipped with two rows of photocells sensitive to infrared light, each row having 16 photocells per side. The space between the photocells was 31 mm and the outermost was placed 17.5 mm from the wall. The number of photocell interruptions was collected by a computer and the following variables were recorded and analysed: horizontal activity (Ha, total number of beam breakings), locomotion (L, interruptions of photocells in the lower rows when there is a new beam broken, i.e. the animal has made an actual transfer) and rearing activity (Ra, all interruptions of photocells in the upper rows). This equipment does not allow recording small movements, e.g. tremor, reflexes and tail movements.
