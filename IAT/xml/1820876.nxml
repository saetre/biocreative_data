Introduction</title><p>Polycomb/trithorax proteins are epigenetic regulators of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein is a mammalian homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> trithorax, functioning as a transcriptional maintenance factor during morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. In fact, MLL normally regulates transcription initiation and elongation of a specific set of HOX genes. The human MLL gene on chromosome 11 is frequently translocated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), generating chimeric proteins composed of amino-terminal MLL and carboxyl-terminal partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. The reciprocal chimera can also occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. There is evidence implicating these chimeras in dys-regulation of normal MLL-mediated HOX gene expression, leading to ALL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. Importantly, three AFF members (AF4, LAF4, MCEF, see below), are partners for MLL translocations, suggesting a role as transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>.</p><p>The human AF4 gene (designated HUMAN AFF1 by the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), on chromosome 4, activates transcription when fused to the DNA binding domain of yeast Gal 4 (GAL4), and tethered to a promoter with Gal 4 DNA binding sites (G4DBS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. In mice, AF4 is expressed in lymphoid tissues and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. Although knockout AF4 mice appear affected only in lymphoid tissues, it has recently been established that AF4 plays a role in the CNS, where a single aa mutation, modifying a Siah site, is associated with Purkinje cell loss; highlighting that even for the best studied AFF member, we still know little about its normal function in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>.</p><p>The human FMR2 gene (designated HUMAN AFF2 by HGNC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) on chromosome X, has not been implicated in leukemia. Silencing FMR2 is involved in mild mental retardation (MMR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. FMR2 is highly expressed in brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. As for AF4, GAL4-FMR2 activates transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>.</p><p>The human LAF4 gene (designated HUMAN AFF3 by HGNC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) on chromosome 2, parallels AF4 expression, and is implicated in ALL and breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>. Mouse LAF4 likely acts in lymphoid and CNS development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>. As for AF4 and FMR2, GAL4-LAF4, activates transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>.</p><p>The human MCEF gene (designated HUMAN AFF4 by the HGNC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref> and also known as AF5q31) on chromosome 5, codes for a 1,163 aa protein with regions of homology to other AFF members, designated NHD, ALF, pSer, CHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. MCEF is expressed in adult heart, with lower levels in placenta, skeletal muscle, pancreas and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. Higher expression occurs in fetal compared to adult lung and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Unexpectedly, MCEF knockout mice were recently shown to be azoospermic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>.</p><p>Despite the growing list of pathologies implicating AFF members, little is known about their structure/function relationships. For this paper, we first mined databases for AFF sequences from multiple species, and determined phylogenetically that AFFs form sister clades, suggesting they have a common <italic>Bilateria</italic> ancestor. We then characterized MCEF <italic>in silico, </italic>finding seven putative NLS, within 3 of 21 exons. In HeLa cells, we showed that a full-length MCEF-EGFP fusion protein was nuclear. We consequently made twenty constructs expressing MCEF deletions, to test for functional NLS. We found that distinct protein sequences, encoded by three separate exons could mediate nuclear localization, only two of which were predicted <italic>in silico</italic>. Importantly, we also found that MCEF can directly repress RNA Polymerase II transcription of HIV-1 LTR-directed Tat-transactivation, in HeLa cells. These results establish that MCEF is a bonafide nuclear transcription factor, and suggest that portions of MCEF may be useful in designing a protein to be used in chimeric transcription factor repression (CTFR) of HIV-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>2.

The CMV-RL construct (Promega) was used to analyze the effects of MCEF on the CMV promoter, with results represented as fold repression, compared to fold repression of LTR, both in the presence or absence of Tat.

Results</title><p><bold>AFFs form sister clades.</bold> Few AFF sequences have been published. As a result, we mined databases to determine which species have AFF sequences. We found complete or partial AFF sequences in Fly, Zebra fish, Puffer fish, Frog, Chicken, Cow, Rat, Mouse, Orangutan, Macac, Chimpanzee and Humans (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and not shown). To establish which AFF members most resemble MCEF, we phylogenetically analyzed AFF members from various species, and found that AFF1 and AFF4 are sister clades, as are AFF2 and AFF3, with bootstrap values of 100% and 99% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The distinct sequences for MCEF and Af5q31, result from the fact that they represent nearly identical but distinct clones. The AFF4 sequence is also distinct, but nearly identical to MCEF, since it is a theoretical consensus sequence.</p><p><bold>MCEF has seven putative NLS.</bold><italic>In silico</italic>, the 21 exon MCEF gene on chromosome 5 was found to span 88,283 bp, to be transcribed into a 9,580 b mRNA and to code for a 1,163 aa protein, with seven putative NLS, distributed over 4 regions, designated 1/2, 3/4, 5, 6/7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The putative NLS are outside the NHD, ALF, pSer, CHD and a putative transcription activation domain (TAD) regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. <italic>In silico</italic>, we also found seven high scoring putative PEST (PP1 to PP7) sequences, in addition to a previously reported Siah site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>. PEST and Siah1 sites are involved in proteosome protein turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>.</p><p><bold>MCEF localizes to the nucleus. </bold>Although T-cells are a preferred target for HIV-1, the HeLa cell was selected for our studies because: (i) our MCEF clone was derived from HeLa cells, and (ii) we have previously shown that MCEF represses HIV-1 transcription in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. To determine MCEF localization, we transfected HeLa cells with a construct over-expressing a full-length MCEF-EGFP fusion protein. In contrast to EGFP or DsRed alone, green fluorescence was strictly nuclear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; a and b, versus c). Despite the compartmentalized restriction, we estimated the expression at 1/20 that of EGFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, c-1 versus a, and Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B upper graph). The cells in panel c-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and all subsequent panels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, d to w), were photographed after laser power was adjusted to approximately match EGFP or DsRed expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>a and b). However, the data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B and C upper graphs, is quantitative. Using this data, we calculated the % change in nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of EGFP, as a result of MCEF fusion, using a 20% change as indicative of localization signals. Clearly, there is at least one NLS in MCEF, since its fusion to EGFP results in an approximately 60% change in nuclear localization, accompanied by a corresponding -60% cytoplasmic localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B lower graph).</p><p><bold>The C-terminal half of MCEF mediates nuclear localization. </bold>To map nuclear localization sequences in HeLa cells, we transfected constructs expressing MCEF deletion mutants, fused to EGFP and/or DsRed proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). N-terminal MCEF localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas C-terminal MCEF localized only to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; d, versus f and g). This is consistent with <italic>in silico</italic> C-terminal prediction of NLS (see above). Fusion of PP3 alone to EGFP, had no effect on localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; e versus a).</p><p><bold>NLS 1, and 5, within exons XI and XII, mediate nuclear localization.</bold> From the C-terminal portion of MCEF, a construct containing NLS 1 and 2, fused to EGFP, resulted in nuclear localization, whereas a construct with only NLS 2, did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; h versus i). This indicates NLS 1 is functional. However, constructs containing NLS 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, also localized to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; j, k). A construct with only NLS 3, 4 and 5, also localized to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; l). We also tested PP6 fused to EGFP, but found no effect on EGFP localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; m versus a). Five additional constructs containing either NLS 3, 4, or sequences between NLS 3, 4 and NLS 1, 2, all failed to localize fused EGFP to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; n, o, p, q, r). In contrast, a construct containing NLS 3, 4 and 5, localized exclusively to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; s). This indicates that in addition to NLS 1, in exon XI, NLS 5 in exon XII, is functional.</p><p><bold>A non-NLS sequence within exon XIII, mediates nuclear localization. </bold>To test NLS 6 and 7, we made a construct encompassing the C-terminal 804-1,163 aa and found that it localized to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; t). Surprisingly, a further deletion to aa 846, ablated nuclear localization, despite leaving NLS 6 and 7 intact (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; u). We further tested NLS 6 and 7 directly and confirmed no nuclear localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; v). This suggests NLS 6 and 7 are not functional, but another sequence, containing aa 804-845, can mediate nuclear localization. In fact, sequences from 804-845, were able to mediate nuclear localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; w). These results establish that a non-NLS sequence, within exon XIII mediates nuclear localization, in addition to the sequences in exons XI and XII, summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>.</p><p><bold>MCEF represses HIV-1 Tat Transactivation. </bold>Because MCEF was isolated as a co-immunoprecipitating protein with P-TEFb (see discussion), we directly tested its ability to impinge Tat-transactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. In order to ensure that our construct was in fact expressing MCEF, we tested the expression, in a coupled transcription-translation reaction, and a band of the expected size was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>D, lane 4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. In the absence of Tat, MCEF had a minimal effect upon HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription, 0.7 fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). However, in the presence of Tat, it repressed Tat-transactivation, 2.4 fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). In order to test for promoter specificity of the repression, we tested the CMV promoter in the presence or absence of Tat and in the presence or absence of MCEF. These were the exact same conditions used for the LTR experiments. Under these conditions, MCEF had a minimal activation effect, independent of the presence or absence of Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). Similarly, we found that the TK promoter was also un-affected by MCEF expression (not shown).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>All AFF sequences we mined, came from <italic>Deuterostomia</italic>, except the Fly sequence (<italic>Arthropoda</italic>). This suggests the ancestor to <italic>Deuterostome</italic> AFFs, is at least as old as the common ancestor to <italic>Deuterostome</italic> and <italic>Ecdysozoa</italic> (from which <italic>Arthropoda </italic>developed), which is <italic>Bilateria </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. As more AFF-like sequences are discovered in species distant to humans, they should be classified according to where they fall on a robust tree, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. In Fly, there appears to be only one distantly related family member, <italic>Drosophila</italic> lilliputian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Since three of the four AFFs are known to be involved in translocations, it is entirely possible that the four AFFs developed from ancestral duplications of a single sequence, as the <italic>Bilateria </italic>evolved, approximately 600 million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>.</p><p>Precedent for differentially spliced AFF isoforms, was set by OX19, an FMR2 variant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. PEST sequences are involved in proteosome pathway degradation of proteins, and interestingly, a Siah1 site, conserved in AFF members, is involved in proteosome pathway degradation of AFF1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>. Therefore, our <italic>in silico</italic> results initially suggested MCEF, or differentially spliced MCEF isoforms, containing exons XI, and/or XII and/or XIV, would be nuclear, with expression levels of at least some isoforms, regulated by proteosomal turnover. The experimental data however, indicated that only the bipartite NLS 1, and NLS 5, in exons XI and XII were functional in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>. Interestingly, we also discovered that a non-NLS containing sequence, in exon XIII, mediates nuclear localization. One possibility is that this sequence is a binding region involved in co-transport via association with another nuclear localized factor. In this regards, MCEF is known to interact with such a factor, P-TEFb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. Further experiments will be required to test if this same interaction is involved in the nuclear localization through exon XIII.</p><p>Our results suggest that the fusion of full-length MCEF to EGFP, reduces expression levels by a factor of 20 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, upper graph; a versus c-1 or c-2). However, we could not map this reduced expression level to specific Pest sites. Further experiments will be required to determine if the Pest sites are indeed functional or not, in mediating expression levels. Alternatively, Kozak sequences affect expression levels in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>. In fact, the naturally-occurring MCEF Kozak sequence is weak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. However, the weak Kozak sequence in our original MCEF cDNA clone, was replaced in the MCEF-EGFP fusion constructs. At any rate, our results show that MCEF isoforms with exons XI, XII and XIII, will be nuclear, and suggest translational or post-translational control of MCEF expression levels may be occurring.</p><p>MCEF was initially cloned as a protein immunoprecipitating with P-TEFb, itself composed of CDK9 and Cyclin T <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat, P-TEFb and a nascent RNA stem-loop structure called TAR, form a ternary complex, permitting CDK9 to hyperphosphorylate the RNA Polymerase II Carboxy Terminal Domain (Pol II CTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. This hyperphosphorylation is essential for transcription elongation to occur at the HIV-1 LTR promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> E). Previous tethering of GAL4-AF5q31 or GAL4-MCEF, did not activate a minimal promoter with G4DBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. However, tethering of GAL4-MCEF repressed an enhancer containing promoter, and ectopic MCEF expression has been previously shown to repress HIV-1 replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. It is therefore significant that MCEF represses Tat-transactivation (this paper), and we propose the model illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> E. In this model, MCEF interactions with P-TEFb would interfere with the proper formation of the ternary complex (see above), possibly inhibiting CDK9 hyperphosphorylation of the RNA Pol II CTD. This mechanism may appear to be at odds with another groups data, where they failed to inhibit P-TEFb phosphorylation of the RNA Pol II CTD, with AF5q31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. However, their results were derived outside the cellular environment, and they did not look at the assembled RNA Pol II complex on a promoter, in the presence of Tat and TAR, as would be the case in our assays inside HeLa cells. Further experiments will be required to test our model, and to determine if MCEF can interfere with other well-known treatments that activate the HIV-1 LTR, independent of Tat, such as ionomycin/PMA.</p><p>Chimeric transcription factors, encompassing a portion of a protein encoded by one gene, fused to a portion of another protein encoded by a second gene, are naturally-occurring inside cells, for example, in the case of MLL-AFF member translocations (see introduction). These chimeric proteins appear to be able to change expression patterns of sets of genes. Similarly, fusions between GAL4 and a long list of proteins, can be used to artificially tether these proteins to promoters with appropriate binding sites. Engineered tethering of transcription repressors to the HIV-1 LTR has also been shown to be possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. Extending this line of thinking, despite the extreme sequence variability of HIV-1, there is a highly conserved DNA binding site, proximal to its minimal promoter, termed RBEIII/ MFNLP, which binds the transcription factor RBF2. We have recently shown that RBF2 consist of USF and TFIIi [26, 27, 32, 33, and M.C.E. unpublished data]. Given that MCEF represses HIV-1 replication, that it represses transcription from an enhancer containing promoter with GAL4 DBS, that it interacts with P-TEFb, and that it represses Tat-transactivation (this paper) - we propose that an RBF2-MCEF chimeric protein, may result in potent Chimeric Transcription Factor Repression (CTFR) of HIV-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>E).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by CFI, OIT, NSERC, Canfar and Ryerson University grants, to MCE.

(E) Cartoon of proposed mechanism for MCEF repression of HIV-1 replication and Tat Transactivation. The HIV-1 LTR is depicted with the Luciferase reporter gene fused (right side of cartoon) and several DNA binding sites depicted (RBEIII/ MFNLP, NFkB, SP1, TATA). RNA Pol II is depicted after promoter clearance and transcription of the RNA stem-loop structure TAR. The ternary complex between Tat-Tar and P-TEFb is indicated. The carboxy Terminal Domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II is shown phosphorylated, with hyperphosphorylation occurring through P-TEFb (1). In (2) the interaction between MCEF (Black circle) and P-TEFb would inhibit and/or disrupt the ternary complex from hyperphosphorylating the CTD. In (3), the cartoon suggests that if tethered to the highly conserved RBEIII/MFNLP site, this could increase the repressive effects of MCEF. This strategy of making a chimeric transcription factor, between MCEF and a component of RBF2 (USF or TFIIi), we dub Chimeric Transcription Factor repression (CTFR) of HIV.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijbsv03p0225g08"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Exon-intron structure of AFF4 gene.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijbsv03p0225g03"/></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
