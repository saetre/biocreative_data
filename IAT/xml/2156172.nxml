The response is mechanistically related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses described in mammalian systems. Such responses involve processing and relocation to the nucleus of ER membrane-associated transcription factors to activate stress response genes. The salt stress response in Arabidopsis requires a subtilisin-like serine protease (AtS1P), related to mammalian S1P and a membrane-localized b-ZIP transcription factor, AtbZIP17, a predicted type-II membrane protein with a canonical S1P cleavage site on its lumen-facing side and a b-ZIP domain on its cytoplasmic side. In response to salt stress, it was found that myc-tagged AtbZIP17 was cleaved in an AtS1P-dependent process. To show that AtS1P directly targets AtbZIP17, cleavage was also demonstrated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay with agarose bead-immobilized AtS1P. Under salt stress conditions, the N-terminal fragment of AtbZIP17 tagged with GFP was translocated to the nucleus. The N-terminal fragment bearing the bZIP DNA binding domain was also found to possess transcriptional activity that functions in yeast. In Arabidopsis, AtbZIP17 activation directly or indirectly upregulated the expression of several salt stress response genes, including the homeodomain transcription factor ATHB-7. Upregulation of these genes by salt stress was blocked by T-DNA insertion mutations in AtS1P and AtbZIP17. Thus, salt stress induces a signaling cascade involving the processing of AtbZIP17, its translocation to the nucleus and the upregulation of salt stress genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>salt stress</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>subtilase</kwd><kwd>regulated intramembrane proteolysis</kwd><kwd>proteolytic processing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Salinization is a widespread agricultural problem affecting 20% of the world&#x02019;s irrigated cropland, and many other regions of the earth designated as arid and desert lands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Yamaguchi and Blumwald, 2005</xref>).

ER stress occurs when normal protein folding or secretory processes are inhibited, and unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Urade, 2007</xref>). ER stress activates signaling pathways, collectively referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR), which mitigate the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins by upregulating the expression of genes encoding ER-folding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2004</xref>). UPR is highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms, and has been extensively described in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Welihinda <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Patil and Walter, 2001</xref>).

The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in mammalian cells activates three types of ER stress sensor/transducer proteins: activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), IRE1&#x003b1; or IRE1&#x003b2;, and dsRNA activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Schroder and Kaufman, 2005b</xref>). ATF6 is a type-II transmembrane protein normally retained in the ER by its association with binding protein BiP/GRP78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In response to stress, ATF6 dissociates from BiP/GRP78 and is transported to the Golgi where it is subjected to proteolytic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Relocated ATF6 is cut on its luminal side in the Golgi by a site-1 protease (S1P), and the N-terminal, cytosol-facing domain of the protein is released by cleavage within the membrane by a site-2 protease (S2P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The released N-terminal domain contains a basic leucine zipper motif and is translocated to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of genes with ER stress promoter elements (ERSE), such as BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Membrane-associated transcription factors have been recently described for a number of different transcription factor families in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Membrane-associated NAC transcription factors, in particular, have been implicated in cytokinin and stress signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this paper we identified and characterized a salt stress signaling pathway that resembles an ER stress response. In this pathway AtS1P, a plant subtilisin-like serine protease (subtilase), targets a membrane-associated bZIP factor, AtbZIP17, which functions as a stress sensor/transducer. In response to salt stress, AtbZIP17 is cleaved and the N-terminal bZIP component is translocated to the nucleus, where it activates the expression of salt stress response genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A T-DNA mutation in AtS1P demonstrates a role for this subtilisin-like serine protease gene in salt stress responses</title><p>Some of the important components of the ATF6-related ER stress response in mammalian cells are the stress sensor ATF6, chaperones such as BiP, and Golgi-located protein processing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). A key processing factor is S1P, a subtilisin-like serine protease or subtilase that initiates the processing of ATF6. Arabidopsis encodes a large family of subtilases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Rautengarten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and one of them, AtS1P, At5g19660, is surprisingly similar to human S1P (<italic>P</italic> = 4.4e<sup>&#x02212;231</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Like most other Arabidopsis subtilases, AtS1P has a preprodomain structure, in that it has an N-terminal signal peptide targeting it to the secretory pathway, and a subterminal prodomain that is processed upon activation of the proenzyme. However, AtS1P differs from other Arabidopsis subtilases by the presence of a long C-terminal tail with a transmembrane domain (TMD) near its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Properties of AtS1P.

To determine if AtS1P is similarly located, we fused the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to the C-terminus of AtS1P and expressed it in transgenic Arabidopsis using the 35S promoter.

We did not observe an intermediate corresponding to processing at the S1P site <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, processing intermediates of ATF6 have not been directly observed in mammalian cells either, suggesting that the S1P-cleaved intermediate is short lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). We did consistently observe that more 84-kDa precursor accumulated after salt treatment than before, and that more 46-kDa product was produced than expected from the quantity of precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5a</xref>). One explanation is that the precursor turns over in the ER membrane under normal conditions, and that both the precursor and product are stabilized following stress. An examination of that possibility is underway.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Processing of AtbZIP17 <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro.</italic> (a) Processing <italic>in vivo</italic> of a 35S:myc-AtbZIP17 construct in wild-type and <italic>s1p-3</italic> seedlings incubated in high salt medium for the times indicated.

RIP processing of ATF6 is thought to be dependent on prior S1P cleavage to remove the bulky lumenal domain, making the protein accessible to S2P digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Shen and Prywes, 2004</xref>). Although we did not directly observe S1P cleavage of AtbZIP17 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we wanted to determine whether AtbZIP17 is indeed a substrate for proteolysis by AtS1P. To do so, we tested whether AtbZIP17 could be cleaved by affinity-purified AtS1P in an <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay. A myc-tagged form of AtS1P (AtS1P-myc-HDEL) produced in transgenic Arabidopsis was pulled down out of plant extracts with anti-myc agarose beads. (The AtS1P-myc-HDEL construct lacks a transmembrane domain to aid in solubilizing the protein and has an HDEL element to retain the protein in the ER.) The beads were washed extensively and incubated with a C-terminal His-tagged, lumen-facing fragment of AtbZIP17 (40 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5b</xref>). The products of the <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction were analyzed on western blots, and a 10-kDa protein product consistent with cleavage at the canonical S1P site in AtbZIP17 was found. The product was not formed in controls when plant extracts from transgenic plants bearing an empty vector were used, or when the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) or the calcium chelator EGTA was added to the reaction. From this we posit that AtS1P directly targets AtbZIP17 for proteolysis, which makes the protein further accessible for cleavage by S2P-like processing activities. If AtS1P does indeed process AtbZIP17 in response to salt stress, then one would expect the two gene products to interact and be expressed in the same tissues. The expression pattern of AtbZIP17 promoter:GUS demonstrated that AtbZIP17 is expressed mainly in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2f,g</xref>), similar to the tissue expression pattern for AtS1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2d,e</xref>).</p><p>We were interested in understanding the consequences of proteolytic processing of AtbZIP17 with respect to the subcellular localization of the protein. We examined its subcellular localization under salt stress and non-stressed conditions using a 35S promoter:mGFP-AtbZIP17 construct. When grown on agar in the absence of added NaCl, mGFP fluorescence was located in cytoplasmic strands co-localizing with a fluorescent ER marker, ER-tracker Dapoxy<sup>TM</sup>(DPX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6a&#x02013;c</xref>), and was excluded from nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6d&#x02013;f</xref>). However, after incubation of seedlings overnight on 100 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, mGFP fluorescence from the N-terminal labeled fusion protein appeared in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6g&#x02013;i</xref>). Nuclear relocalization happened on a time scale consistent with the observations on <italic>in vivo</italic> processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5a</xref>). We observed substantial nuclear relocation of fluorescence 2 h after salt stress, and nearly maximal nuclear relocation after 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6j&#x02013;k</xref>). We interpret this to mean that the N-terminal component of AtbZIP17 relocates from the ER to the nucleus in response to salt stress. We have not yet observed intermediate stages in the nuclear relocation process, particularly whether AtbZIP17 moves through the Golgi. We found that AtbZIP17 is predicted to be Golgi-localized based on the attributes of its TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Yuan and Teasdale, 2002</xref>). However, further investigation will be needed to determine whether AtbZIP17 transiently relocates to the Golgi following salt treatment.</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Subcellular localization and nuclear relocation of AtbZIP17 in reponse to salt stress.

The response has some of the features of a classical ER stress response, but not all of those associated with UPR. The AtS1P-dependent salt stress genes differ from those reported for UPR when induced by stress agents such as tunicamycin and DTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Martinez and Chrispeels, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The molecular signature of UPR in plants is dominated by BiP and ER-associated calcium binding proteins, and these genes are not significantly upregulated by salt stress.</p><p>Nonetheless, our findings raise an important issue as to whether salt stress is a specific ER stress response or if it is just another way to generate misfolded proteins. It is possible that salt stress simply promotes the misfolding of a different group of proteins than those affected by tunicamycin and DTT treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Koiwa <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> argued that the salt/osmotic stress response in Arabidopsis is, in fact, a UPR based on the salt sensitivity of a mutation in a gene encoding a component of the protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation machinery. However, we have not observed significant upregulation of BiP1, BiP2 or BiP3 by salt stress.</p><p>Of course, we do not know whether salt is the only stressor to which this system responds, or whether this system in Arabidopsis exists in nature to cope with salt-stressing environments. Findings in other systems confirm that ER stress responses can be activated by different stressors, such as glucose starvation, treatment with drugs that inhibit cellular glycosylation, treatment with calcium ionophores or treatment with amino-acid analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kozutsumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). In mammalian cells, low cholesterol levels elicit an ER stress response by activating sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) via an RIP mechanism (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Goldstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). SREBP precursor proteins form a complex with another protein, SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP), which contains a sterol sensory domain. When cellular cholesterol concentrations drop, SCAP escorts SREBP to the Golgi, where it is activated by RIP, a two-step process involving S1P and then S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>AtbZIP17 activation involves RIP and nuclear relocation of an ER resident protein</title><p>We observed in this study that AtbZIP17 is activated by salt stress in a manner similar to the activation of mammalian ATF6: by proteolytic processing and translocation of the cytosol-facing component to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Schroder and Kaufman, 2005a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Iwata and Koizumi (2005)</xref> proposed that the signaling mechanisms mediating ER stress responses in Arabidopsis might be unconventional, based on the structure of AtbZIP60, a bZIP transcription factor upregulated in response to stress agents. Although AtbZIP60 is predicted to be a transmembrane protein on the secretory pathway, it did not have a conserved S1P protease cleavage site, and its luminal sequence, which would interact with chaperones, is much shorter than ATF6. The bZIP factors we have identified have a structure similar to ATF6, and AtbZIP17, in particular, appears to be processed by a mechanism similar to RIP, as is ATF6.</p><p>Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is conserved from bacteria to humans, and in other systems RIP plays an important role in cellular differentiation, lipid metabolism and response to unfolded protein stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). RIP involves intramembrane-cleaving proteases (ICLiPs), for which there are four major families in animals: the S2Ps, presenilins, SPP family and rhomboid family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Weihofen and Martoglio, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kanaoka <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> showed RIP activity of an Arabidopsis rhomboid homolog with <italic>Drosophila</italic> substrates. The substrate for the Arabidopsis rhomboid homolog and the function of other ICLiPs have not yet been identified in plants. Recently, an RIP mechanism was reported in Arabidopsis that involves the activation of another membrane-bound transcription factor, NTM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, in this case NTM1 is an NAC transcription factor that mediates cytokinin signaling during cell division, and is likely to be released from the membrane by a calpain protease. We have demonstrated that AtS1P is involved in the processing of AtbZIP17, and our data support the idea that another protease, such as an S2P protease homolog, is responsible for further processing. There is one gene (At4g20310) annotated as a mammalian S2P homolog in Arabidopsis. It will be interesting to see whether AtbZIP17 is processed in T-DNA mutants that lack functional S2P. However, we have not yet been able to obtain homozygous plants with T-DNA insertions in S2P.</p><p>Key features in the operation of the ATF6 in mammalian UPR are the interaction between ATF6 and chaperone proteins in the ER, and relocation of ATF6 to the Golgi following treatment by stress agents. We have indirect evidence for the latter in that AtS1P is located in the Golgi, and following salt stress AtbZIP17, a resident ER protein, is processed by a Golgi-located enzyme, AtS1P. We have not yet shown that AtbZIP17 is transported to the Golgi following stress. It is unlikely that we could see that, if it happens, because the residency time for AtbZIP17 in the Golgi might be very short. To approach this matter, we plan to look at AtbZIP17 relocation in mutants defective in AtS1P-mediated processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Salt stress genes upregulated following AtbZIP17 activation</title><p>We have described a group of salt stress induced genes in Arabidopsis that depend on AtS1P and AtbZIP17 for upregulation in response to salt stress.

Likewise, in animal systems, ER stress elements (ERSEs) have been identified that bind bZIP factors, such as ATF6 and XBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In Arabidopsis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Oh <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> analyzed the AtBiP2 promoter and found a 24-bp sequence element that conferred tunicamycin-induced expression on a minimal 35S promoter and that was similar to an ERSEII and an XBP1 binding site. In Arabidopsis microarray experiments, no single promoter element motif was recognized from among the genes induced by tunicamycin and DTT; however, motifs similar to various yeast and mammalian stress response elements were over-represented in the group of upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Martinez and Chrispeels, 2003</xref>). In our study, a blast search revealed that AtbZIP17 is most similar to tobacco TGA1b, a TGACG-specific bZIP binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Katagiri <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Schindler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). We found that 16/22 of the top S1P-dependent salt stress induced genes have at least one TGACG element in the 1-kb upstream regions of these genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). On a random basis one might expect to find only five genes with TGACG elements. We have not yet shown that the group of salt stress upregulated genes in Arabidopsis are direct transcriptional targets of AtbZIP17, but those studies are underway. The genes that do not bear promoter elements recognized by AtbZIP17 might be indirectly upregulated.</p><p>Some of the genes we found in our study to be the most dependent on At<italic>S1P</italic> and <italic>AtbZIP17</italic> function are genes that had been shown by others to be associated with salt stress. They include a homeobox-leucine zipper protein ATHB-7 (At2g46680) and a calcium-binding EF hand protein (RD20 or At2g33380) reported to be upregulated by salt and drought stress, or by ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Soderman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lee and Chun, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Some of these genes still show some low level salt stress induced response in the <italic>s1p-3</italic> background, and, therefore, it will be important for us to determine whether the regulation of expression of these genes involves interaction with other salt stress signaling pathways, or whether these genes are targets of one or more independent stress signaling pathways.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a signaling pathway in plants that is exquisitely simple, but highly effective in responding to salt stress. This pathway involves an ER membrane-bound transcription factor AtbZIP17 that is cleaved by AtS1P, and the cystosolic-facing component, bearing bZIP DNA binding and transcription activation domains, is translocated into the nucleus where it activates stress response genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Five T-DNA insertion mutant lines for AtS1P and one line for AtbZIP17 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/pcmb/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/pcmb/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm</ext-link>).
