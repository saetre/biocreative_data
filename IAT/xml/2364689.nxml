Nrg1 activation of ErbB signaling regulates the levels of several ion channels, including subtypes of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang and Fischbach, 2006</xref>), <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartic acid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2005</xref>), &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2007</xref>), and &#x003b3;-amino butyric acid<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rieff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Okada and Corfas, 2004</xref>). Nrg1 has been implicated as a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, and the potential relationship between Nrg1 and circuits affected in schizophrenia underscores the importance of determining the molecular mechanisms of action of Nrg1 signaling in the developing and adult nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stefansson et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The Nrg1 gene encodes over a dozen different protein products. Multiple promoters and alternative splicing leads to the synthesis of three (and perhaps as many as six) classes of proteins differing in their amino-terminal domains, as well as in the EGF-like domain (&#x003b1; or &#x003b2;), and/or in the length of the C termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Falls, 2003</xref>). These differences in primary sequence translate into subtle and dramatic differences in signaling strategies. Although Types I and II Nrg1 are either directly secreted or released after constitutive cleavage, Type III Nrg1 remains membrane tethered as a result of its unique N-terminal transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, Types I and II Nrg1 can participate in paracrine signaling, whereas Type III Nrg1 predominantly signals in a juxtacrine manner. Additionally, it has been shown that Type III Nrg1 also functions as a receptor, in that Type III Nrg1&#x02013;ErbB interaction results in signaling within the Type III Nrg1&#x02013;expressing cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2004</xref>).</p><p>The integrity of a neuron&#x02013;neuron synapse is determined by several molecular interactions between pre- and postsynaptic cells. Throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, nAChRs function as cation-selective ligand-gated ion channels and play important roles in synaptic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg and Conroy, 2002</xref>). There is increasing evidence for the importance of nAChRs in the modulation of transmitter release from presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGehee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacDermott et al., 1999</xref>), neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mechawar et al., 2004</xref>), and postsynaptic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang and Berg, 2007</xref>). Individual nAChR channels have unique biological functions that are determined by the pentameric combination of 11 distinct subunits: &#x003b1;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;7, &#x003b1;9, &#x003b1;10, and &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenberg et al., 2002</xref>). Of particular interest are the &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs (&#x003b1;7-containing nAChRs) because of their high permeability to calcium and abundant expression in both mammalian and avian peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roth and Berg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fucile et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The Type III isoform of Nrg1 was identified as the nerve-derived factor responsible for increasing acetylcholine-evoked currents in neurons and was shown to regulate expression of neuronal nAChR subunit mRNAs, including that of &#x003b1;7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). More recent findings in our laboratory reveal a requirement for presynaptic Type III Nrg1 in potentiation of glutamatergic transmission by nicotine in a central sensory motor&#x02013;gating circuit (Du, C., C. Zhong, M. Hancock, D.A. Talmage, and L.W. Role. 2004. Society for Neuroscience 34th Annual Meeting; unpublished data). These results inspired us to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying presynaptic Type III Nrg1's cell-autonomous effect on functional &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs along axonal projections.</p><p>In this paper, we show that presynaptic Type III Nrg1 is required for normal levels of presynaptically targeted &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs in primary sensory neurons. Sensory neurons from Type III Nrg1 mutant mice exhibit deficits of the surface expression of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs. Acute stimulation of Type III Nrg1 back signaling increases the number of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs on sensory axons from wild-type (WT), but not from homozygous Type III Nrg1, mutant embryos. These increases in axonal surface &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs result from redistribution of preexisting intracellular pools of &#x003b1;7 rather than from increased &#x003b1;7 protein synthesis. Increases in surface pools of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChR are accomplished, at least in part, by local activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3K) signaling pathway, which in turn stimulates the membrane insertion of intracellular &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Reduction of Type III Nrg1 expression results in decreased axonal &#x003b1;7 nAChR surface expression</title><p>Subsets of primary sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) express Type III Nrg1 and &#x003b1;7 nAChR subunit mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolpowitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genzen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>). In the following experiments, we examined the expression of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs and Type III Nrg1 on the surface of axons from sensory neurons of WT or Type III Nrg1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryos. Embryonic neurons were used for these experiments because mutant mice lacking Type III Nrg1 die at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolpowitz et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>To label surface &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs, primary sensory neurons were labeled with &#x003b1;BgTx-488 (Alexa 488&#x02013;conjugated &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin) before fixation and permeabilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). &#x003b1;-BgTx is an effective reagent for probing &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs because of its high affinity for &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ravdin and Berg 1979</xref>). After fixation and permeabilization, we applied antibodies recognizing the cysteine-rich domain of Type III Nrg1 (red) or neurofilament (NF) proteins (blue; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). In neurons from WT mice, axons were studded with distinct puncta of &#x003b1;BgTx-488 and Type III Nrg1 along the same sensory axons. Pretreatment with 5 &#x003bc;M methyllycaconitine or 1 &#x003bc;M of nicotine before addition of &#x003b1;BgTx-488 blocked surface labeling of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs, confirming the specificity of surface &#x003b1;BgTx-488 labeling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We repeated this analysis using sensory neurons isolated from Type III Nrg1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos. Labeling with &#x003b1;BgTx-488 identified discrete clusters of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs on the axonal surface of mutant neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, when we quantified the number of these &#x003b1;BgTx-488 clusters we found that the mutants had &#x0223c;50% fewer clusters than WT neurons (WT, 6.47 &#x000b1; 0.69 clusters/100 &#x003bc;m; Type III Nrg1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, 3.22 &#x000b1; 0.59 clusters/100 &#x003bc;m; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).

In this study we demonstrate that Type III Nrg1, acting as a receptor for ErbB4, controls the insertion of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs into axonal membranes. Type III Nrg1 accomplishes this by activating a local PtdIns 3K signaling pathway. These findings expand the repertoire of identified mechanisms by which Type III Nrg1 bidirectional signaling contributes to the establishment and the maturation of functional presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2004</xref>). Our major findings supporting this conclusion are the following: genetic disruption of Type III Nrg1 affects surface &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChR levels; Type III Nrg1 functioning as a receptor can regulate insertion of preformed &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs into axonal surfaces; and Type III Nrg1 activates an axonal PtdIns 3K signaling pathway that mediates increased levels of surface &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs.</p><p>Prior work has shown that presynaptic Type III Nrg1 is critical for establishing stable interactions with postsynaptic partners and, ultimately, for the survival of neuromuscular synapses as well as for glia development and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolpowitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michailov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Our studies demonstrate that Type III Nrg1 acts as a presynaptic signaling receptor. Activation of presynaptic Type III Nrg1 signaling, either by postsynaptic ErbB4 (as shown in Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710037/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710037/DC1</ext-link>), by the ErbB3 present on glia, or after depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2004</xref>), locally regulates the levels of presynaptic &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChR surface expression. As a result, Type III Nrg1 back signaling, by regulating presynaptic &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs, alters the magnitude of acetylcholine modulation of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacDermott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones and Wonnacott, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that stimulating Type III Nrg1 activates a PtdIns 3K signaling pathway and that PtdIns 3K and Akt activity are required for increased surface expression of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs. At present, we do not know the molecular details of how Type III Nrg1 communicates with the PtdIns 3K signaling pathway or what Akt substrates regulate &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChR trafficking. The intracellular domains of Type III Nrg1 lack known functional motifs that could mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p>PtdIns 3K and its product PIP<sub>3</sub> are ubiquitous signaling molecules that link cell surface receptors to intracellular downstream effectors. PtdIns 3K signaling regulates the trafficking of several cell surface proteins, such as glucose transporter 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tengholm and Meyer, 2002</xref>), excitatory amino acid carrier 1 glutamate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 1998</xref>), calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Viard et al., 2004</xref>), and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Man et al., 2003</xref>). An increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate trafficking of these proteins is certain to inform our further studies on presynaptic &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChR targeting.</p><p>We have used &#x003b1;BgTx binding to identify both surface and internal pools of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs. &#x003b1;BgTx binding requires at least partial assembly of &#x003b1;7 subunits into pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitra et al., 2001</xref>). Because we do not see effects of Type III Nrg1 back signaling on &#x003b1;BgTx binding in permeabilized cells, it is unlikely that the early stages of assembling &#x003b1;7 subunits into functional receptors are targeted by back signaling. Assembly of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs and trafficking of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs through the exocytic pathway can be influenced by synaptic scaffolding proteins such as PICK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baer et al., 2007</xref>), reversible palmitoylation (of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs by itself; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drisdel et al., 2004</xref>), tyrosine residues on unidentified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2005</xref>), and chronic nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marks et al., 1992</xref>). Any of these mechanisms might represent convergent targets with Type III Nrg1&#x02013;PtdIns 3K signaling for influencing the rate of ER/Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs.</p><p>Targeting nAChRs to presynaptic locales is an important part of establishing a plastic synapse. The &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChRs in particular play a critical role in sustained modulation of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGehee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Girod et al., 2000</xref>). Deficits in Type III Nrg1 signaling compromise the ability of nicotine to elicit sustained glutamatergic transmission at ventral hippocampal to nucleus accumbens synapses (Du, C., C. Zhong, M. Hancock, D.A. Talmage, and L.W. Role. 2004. Society for Neuroscience 34th Annual Meeting; unpublished data) and, based on the results presented here, we would predict a similar effect on nicotine/acetylcholine modulation of glutamate release from primary sensory afferents in the dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genzen and McGehee, 2003</xref>). From the present data, we cannot say whether the requirement for Type III Nrg1 signaling is limited to developmental synaptogenesis or whether it continues to affect presynaptic &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChR targeting to established synapses, contributing to the maintenance of synaptic plasticity throughout the lifespan. If Type III Nrg1 signaling does continue to regulate presynaptic levels of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a; nAChR or other receptors, then modulation of Type III Nrg1 signaling in sensory axons could contribute to adaptive physiological changes or to pathological changes in sensory transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermingham-McDonogh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerber et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>There are interesting parallels between our findings and pathophysiological studies.

The AFI of transferrin&#x02013;Alexa 488 in collapsed z series was measured using MetaMorph software. The AFI of two to three randomly selected regions for each condition was measured as background AFI and subtracted. The AFI from each time point was normalized to the AFI at t &#x0003d; 0 and is expressed as percentage of initial AFI.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical significance</title><p>For normally distributed data, statistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA with a post-hoc Fischer's PLSD test for multiple comparisons (Statview; Adept Scientific). Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using nonparametric methods and are presented using box plots. The boxes include data points within the middle 50%. The bottom marks the twenty-fifth percentile, the middle line the fiftieth percentile, and the top the seventy-fifth percentile. Vertical lines mark the fifth and ninety-fifth percentiles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Devay et al. [1999]</xref> for a detailed description of data presentation). Statistical significance was evaluated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>In Fig. S1, we show that endocytic recycling of transferrin (A and B) and the trafficking of presynaptic proteins vGlut1 and synaptophysin (C and D) are not impaired in Type III Nrg1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sensory neurons. Additionally, we show that activation of Type III Nrg1 back-signaling does not induce an increase in the surface expression of TrkA along axons (E and F). Fig. S2 shows soluble ErbB4-ECD (B4-ECD) bound to Type III Nrg1 puncta along WT axons only (A). B4-ECD treatment induces an increase in the axonal surface expression of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a;nAChRs in a dose-dependent manner (B). Fig. S3 shows that Type III Nrg1 back signaling activates Akt in neurons and not nonneuronal cells (A). Inhibition of ErbB (B) or TrkA (C) kinase activity does not prevent the B4-ECD-induced response. We also show that B4-ECD treatment does not activate MAPK in neurons (D). Fig. S4 consists a diagram summarizing a mechanism by which Type III Nrg1 back-signaling regulates the levels of &#x003b1;7&#x0002a;nAChRs along axons.
