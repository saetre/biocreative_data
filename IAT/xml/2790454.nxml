Based on their motor domain location within the primary sequence of the proteins, different kinesins may have their motor domains affixed at C-terminal, N-terminal or internal positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The C-terminal and N-terminal motor kinesins transport various vesicles and organelles toward the microtubules minus-terminal or plus-terminal, respectively. The internal motor kinesins found in animal cells are not able to move along the microtubules in the conventional form, but instead depolymerize microtubules from both ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The completed Arabidopsis genome contains at least 61 genes encoding polypeptides with the kinesin catalytic core. Among these kinesins, AtKinesin-13A and AtKinesin-13B are two internal-motor kinesins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the similarity of AtKinesin-13A and AtKinesin-13B to kinesins of the same subfamily from other kingdoms is only limited to the catalytic core, and they lacks a Lys-rich neck motif commonly found in animal Kinesin-13s. Plant Kinesin-13A and animal Kinesin-13s also have different localization patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Lu et al. reported that AtKinesin-13A was co-localized with Golgi stacks in various Arabidopsis cells, indicating that AtKinesin-13A is a special plant internal-motor kinesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the precise localization of AtKinesin-13A as well as its biological function in plant Golgi apparatus is unclear.</p><p>Cellular trafficking is the foundation of cellular morphology and function, where the Golgi apparatus plays an important role in the secretion and transportation of cellular vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is positioned near the microtubule-organizing center, and its localization and organization depend on intact microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, microtubules and microtubule-based motor proteins play critical roles in Golgi dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Both the conventional kinesins and kinesin-related proteins have been reported to regulate Golgi structure and function in animal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Actin microfilaments have also been found to be necessary in maintaining the sub-cellular localization of the animal Golgi complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Both microtubules and microfilaments cooperate in maintaining the balance of Golgi dynamics within animal cells.</p><p>Unlike in animal cells, the Golgi apparatus of plant cells consists of a large number of small, independent Golgi stacks that are distributed throughout the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], with the number of Golgi stacks being different among different kind of cells. The number of the Golgi apparatus is typically abundant in plant root-cap peripheral cells, in which very large vesicles are produced by each Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This is in accord with the high secretory activity needed for root growth in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. On the other hand, it is generally believed that the movement of plant Golgi stacks is solely dependent on actin microfilaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In plant cells, it has been reported that microtubules play a key role in organelle movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], but it is unclear whether microtubule-based motor kinesins take part in regulating the structure and function of Golgi apparatus. In the present study, AtKinesin-13A was detected on Golgi-associated vesicles in root-cap cells of Arabidopsis. Additionally, the Golgi structure was abnormal in root-cap peripheral cells of the <italic>kinesin-13a-1 </italic>mutant. These results suggest that AtKinesin-13A may participate in regulating the formation of Golgi-associated vesicles in Arabidopsis root cap peripheral cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>AtKinesin-13A co-localization with Golgi stacks in Arabidopsis root tip cells</title><p>The expression of AtKinesin-13A was not tissue-specific in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. On the other hand, there are different types of Golgi stacks in plant root tip cells. Therefore, for further studying the localization and function of AtKinesin-13A, Arabidopsis root tip cells were used. <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyl transferase I (Nag)-GFP fusion protein specially decorates Golgi stacks in plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To co-localize AtKinesin-13A with Golgi apparatus in Arabidopsis root tip cells, we used an Arabidopsis line expressing the Nag-GFP fusion. Root tip cells were used to verify the relationship between AtKinesin-13A localization and individual Golgi stacks marked by Nag-GFP. Confocal microscopic observation revealed that AtKinesin-13A was co-localized with Nag-GFP in Arabidopsis root tip cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), suggesting that AtKinesin-13A is localized to the Golgi stacks in these cells.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Immuno-localization and confocal microscopy observation showed co-localization of AtKinesin-13A and the Golgi stacks in Arabidopsis root tip cells</bold>.

The immuno-gold labeling with the affinity-purified anti-AtKinesin-13A antibody and electron microscopy revealed that AtKinesin-13A was specifically linked with the Golgi stacks of Arabidopsis root cap cells. Electron microscopic observation detected that gold particles were associated with the Golgi vesicles in the root-cap cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the gold particles distribution showed a preferential association of AtKinesin-13A with the Golgi vesicle, accounting for 55.6% of the total gold particles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

In animal cells, the high level of activity at the Golgi apparatus is sustained largely through the combined effects of microtubules, actin-microfilaments, and some intermediate filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In plant cells, the Golgi apparatus consists of a large number of small, independent Golgi stacks that appear to be randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm that take on rapid stop-and-go movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The Golgi apparatus is a polar organelle. From its <italic>cis</italic>-cisternae to the <italic>trans</italic>-network, there are multi-compartments that carry out versatile functions. Within different functional compartments there are also special proteins that perform different biological functions. Previous studies have shown that a number of molecular motors are around Golgi apparatus and involved in maintaining its proper structure and function in animal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, few motors were found to locate on plant Golgi apparatus before. Recently, Lu et al reported that AtKinesin-13A decorated Golgi stacks of various Arabidopsis cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Results from immuno-gold labeling and electron microscopy presented here further indicated that AtKinesin-13A located to the margin of Golgi vesicles in Arabidopsis root cap cells. This result suggests that AtKinesin-13A may associate with membranes of Golgi vesicles in Arabidopsis root cap cells. On the other hand, there is no predicted trans-membrane domain in the Atkinesin-13A protein sequence. Taken together, these results imply that AtKinesin-13A may be a cytoplasmic oriented peripheral membrane protein of Golgi-associated vesicles in Arabidopsis.</p><p>The root cap consists of a large number of parenchyma cells. During the growth of the root system, root-cap cells initially stem from the root-cap meristem by mitosis, then progress through a series of distinctive developmental stages. Ultimately, these cells separate from the periphery of the root cap to produce border cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. During differentiation from meristematic cells into peripheral cells, the number of Golgi stacks per cell as well as the size and the number of Golgi-associated vesicles per Golgi apparatus increase visibly. In root-cap peripheral cells, there are large populations of active secretory Golgi apparatus, and the secretory vesicles around the Golgi are large and abundant, while the size and number of Golgi-associated vesicles in root-cap meristematic cells are relatively few and small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this paper, electron microscopy observation showed that the <italic>AtKinesin-13A </italic>gene inactivation induced a significant decrease of the size and number of Golgi-associated vesicles in root-cap peripheral cells. In addition, no swelling was observed at the ends of <italic>trans</italic>-cisternae of Golgi stacks in root-cap peripheral cells of the mutant line. The large Golgi-associated vesicles often come from <italic>trans</italic>-cisternae swelling and budding in root-cap peripheral cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These results suggest that AtKinesin-13A may be involved in the <italic>trans</italic>-cisternae swelling and budding of Golgi-associated vesicles in root-cap peripheral cells, and then regulates the size and number of Golgi-associated vesicles in these cells.</p><p>The expression of AtKinesin-13A was not tissue-specific in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, some unconventional Golgi apparatus behaviors were only observed in the root-cap peripheral cells of the Arabidopsis <italic>kinesin-13a-1 </italic>mutant line. Recently, Poulsen et al also reported that Aminophospholipid ATPase3 (ALA3), a member of the P4-ATPase subfamily in Arabidopsis, localizes to the Golgi stacks and that mutations of ALA3 result in devoid of the characteristic Golgi vesicles in only Arabidopsis root-cap peripheral cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Taken together, these results indicated that both AtKinesin-13A and ALA3 mutations have similar phenotype of Golgi vesicles in root-cap peripheral cells. The root-cap peripheral cells secrete mucilage to protect and lubricate root cap as they force their way between soil particles. Hence the Golgi apparatus in root-cap peripheral cells are very specialized and possess a high secretory activity. So there may be some special Golgi-associated vesicles or some special vesicle formation/budding mechanism in root-cap peripheral cells in which the Atkinesin-13A and ALA3 play essential roles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this paper we found that AtKinesin-13A located on Golgi-associated vesicles in Arabidopsis root-cap cells, and the inactivation of the <italic>AtKinesin-13A </italic>gene caused a sharp decrease of Golgi vesicles number and size in root-cap peripheral cells. Based on these results, we speculate that there may be a novel mechanism by which AtKinesin-13A controls Golgi vesicles formation or budding in plant root cap peripheral cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>plants used were the ecotype Columbia.
