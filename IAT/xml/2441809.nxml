Tudor-SN contains four tandem repeats of staphylococcal nuclease-like domains (SN1&#x02013;SN4) followed by a tudor and C-terminal SN domain (SN5). Here, we showed that Tudor-SN requires tandem repeats of SN domains for its RNA binding and cleavage activity. The crystal structure of a 64-kD truncated form of human Tudor-SN further shows that the four domains, SN3, SN4, tudor and SN5, assemble into a crescent-shaped structure. A concave basic surface formed jointly by SN3 and SN4 domains is likely involved in RNA binding, where citrate ions are bound at the putative RNase active sites. Additional modeling studies provide a structural basis for Tudor-SN's preference in cleaving RNA containing multiple I&#x000b7;U wobble-paired sequences. Collectively, these results suggest that tandem repeats of SN domains in Tudor-SN function as a clamp to capture RNA substrates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Posttranscriptional regulation, such as RNA interference, editing and decay, plays important roles in many cellular processes, including viral defense, chromatin remodeling, genome rearrangement and gene expression. A number of RNases are critically involved in these processes, such as the RNase III enzymes Dicer and Drosha, which digest primary double-stranded RNA transcripts to produce siRNA and miRNA in RNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Recently, a novel miRNase (ribonuclease for small interference micro RNA), Tudor-staphylococcal nuclease-like (SN), has been shown to be involved in the degradation of hyper-edited miRNA primary transcripts and intriguingly links the pathways between RNA editing and RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Tudor-SN, also called p100 or SND1, has been identified in mammals, fishes, Drosophila, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, ciliates (tetrahymena) and fission yeast, but not in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>). It is an ubiquitous protein with similar mRNA levels in human pancreas, muscle, liver, lung, placenta, brain and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Tudor-SN was first characterized as a transcription coactivator, interacting with several specific transcription factors to activate their activities, including EBNA-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), c-Myb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), STAT6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>) and STAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Some of these transcription factors regulate important cellular signaling pathways. For example, c-Myb is involved in hematopoietic cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, while STAT6 is a critical interleukin-4-induced transcription factor in immune and antiinflammatory responses. Tudor-SN was found to bridge between these specific transcription factors and component proteins of transcriptional machinery, for example, between c-Myb and Pim-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), STAT6 and CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), STAT6 and RNA HelicaseA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and STAT6 and PC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Activation of some of these transcription factors by Tudor-SN leads to cell proliferation and is linked to human diseases. For instance, Tudor-SN interacting with STAT6 and PC1 activates renal epithelial cell proliferation in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Up-regulation of Tudor-SN mRNA has also been observed in human colon cancer tissues and cell lines; however, in this case, posttranscriptional regulation of <italic>APC</italic> gene by Tudor-SN was suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of Tudor-SN in posttranscriptional regulation was first hinted by the discovery that Tudor-SN is a component protein associated in RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Human Tudor-SN was then shown to promote the cleavage of hyper-edited double-stranded RNA containing multiple I&#x000b7;U and U&#x000b7;I pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Subsequently, Tudor-SN was identified as a ribonuclease specific for inosine-containing primary transcripts of miRNA; it modulates miRNA processing and expression through RNA editing by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The primary transcript of human miRNA-142 is edited by ADAR enzymes, resulting in suppression of its processing by Drosha, and the edited transcripts are further degraded by Tudor-SN. These results demonstrate that Tudor-SN plays an important role in the regulation of the biogenesis and expression of some miRNAs. Moreover, Tudor-SN interacts with U5 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) and functions in spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Therefore, this interesting protein appears to play multiple roles in transcriptional regulation, RNA interference, RNA editing and RNA splicing.</p><p>Sequence analyses have shown that Tudor-SN contains four tandem repeats of SN domains (SN1 to SN4) followed by a tudor and C-terminal partial SN domain (SN5, see domain organization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The SN domains share &#x0223c;20% sequence identity with staphylococcal nuclease, which is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent extracellular nuclease produced by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The tudor domain, bearing a barrel-like fold, is a protein&#x02013;protein interaction domain, usually interacting with methylated peptides, such as the ones identified in SMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), SPF30 and TDRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of Tudor-SN (residues 654&#x02013;870) containing the tudor domain and the C-terminal SN domain (SN5) shows that a conserved aromatic cage in the tudor domain may bind the methylated peptides of its interaction partners in snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, it remains uncertain how Tudor-SN binds RNA and participates in RNA interference, editing and degradation. Here, we address the role of Tudor-SN in RNA binding and cleavage by biochemical and X-ray crystal structure analysis. Our results demonstrate that Tudor-SN adopts an interesting means, using its tandem repeats of SN domains, to capture RNA substrates. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Different constructs of Tudor-SN, and their DNase and RNase activity assays.

Interestingly, an amino acid sequence comparison between SN domains of Tudor-SN and staphylococcal nuclease showed that most of the critical active site residues have been mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). To find out which SN domains are involved in substrate binding and cleavage, a number of deletion mutants of Tudor-SN were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). We found that the full-length Tudor-SN was unstable and degraded into three major stable fragments after purification. According to the N-terminal sequencing analysis results of these stable degraded fragments, three truncated forms of Tudor-SN, TSN-90 (residues 114&#x02013;885), TSN-70 (residues 280&#x02013;885) and TSN-50 (residues 476&#x02013;885), were constructed. Based on the secondary structure predictions, three more constructs, TSN (residues 22&#x02013;863), TSN-64 (residues 315&#x02013;863) and TSN-25 (residues 645&#x02013;863) were prepared, in which the flexible loops at both the N- and C-terminal ends were deleted. All of these His-tagged Tudor-SN truncated proteins were then overexpressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified to homogeneity by chromatographic methods, using a Ni-NTA affinity column, followed by a heparin and a size exclusion column. The purified proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) and had &#x0003e;98% purity with minor degraded fragments that were confirmed by the Tudor-SN-specific antibody (data not shown).</p><p>To test if the recombinant Tudor-SN proteins contained DNase activity, plasmid-nicking assays were carried out. The intensity of each substrate and product gel band was quantified and the estimated substrate cleavage percentages were listed at the bottom of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). TSN, TSN-90 and TSN-70 had detectable DNase activity (14&#x02013;3%), whereas TSN-64 TSN-50 and TSN-25 had residual activity (1%). This result suggests that the N-terminal SN domains, including SN1, and SN2, are required for efficient DNase activity. To test the RNase activity, 20-bp double-stranded RNAs, containing four wobble-paired IIUI/UIUU or four Watson&#x02013;Crick base-paired AAUA/UAUU, were used as substrates for RNA digestion experiments. We found that TSN and TSN-90 cleaved IIUI-dsRNA with the highest activities (5 and 15%), whereas TSN-70, TSN-64, TSN-50 and TSN-25 had no detectable dsRNase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Moreover, TSN and TSN-90 cleaved IIUI-dsRNA more efficiently than AAUA-dsRNA, demonstrating that Tudor-SN indeed prefers to cleave I&#x000b7;U-containing double-stranded RNA, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>To find out why some of the truncated mutants do not cleave RNA efficiently, the dissociation constants between Tudor-SN truncated proteins and RNAs were measured by nitrocellulose filter-binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B), in the absence of magnesium ions. The results summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E show firstly that the full-length TSN (residues 22&#x02013;863) binds to IIUI- and AAUI-dsRNA with similar <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values in the range of &#x0223c;10&#x02013;20 nM. This result indicates that Tudor-SN does not bind site-specifically to the IIUI sequence, but it also binds well to Watson&#x02013;Crick based-paired RNAs. Second, the truncated proteins containing four tandem SN (TSN), three tandem SN (TSN-90) and two tandem SN (TSN-70 and TSN-64) domains all bound RNA, with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values ranging from 20 to 700 nM. Nevertheless, the two truncated mutants, TSN-50 and TSN-25, which did not contain tandem SN domains, cannot bind either IIUI- or AAUA-dsRNA. These results suggest that the N-terminal SN domains are responsible for RNA binding and the C-terminal tudor and SN5 domains are not involved in RNA binding. To further investigate whether the C-terminal tudor and SN5 domains are required for RNA binding, we expressed and purified a C-terminal truncated mutant TSN-SN34 bearing only SN3 and SN4 domains. TSN-SN34 bound to IIUI- and AAUA-dsRNA with apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values in the range of &#x0223c;80&#x02013;160 nM, comparable to those of TSN-64.

SN4, though linked to SN5 in sequence, makes no contact to SN5, but is packed against the tudor domain. The four domains are well packed with reasonably buried interfaces to stabilize the structure (1541.6 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> between SN3 and SN4, 1339.1 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> between SN4 and tudor, and 628.9 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> between tudor and SN5).

On the other hand, the surfaces of SN3 and SN4 are more basic, especially in the concave surface of the crescent-shaped structure. Four citrate molecules, cocrystallized with TSN-64, are located at the basic surfaces, with two citrates bound near the putative active site region in the SN3 and SN4 domains, respectively.

The recombinant Tudor-SN proteins indeed prefer to cleave a 20-bp I&#x000b7;U-containing RNA over an A&#x000b7;U-containing RNA. The crystal structure of TSN-64 further shows that SN3 and SN4 domains form a compact structural module and jointly generate a basic surface suitable for RNA recognition. The question is how these two SN domains work together to recognize a double-stranded RNA.</p><p>We noticed that the two SN domains in TSN-64 are related to each other by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). This 2-fold symmetry might be linked to the protein function of RNA recognition since the two sugar-phosphate backbones of a double-helical RNA are also related approximately by a 2-fold symmetry. Therefore, the structural module of SN3&#x02013;SN4 seems ideal for the interactions with a double-stranded RNA. We thus built a complex model by superimposition of the dyad axis between SN3 and SN4 in TSN-64 to the dyad axis in a 16-bp RNA [PDB accession code: 1DI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>)]. In this way, one of the rotational axes of the RNA molecule in the complex was fixed by the superposition. Another rotational axis was further constrained by the shape of the cleft, which allows the RNA helix to pass through in only one direction. The final model, displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, has a double-stranded RNA snugly bound at the concave side of the crescent-shaped structure, with one strand of phosphate backbone interacting mainly with one SN domain. It is possible that the SN1 and SN2 domains assemble together with SN3 and SN4 to create another concave surface for RNA binding. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Structural model of TSN-64 bound with a double-stranded RNA. (<bold>A</bold>) Two different views of the model show that a dsRNA may bind snugly at the concave basic surface in TSN-64 to SN3 and SN4 domains. (<bold>B</bold>) A pseudo 2-fold symmetry axis is identified between SN3 and SN4 domains. The structural model was built by aligning the dyad axis between a 16-bp RNA [PDB accession code: 1DI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>)] to the dyad axis between SN3 and SN4. Two stars mark the likely location of putative active sites in SN3 and SN4, based on the pdTp-binding site in staphylococcal nuclease. (<bold>C</bold>) The part of double-stranded RNA containing mis-paired I&#x000b7;U or U&#x000b7;I sequences may have an open conformation. The phosphate backbones may displace from a canonical A-form conformation so that they can be bound near the active sites in the SN3 and SN4 domains.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn236f6"/></fig></p><p>This model of Tudor-SN&#x02013;RNA complex is consistent with our biochemical and structural data, except that the phosphate backbones are far away from the putative active sites in SN3 and SN4 domains (marked as stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Previous biochemical studies showed that Tudor-SN efficiently cleave only the dsRNAs containing multiple I&#x000b7;U and U&#x000b7;I wobble base pairs, but not the RNAs containing the isosteric G&#x000b7;U and U&#x000b7;G wobble base pairs or Watson&#x02013;Crick A&#x000b7;U base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). It has been shown that the RNA containing tandem I&#x000b7;U pairs are significantly less stable than the ones containing G&#x000b7;U or A&#x000b7;U base pairs; the melting points of an 8-bp RNA containing two or three tandem I&#x000b7;U base pairs are &#x0003e;20&#x000b0;C lower than those of G&#x000b7;U or A&#x000b7;U base-paired RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Therefore, the dsRNA containing multiple I&#x000b7;U pairs might have a specific structure that is less stable and deviates considerably from a classical A-form structure. It is likely that the I&#x000b7;U-containing RNA bound at Tudor-SN has a distorted open conformation so that the RNA backbones are displaced from a well-annealed structure and thus are bound at the active sites (schematic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Only the hyper-edited double-stranded RNA may adopt this specific conformation and therefore only the RNA substrates containing multiple I&#x000b7;U and U&#x000b7;I pairs can be cleaved efficiently by Tudor-SN. This explains previous observations showing that the <italic>in vitro</italic>-edited pri-miRNA-142 can be degraded sensitively by Tudor-SN in proportion to the number of A&#x02192;I modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Moreover, our hypothesis that two SN domains form a structural module for dsRNA binding is further supported by sequence data showing that Tudor-SN from various species contains even numbers of tandem repeats of SN domains, that is, either four for human, mouse, fish, drosophila, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and fission yeast or two for tetrahymena.</p></sec><sec><title>Biological roles of Tudor-SN and its substrates</title><p>Our biochemical and structural data support the previous finding that Tudor-SN functions as a miRNase (RNase for microRNA), which is more specific for I&#x000b7;U-containing double-stranded RNA. To date, the ADAR deaminase-edited primary transcript of miRNA-142 is the only identified natural substrate for Tudor-SN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Mature miRNA-142 expression levels increased substantially in ADAR1 null or ADAR2 null mice since Drosha processed only the unedited primary miRNA transcripts but not the hyper-edited ones. Tudor-SN plays an opposite role in that it degrades the hyper-edited miRNA more efficiently than the unedited ones. Over the decades, considerable lines of evidence have accumulated showing that miRNAs play key roles in the regulation of gene expression and affect mRNA degradation and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Therefore, besides functioning as a transcription coactivator and regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level, Tudor-SN may likely degrade negative regulators of hyper-edited miRNA and thus upregulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level.</p><p>Apart from hyper-edited primary transcripts of miRNA, are there other RNA types that may be good candidate substrates for Tudor-SN? Firstly, bioinformatics screening for A&#x02192;I RNA editing sites based on the comparison of cDNA or EST sequences with the corresponding genome sequences predicted that &#x0003e;85% of pre-mRNAs are edited, with the majority in introns (&#x0223c;90%) and UTRs containing Alu repeats or LINE repeats in human transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42 B43">40&#x02013;43</xref>). These A&#x02192;I edited pre-mRNAs, containing inverted repeats that fold into double-stranded RNA, are candidate substrates for Tudor-SN, which in turn, may control gene expression of mRNAs bearing repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Second, the cytoplasmic ADAR1 is induced by interferon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), implying that this enzyme is involved in antiviral defense. Combined with the finding demonstrating that a number of viral RNAs are hyper-edited, Tudor-SN might target these hyper-edited viral RNAs and work together with ADAR1 to combat viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Third, up- or down-regulation of a number of miRNA levels has been shown to play a role in antiviral defense during viral infection not only in plants and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), but also in mammals, through the interferon system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Therefore, it will be intriguing to find out whether Tudor-SN is involved in the regulation of these host miRNA levels. As there is no direct evidence for the role of Tudor-SN in the degradation of hyper-edited pre-mRNA, viral RNA or host miRNA, more studies are needed to further reveal Tudor-SN's natural substrates.</p><p>How Tudor-SN's RNase activity is regulated is another important issue that has not yet been addressed. Tudor-SN is an ubiquitous protein present in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It has been shown that a recombinant Tudor-SN, supplemented with a limited amount of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte extract, cleaved a IIUI-containing dsRNA much more efficiently than the unsupplemented one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), indicating that some other factors may be involved in promoting its RNase activity. The recombinant Tudor-SN purified from yeast enhanced the cleavage of IIUI-dsRNA (20-mer) but no RNase activity was detected when the RNA substrates were incubated with 5 &#x003bc;M Tudor-SN alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In contrast, the recombinant flag tagged Tudor-SN from HeLa cell digested inosine hyper-edited miRNA efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In this study, the recombinant Tudor-SNs were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>, and they had weak DNase and RNase activities. It is likely that Tudor-SN needs other cofactors to enhance its nuclease activity, or Tudor-SN prefers to digest a longer native hyper-edited substrate. The tudor domain in Tudor-SN is known to be a protein&#x02013;protein interaction domain and it could interact with other cofactors for the regulation of Tudor-SN's activities. The SN5 domain, appearing not to be involved in nucleic acid interactions, may also be a good candidate for the screening of protein&#x02013;protein interaction partners. Our structure analysis thus paves the way for future functional analyses of this versatile protein in RNA editing, interference and splicing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by research grants from Academia Sinica and the National Science Council, Taiwan, ROC.
