The pathogenesis of the disease is complex, involving a wide range of cytokines and endogenous proinflammatory molecules.</p><p>High mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1), a nuclear DNA-binding protein, proved recently to be a potent proinflammatory cytokine implicated as an important mediator of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Increased levels of HMGB1 are found in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and the protein triggers arthritis when applied into the joints of na&#x000ef;ve mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. HMGB1 is actively released from immune cells in response to different stimuli, including TNF&#x003b1; and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Previous studies have reported that IFN-&#x003b3; plays an important role in the regulation of HMGB1 release partly through a TNF&#x003b1;-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Chen and colleagues demonstrated that direct suppression of TNF activity with neutralizing antibodies or genetic disruption of TNF expression partially attenuated LPS-induced HMGB1 release from macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Once released, HMGB1 generates a positive feedback loop and in turn induces production of several proinflammatory cytokines &#x02013; such as IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; &#x02013; by macrophages, thereby sustaining prolonged inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>To what extent the ability of HMGB1 to induce arthritis is mediated via the TNF&#x003b1; pathway and whether the presence of TNF&#x003b1; gene affects the proinflammatory cytokine production in response to HMGB1, however, are unknown. In the present study we examined whether the HMGB1-induced joint inflammation is dependent on TNF&#x003b1; signalling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Female and male TNF&#x003b1; knockout mice and backcrossed control animals on a C57Bl6 background were bred at the Institute of Immunology, Biomedical Sciences Research Center 'Al.

In the present study we observed mild synovial inflammation in 32% to 39% of mice upon intraarticular injection of HMGB1, which is in accordance with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In our <italic>in vitro </italic>study we observed no differences regarding IL-6 production from splenocyte cultures between TNF&#x003b1;<sup>-/- </sup>mice and TNF&#x003b1;<sup>+/+ </sup>mice in response to stimulation with either endotoxin-free or LPS-containing HMGB1. The latter LPS-containing HMGB1, however, induced a much higher IL-6 response as compared with the endotoxin-free preparation. The higher activity of the recombinant HMGB1 to induce IL-6 release cannot be explained only by the endotoxin contamination since the corresponding dose of LPS found in HMGB1 preparations induced a 100-fold lower production of IL-6 than HMGB1. The synergistic effect of LPS and HMGB1 mediated via Toll-like receptor 4 could account for the increased production of proinflammatory IL-6 release demonstrated in our study.</p><p>HMGB1 is a potent inducer of several proinflammatory cytokines. One of these cytokines, IL-1, is considered a crucial mediator in the pathogenesis of destructive arthritis along with TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There is a great deal of crosstalk between IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; but their pathways differ nevertheless, and production of IL-1 may occur independently of TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In our previous study, we demonstrated that mice deficient for IL-1 receptor did not develop arthritis upon intraarticular administration of HMGB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, Park and colleagues reported in their study that TNF-receptor associated factor 2 &#x02013; which is not associated with TLR/IL-1 receptor, but rather with TNF receptors &#x02013; did not appear to be involved in HMGB1 signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Sha and colleagues demonstrated recently that IL-1&#x003b2; was bound to HMGB1 isolated from cells cultured with this cytokine, and addition of anti-IL-1&#x003b2; antibodies or the IL-1 receptor antagonist to cell cultures blocked the proinflammatory activity of HMGB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], further suggesting that the proinflammatory action of HMBG1 is likely to be mediated by IL-1 activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that pathways other than TNF&#x003b1; are involved in the initiation of joint inflammation in the case of HMGB1-induced arthritis. Combined with our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], we suggest that HMBG1-triggered arthritis is probably mediated by IL-1 activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>H&#x00026;E = haematoxylin and eosin; HMGB1 = high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1; IFN = interferon; IL = interleukin; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; pHMGB1 = purified recombinant endotoxin-free high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1; rHMGB1 = mouse recombinant high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1; TNF = tumour necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RP participated in the design of the study, carried out all the experiments, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
