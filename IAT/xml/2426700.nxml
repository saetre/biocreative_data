The biological function of ERH protein has not been fully elucidated, however functions in cell cycle progression, pyrimidine metabolism a possible interaction with p21(Cip1/Waf1) via the Ciz1 zinc finger protein have been suggested. The aim of the present study was a systematic characterization of <italic>ERH </italic>expression in human breast cancer in order to evaluate possible clinical applications of this molecule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The expression pattern of <italic>ERH </italic>was analyzed using multiple tissue northern blots (MTN) on a panel of 16 normal human tissues and two sets of malignant/normal breast and ovarian tissue samples. <italic>ERH </italic>expression was further analyzed in breast cancer and normal breast tissues and in tumorigenic as well as non-tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines, using quantitative RT-PCR and non-radioisotopic <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (ISH).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among normal human tissues, <italic>ERH </italic>expression was most abundant in testis, heart, ovary, prostate, and liver.

Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that <italic>ERH </italic>expression was significantly more abundant in tumorigenic than in non-tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines (4.5-fold; p = 0.05, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test); the same trend was noted in a set of 25 primary invasive breast cancers and 16 normal breast tissue samples (2.5-fold; p = 0.1).

Since similar results were obtained for ovarian cancer, ERH overexpression may be implicated in the initiation and/or progression of certain human malignancies. Further studies on large breast cancer tissue cohorts should determine whether ERH could function as a prognostic factor or even a drug target in the treatment of human breast cancer.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The human <italic>ERH </italic>(Enhancer of the Rudimentary gene Homologue) gene encodes a protein highly conserved among eukaryotes. It has been identified after comparison of human ESTs with known genes in public databases, as a gene highly homologous to the enhancer of the rudimentary gene (DROER) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The human <italic>ERH </italic>consists of 797 nucleotides, including an open reading frame of 312 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 104 amino acids. <italic>ERH </italic>has been mapped to the chromosomal band 7q34 by fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization, and its expression was originally found in all normal human tissues examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Details on the purification and crystallization of the human ERH protein have been reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Intriguingly, the enhancer of the rudimentary gene &#x02013; named <italic>ERH </italic>in humans, <italic>er(h) </italic>in all non-human species, <italic>DROER </italic>in Drosophila and <italic>XERH </italic>in Xenopus &#x02013; is highly conserved among vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants with various orthologs identified, while there are no homologous sequences known within the same species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The human and mouse coding regions are 93% identical, and the amino acid sequence of their proteins are completely identical to each other, as well as to that of the frog (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the human ERH protein has a 79.8% identity in amino acid sequence to that of <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Similarly impressive is the conservation of hydrophobic amino acids: Of the 27 positions occupied by hydrophobic amino acids in DROER, 25 (93%) are conserved in the mosquito and human, 23 (85%) in the nematode (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), and 20 (74%) in the <italic>Arapidopsis thaliana </italic>protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Using the <italic>in silico </italic>method electronic Northern (eNorthern) for RNA expression profiling, we have previously identified a genetic signature containing hundreds of candidate genes differentially expressed in breast and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Characterization of a subset of these candidate genes, by cDNA dot blot using cancer profiling arrays, real-time RT-PCR, non radioisotopic RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>ERH </italic>was identified by this <italic>in silico </italic>approach among other genes, and this gave us the impetus to further study its expression in human breast cancer. In the present study, we present a systematic expression analysis of <italic>ERH </italic>in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and malignant and normal human breast tissue samples using Northern blot, quantitative RT-PCR and non-radioisotopic RNA ISH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue Specimens and RNA extraction</title><p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from breast cancer and corresponding normal tissue specimens were obtained from patients treated at the Gynaecology Department of the University Hospital of Aachen, with institutional review board approval.

Later studies provided experimental evidence suggesting that the wild-type ERH protein is a transcriptional (co-)repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and its activity is not restricted to the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Another hypothesis was based on the observation that <italic>ERH </italic>is only weakly expressed in non-dividing cell lines of hepatocytes while it is abundantly expressed in fibroblast and hepatoma cell lines, suggesting that <italic>ERH </italic>might have a function necessary for normal cellular proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>However, our findings do not support a key role of ERH in cellular proliferation, since <italic>ERH </italic>seems to be heterogeneously expressed in normal tissues expected to be transcriptionally active (more abundant expression in testis, ovary, prostate, and liver, but lower expression in placenta, kidney, pancreas, small intestine and colon &#x02013; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), as well as heterogeneously expressed in terminally differentiated tissues expected to have low transcriptional activity (very weak expression in lung, brain and peripheral blood leucocytes, but abundant in heart and skeletal muscle &#x02013; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Based on our finding that <italic>ERH </italic>is abundantly expressed in the majority of normal human tissues analyzed, it does not appear to be an ideal therapeutic drug target in human cancer treatment, but still such a role cannot be completely excluded. On the other hand, more abundant <italic>ERH </italic>expression in tumorigenic as compared with non-tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and the trend of higher expression in malignant as compared with normal tissue samples (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) suggest that <italic>ERH </italic>could be possibly used as a prognostic factor in breast cancer. Since similar results were obtained for ovarian cancer (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the expression pattern and the prognostic role of ERH in breast cancer and gynecologic malignancies awaits evaluation in future studies. Furthermore, this expression pattern suggests that <italic>ERH </italic>might be implicated in carcinogenesis and tumour-progression and this should be further investigated in appropriately designed functional studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>ERH </italic>expression is clearly up-regulated in tumorigenic as compared with non-tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines (found by quantitative RT-PCR), and in malignant as compared with normal breast tissue samples (confirmed by three independent methods, i.e. MTN, quantitative RT-PCR, and non-radioisotopic ISH). These findings suggest that <italic>ERH </italic>is progressively up-regulated with tumour progression, and thus it could be used as a prognostic factor in breast cancer. A similar expression pattern was also found in ovarian cancer (by MTN), suggesting that ERH overexpression might be implicated in the initiation and/or progression of other human malignancies as well. Further studies on large breast cancer tissue cohorts are necessary in order to investigate whether ERH could function as a prognostic factor or even a drug target in the treatment of human breast cancer, while functional studies should delineate its possible role in carcinogenesis and tumour-progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p><italic>ERH</italic>: Enhancer of the Rudimentary gene Homologue (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>); erh: enhancer of the rudimentary gene homologue (species other than <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>); DROER: Drosophila Enhancer of Rudimentary; EST: Expressed Sequence Tag; MTN: Multiple Tissue Northern blot; RT-PCR: Reverse Transcription &#x02013; Polymerase Chain Reaction; DEPC: Diethylpyrocarbonate; ISH: <italic>In Situ H</italic>ybridization; <italic>GAPDH</italic>: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; <italic>r</italic>: rudimentary gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>); XERH: Xenopus Enhancer of Rudimentary.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MZ drafted the manuscript and participated in the design of the study and molecular studies.
