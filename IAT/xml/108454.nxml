Previously we detected two mammalian nuclear proteins of 100 and 75 kDa able to promote homologous DNA pairing. Here we report isolation and characterisation of the human (h) 100-kDa DNA-pairing protein, hPOMp100, from HeLa nuclei. The peptide sequences of hPOMp100 revealed identity to the human splicing factor PSF and a DNA-binding subunit of p100&#x0002f;p52 heterodimer of unknown function. Bacterially expressed PSF promotes DNA pairing identical to that of hPOMp100. hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF binds not only RNA but also both single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA and facilitates the renaturation of complementary ssDNAs. More important, the protein promotes the incorporation of a ss oligonucleotide into a homologous superhelical dsDNA, D-loop formation. A D-loop is the first heteroduplex DNA intermediate generated between recombining DNA molecules. Moreover, this reaction could be implicated in re-establishing stalled replication forks. Consistent with this hypothesis, DNA-pairing activity of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF is associated with cellular proliferation. Significantly, phosphorylation of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF by protein kinase C inhibits its binding to RNA but stimulates its binding to DNA and D-loop formation and may represent a regulatory mechanism to direct this multifunctional protein to DNA metabolic pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Homologous pairing (HP) is a fundamental biological reaction implicated in various cellular processes such as DNA recombination and repair (1&#x02013;3), chromosome pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c5">5</xref>), sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c6">6</xref>), gene inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c7">7</xref>) and initiation of replication (8&#x02013;10). The base pairing is also involved in spliceosome assembly resulting in formation of a dynamic Holliday-like structure within which splicing occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c11">11</xref>). Accordingly, proteins displaying HP activity are of great interest in biology.</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecA protein is the prototype of HP proteins involved in homologous recombination. RecA protein plays a pivotal role in the process by searching for homology and promoting strand exchange between recombining DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c12">12</xref>). The discovery of structural and functional homologues of RecA, such as the RAD51 proteins, in every eukaryote examined has implied that the basic mechanisms of homologous recombination are evolutionary conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c13">13</xref>). Demonstration of the ability of yeast and human RAD51 proteins to promote <italic>in vitro</italic> ATP-dependent HP and strand exchange further supports their central role in recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c15">15</xref>). However, the process in eukaryotic organisms is much more complex than in <italic>E.coli</italic>. In mammals, a growing number of <italic>RAD51</italic> homologues has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c16">16</xref>). Surprisingly, unlike <italic>E.coli recA</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc)RAD51</italic>, vertebrate <italic>RAD51</italic> is essential for cell proliferation and genome maintenance (17&#x02013;19). Further complicating the picture, emerging data suggest association of recombination machinery with a number of additional factors that previously had not been implicated in the process. These include the tumour suppressor proteins p53, BRCA1 and BRCA2 (20&#x02013;24), the RNA polymerase II complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c25">25</xref>), the ubiquitin-like protein Ubl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c26">26</xref>) and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c27">27</xref>). Whether or not these factors play direct roles in homologous recombination remains to be established.</p><p>Besides RAD51, the major eukaryotic HP protein, a recently emerged family of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins playing an important role in pro- and eukaryotic chromosome dynamics can promote some HP reactions <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> (28&#x02013;30).</p><p>Given the importance of proteins promoting HP and the variety of cellular processes in which they could be implicated, a biochemical screen for proteins that display HP activity is justified. To this end, we have developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> pairing on membrane (POM) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c32">32</xref>). In mammalian cells, we have detected two nuclear proteins of 100 and 75 kDa, POMp100 and POMp75, respectively, able to promote ATP-independent homologous DNA pairing without associated exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c32">32</xref>). Recently, we identified hPOMp75 as the human pro-oncoprotein TLS&#x0002f;FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c34">34</xref>). Although cellular functions of hPOMp75&#x0002f;TLS are still unclear, its ability to promote HP including D-loop formation suggests a role in some aspects of recombination&#x0002f;repair. This hypothesis is further supported by recent findings that <italic>Tls&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic> mice exhibit severe defects in chromosome pairing during meiosis, increased sensitivity to ionising radiation and high levels of chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c36">36</xref>). Finally, both hPOMp75&#x0002f;TLS and hPOMp100 activities are associated with cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c33">33</xref>).</p><p>In the present report, we describe the purification and identification of hPOMp100 as the human splicing factor PSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c37">37</xref>). It binds both single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA and facilitates the renaturation of complementary ssDNA molecules. Importantly, hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF promotes the formation of D-loops in superhelical duplex DNA. hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF serves as an efficient substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. PKC phosphorylation of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF stimulates its DNA binding and D-loop formation activity suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Nitrocellulose membranes Hybond C-super (0.45 &#x000b5;m) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (D&#x000fc;bendorf, Switzerland).

Therefore, we have used EMSA to investigate its DNA-binding properties. Upon incubation of increasing amounts of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF with the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 49mer oligonucleotide, two protein&#x02013;DNA complexes that exhibited retarded mobility were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f3">3</xref>A). At concentrations up to 10 nM hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF, there was a single predominant band with retarded mobility.

The addition of increasing amounts of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF to the reactions resulted in increased formation of dsDNA; up to 73&#x00025; of the DNA became S1 nuclease resistant at roughly one protein molecule per 50 nt of ssDNA substrate after 15 min incubation at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f4">4</xref>A).</p><p>DNA-reannealing activity of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF was confirmed by a second independent assay which utilised shorter (422 nt) ssDNA substrates and visualised formed products by gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f4">4</xref>B, hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF promoted renaturation of 422 nt DNA strands in a concentration dependent manner with an efficiency comparable to that of RecA. After &#x0223c;20 min of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, the reaction reached a plateau corresponding to 62&#x00025; of ssDNA being converted into duplex form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f4">4</xref>C). Under our conditions, optimal activity was observed at one hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF molecule per 50&#x02013;60 nt ssDNA. As in the S1 nuclease digestion assay, the reaction required Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> but not ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f4">4</xref>B, lanes 10 and 11, and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF mediates D-loop formation</title><p>The results presented above demonstrated that hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF can efficiently promote renaturation of ssDNAs. To test whether the protein can mediate a more specific recombination reaction, the invasion of a duplex DNA by a ssDNA (D-loop formation), hPOMp100 was incubated with the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 49mer oligonucleotide and the homologous superhelical dsDNA. D-loops were detected as the comigration of radioactivity with duplex DNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f5">5</xref>, hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF promoted D-loop formation between homologous ssDNA and dsDNA (lane 2&#x02013;6), but not between heterologous DNA substrates (lane 9). Since at elevated temperatures D-loop formation can proceed spontaneously without participation of any proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c40">40</xref>), all our D-loop assays included control reactions which were incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Under our reaction conditions, the yield of D-loops formed spontaneously never exceeded 0.6&#x00025; (lane 1). As a positive control, we examined the D-loop formation from the same substrates catalysed by RecA protein (lanes 17 and 18). Two major DNA product bands were observed; the more slowly migrating DNA species that comigrated with relaxed dsDNA might represent less efficient assimilation of ssDNA into relaxed dsDNA present in the superhelical DNA preparation. The yield of D-loops formed by hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF depended on the protein concentration and duration of incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f5">5</xref>). It increased up to 20&#x00025; at 10 nM of POMp100&#x0002f;PSF after 40 min of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. Under our conditions, optimal activity was observed at one protein molecule per 20&#x02013;25 nt ssDNA. hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF was also able to catalyse the formation of D-loops with 24mer oligonucleotide and homologous superhelical pUC19 or M13mp19 DNAs, implying that the reaction is not specific for a particular DNA sequence context (data not shown).</p><p>In contrast to the RecA-like-promoted reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c42">42</xref>), the addition or omission of ATP or ATP&#x003b3;S to the hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF-promoted reaction had no effects on D-loop formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f5">5</xref>, compare lane 5 with 7 and 8). The reaction required Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>; optimal activity occurred at 1&#x02013;2 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f6">6</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;8 and lower panel). Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can be replaced by Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> but not Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (lanes 13&#x02013;16). When the protein was loaded onto ssDNA at 1 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, followed by shift up to 10&#x000a0;mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (the conditions optimal for the RecA-promoted reaction), the efficiency of D-loop formation was not changed (data not shown). D-loop formation was optimal at 0&#x02013;25 mM NaCl and decreased at higher salt concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f6">6</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;12 and lower panel).</p><p>We did not detect any significant differences whether hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF was preincubated with ssDNA followed by the addition of dsDNA (the conditions required for the hRAD51-promoted HP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c43">43</xref>), or the protein was added to a mixture of ss- and dsDNA (data not shown).</p><p>We also studied the effect of varying dsDNA concentration as a function of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF concentration on the formation of D-loops (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f7">7</xref>). At a constant protein&#x0002f;ssDNA ratio which varied from one protein molecule per 160 nt to one protein molecule per 40 nt, increasing the concentration of dsDNA from 10 to 60 mM resulted in an increased amount of D-loops formed. When the linear dsDNA was substituted for the superhelical dsDNA, no D-loops were detected (lane 17), consistent with the known stabilisation of D-loops by supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c42">42</xref>).</p><p>As the positively charged RNA&#x0002f;DNA-binding proteins such as splicing factors SF2&#x0002f;ASF and U2AF<sup>65</sup> and histone H1 are able to promote DNA renaturation <italic>in vitro</italic> (44&#x02013;46), we examined if these proteins can mediate D-loop formation. Although all three control proteins mediated DNA renaturation more efficiently than hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF, unlike the latter, none of these proteins could promote D-loop formation under various reaction conditions (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF by PKC stimulates its DNA binding and D-loop formation activity</title><p>Because PKC in the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and phospholipids phosphorylates PSF <italic>in vitro</italic> resulting in inhibition of its RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c47">47</xref>), we examined whether PKC phosphorylation of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF also affects its DNA binding and D-loop formation activity. When purified protein was phosphorylated by PKC its binding to ssDNA was significantly increased compared to the unphosphorylated protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f8">8</xref>A) whereas, in agreement with results reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c47">47</xref>), binding to poly(U) was decreased (data not shown). The formation of a more slowly migrating DNA&#x02013;protein complex was enhanced in particular. Consistently, PKC phosphorylation of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF stimulated its D-loop formation activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd479f8">8</xref>B). Quantitation of the reaction products using a PhosphorImager revealed a 2&#x02013;3-fold increase in D-loop formation by the phosphorylated protein compared to unmodified protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have previously described two HP activities in nuclear extracts from different mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c32">32</xref>). One of these proteins, hPOMp100, has been purified from HeLa nuclei to near homogeneity. Seven internal peptides of purified hPOMp100 revealed identity to the human polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor, PSF, required early in spliceosome formation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c48">48</xref>). The identification of hPOMp100 as PSF was further confirmed by the demonstration of the ability of bacterially expressed rPSF to promote HP under the POM conditions.</p><p>PSF contains two RNA recognition motifs and a proline- and glutamine-rich N terminus, which are present not only in many RNA-binding proteins but also in many transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c37">37</xref>). However, its ability to bind DNA has never been addressed. hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF binds both ssDNA and dsDNA in a non-sequence specific manner with a slightly higher affinity for ssDNA. Unlike RecA protein or its yeast and human homologues, ATP does not affect its DNA binding. The efficiency of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF binding to ssDNA increases with an increase in DNA length from 19 to 60mer. Two major protein&#x02013;DNA complexes observed with longer (49 and 60mer) oligonucleotides suggest that more than one protein molecule is bound to the oligonucleotides. In contrast to RecA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c49">49</xref>) and similar to hRAD51 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c43">43</xref>), hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF does not bind to ssDNA with high cooperativity.</p><p>Proteins involved in homologous recombination like <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA, RecT and RecO, <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> Rec2 and yeast and human RAD52 are able to catalyse the renaturation of two complementary DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c38">38</xref>,50&#x02013;54). Using two independent assays with two different DNA substrates, we have demonstrated that hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF has a similar activity. The hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF-promoted renaturation requires Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> but is ATP-independent.</p><p>In contrast to DNA renaturation, a rather simple reaction that can occur non-enzymatically and can be facilitated by unrelated proteins, D-loop formation is a much more specific recombination reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c2">2</xref>). According to the current models for homologous recombination, D-loop is the first heteroduplex DNA intermediate generated between two recombining DNA molecules. Moreover, as discussed by Kowalczykowski and Eggleston (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c2">2</xref>), this <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction is less prone to artifacts than strand exchange.</p><p>hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF is able to catalyse the formation of D-loops in superhelical duplex DNA. The formation of D-loops by hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF is slow and does not exhibit the pseudoreversibility that is a feature of the RecA-mediated reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c55">55</xref>). Similar characteristics have been reported for D-loop formation by RecO, RecT, scRad51 and hDMC1 proteins (56&#x02013;59). It is worth noting that although the efficiency of D-loop formation by hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF is lower than that reported for RecA, it is comparable with those reported for scRad51 and hDMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c59">59</xref>). Like the formation of D-loops by RecO protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c56">56</xref>) and HP and strand transfer by hRAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c43">43</xref>), the hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF-mediated reaction is optimal at low Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations. This could be explained in part by the inability of these proteins to remove secondary structures from ssDNA.</p><p>The most significant difference in HP mediated by both POM proteins, hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF and hPOMp75&#x0002f;TLS, from that by RecA-like proteins is the absence of requirement for a high energy cofactor. The <italic>E.coli</italic> recombination proteins RecT and RecO display a similar feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c58">58</xref>). Recently discovered SMC proteins from both yeast and mammals are also able to catalyse ATP-independent DNA reannealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c29">29</xref>) whereas the reaction promoted by bacterial SMC is highly stimulated by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c30">30</xref>). According to current models, DNA-renaturation activity of pro- and eukaryotic SMC proteins might be essential for their roles in recombination&#x0002f;repair as well as in chromosome condensation and chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Another important difference which suggests that the mechanism of D-loop formation by hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF is different from that of the RecA-like catalysed reaction, is the demonstration that the amount of the protein required for optimal activity is determined by the concentration of dsDNA. In contrast to the RecA-like promoted reaction which is mediated by a nucleoprotein filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c60">60</xref>), D-loop formation by hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF might involve binding to both ssDNA and dsDNA, unwinding of the latter followed by reannealing of the ssDNA to complementary sequences. A similar mechanism was proposed for the RecO-catalysed reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c56">56</xref>). In agreement with this, the order of addition of DNA substrates and protein has no effect on the efficiency of the hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF-promoted D-loop formation, whereas for efficient HP catalysed by RecA and especially by hRAD51, it is essential to preincubate the proteins with ssDNA, to form nucleoprotein filament, prior to the addition of dsDNA.</p><p>Finally, D-loop formation activity is a specific feature of both POM proteins. Indeed, despite splicing factors SF2&#x0002f;ASF and U2AF<sup>65</sup> as well as histone H1 displaying somewhat similar biochemical characteristics (highly basic charge, RNA&#x0002f;DNA binding and DNA renaturation; 44&#x02013;46), they are unable to catalyse the formation of D-loops. This also implies that D-loop formation by hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF is not a simple consequence of its annealing activity.</p><p>The biological importance of D-loop formation is emphasised by emerging evidence that this reaction could also be implicated in re-establishing stalled replication forks (8&#x02013;10). In this context, our results demonstrating that both POMp100&#x0002f;PSF and POMp75&#x0002f;TLS activities are associated with cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c33">33</xref>) further suggest that their <italic>in vitro</italic> HP activities may be physiologically relevant.</p><p>Evidence for an additional intriguing similarity between hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF and hPOMp75&#x0002f;TLS linking both proteins to tumourigenesis has recently emerged. In papillary renal cell carcinoma, chromosomal translocation results in the fusion of <italic>PSF</italic> to the <italic>TFE3</italic> transcription factor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c61">61</xref>). Given the structurally similar fusion of <italic>TLS</italic> to the <italic>CHOP</italic> gene in lyposarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c63">63</xref>) and our recent finding that the oncoprotein TLS&#x02013;CHOP cannot promote DNA pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c34">34</xref>), it will be of interest to study HP activity of the fusion protein PSF&#x02013;TFE3 to define cellular functions of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF.</p><p>PSF was first discovered as a splicing factor associated with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein and essential for the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c48">48</xref>). The same protein appears to be purified as a 100-kDa DNA-binding subunit of a p100&#x0002f;p52 heterodimer of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c64">64</xref>). More recently, PSF has been demonstrated to interact with a variety of cellular targets including the human pro-oncoproteins EWS and hPOMp75&#x0002f;TLS and calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c47">47</xref>), the RNA&#x0002f;DNA-binding nuclear protein p54<italic><sup>nrb</sup></italic>&#x0002f;NonO (the homologue of PSF) and DNA topoisomerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c65">65</xref>). We also observed stable PSF&#x0002f;p54<italic><sup>nrb</sup></italic> heterodimers in HeLa nuclear extracts whereas association with hPOMp75&#x0002f;TLS was less stable (A.T.Akhmedov, unpublished results). Interestingly, the PSF&#x0002f;p54<italic><sup>nrb</sup></italic> dimer not only copurifies with DNA topoisomerase I but also stimulates <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c65">65</xref>), which itself is involved in various aspects of DNA dynamics. These interactions, together with the relative abundance of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF, suggest that it may get recruited by protein&#x02013;protein interactions to various RNA and&#x0002f;or DNA metabolic pathways.</p><p>Emerging evidence indicates that radiation-induced phosphorylation of hRAD51 recombinase may regulate <italic>RAD51</italic>-dependent recombination&#x0002f;repair, although the current data are controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c67">67</xref>). In this context, our finding demonstrating that PKC phosphorylation of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF stimulates its binding to DNA and D-loop formation but inhibits its binding to RNA implies an additional or alternative regulatory mechanism to direct this multifunctional protein to DNA metabolism. Significantly, a similar regulatory switch between RNA and DNA binding has been recently proposed for one of the hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF interacting partners, p54<italic><sup>nrb</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c68">68</xref>).</p><p>Given the essential role of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF in pre-mRNA splicing and the absence of its homologue in yeast, it is difficult to provide genetic evidence for auxiliary roles of this multi-faceted protein in DNA metabolism. Significantly, the recombinational potential of another POM protein, hPOMp75&#x0002f;TLS, which was also first described as an RNA-binding protein, was supported by the phenotypes of TLS-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd479c36">36</xref>). In this regard, detailed biochemical characterisation of hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF is of particular importance. Although based on demonstrated biochemical characteristics it is tempting to speculate on a role for hPOMp100&#x0002f;PSF in some aspects of DNA recombination&#x0002f;repair, these novel features might also be important for its role in spliceosome formation during pre-mRNA splicing.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd479f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Purification of hPOMp100 from HeLa cell nuclei.
