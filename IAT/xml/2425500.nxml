A methyl group at position <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup> prevents Watson&#x02013;Crick-type base pairing by adenosine and is therefore important for regulation of structure and stability of tRNA molecules. Thus far, only one family of genes encoding enzymes responsible for m<sup>1</sup>A methylation at position 58 has been identified, while other m<sup>1</sup>A methyltransferases (MTases) remain elusive. Here, we show that <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> open reading frame <italic>yqfN</italic> is necessary and sufficient for <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-adenosine methylation at position 22 of bacterial tRNA. Thus, we propose to rename YqfN as TrmK, according to the traditional nomenclature for bacterial tRNA MTases, or TrMet(m<sup>1</sup>A22) according to the nomenclature from the MODOMICS database of RNA modification enzymes. tRNAs purified from a &#x00394;<italic>trmK</italic> strain are a good substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> for the recombinant TrmK protein, which is sufficient for m<sup>1</sup>A methylation at position 22 as are tRNAs from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which natively lacks m<sup>1</sup>A22. TrmK is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria and present in some Gram-negative bacteria, but its orthologs are apparently absent from archaea and eukaryota. Protein structure prediction indicates that the active site of TrmK does not resemble the active site of the m<sup>1</sup>A58 MTase TrmI, suggesting that these two enzymatic activities evolved independently.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) contain a large number of modified nucleosides generated posttranscriptionally by a variety of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Among nucleoside modifications, base and/or ribose methylations are by far the most frequent and diverse. They are catalyzed by methyltransferases (MTases), a great majority of which use S-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl group donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>The modified nucleoside 1-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A) is found at four different positions (9, 14, 22 and 58) in tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and is also formed at position 57 as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 1-methylinosine (m<sup>1</sup>I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). m<sup>1</sup>A9 occurs in mammalian mitochondrial tRNAs. The presence of this modification in mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> avoids the formation of an alternative structure of the tRNA by preventing the formation of a base pair between A9 and U64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). An m<sup>1</sup>A9 activity was detected in extracts prepared from mitochondrial fractions from human HeLa cells; the corresponding gene, however, has not been identified. m<sup>1</sup>A14 is rare and thus far has been reported only in cytoplasmic tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> from several mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). A tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>A14 MTase activity was identified in an extract prepared from rat brain cortices and the enzyme was partially purified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The gene encoding this enzyme also remains unknown. Unlike the two aforementioned positions of m<sup>1</sup>A modification, m<sup>1</sup>A58 is found in tRNAs from organisms belonging to the three domains of life. The genes and corresponding enzymes (Trm6 and TrmI in eukaryota and prokaryota, respectively) were identified and characterized in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), in the bacteria <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and in the archaeon <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The archaeal tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>A58 MTase was shown to be a region-specific enzyme, also forming m<sup>1</sup>A at position 57 (intermediate in the formation of m<sup>1</sup>I). The yeast tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>A58 MTase is essential for growth, its absence leading to degradation of the initiator tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). On the other hand, a <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> mutant, in which the <italic>trmI</italic> gene has been inactivated, displays a thermosensitive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we focus our attention on the MTase that catalyzes m<sup>1</sup>A at position 22 in tRNA. So far, this modification has been found only in tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> and tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (tRNAs with a long extra arm) from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and <italic>Mycoplasma capricolum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Earlier studies showed that an AdoMet-dependent m<sup>1</sup>A MTase activity is present in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This <italic>B. subtilis</italic> enzyme modifies adenosine in the sequence 5&#x02032;-AA<sub>22</sub>GGC-3&#x02032; and requires that the target nucleoside, which is part of the D-loop, is not paired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In this work, we demonstrate that this enzyme, hereafter named TrmK, is encoded by the <italic>yqfN</italic> gene in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics analyses</title><p>Searches of the non-redundant version of current sequence databases (nr) were carried out at the NCBI using PSI-BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) with default parameters, except for using a stringent expectation (<italic>e</italic>)-value threshold of 1<italic>e</italic>&#x02013;30 to restrict the analysis to YqfN orthologs and prevent &#x02018;explosion&#x02019; of the search by inclusion of all members of the large Rossmann fold methyltransferase (RFM) superfamily.

However, analysis of the COG2384 multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) revealed that the YqfN sequence present in the database under Gene Identification (GI) no. 1731002 is N-terminally truncated compared to most of its orthologs. Therefore, we checked for alternative start codons lying upstream from the postulated 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>yqfN</italic> open reading frame (ORF). We found that a tentative translation starting from the alternative codon GTG (66 nucleotides upstream from the one putative ATG codon from the GenBank entry) possesses an N-terminal extension of the YqfN amino acid sequence &#x02018;MNELKLSKRLQTVAEYIPNGAV&#x02019; that resembles the typical N-terminus of YqfN orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This finding has been supported by protein structure prediction (see below), which suggested that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the YqfN that is missing from the variant in GenBank, is involved in the formation of the N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix that might be important both for protein stability and enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>B. subtilis</italic> full-length <italic>yqfN</italic> gene encodes an MTase involved in the formation of m<sup>1</sup>A in tRNA (TrmK)</title><p>Two versions of the <italic>B. subtilis yqfN</italic> gene, with or without the 66 nucleotides extension, were PCR amplified and cloned into the pET28 expression vector, allowing the production of N-terminally His-tagged proteins (&#x02018;full length&#x02019; or &#x02018;truncated&#x02019;, respectively) in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Thus, a question arises about the details of phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of these proteins. A phylogenetic tree of the COG2384 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) reveals that these proteins split into two main lineages, one grouping together mostly Gram-positive, and the other exclusively Gram-negative bacteria (Gammaproteobacteria and just a single Deltaproteobacterium). The &#x02018;Gram-positive&#x02019; lineage can be further subdivided into two branches. One branch comprises only Mollicutes, including <italic>M. capricolum</italic>, for which there is experimental evidence of m<sup>1</sup>A22 methylation in tRNA by the so far uncharacterized enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The other branch includes Clostridia (divided into several groups, scattered at the base of the branch with no bootstrap support for their unification into a monophyletic group), Lactobacillaceae (also split into several branches) and Bacillales (apparently monophyletic grouping, but with very weak bootstrap support). The &#x02018;Gram-positive&#x02019; lineage includes two groups of Gram-negative members from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and Deltaproteobacteria. According to the bootstrap support of the calculated topology COG2384 genes have been acquired by their Gram-negative hosts due to horizontal gene transfers: independently from Lactobacillales to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and from Clostridia or Lactobacillales to Deltaproteobacteria. Thus, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that either COG2384 is an ancient bacterial family, whose members have been lost from most Gram-negative species such as <italic>E. coli</italic> (and have been reintroduced later to some species by horizontal gene transfer) or that it originated in Firmicutes (in which it is now most prevalent) and has been transferred horizontally to other species. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree of the TrmK family.

By analogy to other members of the RFM superfamily, and based on the analysis of sequence conservation among TrmK homologs, we predict that residues D25, E50 and D78 are involved in coordination of the methionine, ribose and adenine moieties of AdoMet, respectively. A nearly invariant pair of residues in motif VII, corresponding to R130 and E143 in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> TrmK sequence, may form a salt bridge potentially important for protein folding and/or stability.</p><p>Based on the model we predict that the side chains of conserved residues R9 (in motif X), and Y153 (motif VIII) are involved in substrate binding and/or catalysis. Conserved residues G95 and G97 appear to be important for positioning of a hydrophobic residue at position 96 (Met in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> TrmK), which may be important for stabilizing the target base by van der Waals interactions. A conserved residue Q121 (motif VI) may be involved in binding of the target base. However, it is substituted by Glu in TrmK homologs from some of the Lactobacilli or by Cys in some members from Mycoplasma and most of those from the Proteobacterial branch. This suggests that Q121 it is unlikely to be directly involved in catalysis, unless the above mentioned TrmK family members exhibit differences in their catalytic mechanism. Interestingly, Q121 of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> TrmK is homologous to the catalytic Cys in e.g. tRNA:m<sup>5</sup>C MTases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).

Addition of a single methyl group at one of the Watson&#x02013;Crick positions, e.g. <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup> atom of adenosine, can bring about a large conformational rearrangement, by preventing formation of a single base pair, as demonstrated for m<sup>1</sup>A9 modification in human mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). A physicochemical understanding of modified nucleoside contributions to the tRNA structure and function is greatly facilitated by the knowledge of these enzymes, which allows easy generation of tRNAs lacking individual modifications by simple genetic techniques. For the model organisms <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> nearly all tRNA modification enzymes have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, this is not the case for other organisms, which contain modifications at different positions. One example of a modification enzyme that has remained unidentified is the one responsible for formation of m<sup>1</sup>A at position 22 of tRNA. In this work, we demonstrated that this enzyme, hereafter named TrmK belongs to the COG2384 protein family, and is encoded by the <italic>yqfN</italic> ORF in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We found that the published sequence of YqfN contains a truncation of the N-terminus, and we cloned both the original (&#x02018;truncated&#x02019;) and extended (&#x02018;full length&#x02019;) versions and validated the extended variant (but not the original one) for the ability to introduce m<sup>1</sup>A methylation at position 22 in tRNA.</p><p>The <italic>trmK</italic> mutant shows no detectable phenotype, neither at the growth nor at the sporulation levels. This is however not exceptional since recent work by the group of Phizicky showed that the cumulation of mutations affecting nucleoside modification in tRNA are often necessary to confer a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Thus, analyses of other tRNA modification enzymes from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and construction of respective mutants are required to elucidate the role of m<sup>1</sup>A22 modification.</p><p>We predict that the catalytic domain of TrmK exhibits a novel type of the active site, without obvious similarities to any known RNA MTase family, including the previously characterized tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>A58 MTase TrmI. While both enzymes bind the methyl group donor AdoMet in a very similar way, the methyl group acceptor adenosine from tRNA is probably recognized using a completely different mechanism. It is intriguing that the putative active site of TrmK that must bind the positively charged adenine contains a conserved positively charged Arg9, but no negatively charged residue that could facilitate the transfer of a methyl group from a positively charged AdoMet molecule. Unfortunately, the limited accuracy of the current model makes the small molecule docking analysis unfeasible, hence speculations about the catalytic mechanism of m<sup>1</sup>A22 methylation must await biochemical analyses of the residues highlighted by the model&#x02014;in particular R9, Q121, Y153 and M96.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis reveals that TrmK has orthologs not only in Gram-positive, but also in Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, some of the Gram-negative orthologs of TrmK (e.g. <italic>Shewanella</italic> and <italic>Vibrio</italic>) exhibit different amino acid residues in the putative active site, suggesting possible variation in substrate specificity. Therefore, we hope our discovery of the gene encoding the m<sup>1</sup>A22 MTase and characterization of the respective enzyme in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> will stimulate comparative experimental analysis of its homologs from other species. We would also like to underscore the value of experimental determination of tRNA sequences (including mapping of modified residues that obviously cannot be made at the level of tDNA sequencing), and would like to encourage scientists from the tRNA field to systematically determine tRNA sequences for organisms representative for different branches of the Tree of Life.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn169/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn169_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="gkn169_nar-02742-s-2007-File009.fas"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkn169_nar-02742-s-2007-File010.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank St&#x000e9;phane Aymerich for the gift of the pMUTIN plasmid and for advice for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> gene inactivation, and Val&#x000e9;rie de Cr&#x000e9;cy-Lagard and Henri Grosjean for helpful discussions.
