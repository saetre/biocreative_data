Transcriptional responses are frequently controlled by transcription factors regulated by phosphorylation. We demonstrate that differential phosphorylation of the budding yeast transcription factor Pho4 contributes to differential gene expression. When yeast cells are grown in high-phosphate growth medium, Pho4 is phosphorylated on four critical residues by the cyclin&#x02013;CDK complex Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 and is inactivated. When yeast cells are starved for phosphate, Pho4 is dephosphorylated and fully active. In intermediate-phosphate conditions, a form of Pho4 preferentially phosphorylated on one of the four sites accumulates and activates transcription of a subset of phosphate-responsive genes. This Pho4 phosphoform binds differentially to phosphate-responsive promoters and helps to trigger differential gene expression. Our results demonstrate that three transcriptional outputs can be generated by a pathway whose regulation is controlled by one kinase, Pho80&#x02013;Pho85, and one transcription factor, Pho4. Differential phosphorylation of Pho4 by Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 produces phosphorylated forms of Pho4 that differ in their ability to activate transcription, contributing to multiple outputs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Differentially phosphorylated forms of the Pho4 transcription factor regulate distinct sets of target genes, thereby mediating specific responses to environmental conditions</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A cell's survival depends on its ability to respond appropriately to its extracellular environment. An appropriate response often depends not only on the presence or absence of a signal, but also on its magnitude and duration. Many signaling pathways utilize protein kinases, which commonly regulate downstream transcription factors through phosphorylation. Phosphorylation can affect the activity, stability, or subcellular localization of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Cohen1">Cohen 2000</xref>). Multisite phosphorylation of a protein permits not only the binary combination of the effects of each phosphorylation event, but also the emergence of more complex properties, such as signal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Cohen1">Cohen 2000</xref>), switch-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Ferrell1">Ferrell and Machleder 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Nash1">Nash et al. 2001</xref>), and kinetic proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-McKeithan1">McKeithan 1995</xref>). Although many proteins are phosphorylated on multiple sites, the biological significance of such phosphorylation is in most cases unclear.</p><p>When starved for inorganic phosphate, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> induces a program of gene expression that includes a phosphate permease, Pho84 (NP&#x0005f;013583); a secreted acid phosphatase, Pho5 (NP&#x0005f;009651); and proteins involved in phosphate storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Oshima1">Oshima 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Ogawa2">Ogawa et al. 2000</xref>). Induction of the phosphate-responsive gene expression program is controlled by the transcription factor Pho4 (NP&#x0005f;116692) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Oshima2">Oshima 1997</xref>). Activity and localization of Pho4 are regulated in response to phosphate availability through phosphorylation by the nuclear cyclin&#x02013;CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) complex, Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 (NP&#x0005f;014642 and NP&#x0005f;015294) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-OaNeill1">O'Neill et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Komeili1">Komeili and O'Shea 1999</xref>). Pho4 is unphosphorylated, nuclear-localized, and active when yeast cells are starved for phosphate, but is phosphorylated, cytoplasmic, and inactive when cells are grown in phosphate-rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Kaffman1">Kaffman et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-OaNeill1">O'Neill et al. 1996</xref>). Pho4 is phosphorylated by Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 on four functionally important serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-OaNeill1">O'Neill et al. 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Together, phosphorylation of sites 2 and 3 results in export of Pho4 from the nucleus by promoting its interaction with the export receptor Msn5 (NP&#x0005f;010622) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Kaffman2">Kaffman et al. 1998a</xref>). Phosphorylation of site 4 inhibits nuclear import of Pho4 by impairing its binding to the import receptor Pse1 (NP&#x0005f;014039) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Kaffman2">Kaffman et al. 1998b</xref>). Phosphorylation of Pho4 also regulates its transcriptional activity within the nucleus; phosphorylation of site 6 inhibits the binding of Pho4 to Pho2 (NP&#x0005f;010177), a transcription factor essential for the induction of many phosphate-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Komeili1">Komeili and O'Shea 1999</xref>).</p><p>The kinetics by which Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 phosphorylates Pho4 could lead to the accumulation of different Pho4 phosphoforms in vivo. In vitro, on average only two of the four functionally relevant phosphorylatable serine residues are phosphorylated on a single molecule of Pho4 during one binding interaction, between Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 and an unphosphorylated Pho4 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Jeffery1">Jeffery et al. 2001</xref>). Additionally, in vitro Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 shows dramatic site preference; site 6 on Pho4 is phosphorylated approximately 50&#x00025; of the time during any single phosphorylation event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Jeffery1">Jeffery et al. 2001</xref>). Together, this leads to phosphorylation of site 6 before phosphorylation of both sites 2 and 3 approximately 90&#x00025; of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Jeffery1">Jeffery et al. 2001</xref>). These in vitro characteristics of Pho4 phosphorylation by Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 suggest that a partially phosphorylated form of Pho4 predominately phosphorylated on site 6 may accumulate in vivo when Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 is partially active.</p><p>We wished to determine whether partially phosphorylated forms of Pho4 accumulate under physiological conditions and whether such forms of Pho4 have activity that is different from Pho4, that is, either completely phosphorylated or unphosphorylated. We demonstrated a mutant form of Pho4 that is partially phosphorylated efficiently activates transcription of a subset of phosphate-responsive genes. We also uncovered a physiological growth condition in which only a subset of the phosphate-responsive genes is induced significantly. The differential gene expression observed under this growth condition correlates with the appearance of a partially phosphorylated form of Pho4 that is phosphorylated predominately on site 6.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Regulation of Either the Activity or Nuclear Localization of Pho4 Is Sufficient to Prevent Induction of <italic>PHO5</italic>, but Not <italic>PHO84</italic>, in High-Phosphate Medium</title><p>Motivated by our in vitro observations that Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 preferentially phosphorylates Pho4 on site 6, we wished to systematically explore the transcriptional properties of Pho4 phosphorylated only on site 6.

We wished to determine whether Pho4 phosphorylated only on site 6 could activate transcription of any phosphate-responsive genes.</p><p>To address this question, we made use of a mutant form of Pho4 that can only be phosphorylated on site 6; this mutant contains serine-to-alanine substitutions at phosphorylation sites 1, 2, 3, and 4 (referred to as SA1234). Pho4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup> is localized to the nucleus and phosphorylated on site 6 in high-phosphate conditions, but it cannot efficiently activate transcription of <italic>PHO5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Komeili1">Komeili and O'Shea 1999</xref>). We compared the transcriptional properties of Pho4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup> to those of a second mutant form of Pho4, which is refractory to phosphorylation because it has serine-to-alanine substitutions at sites 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Pho4 and a proline-to-alanine substitution at site 6 (referred to as SA1234PA6; it is necessary to mutate the proline because the serine at site 6 is required for the full induction of phosphate-responsive genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Komeili1">Komeili and O'Shea 1999</xref>). Pho4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup> is localized to the nucleus and unphosphorylated on site 6 in high-phosphate conditions and efficiently activates transcription of <italic>PHO5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Komeili1">Komeili and O'Shea 1999</xref>). Strains expressed both Pho4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup> and Pho4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup> at levels that were indistinguishable from wild-type Pho4 expression as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescence microscopy (see the Supplementary Microscopy Section below).</p><p>Yeast strains expressing Pho4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup> and Pho4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup> were analyzed by whole-genome expression profiling using cDNA microarrays. The gene expression profile of the <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup></italic> strain grown in high-phosphate medium was very similar to the profile observed for a wild-type strain grown in no-phosphate medium, where Pho4 is completely unphosphorylated; all phosphate-responsive genes, including <italic>PHO5</italic>, are induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Ogawa2">Ogawa et al. 2000</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup></italic> strain grown in high-phosphate medium expressed only a subset of genes normally induced in no-phosphate medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The 20 phosphate-responsive genes examined largely fell into two classes when we compared the percent induction of each phosphate-responsive gene in the <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup></italic> strain to its maximal induction in the <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup></italic> strain. Four genes were induced less than 11&#x00025;, whereas 15 genes were induced more than 40&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The class induced less than 11&#x00025; was comprised mainly of phosphate-responsive phosphatases, whereas the class induced more than 40&#x00025; consisted mainly of genes involved in phosphate storage, mobilization, and transport. From the first category, we chose to analyze <italic>PHO5</italic> (encoding a secreted acid phosphatase) further because it was both highly induced in no-phosphate medium and well characterized. From the second category, we chose to analyze <italic>PHO84</italic> (encoding a high affinity phosphate transporter) because it was induced over 100-fold in both the <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup></italic> and <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup></italic>strains.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Physiological Conditions That Cause Differential Phosphorylation of Pho4</title><p>Our observations with the Pho4 mutants led us to ask whether there exist physiologically relevant conditions in which partially phosphorylated Pho4 accumulates in the nucleus and causes differential gene expression. We predicted that as the extracellular phosphate concentration drops, Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 would become partially inactivated, and because of the kinetic properties of Pho80&#x02013;Pho85, a nuclear pool of Pho4 phosphorylated on site 6 (but not on sites 2 and 3) would accumulate. We anticipated that only at much lower concentrations of phosphate would a nuclear pool of completely unphosphorylated Pho4 build up and activate transcription of all phosphate-responsive genes.</p><p>To test these predictions, we grew cells in medium containing different levels of phosphate (0, 50, 100, 300, and 10,000 &#x003bc;M) and monitored localization of a Pho4&#x02013;GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein and transcription of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic>. We observed three different responses to different phosphate conditions. First, the high-phosphate response occurs at extracellular phosphate concentrations greater than 300 &#x003bc;M phosphate. Pho4 is cytoplasmic, and <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> are expressed at only basal levels under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">2</xref>B). Second, the no-phosphate response occurs when there is no phosphate in the medium. Pho4 is nuclear, and <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> are expressed maximally under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">2</xref>B). Third, the intermediate-phosphate response occurs at extracellular phosphate concentrations less than 100 &#x003bc;M phosphate and greater than no phosphate. Pho4 is nuclear, but under these conditions there is only approximately 10&#x00025; of maximal expression of <italic>PHO5</italic>, while there is approximately 50&#x00025; of maximal expression of <italic>PHO84</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">2</xref>B).</p><p>To further characterize the properties of the intermediate-phosphate response, we examined the time and concentration dependence of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> expression. Differential gene induction was observed in medium containing less than approximately 150 &#x003bc;M phosphate and more than 1 &#x003bc;M phosphate medium (data not shown). To confirm that the differential transcriptional response of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> observed in intermediate-phosphate medium is not a kinetic artifact, we monitored the amount of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> mRNA over several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The expression pattern of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> was stable over a range of both time and external phosphate concentration, indicating that the intermediate-phosphate response is robust. After 4&#x02013;6 h, cells adapted to intermediate-phosphate medium and Pho4 was relocalized to the cytoplasm (data not shown).</p><p>Whole-genome expression profiling of cells grown in intermediate-phosphate medium was used to assess the number of phosphate-responsive genes that behave like <italic>PHO5</italic> or <italic>PHO84</italic>. Genes fell into two classes when we compared the induction of each phosphate-responsive gene in intermediate-phosphate medium to its induction in no-phosphate medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). These two classes were similar to the two classes observed when we compared the strain expressing Pho4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup> to the strain expressing Pho4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). This was anticipated because both a wild-type strain grown in intermediate-phosphate medium and a <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup></italic> strain grown in high-phosphate medium have nuclear Pho4, which is predominately phosphorylated on site 6.</p><p>To determine whether Pho4 is preferentially phosphorylated on site 6 in intermediate-phosphate medium, we generated phosphopeptide-specific antibodies that recognize phosphorylation on sites 2, 3, and 6 of Pho4. Cells were grown for 2 h in no-, intermediate-, and high-phosphate medium and analyzed by Western blotting, which indicated that there is more unphosphorylated Pho4 present in intermediate-phosphate conditions than in high-phosphate conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). In high-phosphate medium, when Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 kinase activity is high, sites 2, 3, and 6 were phosphorylated. In no-phosphate medium, when Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 kinase activity is low, there was no detectable phosphorylation on sites 2, 3, and 6. In intermediate-phosphate medium, as predicted by in vitro Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 kinetics, site 6 was phosphorylated, but there was only minimal phosphorylation on sites 2 and 3. Thus, differential phosphorylation of Pho4 occurs in physiologically relevant conditions in vivo and site 6 phosphorylation in vivo correlates with differential gene expression.</p><p>Site 6 phosphorylation is lower in intermediate-phosphate medium than high-phosphate medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Differential expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> could be the result of differential sensitivity of these two promoters to the amount of unphosphorylated Pho4 in the nucleus. To assess this possibility, we created a Pho4 mutant that behaves as if it were phosphorylated on site 6 constitutively. This was achieved by substitution of the serine at site 6 with aspartate, which hinders the interaction between Pho4 and Pho2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Komeili1">Komeili and O'Shea 1999</xref>). Gene expression in a yeast strain expressing Pho4<sup>WT1234SD6</sup> was monitored by Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>F) and microarray analysis (data not shown). Even when grown in no-phosphate medium, the strain expressing Pho4<sup>WT1234SD6</sup> exhibited differential expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic>. Therefore, differential expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> in intermediate-phosphate conditions is not likely to be due to a subset of Pho4 molecules that is unphosphorylated in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Differential Promoter Binding of Pho4</title><p>To determine whether differential gene expression results from differential occupancy of Pho4 at <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic>, we examined the binding of Pho4 to these promoters using chromatin immunoprecipitation. There was little enrichment of Pho4 at the <italic>PHO5</italic> or <italic>PHO84</italic> promoters when cells were grown in high-phosphate medium, whereas in no-phosphate medium, Pho4 was significantly enriched at both the <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, left). When cells were grown in intermediate-phosphate medium, Pho4 was enriched at the <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter, but was not significantly enriched at the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments carried out with <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup></italic> and <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup></italic> strains grown in high-phosphate medium resembled immunoprecipitations carried out with wild-type cells grown in intermediate and no-phosphate medium, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, right). Thus, differential expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> correlates with differential Pho4 binding to these promoters.</p><p>Because site 6 phosphorylation inhibits the Pho4&#x02013;Pho2 interaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Komeili1">Komeili and O'Shea 1999</xref>), the preferential induction of genes in intermediate-phosphate medium could be explained if their transcription does not require Pho2. To determine whether the expression of <italic>PHO84</italic> is dependent on Pho2, we deleted <italic>PHO2</italic> in a Pho4 wild-type strain and in strains expressing Pho4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup> and Pho4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup>. Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; data not shown) and microarray analysis (data not shown) of these <italic>pho2</italic>&#x00394; strains demonstrated that both <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> (and the majority of the phosphate-responsive genes) required Pho2 for induction. To determine whether the transcriptional defect in <italic>pho2</italic>&#x00394; strains was due to a defect in binding of Pho4, we used chromatin immunoprecipation to examine Pho4 occupancy at the <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> promoters in <italic>pho2</italic>&#x00394; strains. Surprisingly, in a <italic>pho2</italic>&#x00394; strain, little Pho4 was bound to the <italic>PHO5</italic> or <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter in either wild-type or mutant Pho4 strain backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Barbaric1">Barbaric et al. 1996</xref>). Therefore, Pho2 must directly or indirectly facilitate Pho4 binding to the <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter, even when Pho4 is phosphorylated on site 6.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Physiological Role of Site 6 Phosphorylation</title><p>Site 6 phosphorylation correlates with differential gene expression in wild-type cells and is sufficient to cause differential gene expression in strains expressing Pho4 mutants, but this does not mean site 6 phosphorylation is necessary for differential gene induction. If site 6 phosphorylation is the sole mechanism to inhibit <italic>PHO5</italic> expression in intermediate-phosphate conditions, a strain grown in intermediate-phosphate medium (where Pho4 is nuclear) expressing a mutant Pho4 that cannot be phosphorylated on site 6 should significantly induce <italic>PHO5</italic>. We therefore created a strain expressing a Pho4 mutant, Pho4<sup>WT1234PA6</sup>, that cannot be phosphorylated on site 6 but is able to bind Pho2. Fluorescence microscopy was used to confirm proper localization of this mutant (data not shown). In contrast to expectations, the mutant that prevents site 6 phosphorylation did not strongly influence the expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> or <italic>PHO84</italic> in intermediate-phosphate medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). This suggests that a second mechanism that contributes to differential expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> expression exists in intermediate-phosphate conditions. Because a Pho4 mutant that is refractory to phosphorylation, <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup></italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), induces all phosphate-responsive genes, we conclude that this second mechanism is likely to work through Pho4 and Pho80&#x02013;Pho85.</p><p>Although site 6 phosphorylation is not necessary to inhibit <italic>PHO5</italic> expression, it is necessary to keep cells from inducing transcription of <italic>PHO84</italic> in high-phosphate medium. A strain expressing Pho4<sup>WT1234PA6</sup> grown in high-phosphate medium had levels of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> expression that were similar to those of a wild-type strain grown in intermediate-phosphate medium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Site 6 phosphorylation was necessary to inhibit binding of Pho4 to the <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter in high-phosphate medium, but was not required to inhibit binding of Pho4 to the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter in intermediate-phosphate medium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>It is possible that phosphorylation on site 1 or 4 could be contributing to differential expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic>. To assess this possibility, we made a plasmid-expressed version of Pho4, Pho4<sup>SA14PA6</sup>, which can only be phosphorylated on sites 2 and 3. We used fluorescence microscopy to confirm that, in intermediate-phosphate medium, this mutant is localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) (see Supplementary Microscopy Section below). Because this mutant is localized to the cytoplasm in high-phosphate conditions, we infer that this mutant can be phosphorylated on sites 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Pho4<sup>SA14PA6</sup>-expressing strains grown in intermediate-phosphate medium still induce <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> differentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). This suggests that the second mechanism of inhibition at the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter does not involve phosphorylation of sites 1 or 4. Because a <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup></italic> strain in high-phosphate medium mimics a wild-type strain grown in no-phosphate medium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g002">Figure 2</xref>F), it is likely that the second mechanism for differential regulation of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> works through sites 2 and 3.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Supplementary Microscopy Section</title><p>To assess whether variations in the nuclear concentration of Pho4 in different mutant backgrounds might affect the expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic>, the levels of Pho4&#x02013;GFP were quantified by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear Pho4<sup>SA1234WT6</sup> was present at 242 &#x000b1; 5 arbitrary units, and nuclear Pho4<sup>SA1234PA6</sup> was present at 242 &#x000b1; 6 arbitrary units.

Whereas fully phosphorylated Pho4 cannot activate transcription of any of the phosphate-responsive genes and unphosphorylated Pho4 can efficiently activate transcription of all phosphate-responsive genes, partially phosphorylated Pho4 contributes to the activation of some phosphate-responsive genes, but not others. When Pho4 is localized to the nucleus and phosphorylated on site 6, it can efficiently bind to the promoter of <italic>PHO84</italic> and activate its transcription, but it does not efficiently bind to or activate <italic>PHO5</italic>. Our in vitro studies of Pho4 phosphorylation suggested that when Pho80&#x02013;Pho85 was partially active, Pho4 would accumulate in the nucleus phosphorylated on site 6. In vivo, Pho4 accumulates in the nucleus phosphorylated on site 6 in growth medium containing a range of intermediate-phosphate concentrations, conditions that we anticipate result in partial activity of Pho80&#x02013;Pho85. Nuclear accumulation of this Pho4 phosphoform correlates with both differential expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic>, as well as with differential binding to the <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> promoters.</p><p>Although nuclear Pho4 phosphorylated on site 6 differentially binds to the <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>PHO5</italic> promoters and differentially activates transcription, site 6 phosphorylation is not the only mechanism contributing to differential expression of phosphate-responsive genes in intermediate-phosphate conditions. When we prevent site 6 phosphorylation, we still observe differential expression of <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>PHO5</italic> in intermediate-phosphate conditions. We have not yet identified the second mechanism contributing to differential expression, but this mechanism works through Pho80&#x02013;Pho85-dependent phosphorylation of site 2 and 3 of Pho4. It is possible that this additional mechanism functions redundantly with site 6 phosphorylation to cause differential expression of phosphate-responsive genes.</p><p>We propose that differences in the regulation of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> are caused by affinity differences and kinetic mechanisms. If the <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter has higher affinity for Pho4 than does the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter, differential occupancy of these promoters in intermediate-phosphate conditions may lead to differences in transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). For example, the concentration of Pho4 and its affinity for DNA may be such that in no-phosphate conditions Pho4 binding at the <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter is saturated, but binding at the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter is not. When Pho4 is phosphorylated on site 6, as in intermediate-phosphate conditions, we expect its affinity for DNA is reduced. This reduced affinity would have a more significant impact on the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter than on the <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter because the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter was not saturated for binding. This differential occupancy could account for differences in transcription of these genes in intermediate-phosphate conditions.</p><p>It is also possible that differences in the kinetic mechanisms leading to transcription of these two genes contribute to differential expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000028-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). For example, if Pho4 can be phosphorylated while bound to DNA and this phosphorylation can compete with formation of an active transcription complex, the amount of transcription of a gene will be determined by the ratio of the rate of phosphorylation of Pho4 to the rate of formation of an active transcription complex. If formation of an active transcription complex is slower for <italic>PHO5</italic> than for <italic>PHO84</italic>, in intermediate-phosphate conditions phosphorylation of Pho4 may compete with formation of an active transcription complex at the <italic>PHO5</italic> gene, but not at <italic>PHO84</italic>. This model is plausible, given what is known about the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter; the promoter is regulated by positioned nucleosomes that need to be &#x0201c;remodeled&#x0201d; in order for the gene to be transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Almer1">Almer et al. 1986</xref>). Chromatin remodeling may represent a slow step in the pathway to transcription that could compete with Pho4 inactivation by phosphorylation on DNA. This mechanism is conceptually similar to kinetic proofreading mechanisms proposed for DNA replication and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Hopfield1">Hopfield 1974</xref>).</p><p>Differential gene induction should allow a more finely tuned response to changes in external phosphate concentrations. In high-phosphate conditions, cells can uptake ample phosphate from their environment without inducing any phosphate-dependent genes, so the pathway is not induced. In no-phosphate conditions, regardless of the amount of phosphate transporter at the plasma membrane, it is essential to also scavenge phosphate from the environment. Extracellular phosphatases can liberate inorganic phosphate, which the phosphate transporter can uptake with high affinity. In no-phosphate conditions, it is therefore necessary to induce all the phosphate-responsive genes. In intermediate-phosphate conditions, the concentration of phosphate is near the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of the Pho84 permease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Bun-Ya1">Bun-Ya et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000028-Wykoff1">Wykoff and O'Shea 2001</xref>). Therefore, it is likely the amount of phosphate that a cell can take up is proportional to the level of permease at the plasma membrane. Induction of <italic>PHO84</italic> transcription could help to maintain levels of intracellular phosphate as external levels drop. It is not necessary to secrete extracellular phosphatases at high levels because there is ample inorganic phosphate in the growth medium. An intermediate-phosphate response may thereby allow cells to take up appropriate amounts of phosphate over a wide extracellular concentration range at a minimal energetic cost. Induction of genes involved in phosphate storage and mobilization may also help to buffer the cells from rapid changes in extracellular phosphate and allow the cells time to adjust the level of phosphate permeases at the plasma membrane.</p><p>Even though the phosphate regulon involves a single kinase and a single regulated transcription factor, yeast cells can generate multiple programs of gene expression in response to different phosphate levels. Many transcription factors contain multiple phosphorylation sites and may also use differential phosphorylation to respond to different levels of extracellular stimuli with different programs of gene expression. Differential phosphorylation of transcriptional regulators may help generate complex programs of gene expression with only a small set of proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>The following pRS306-based plasmids were used in this paper: <italic>PHO4<sup>WT1234PA6&#x02013;GFP</sup></italic> (EB1377), <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234WT6&#x02013;GFP</sup></italic> (EB1264), and <italic>PHO4<sup>SA1234PA6&#x02013;GFP</sup></italic> (EB1265).
