The function of other fibulins in acute or chronic liver damage has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the expression of fibulin-1 and -2 in models of rat liver injury and in human liver cirrhosis. Their cellular sources have also been investigated. In normal rat liver, fibulin-1 and -2 were both mainly present in the portal field. Fibulin-1-coding transcripts were detected in total RNA of normal rat liver, whereas fibulin-2 mRNA was only detected by sensitive, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In acute liver injury, the expression of fibulin-1 was significantly increased (17.23-fold after 48 h), whereas that of fibulin-2 was not modified. The expression of both fibulin-1 and -2 was increased in experimental rat liver cirrhosis (19.16- and 26.47-fold, respectively). At the cellular level, fibulin-1 was detectable in hepatocytes, &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; hepatic stellate cells, and liver myofibroblasts (2.71-, 122.65-, and 469.48-fold over the expression in normal rat liver), whereas fibulin-2 was restricted to liver myofibroblasts and was regulated by transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) in 2-day-old hepatocyte cultures and in liver myofibroblasts. Thus, fibulin-1 and -2 respond differentially to single and repeated damaging noxae, and their expression is differently present in liver cells. Expression of the fibulin-2 gene is regulated by TGF-&#x003b2;1 in liver myofibroblasts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Carbon tetrachloride</kwd><kwd>Extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>Hepatic stellate cells</kwd><kwd>Liver cirrhosis</kwd><kwd>Liver myofibroblasts</kwd><kwd>Rat (Wistar)</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2009</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Liver fibrogenesis represents the uniform response of the liver to toxic, infectious, or metabolic agents and is characterized by an increased synthesis and altered deposition of newly formed extracellular matrix (ECM) components (Ramadori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1998</xref>). In liver fibrosis, the composition in expanded portal areas, septa, and cirrhotic nodules is similar to that of the normal portal tracts and consists of collagens, various members of the structural glycoprotein family, the major subclasses of glycosaminoglycans, and elastin. In addition to these classical matrix components, members of the coagulation system, such as fibrinogen/fibrin, plasmin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF; Knittel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1995</xref>; Neubauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1995</xref>), participate in hepatic tissue repair. The deposition of fibrin/fibronectin seems to be an early event in hepatic injury (Neubauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1995</xref>) and might provide a pacemaker function during liver fibrogenesis (Martinez-Hernandez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1985</xref>). However, the exact temporal sequence of ECM protein deposition still needs to be clarified, and possibly even the list of the main ECM proteins involved in the repair processes is still incomplete.</p><p>The fibulins are an emerging family of ECM proteins characterized by tandem arrays of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and a unique C-terminal structure (Timpl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2003</xref>) and are a broadly conserved component of the ECM (Hesselson and Kimble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>). They were first discovered in 1989 (see Argraves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>). To date, fibulin-1 and -2 represent those characterized in more detail (Timpl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2003</xref>) and have been shown to display distinct, yet overlapping, molecular interactions and expression patterns, whereas fibulins 3-6 are less-well defined (Argraves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>). Both fibulin-1 and -2 are localized in basement membranes, elastic fibers, and other connective tissue structures. Fibulin-1 is also a plasma protein, and its gene-expression can be detected early during embryonic development in most basement membranes. Expression of the fibulin-2 gene is initiated later during embryonic development and is distributed in a more restricted manner than that of fibulin-1 (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1996</xref>).</p><p>Considerable evidence is available supporting a role for fibulins within the ECM; indeed, they have been found in various tissues in association with elastic fibers, basement membrane networks, fibronectin microfibrils, and proteoglycan aggregates (Roark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1995</xref>; Sasaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">b</xref>; Reinhardt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1996</xref>; Timpl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2003</xref>; Argraves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian fibulin-1 has been shown to be an important component of blood vessel walls and to be a ligand for a diverse group of extracellular proteins (Argraves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>). Fibulin-2 is present in the basement membrane and stroma of many tissues, and its expression pattern suggests an essential role in organogenesis, particularly in embryonic heart development (Tsuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2001</xref>). Recently, fibulin-2 has been shown to be produced by smooth muscle cells, as a response to injury, and may participate in the ECM organization that regulates the migration of smooth muscle cells during the repair of vessel walls (Strom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2006</xref>).</p><p>We have previously reported the identification and cellular expression of fibulin-2, as a marker of alpha-smooth muscle-actin<sup>+</sup> (SMA<sup>+</sup>) myofibroblasts (MFs) in rat liver (Knittel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1999a</xref>). Fibulin-2-positive MFs have been detected in the portal field, vessel walls, and hepatic parenchyma of the normal liver, and their number is increased in the septal regions during liver fibrogenesis (Knittel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1999b</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the hepatic localization and expression of fibulin-1 in normal adult liver (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1996</xref>), and no data are available concerning fibulin-1 and -2 in human liver diseases. The inflammatory response to liver damage involves an important participation of the ECM (Ramadori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1991</xref>; Knittel and Ramadori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1994</xref>; Baumann and Gauldie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994</xref>; Desmouliere and Gabbiani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1994</xref>; Gressner and Bachem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1995</xref>; Pinzani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1995</xref>) and fibrogenetic processes. Furthermore, the hepatic cellular sources of fibulin-1 based on the study of liver cell cultures have not been described as yet. In particular, whether fibulin-1 shares with fibulin-2 a specificity for SMA<sup>+</sup> MFs remains to be investigated. Hence, we have carried out a comparative investigation of the gene expression and localization of fibulin-1 and -2 in normal liver, during short term liver injury, in cirrhotic livers, and in various types of liver cell culture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>Liver cells were isolated from female Wistar rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) maintained under 12-h light/ dark cycles, with food and water being provided ad libitum.

Cells cultured in LAB-TEK slide chambers were fixed by the same procedure. Cells or tissue sections were examined by indirect immunochemistry. Slides were preincubated with goat serum for 45 min at 37&#x000b0;C to reduce unspecific staining. After extensive washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells or tissue sections were incubated with specific primary antibodies for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere and washed three times with PBS. Samples were covered with peroxidase- or fluorescent-compound-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C followed by extensive washes in PBS. The secondary antibodies used were: anti-rabbit Alexa-555 (Molecular Probes, Karlsruhe, Germany; excitation 555&#x000a0;nm, emission 565&#x000a0;nm), anti-rabbit-FITC (Sigma, Steinheim Germany; excitation 494&#x000a0;nm, emission 518&#x000a0;nm), and anti-rabbit-TRITC (Sigma; excitation 557&#x000a0;nm, emission 576&#x000a0;nm).

Primers for the RT-PCR were designed by using the program &#x0201c;prime&#x0201d; of the Wisconsin package of the genetics computer group (Devereux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1984</xref>) as follows: forward primer, 5&#x02032;-GTA TTC ATA ACT GCC CCC-3&#x02032;; reverse primer, 5&#x02032;-CAC TCA TCC ACA TCA ACA C-3&#x02032;, corresponding to the published nucleotide sequence of the mouse mRNA for fibulin-1, positions 935 and 1208 (AC X70854; Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1993a</xref>). This tract is situated in the EGF-like repeats region, which is highly preserved in various mammals, such as humans and mice (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">b</xref>) and is common to all the variants of fibulin-1 (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1993a</xref>; Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1997b</xref>). The PCR product, expected to encode the corresponding EGF-like repeats tract of the rat sequence for fibulin-1, was cloned into pCR2.1 cloning vector by using the TA cloning kit and sequenced.

Rat fibulin-2-specific messengers were detected by Northern blot hybridization as a large band at the position of 28S RNA, as found in mouse (Neubauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1996</xref>).In addition, to confirm the specificity of this probe, a second probe generated by cloning RT-PCR products was produced. The specific primers for the PCR were designed (Devereux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1984</xref>) from the conserved tract of the mouse fibulin-2 sequence (AC X75285; Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1993a</xref>) coding for the EGF-like repeats.

Briefly, the liver was digested enzymatically with pronase and collagenase, and non-parenchymal liver cells were separated by a Nycodenz density gradient. HSCs were collected from the white top layer of the gradient. KCs and ECs were further purified by centrifugal elutriation according to Knook et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1977</xref>) and De Leeuw et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1983</xref>). By using a JE-6B elutriation rotor in a J2-21 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 2500&#x000a0;rpm, KCs were removed at 55&#x000a0;ml/min and ECs at 19&#x000a0;ml/min. HSCs, KCs, and ECs were plated at a density of 2.5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> (HSCs) or 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> (KCs) cells per milliliter culture medium in 24-well Falcon plates, in 1 ml medium/well, or on LAB-TEK chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, Ill., USA), in 0.5 ml medium/well. They were cultured in DMEM (HSCs), ECBM (ECs), or M199 (KCs) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100&#x000a0;U/ml penicillin, 100&#x000a0;mg/ml streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine. ECBM was additionally supplemented with 0.05% insulin, hbFGF (1&#x000a0;ng/ml), and hEGF (0.1&#x000a0;ng/ml).</p><p>Furthermore, freshly isolated HSC were plated for 7&#x000a0;days, released from the culture plates by trypsinization, and replated at a 1:4 split ratio. Passaged HSC were analyzed at confluency, which usually took place within 7&#x000a0;days (1st passage). The purity of the freshly isolated cells and cultured cells was assessed as stated earlier (Knittel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1997b</xref>). Rat liver MFs were obtained by the outgrowth of primary non-parenchymal liver cell cultures.</p><p>Additional liver was digested as for the isolation of KCs and ECs, and the remaining procedures were also the same, except that, during stirring in the final enzyme-containing solution, the pH was not corrected to physiological levels in order to eliminate HSC. Finally, at the time of the centrifugal elutriation, a fraction enriched with MFs was collected at a flow rate of 23&#x000a0;ml/min.

They were represented 3.1-fold over the expression level of normal liver in activated HSCs as shown by real-time RT-PCR (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Fibulin-2 appeared as a large band with a size of the 28S ribosomal RNA in the total RNA isolate of rat liver MFs on Northern blots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The large band is consistent with the existence of at least two different mRNA transcripts in rat cells, as reported in mice, where it is hypothesized to be attributable to the presence or absence of a single EGF-like repeat (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1993b</xref>).</p><p>HSCs either freshly isolated or at day 2 after plating, hepatocytes and KCs either freshly isolated or at day 1 and 3 of primary cultures, and ECs freshly isolated were also analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. No fibulin-2 mRNA expression was revealed, even after prolonged exposures of the films (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p>The expression of fibulin-1-specific transcripts in fully &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; HSCs was not modified significantly by stimulation with TGF-&#x003b2;1 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>); fibulin-2 gene expression was also not increased in HSC significantly after TGF-&#x003b2;1 exposure (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced a significant 4.33-fold increased gene expression for fibulin-2 in hepatocyte cultures and a 2.62-fold increase in MF cultures (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2;1 had no effect on fibulin-1-coding mRNA in isolated rat hepatocytes or MFs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the immunocytochemistry and Northern blot data indicated that the ECM proteins, fibulin-1 and -2, deposited in a fibrillar matrix, are synthesized in larger amounts by rat liver MFs than in other cell populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p>Fibulins, like other ECM molecules, are associated with liver fibrosis, but their specific role is not fully understood. Moreover, the main liver cell population promoting the process of liver fibrogenesis remains uncertain (Ramadori and Saile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2002</xref>). No definitive evidence has been found for a &#x0201c;transdifferentiation&#x0201d; of HSCs to MFs. On the contrary, an increasing amount of data support the conviction that HSCs and MFs represent two similar but non-identical cell populations, the latter being comparable with those of other organs (Kinnman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2003</xref>; Forbes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>).</p><p>In previous work, we first identified fibulin-2 as a specific marker of rat liver MFs in order to be able to distinguish these cells from other fibrogenic liver cell populations such as HSCs (Knittel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">c</xref>). The present study aims to evaluate, in more detail, the expression patterns of fibulin-1 and -2. Both proteins are present in the elastic fibers of normal hepatic vessels, in rat and in humans, according to previous publications (Roark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1995</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1995</xref>; Miosge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1998</xref>).</p><p>Following acute liver damage, fibulin-1-specific mRNAs increase early after CCl<sub>4</sub> administration and peak at 48 h (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Interestingly, similar changes have not been seen for fibulin-2, whose specific mRNA levels and immunohistochemical expression remain unmodified throughout the observed kinetics of acute tissue damage and repair. Such divergent patterns of fibulin-1 and -2 might be related to the different properties of the two proteins and to the participation of different subsets of cell populations in the acute and chronic repair processes, at least in rats. In particular, the participation of hepatocytes in the synthesis of fibulin-1, which is also a circulating plasma protein, can be suggested. In addition, the peak of gene expression for fibulin-1 occurs 48 h after the CCl<sub>4</sub> administration, when pericentral necrosis is detectable. At this time point, the maximal stimulation of HSCs might be expected. Fully activated HSC significantly contribute to fibulin-1 synthesis in the liver (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, in view of the fibulin-2 pattern and the hypothesis of the participation of different subsets of cell populations, it is noteworthy that activated HSCs remain negative for fibulin-2 after acute damage, whereas other molecules selectively expressed by activated HSC, such as neural cell adhesion molecule and glial fibrillary acidic protein, are reported to appear at the immunohistochemical level under the same conditions (Neubauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1996</xref>).</p><p>For the first time, we have shown that fibulin-1 and -2 are major components of the fibrotic septa not only in animal models, but also in humans and that their gene expression increases in liver fibrosis. Fibulin-1 stains both small and large septa homogeneously in rats. Fibulin-2, instead, shows a distribution, within the scars, that is not as uniform as the pattern for fibulin-1. Usually, the smallest septa are completely immunostained for fibulin-2. Larger septa are, instead, immunostained for fibulin-2 preferentially around portal vessels running inside them and along the outer lining of the scars. Specific staining for fibulin-2 occasionally appears along the sinusoids in rats and rather constantly and extensively in humans (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p>The fibulin-2 positivity in this area is unexpected when one considers that HSC primary cultures have been found to stain negatively for fibulin-2, only limited cell groups showing a positive reaction. As regards the origin of the fibulin-2-positive cells in HSC cultures, the spotted distribution of fibulin-2 positivity has inspired us to consider fibulin-2-positive cells as being MFs contaminating HSC cultures, rather than a subpopulation of HSC (Knittel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">b</xref>). Possible explanations for perisinusoidal fibulin-2 detection, especially in human liver cirrhosis, are that &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; HSC behave differently in vitro and during chronic damage in vivo, or that HSCs and liver MFs constitute a mixed population during chronic damage in vivo. However, as far as acute liver injury is concerned, the in vitro and in vivo patterns are closely correlated; in particular, no fibulin-2 expression is apparent, consistent with HSC being the principal mesenchymal cell type deputed to acute hepatic tissue repair.</p><p>In human liver cirrhosis, a greater induction of fibulin-2 has been detected than in the rat liver cirrhosis. This finding is consistent with the previous observations that more MFs might be present in human liver and in human liver cirrhosis (Dudas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>).</p><p>An additional finding of our study is that the relative increase of the two fibulin-1 variants C and D is not identical during acute and chronic hepatic tissue repair. After acute liver injury, the increase of the two isoforms is similar, whereas in chronic liver damage, a prevalence of isoform D is manifest. As shown by the analysis of in vitro cultures, the fibulin-1 gene is expressed in a greater number of cell types than is fibulin-2, including both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. The synthesis of ECM proteins in hepatocytes has been previously reported (Chojkier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1988</xref>) and raises the question of the role of parenchymal cells in the process of fibrogenesis (Dooley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>). Nevertheless, we should also take into consideration that primary cultures of isolated hepatocytes might be overgrown by mesenchymal cells, and the contaminating cell populations might express ECM proteins. Similar to other matrix proteins, fibulin-1 transcription is greatly enhanced in fully &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; MF-like HSCs (day 7 after plating) with respect to HSCs &#x0201c;at an early stage of activation&#x0201d; (day 2 after plating; Ramadori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1991</xref>; Gressner and Bachem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1995</xref>; Pinzani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1995</xref>; Knittel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">c</xref>; Friedman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>), further confirming the role of activated HSCs in fibulin-1 deposition in chronic hepatic tissue repair. The gene expression for fibulin-1 is not regulated by the fibrogenic mediator TGF&#x003b2;1 in any of the liver cells (hepatocytes, HSCs, and MFs) that express it, whereas fibulin-2 is responsive to TGF-&#x003b2;1, at least in MFs. This confirms that fibulin-2-positive cells are not a more advanced fibrogenic subphenotype of HSCs. A low increase of the gene expression of fibulin-2 in hepatocyte cultures treated with TGF&#x003b2;1 might be also attributable to contaminating MFs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, these in vitro data confirm our previous results showing that HSCs and liver MFs are two similar, but non-identical, cell populations of the hepatic mesenchymal compartment. The participation of various liver cell populations in matrix synthesis might be different after acute and chronic liver injury. An understanding of the interactions among the different liver cell populations and their roles in the production of different ECM proteins might open up new and interesting perspectives in the field of liver fibrogenesis</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are indebted to Anka Grundmann, Anke Herbst, and Sandra Georgi for excellent technical assistance.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This
