When located in coding regions, disease-associated expansions of trinucleotide repeats are translated into homopolymeric amino acid stretches of glutamine or alanine. Polyalanine expansions in the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). To gain novel insight into the molecular pathophysiology of OPMD, we studied the interaction of cellular proteins with normal and expanded PABPN1. Pull-down assays show that heat shock proteins including Hsp70, and type I arginine methyl transferases (PRMT1 and PRMT3) associate preferentially with expanded PABPN1. Immunofluorescence microscopy further reveals accumulation of these proteins at intranuclear inclusions in muscle from OPMD patients. Recombinant PABPN1 with expanded polyalanine stretches binds Hsp70 with higher affinity, and data from molecular simulations suggest that expansions of the PABPN1 polyalanine tract result in transition from a disordered, flexible conformation to a stable helical secondary structure. Taken together, our results suggest that the pathological mutation in the PABPN1 gene alters the protein conformation and induces a preferential interaction with type I PRMTs and Hsp70 chaperones. This in turn causes sequestration in intranuclear inclusions, possibly leading to a progressive cellular defect in arginine methylation and chaperone activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tandem arrays of simple repeats such as mono-, tri-, and tetranucleotides are common in eukaryotic genomes, and repeat instability is the cause for more than 40 neurological, neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Pearson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Repeat instability is a dynamic form of mutation that is most likely associated with DNA replication, repair and recombination. Intriguingly, there is an evolutionary trend towards longer trinucleotide repeats in humans relative to other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Kovtun1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority of repeat-associated disorders are caused by expansions of trinucleotide repeats located in either coding or non-coding regions of the genome. While noncoding repeats may induce the generation of chromosome fragility, the silencing of the genes in which they are located, the modulation of transcription and translation, and the sequestering of proteins involved in cellular processes, repeats in the coding sequence can result in the generation of toxic or malfunctioning proteins. Disease-associated expansions of coding DNA triplets are translated into homopolymeric amino acid stretches of glutamine or alanine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Shao1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Albrecht1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Approximately 500 human proteins are predicted to contain polyalanine tracts, and disease-causing expanded alanine stretches have been identified in nine of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Albrecht1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Brown1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. With a single exception, all these proteins are transcription factors that play important roles during development. The expansion mutations in these transcription factors lead to a variety of symptoms including mental retardation and malformations. The exception is poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1, PABPN1 (previously called PABP2), a protein involved in polyadenylation of mRNA precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Danckwardt1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Polyalanine expansion in PABPN1 causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, OPMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Brais1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent in vitro and in vivo data suggest that expansions of polyalanine tracts beyond a certain threshold result in protein misfolding and aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Albrecht1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we show that the normal polyalanine stretch in PABPN1 is predicted to be intrinsically unstructured and highly flexible, whereas peptides corresponding to the extended PABPN1 tend to form a helical secondary structure. We further show that expansions of the polyalanine tract result in increased association with Hsp70 chaperones and type I arginine methyl transferases. These findings raise the possibility that sequestration by expanded PABPN1 may cause a progressive cellular defect in both protein modifications by arginine methylation and chaperone activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of proteins that associate preferentially with expanded PABPN1</title><p>In order to examine if polyalanine tract expansion affects the binding of cellular proteins to PABPN1, we performed pull-down experiments from cell extracts with immobilized PABPN1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006418-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

The most striking difference is observed with the 15- and 17-alanine peptides, which form a short alpha helical structure.

The simulation with 13-alanine peptides starts with a high content of amino acids in coiled conformation, but at 400 ps the system evolved in a different way, with a decrease of the contribution of the coiled structure and an increase in the residues present in bended fragments. This suggests the presence of a more compact conformation but without any predominant secondary structure elements. The simulation with either 15- or 17-alanine peptides starts with a high content of flexible, non-structured regions and evolves to a structured segment mainly constituted by a helical secondary structure. Particularly interesting is the presence of a stable helical fragment in the 17-alanine peptide at the end of the simulation.

Here, we found that PRMT1 and PRMT3 associate preferentially with expanded PABPN1 and become accumulated at OPMD intranuclear inclusions. This raises the possibility that binding of methyltransferases to expanded PABPN1 accumulated in nuclear inclusions leads to a decreased availability of the enzymes in the nucleoplasm, which may in turn reduce the methylation status of other cellular targets.

We further show that the normal polyalanine stretch in PABPN1 is predictably intrinsically unstructured and highly flexible, whereas alanine expansion causes a disorder-to-order conformational transition. A major change involving formation of a stable helical secondary structure is predicted to take place when the polyalanine stretch expands to 15 or 17 residues.

Possibly, recruitment of Hsp70 chaperones to expanded PABPN1 reflects an effort to prevent aggregate formation and/or to dissociate the protein from aggregates. However, as this protective effort fails and larger nuclear inclusions accumulate in the nucleus, a progressively larger proportion of molecular chaperones may be sequestered in the PABPN1 aggregates, thus decreasing the proportion of chaperones available to perform other essential functions in the cell.

Consequently, cells may become progressively defective in asymmetrical arginine dimethylation activity and in heat shock response. Defects caused by impaired type I PRMT activity could be expected at the level of signal transduction pathways to regulate gene expression and cell proliferation, whereas diminished chaperone activity could impinge on protein translation, import of proteins into organelles, response to stress and protein folding quality control.</p><p>Our data further reveal that the normal polyalanine stretch in PABPN1 is predicted to be intrinsically unstructured and highly flexible. In contrast, peptides corresponding to the extended PABPN1 variants N-terminal regions and containing 15 or 17 alanine residues tend to form a helical secondary structure. The polyalanine expansion in the N-terminal peptide of PABPN1 induces the formation of an alpha-helical segment proportional in size to the number of alanines in expansion.

In OPMD, expanded polyalanine tracts in PABPN1 could act as a signal to promote a misfolding response. This could be due to the presence of a hydrophobic and structured alpha-helical fragment (constituted by the expanded polyalanine stretch) within a hydrophilic N-terminal region. This signal could recruit specific chaperones, mainly belonging to the Hsp family, and cause a misbalance in the levels of these molecules that could be accumulative on time. Furthermore, the formation of this stable alpha helix in the N-terminal region of PABPN1 due to the pathological expansion could be also responsible for the misregulation in the binding specificity of PABPN1 to some of its physiological partners. Indeed, it is well known that protruding alpha helices and more in detail polyalanine stretches are abundant in higher eukaryotes and they are proposed to be involved in regulatory networks mediating protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Lavoie1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although the aggregative behavior of expanded PABPN1 protein has been proposed as the cause of OPMD, a propensity to aggregate is not exclusive of the expanded protein and can also be observed in normal PABPN1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Tavanez1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Rohrberg1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Chartier1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the evidence reported here, we propose that polyalanine tract expansions alter the protein conformation and change the binding properties of interacting proteins independently of the formation of intranuclear inclusions. Together with protein aggregation, this likely represents an additional mechanism contributing to the disease. Indeed, evidence that mutant proteins can induce neurodegeneration by an apoptotic mechanism in the absence of nuclear inclusions was first reported in a cellular model of Huntington's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006418-Saudou1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.
