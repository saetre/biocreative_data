Dendritic cells (DCs) are known as mediators of pathogen recognition and are strategically located at the typical sites of bacterial entry and have the ability to migrate from peripheral tissues to secondary lymphoid organs to elicit primary T cell responses and initiate immunity.</p><p>DCs express several pathogen recognition receptors such as C-type lectins and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognise molecular patterns expressed by pathogens and determine the type of immune response. Microbial stimuli induce significant morphological and biochemical changes, such as IL-12 secretion and increased surface expression of many co-stimulatory and MHC class II molecules. This activation of DCs, known as maturation, is required for efficient T-cell-priming and pathogen elimination. However, several bacterial pathogens have developed mechanisms to subvert DC function and evade the immune system. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> interferes with TLR signalling via the C-type lectin DC-SIGN, blocking DC maturation and IL-12 production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. The immune response is instead directed towards immune suppression with secretion of IL-10, which seems to contribute to the chronic carriage of this pathogen. Similarly, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bordetella pertussis</named-content>-infected DCs secrete IL-10 and activate T regulatory cells that suppress a protective immune response and enhance colonisation of the lower respiratory tract &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, several studies have shown that while <named-content content-type="genus-species">Salmonella typhimurium</named-content> induces normal maturation of DCs and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d; it is able to block MHC class II antigen presentation in bone marrow-derived DCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Another bacterial pathogen, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Francisella tularensis</named-content>, which also induces phenotypic maturation of DCs, has been shown to inhibit secretion of pro-inflamatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; while eliciting production of immunosuppressive cytokines that facilitate pulmonary infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. tularensis</named-content> has also been shown to replicate efficiently within DCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; in contrast to many other bacterial pathogens (including mycobacteria, <italic>Bordetella</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Legionella pneumophila</named-content>) for which DCs seem to restrict their intracellular growth.</p><p>Human brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that results from direct contact with infected animals or ingestion of contaminated food products. It is usually presented as a debilitating febrile illness that can progress into a chronic disease with severe complications such as infection of the heart and bones. It has been previously shown that <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> infection in calves using an intestinal loop model occurred via Peyer's patches &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Several studies using animal models have established macrophages and placental trophoblasts as two key targets of <italic>Brucella</italic> infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; but a more recent study has shown that <italic>Brucella</italic> can replicate <italic>in vitro</italic> within human monocyte-derived DCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. DCs may therefore constitute an important cellular niche to promote infection.</p><p><italic>Brucella</italic> virulence is dependent on its ability to survive and replicate within host cells. Once internalised, <italic>Brucella</italic> is found within a compartment, the <italic>Brucella</italic>-containing vacuole (BCV) that transiently interacts with early endosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. However, BCVs do not fuse with lysosomes and instead fuse with membrane from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to establish a vacuole suited for replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. An important virulence factor of <italic>Brucella</italic> is its unconventional lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is necessary for entry and early development of BCVs within host cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Brucella</italic> LPS also has important immuno-modulatory activities by forming non-functional complexes with MHC class II at the cell surface of macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. More recently, the periplasmic <italic>Brucella</italic> cyclic &#x003b2;-1,2-glucan, which interacts with lipid domains, has been implicated in the early biogenesis of BCVs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. At later stages of BCV trafficking, the VirB type IV secretion system enables interactions with the ER and formation of an ER-derived compartment suitable for <italic>Brucella</italic> intracellular replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. However, no secreted effector molecules of the VirB type IV secretion system have yet been identified.</p><p>Although there is increasing knowledge about the virulence factors that enable <italic>Brucella</italic> to survive inside host cells, it is still unclear how <italic>Brucella</italic> is able to remain hidden from the immune system and cause chronic disease. The escape from the lysosomal pathway and fusion with the ER may interfere with the ability of host cells to mount an efficient immune response against <italic>Brucella.</italic> In this study, we used a murine intestinal loop model of infection and found that intestinal DCs from the region underlying the follicle associated epithelium (FAE) of Peyer's patches were infected by <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> soon after inoculation. To better characterise the consequences of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> infection on the immune functions of DCs, we have used murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) as a model system. <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> replicates within BMDCs and inhibits the process of DC maturation, ultimately leading to a reduction of cytokine secretion and antigen presentation. We have also identified a <italic>Brucella</italic> protein, Btp1, which contributes to inhibiting maturation of infected DCs <italic>in vitro</italic> by targeting the TLR2 signalling pathway, highlighting a new mechanism used by <italic>Brucella</italic> to control the immune response of the host.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> Infection of Intestinal DCs</title><p>We used a mouse intestinal loop model to characterise the cellular targets of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> by confocal microscopy during early stages of the infection.

In addition, an increase in the level of expression and secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and to a lesser extent IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040021-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040021-g006">6</xref>F) was observed at both 24 and 48 h after infection, consistent with a role for Btp1 in controlling DC function.

The most important TLRs in the context of a bacterial infection are TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 that recognize lipoproteins, LPS, flagellin and CpG DNA, respectively. However, recent work showed that DCs poorly respond to flagellin due to limited TLR5 expression in these cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; so we therefore excluded this pathway.

Further work will be required to characterise in detail the molecular mechanisms of <italic>Brucella</italic> internalisation by DCs.</p><p>An important aspect of <italic>Brucella</italic> pathogenesis is its ability to evade the immune system and persist within the host. <named-content content-type="genus-species">In vitro</named-content> studies have illustrated that <italic>Brucella</italic> is efficient at remaining unnoticed by host cells, notably by having an atypical LPS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, which is several hundred times less toxic than <italic>Salmonella</italic> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> LPS. Although, shown to signal through the TLR4 pathway, <italic>Brucella</italic> LPS is not a potent inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-microbial proteins such as the IFN-&#x003b3; inducible p-47 GTPases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. DCs treated with up to 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of purified <italic>Brucella</italic> LPS, did not induce phenotypic maturation nor significant secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0040021-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A and data not shown). Conversely, DCs incubated with heat-killed <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> showed significant maturation indicating that host cells can detect <italic>Brucella</italic> pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), other than LPS. A recent study has shown that a lumazine synthase from <italic>Brucella</italic> can activate DCs via TLR4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, heat-killed <italic>Brucella</italic> can induce TLR9 and promote Th1-mediated responses in both DCs and macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; probably after bacterial degradation in lysosomes.</p><p>Immunity against <italic>Brucella</italic> requires cell-mediated mechanisms that result in the production of cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3;. In this study, we have shown that <italic>Brucella</italic> inhibits or delays the process of DC maturation to establish a replicative niche, which results in reduced cytokine secretion and disabled antigen presentation. It is likely that impairement of DC function and cytokine secretion by <italic>Brucella</italic> favours infection and/or promotes the establishment of the chronic phase of the disease. Although, we did not detect any significant secretion of IL-10 in infected DCs it is possible that, by preventing their full activation, <italic>Brucella</italic> uses the tolerogenic properties of DCs to subvert the immune response. There is growing evidence that induction of tolerance is not restricted to immature DCs. Recent studies have shown that migrating DCs, which are mature or in the process of maturing (bearing considerable surface expression of MHC class II molecules) are capable of inducing tolerance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b034">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Brucella-</italic>infected DCs, which show an intermediate level of maturation could therefore contribute to tolerance induction in tissues and establishment of chronic infection. Consistent with this hypothesis, reduction of IL-10 levels in mice has been shown to improve host resistance to <italic>Brucella</italic> infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, a new <italic>Brucella</italic> virulence protein (PrpA) was recently identified as a potent B-cell mitogen and IL-10 inducer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, this protein is necessary for the early immuno-supression observed in <italic>Brucella</italic>-infected mice and the establishment of chronic disease. Brucellosis development is a complex process that involves many virulence factors some of them, such as the VirB type IV secretion system, are required for virulence in different cell types, whereas others may function in specific cell types, such as the <italic>Brucella</italic> cyclic &#x003b2;-1,2-glucan in macrophages and PrpA in B-cells.</p><p>A recent study has shown that <italic>Brucella</italic>-infected human myeloid DCs do not mature extensively and instead secrete low levels of IL-12 and TNF-&#x003b1; and have an impaired capacity to present antigens to na&#x000ef;ve T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. These results are consistent with our data in murine DCs. However, this study implicates the <italic>Brucella</italic> outer membrane protein Omp25 and the two-component regulatory system BvrRS in the control of DC maturation through blockage of TNF-&#x003b1; secretion. This is not surprising as both these mutants have significant modifications of their outer membrane and LPS structure, which are an essential feature of <italic>Brucella</italic> virulence enabling bacteria to escape pathogen recognition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore the effects observed are more likely to be pleiotropic than specific to DC maturation. Furthermore, in the case of the <italic>bvrR</italic> mutant, which they show induces higher maturation than the <italic>omp25</italic> mutant, the increased maturation is most likely due to its degradation in lysosomal compartments (the equivalent results can be obtained with heat-killed <italic>Brucella</italic>) since this mutant was previously shown to be unable to replicate within human DCs by the same group &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In this study, we have identified a new <italic>Brucella</italic> protein, Btp1, which contributes to modulation of TLR signalling within host cells. A mutant lacking this protein showed increased levels of DALIS formation and also an increase in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the level of surface expression of some co-stimulatory molecules was not significantly increased in cells infected with the mutant strain. Thus the existence of other bacterial molecules, capable of further inhibiting the antigen presentation capability of DCs, is highly probable and additional studies are required to identify and characterize these putative new factors.</p><p>By ectopically expressing Btp1, we found that it can inhibit TLR signalling, particularly TLR2, in a manner consistent with observations in DCs obtained from different knock-out mice infected with the <italic>btp1</italic> mutant strain. Interestingly, we did not observe any inhibition of human TLR2 when using the same concentrations of Btp1. It is possible that higher amounts of Btp1 are required to block human TLR2 in this system or it may be that Btp1 specifically recognizes the mouse TLR2 Tir domain. Further work is now required to identify the cellular target of Btp1 and to analyse its role during infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of TLR signalling in the control of <italic>Brucella</italic> infection, namely the role of the MyD88 adaptor protein in the clearance of the S19 <italic>Brucella</italic> vaccine strain in macrophages at late stages of the infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. It is interesting that <italic>Brucella</italic> produces at least one protein that can act as negative regulator of TLR signalling, which constitutes an essential link between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Along with the <italic>Salmonella</italic> TIR-containing protein TlpA, they may constitute a novel class of intracellular bacterial virulence factors that interfere with TLR signalling and control specific steps of the host immune response. We hypothesize that Btp1 is secreted into the host cytosol were it interacts with either the TLR2 directly and/or with its adaptor proteins resulting in reduction of TLR2 signalling.</p><p>In the case of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, TlpA is required for virulence in macrophages and in the mouse model of infection. This is not the case for Btp1, since a <italic>btp1</italic> mutant is not significantly attenuated in the mouse model of brucellosis (Marchesini, Comerci and Ugalde, unpublished results). Interestingly, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection results in phenotypic activation of DCs and high secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines probably due to its LPS (since addition of <italic>Salmonella</italic> LPS at 100 ng/ml to DCs results in DC activation; data not shown). Nonetheless, live <italic>Salmonella</italic> is able to restrict MHC class II-dependent antigen presentation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, however no study has yet been carried out with the <italic>tlpA</italic> mutant in this context. It is possible that the Tir-containing protein TlpA is involved in the control of DC function but no mechanism has yet been proposed and it remains unclear how <italic>Salmonella</italic> interferes with antigen presentation in DCs. When comparing <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Brucella</italic>, it is important to consider that these two pathogens cause very distinct diseases in susceptible mice; <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> infection is characterised by fast systemic spread of the bacteria whereas <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> establishes a chronic-like non-fatal disease. It is therefore likely that DCs play a very distinct role in the pathogenesis of these two bacteria and that these pathogens have developed specific mechanisms to control the immune response. For example, in the case of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, activation of DCs does not affect its intracellular survival (data not shown) whereas <italic>Brucella</italic> cannot reach its ER-derived replication niche in fully matured DCs, which impact on its survival. In the case of <italic>Brucella</italic>, infected DCs remain in an intermediate maturation stage. Although its atypical LPS enables bacteria to remain less noticeable by the host, it is interesting that <italic>Brucella</italic> expresses at least one protein that interferes to a certain level with DC maturation and particularly with secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by DCs. Therefore, it is possible that Btp1 contributes to the establishment of chronic brucellosis by controlling in the host immune response within specific tissues. Overall<italic>, Brucella</italic> infection of DCs may therefore be required to control the anti-bacterial immune response, in addition to providing a productive replication niche. Alternatively, the migration properties of DCs could facilitate infection spreading, as suggested by the rapid interaction of DCs with FAE penetrating <italic>Brucella</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains.</title><p>The bacterial strains used in this study were <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. enterica</named-content> serovar Typhimurium strain 12023, smooth virulent <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. abortus</named-content> strain 2308 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; and the isogenic mutants <italic>virB9</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>cgs</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> BvI129 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040021-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>btp1</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (this study, see bellow).
