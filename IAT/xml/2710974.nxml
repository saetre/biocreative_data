Retroviral vectors introduced constitutively active TSHR (TSHR*) into 3T3L1 preadipocytes; despite increased cAMP (RIA) and phospho-CREB (western blot) there was no spontaneous adipogenesis (assessed morphologically, using oil red O and QPCR measurement of adipogenesis markers). We speculated that G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; signalling may be inhibitory but failed to induce adipogenesis using activated Gs&#x003b1; (<italic>gsp</italic>*). Inhibition of phosphodiesterases did not promote adipogenesis in TSHR* or <italic>gsp*</italic> populations. Furthermore, differentiation induced by adipogenic medium with pioglitazone was reduced in TSHR* and abolished in <italic>gsp*</italic> expressing 3T3L1 cells. TSHR* and <italic>gsp</italic>* did not inactivate PPAR&#x003b3; (PPARG as listed in the HUGO database) by phosphorylation but expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 was reduced and PPAR&#x003b3;2 undetectable in <italic>gsp*</italic>. FOXO1 phosphorylation (required to inactivate this repressor of adipogenesis) was lowest in <italic>gsp</italic>* despite the activation of AKT by phosphorylation. PROF is a mediator that facilitates FOXO1 phosphorylation by phospho-Akt. Its transcript levels remained constantly low in the <italic>gsp</italic>* population. In most measurements, the TSHR* cells were between the <italic>gsp</italic>* and control 3T3L1 preadipocytes. The enhanced down-regulation of PREF1 (adipogenesis inhibitor) permits retention of some adipogenic potential in the TSHR* population. We conclude that Gs&#x003b1; signalling impedes FOXO1 phosphorylation and thus inhibits <italic>PPAR&#x003b3;</italic> transcription and the alternative promoter usage required to generate <italic>PPAR&#x003b3;2</italic>, the fat-specific transcription factor necessary for adipogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS200">Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id rid="CS200">WT076003MA</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipose tissue expands via two mechanisms, hypertrophy of individual adipocytes and hyperplasia due to the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocyte precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drolet <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> protocols to induce preadipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis) use agents to increase cAMP. Furthermore, studies in the 3T3L1 murine preadipocytes, the cell line that has been central in unravelling the complex mechanisms driving adipogenesis, indicated that treatment with forskolin or isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) alone suffices to trigger the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boone <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>) and it has been shown subsequently that cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) activation is both necessary and sufficient to induce adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Reusch <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>).</p><p>Many G protein-coupled receptors, including the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), which is the main regulator of thyroid function and growth, signal predominantly via the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, ultimately leading to phosphorylation of CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Vassart &#x00026; Dumont 1992</xref>). TSHR expression is also increased during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haraguchi <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>). Does this suggest a role for TSHR activation in adipocyte biology? The question is clinically relevant since thyroid dysfunction is common, affecting up to 2% of the population, and the majority of these individuals will have overactivation of the TSHR either by supraphysiological concentrations of TSH in hypothyroidism or from thyroid stimulating antibodies in Graves' hyperthyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vanderpump <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of the known signalling pathways following from TSHR activation, we hypothesise that it should trigger adipogenesis spontaneously or at least enhance that induced by known differentiating agents such as synthetic PPAR&#x003b3; (PPARG as listed in HUGO database) agonists. We have used an <italic>in vitro</italic> model in which naturally occurring constitutively active mutant forms of TSHR, found in e.g. toxic nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Paschke &#x00026; Ludgate 1997</xref>), are introduced using retroviral vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuhrer <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). Our previous studies used the model to investigate the effect of TSHR activation on human orbital primary preadipocytes (of relevance to the eye disease occurring in Graves' patients). We demonstrated spontaneous induction of early, but inhibition of the later stages of adipogenesis, even in the presence of PPAR&#x003b3; agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Orbital preadipocytes are a particular fat depot, being derived from the neural crest, and this may explain the differences between our results following activation of the cAMP pathway and those reported using a murine preadipocyte cell line. In the current study, we have applied the model (activating mutant TSHR&#x02013;L629F) to 3T3L1. To our surprise, despite modestly increasing intracellular cAMP and elevating phospho-CREB levels, TSHR activation did not induce adipogenesis and this was not changed by adding a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Furthermore, adipogenesis induced by PPAR&#x003b3; agonists was significantly reduced in the mutant TSHR expressing cells compared with the non-modified population. Since TSHR activation liberates two functional moieties of the Gs protein, &#x003b1; (which acts via PKA) and &#x003b2;&#x003b3; (signals via PI3K), we suggested that the inhibitory effects were due to the latter. Thus, we have introduced constitutively active Gs&#x003b1; (<italic>gsp*</italic>), Q227L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ludgate <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>), which yields only the &#x003b1; subunit. Again there was no spontaneous adipogenesis and <italic>in vitro</italic> induced differentiation was completely abolished. Further investigations revealed a reduction in PPAR&#x003b3;1 and the complete absence of PPAR&#x003b3;2 proteins, the fat-specific isoform, in <italic>gsp*</italic> expressing 3T3L1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagent source; cell culture and adipogenesis protocols</title><p>All chemicals were obtained from Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich and tissue culture media and serum from BioWhittaker-Lonza (Verviers, Belgium) unless otherwise stated.

All experiments were performed on the mixed pools of cells that resulted from geneticin selection. Furthermore, at least two independent mixed pools were generated for each cell population, with results being comparable. Initial characterisation of the G418 resistant pools of 3T3L1 employed RT-PCR and direct sequencing to demonstrate the expression of human TSHR and rat Gs&#x003b1; in the appropriate populations as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ivan <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuhrer <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>).

PPAR&#x003b3;1 expression continues to increase throughout adipogenesis, but PPAR&#x003b3;2 expression is at the limit of detection during the MCE stage, but then resumes in the terminal stages of differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced FOXO1 phosphorylation may explain the lack of PPAR&#x003b3;2</title><p>The transcription factor <italic>FOXO1</italic> represses the promoters for PPAR&#x003b3;1 and PPAR&#x003b3;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armoni <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>); it is inactivated by phosphorylation when it translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nakae <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, in the non-modified cells total FOXO1 protein expression increases in the first 24&#x0200a;h after addition of DM in the nucleus, where it is highly phosphorylated. It is essentially absent from the cytoplasm during the MCE phase. In the <italic>gsp*</italic> population, total FOXO1 protein expression is higher in basal conditions, its expression is increased in DM and we observe its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus between days 1 and 3. The main difference is the considerably decreased level of phosphorylation from day 3 onwards compared with the non-modified 3T3L1. The TSHR* cells' behaviour is midway between that of the other two populations.</p></sec><sec><title>What accounts for the behaviour of FOXO1?</title><p>Phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of FOXO1 depends chiefly on the PI3K and phospho-Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sakaue <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). We investigated and observed an early increase in the proportion of phospho-Akt in all populations of 3T3L1 cells after addition of DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating the need for an alternative explanation for the reduced FOXO1 phosphorylation in <italic>gsp</italic>*.</p><p>Two novel modulators of adipogenesis have recently been described. PROF is a mediator between AKT and FOXO1 whose expression is transiently up-regulated during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fritzius &#x00026; Moelling 2008</xref>). ID2 is a small molecule, whose transcription also increases during adipogenesis and interacts with as yet to be identified factors to stimulate PPAR&#x003b3; expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Park <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). We investigated their expression and found a transient increase in ID2 TCN in all three populations in the first 4&#x02013;8&#x0200a;h following addition of DM, although transcript levels of <italic>ID2</italic> were lowest in <italic>gsp*</italic> cells at all time points (data not shown). By contrast, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>PROF</italic> transcription was increased in the non-modified and, to a lesser extent, in the L629F populations, but remained at a constant low level in the <italic>gsp*</italic> cells. Thus, despite the abundance of phospho-Akt in the <italic>gsp*</italic> population, the paucity of PROF prevents inactivation of FOXO1 by phosphorylation, PPAR&#x003b3;2 is not expressed and adipogenesis does not occur.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our initial aim was to investigate the effects of TSHR activation on 3T3L1 preadipocytes, following our previous studies demonstrating increased adipogenesis in <italic>ex vivo</italic> fat samples from Graves' patients, in whom thyroid stimulating antibodies (as opposed to gain-of-function mutation) produce chronic activation of the TSHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Starkey <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). From reports of a pro-adipogenic effect of agents capable of elevating cAMP, we hypothesised that spontaneous adipogenesis would arise in preadipocytes expressing naturally occurring (e.g. in toxic thyroid adenoma) gain-of-function TSHR mutations (which like thyroid stimulating antibodies, activate adenylate cyclase/PKA), but this was not the case. It should be noted that the increase in cAMP in preadipocytes using retroviral vectors to express the mutant receptor is considerably lower than that obtained following overexpression by transfection of COS cells. The model more closely resembles the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, in which modest elevation of cAMP is sufficient to generate a thyroid toxic nodule, and concurs with our previous findings in thyroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ludgate <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuhrer <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). The constitutively active mutant TSHR responded further when stimulated with TSH, in common with other such mutants, although its TSH responsiveness was less than the WT TSHR (data not shown) as reported by others <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://innere.uniklinikum-leipzig.de/tsh/frame.html">http://innere.uniklinikum-leipzig.de/tsh/frame.html</ext-link>.</p><p>We have then used a gain-of-function mutation in a second component of the PKA pathway, Gs&#x003b1; subunit, to achieve activation of CREB. Neither the receptor, nor its downstream G protein, induced spontaneous adipogenesis (even in the presence of IBMX) as would be expected from previous reports indicating that CREB activation is &#x02018;necessary and sufficient for adipogenesis in 3T3L1&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Reusch <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>).</p><p>Experiments were then conducted to investigate the effects of TSHR* and <italic>gsp*</italic> on <italic>in vitro</italic> induced adipogenesis. The reduced differentiation in 3T3L1 expressing TSHR* mirror the results we obtained in human primary orbital preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Our demonstration of an inhibitory role for Gs&#x003b1; in adipogenesis confirms and extends the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. (1992)</xref> who demonstrated enhanced differentiation in 3T3L1 cells treated with oligomers antisense to the protein. Subsequently, they (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang &#x00026; Malbon 1999</xref>) reported that Gs&#x003b1; repression of adipogenesis is mediated by the tyrosine kinase Syk, but how this may impact adipogenesis is not clear and we are not aware of further studies to address this question. Our investigations of the pathway confirmed their findings, i.e. an early and transient increase in phospho-SYK in the first day following induced adipogenesis, but only in the non-modified population. The L629F and <italic>gsp*</italic> expressing cells showed a decrease in phospho-SYK levels (data not shown).</p><p>Our experiments illustrate that the failure to differentiate in <italic>gsp*</italic> is due to reduced expression of PPAR&#x003b3;1 and interference in the alternate promoter usage required to generate PPAR&#x003b3;2, the isoform specific to adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tontonoz <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>).</p><p>There is some controversy concerning how PPAR&#x003b3;2 expression changes following addition of DM. Some authors report that it is induced, others that it is up-regulated. In our differentiation protocol; PPAR&#x003b3;2 protein expression increases in the first 24&#x0200a;h, but is then repressed until day 5 post-induction. Its reappearance seems to coincide with the start of the terminal differentiation phase and was a consistent finding in all experiments, but contrasts with the results obtained by others reporting that PPAR&#x003b3;2 expression steadily increases through all stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Saladin <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>).</p><p>FOXO1 represses transcription from both the PPAR&#x003b3;1 and PPAR&#x003b3;2 promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armoni <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>) and so we investigated its participation in our different 3T3L1 populations. We observed a rapid increase in FOXO1 protein expression and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus during the first 3 days post-induction in non-modified 3T3L1. At later time points, the nuclear FOXO1 sustained a high degree of phosphorylation. The antibody we have used detects phosphorylation of FOXO1 at serine 256, located in the forkhead domain and indicative of inactivation of the transcription factor; there are two additional phosphorylation sites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nakae <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref> transduced cells with a tagged FOXO1 and were able to demonstrate a cytoplasmic location for phosphorylated FOXO1. In our experiments investigating endogenous FOXO1, it is predominantly cytoplasmic, then nuclear and then present in both fractions, in agreement with this work. Any phosphorylated endogenous FOXO1 in our nuclear extracts is probably partially phosphorylated (on serine 256, the preferred target for the kinase) and thus inactive. Our experiment also revealed that phosphorylation of FOXO1 is impeded in the <italic>gsp*</italic> population from day 3 post-induction onwards and so provides some explanation for their lack of adipogenesis.</p><p>At no time point is signalling via phospho-Akt compromised and yet FOXO1 phosphorylation had remained low in the <italic>gsp*</italic> cells. Investigation of two recently described modulators of adipogenesis, ID2 and PROF suggested they may have a role in explaining this anomaly. PROF, also known as WDFY2, is a member of the WD-repeat propeller-FYVE protein family, which is a binding partner for phospho-Akt and facilitates FOXO1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fritzius &#x00026; Moelling 2008</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of its proximal promoter reveals the presence of a potentially functional half-site cAMP response element; however, it lacks a &#x02018;tata&#x02019; box, generally thought to be required for robust transcriptional induction by cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). Our investigations demonstrate that its expression level, although higher in basal conditions, remained fairly constant at all time points in the <italic>gsp*</italic> cells following addition of DM, in contrast to the marked increase in the non-modified 3T3L1.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that the excess Gs&#x003b1; in the <italic>gsp*</italic> expressing cells might sequester free G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits generated during adipogenesis and thus impede their downstream effects. However, the mutation in &#x003b1; renders it permanently in the GTP-bound form and thus less likely to bind &#x003b2;&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ford <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>).</p><p>In the majority of our experiments, the behaviour of the TSHR* population is mid-way between that of the <italic>gsp*</italic> expressing and parent cell lines, indicating that the inhibitory effects of Gs&#x003b1; are abrogated, presumably by the &#x003b2;/&#x003b3; subunits, which in the thyroid have been reported to signal by PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zaballos <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). PREF1 inhibits adipogenesis by preventing induction of PPAR&#x003b3;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). The significantly enhanced down-regulation of PREF1 in the TSHR* expressing cells may contribute to the rescue mechanism. The drawing depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref> summarises the mechanism we propose to explain the difference in adipogenic potential of the TSHR* and <italic>gsp*</italic> expressing 3T3L1 populations.</p><p>In conclusion, our results identify an important role for Gs&#x003b1; signalling in inhibiting the alternative promoter usage necessary to produce <italic>PPAR&#x003b3;2</italic> transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>There is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the
