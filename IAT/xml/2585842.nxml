Neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss represent the main histological hallmarks observed in AD brains. Amyloid &#x003b2;-protein (A&#x003b2;), the central component of senile plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). &#x003b2;-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the &#x003b2;-secretase in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). &#x003b3;-Secretase is an atypical multimeric membrane-protein aspartic protease composed of at least four subunits: presenilin (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin (Nct), APH-1 (APH-1aL, APH-1aS, or APH-1b), and PEN-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). More recently, two additional proteins, CD147 and TMP21, were found to be closely associated with the &#x003b3;-secretase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).The components of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex are tightly regulated with each other, and PS1 is generally believed to be its catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Another important substrate of &#x003b3;-secretase is Notch, whose intracellular domain (NICD) is released upon &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage and translocates to the nucleus, where it can activate transcription of downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In addition to its role in Notch signaling and APP processing, &#x003b3;-secretase is also involved in regulating intramembraneous proteolysis of many other type I integral membrane proteins, such as Jagged, Delta, E-cadherin, ErbB-4, Nectin-1&#x003b1;, CD44, and LRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Missense mutations in the PS1 and PS2 genes are major causes of early-onset familial AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Although the underlying mechanism of AD neurodegeneration is currently unclear, A&#x003b2; accumulation appears to play a critical role in AD pathogenesis.</p><p>Valproic acid (VPA) is one of four first-line antiepileptic drugs being increasingly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Like other anticonvulsants, VPA inhibits sodium, potassium, and calcium channel functions. Although its direct in vivo target has yet to be definitively identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), VPA may enhance &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). VPA has been found to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase, a protein kinase known to regulate AP-1 function, and mediate neurotrophic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). VPA treatment could lead to a change in glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Furthermore, VPA, like lithium, regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by increasing &#x003b2;-catenin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Increased &#x003b2;-catenin expression is also seen after treatment with the chemically unrelated HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. This mechanism may explain some effects of VPA on gene expression and neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). It has been shown that increased histone acetylation by HDAC inhibitors facilitates synaptogenesis and improves learning and memory, suggesting that inhibition of HDAC may be a suitable therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the effects of VPA on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that VPA inhibited GSK-3&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage of APP both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, such inhibition decreased A&#x003b2; production and neuritic plaque formation, as well as alleviated the memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Our data suggest that VPA is effective for antiamyloid therapy in the prevention and treatment of AD.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>VPA inhibits A&#x003b2; deposition and neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice</title><p>To assess the effect of VPA treatment on AD neuropathology, APP23 transgenic mice, which are an AD mouse model, were subjected to VPA treatment. APP23 mice carry the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuronal-specific Thy1.2 promoter (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081588/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081588/DC1</ext-link>). APP23 mice develop amyloid plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 6 mo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). APP23 mice were treated with 30 mg/kg VPA at 7 mo of age, whereas age-matched control APP23 mice received vehicle solution. To investigate whether VPA treatment could result in neuropathological changes in vivo, VPA-treated and control mice were killed after treatment and behavioral tests. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin S staining were used to detect A&#x003b2;-containing neuritic plaques in the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Neuritic plaque formation was significantly decreased in APP23 mice treated with VPA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, b</xref>), relative to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, a</xref>). Quantification showed that overall VPA treatment reduced plaque number by &#x0223c;4-fold (3.5 &#x000b1; 0.79 vs. 14.95 &#x000b1; 2.09 per slice; P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The effects were similar among mice killed either immediately, 1 mo, or 2 mo after treatment and behavioral testing (0.75 &#x000b1; 0.48 vs. 5.50 &#x000b1; 1.32, P &#x0003c; 0.001; 2.33 &#x000b1; 0.50 vs. 10.33 &#x000b1; 1.26, P &#x0003c; 0.001; and 5.30 &#x000b1; 1.33 vs. 21.5 &#x000b1; 02.76, P &#x0003c; 0.001, respectively; Fig. S2). APP23 mice were also treated with VPA at 9 mo of age. Significantly more neuritic plaques were formed in the mice at 9 mo compared with 7 mo of age; however, VPA treatment starting at the age of 9 mo could also significantly reduce neuritic plaque formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, c and d</xref>). The number of plaques in VPA-treated and control mice were 11.09 &#x000b1; 0.92 and 25.60 &#x000b1; 3.50, respectively (P &#x0003c; 0.005; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The area of plaques was also significantly reduced in VPA-treated mice compared with control by 43.10 &#x000b1; 11.13% for the 7-mo-old group (P &#x0003c; 0.01) and by 59.66 &#x000b1; 5.44% for the 9-mo-old group (P &#x0003c; 0.05). In addition to reducing neuritic plaque formation, VPA treatment also significantly increased microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2 immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), which indicated a protective effect on dendritic damages and promoting neurite outgrowth in the transgenic mice. Similar results were obtained with silver staining (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>VPA treatment significantly reduces neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice.</bold> (A) APP23 mice at the age of 7 or 9 mo and APP23/PS45 double-transgenic mice at the age of 6 wk were treated with 30 mg/kg VPA for 4 wk, whereas age-matched control APP23 mice received the vehicle solution.

PS45 mice have an overexpression of the human familial AD-associated G384A mutant presenilin-1. The double-transgenic mice developed detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 mo of age. Double-transgenic mice were treated with 30 mg/kg VPA at 6 wk of age for 4 wk. VPA treatment markedly inhibited neuritic plaque formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, f and d</xref>) and significantly reduced plaque numbers from 14.84 &#x000b1; 1.67 to 2.862 &#x000b1; 0.65 (P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).

The Morris water maze was used to determine the effect of VPA on spatial memory. In the visible platform tests, VPA-treated and control APP23 mice had similar escape latency (53.190 &#x000b1; 1.56 and 49.75 &#x000b1; 2.47 s; P &#x0003e; 0.05; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and path length (7.03 &#x000b1; 1.33 and 6.78 &#x000b1; 1.60 s; P &#x0003e; 0.05; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), which indicated that VPA treatment did not affect mouse motility or vision. In the hidden platform-swimming test, APP23 mice treated with VPA showed significant improvements compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth day of the hidden platform test was shorter (15.95 &#x000b1; 1.61 and 12.80 &#x000b1; 1.83 s) than nontreated APP23 mice (29.04 &#x000b1; 2.99 and 24.89 &#x000b1; 3.33 s; P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The VPA-treated mice were able to swim significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (3.88 &#x000b1; 0.91 and 2.68 &#x000b1; 1.02 m) compared with control mice (6.03 &#x000b1; 0.94 and 5.37 &#x000b1; 1.38 m) on the third and fourth day (P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. VPA treatment significantly improved the AD mouse's spatial memory. The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with VPA treatment compared with control (9.56 &#x000b1; 2.62 and 4.18 &#x000b1; 1.06; P &#x0003c; 0.005; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). These data indicate that VPA treatment significantly improves the memory deficits seen in APP23 mice. Because VPA treatment stopped a day before and there was no treatment during the behavioral testing, the effect of VPA on the behavioral performance in the mice was not just acute, but also long lasting.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>VPA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.</bold> A Morris water maze test consists of 1 d of visible platform tests and 4 d of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 h after the last hidden platform test.

To further investigate the underlying mechanism of VPA's effect, we first examined its effect on APP, BACE1, and PS1 gene expression. Our data show that VPA treatment did not change the mRNA levels of these genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Previous studies suggested that GSK-3&#x003b2; regulated A&#x003b2; formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). GSK-3&#x003b2; activity is regulated by its phosphorylation at the serine 9 (S<sup>9</sup>) and tyrosine 216 sites (Y<sup>216</sup>). The S<sup>9</sup> phosphorylation (pGSK-3&#x003b2;<sup>S9</sup>) inhibits GSK-3&#x003b2; activity, whereas the Y<sup>216</sup> phosphorylation (pGSK-3&#x003b2;<sup>Y216</sup>) up-regulates GSK-3&#x003b2; activity. To examine whether GSK-3&#x003b2; mediated VPA's effect on APP processing in AD transgenic model mice, brain tissues of the double-transgenic mice were subjected to Western blot analysis for total GSK-3&#x003b2; and phospho-GSK-3&#x003b2; levels. We found no differences in total GSK-3&#x003b2; protein levels between the VPA treatment and control mice groups; however, VPA treatment also significantly increased GSK-3&#x003b2;<sup>S9</sup> levels in vivo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Consistent with the transgenic mouse data, VPA treatment in vitro also significantly facilitated the phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; at the S9 site. The level of phospho-GSK-3&#x003b2;<sup>S9</sup> in VPA-treated N2a cells was increased to 147.87 &#x000b1; 12.38 and 181.18 &#x000b1; 16.55% after 12- and 24-h treatment (P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>), whereas VPA had little effect on total GSK-3&#x003b2; level in N2a cells (P &#x0003e; 0.05; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Further phosphorylation screening by the Kinetworks 1.3 KPSS Phospho-site Profiling revealed that pGSK-3&#x003b2;<sup>Y216</sup> levels were markedly reduced by 37%. Collectively, these data suggest that VPA negatively regulates GSK-3&#x003b2; activity. To examine the effect of VPA on GSK-3&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated biological function, we performed a &#x003b2;-catenin-Tcf reporter gene assay. Phosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin by GSK-3 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, therefore inhibition of GSK-3 stabilizes &#x003b2;-catenin and activates downstream gene transcription. TOPFLASH, containing three copies of the optimal Tcf motif CCTTTGATC upstream of a minimal c<italic>-Fos</italic> promoter driving luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), were cotransfected with &#x003b2;-catenin and Tcf expression plasmids into N2a cells.

The up-regulatory effect of VPA was abolished when the cells were transfected with mutant &#x003b2;-catenin cDNA.

Inhibition of HDAC activity with pharmacological agents demonstrated limited levels of synaptogenesis and improved learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Preclinical studies suggested that inhibition of A&#x003b2; production by altering APP processing at the &#x003b2;- or &#x003b3;-secretase site by lithium or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs could potentially be avenues for AD drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Here, we show that VPA, an antiepileptic drug, can serve as a highly effective antiamyloid treatment in AD transgenic model mice. VPA can inhibit GSK-3&#x003b2;, resulting in increased &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). GSK-3&#x003b2; is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, controlling &#x003b2;-catenin levels and transcriptional responses required for development and cell growth. Consistent with previous reports, we found that VPA inhibited GSK-3&#x003b2; activity by altering its phosphorylation state. VPA was also found to inhibit HDAC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), which could improve learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Previous reports showed that VPA treatment not only induced synapsin I clustering in developing axons but also increased axonal branching and formation of curved axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). We show that VPA not only inhibits neuritic plaque formation but also promotes neurite outgrowth in the transgenic mice.</p><p>There have been VPA clinical trials conducted on AD patients. Profenno et al. reported that doses of &#x0003c;1,000 mg/d of divalproex sodium could be tolerated by patients in a Safety and Tolerability trial of 20 outpatients with probable AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). In a clinical trial conducted on 14 moderate to severe institutionalized AD patients with a mean age of 85.6 yr that assessed VPA's effect on agitation and aggression, VPA treatment was found to be ineffective for the management of agitation and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). These reports had little data that addressed VPA's effect on AD pathogenesis, neuropathology, and cognitive impairments. Consistent with a previous work which showed that both lithium and VPA inhibited A&#x003b2; production in a Swedish mutant APP751 stable cell line and PDAPP (APPV717F) transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), we systematically demonstrated that in two different transgenic AD mouse models, VPA has significant beneficial effects on AD pathogenesis. VPA reduced &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage of APP and A&#x003b2; production in vitro and in vivo, resulting in the prevention of AD-associated pathological outcomes. Furthermore, our data showed that early administration of VPA not only reduced neuritic plaque formation, but also rescued some memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. Meanwhile, we found that the inhibitory effect of VPA on neuritic plaque formation was present up to 2 mo after discontinuing administration of VPA, indicating VPA's long lasting antiamyloid treatment potential for AD patients. However, when mice were treated with VPA at a later stage, when there was profound neuritic plaque formation, VPA could still reduce further neuritic plaque formation, albeit a lesser effect on improving memory deficits in the older mice. Our preclinical animal study indicated that VPA can have effects on neuropathology changes at early and late stages, but cognitive impairments can only be improved at an early stage intervention. These data suggest that VPA treatment should be applied at early stages of AD pathogenesis for effective improvement of pathological and cognitive impairments. This information may also provide insights for VPA clinical trial designs. Our animal study suggests that the VPA trial might not show beneficial results on late or severe AD patients, whereas it might show significant improvements in early or mild AD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Transgenic mice and VPA treatment.</title><p>Animal experiment protocols were approved by The University of British Columbia Animal Care and Use committee.
