Rapid internalization of fluorescently labeled fasciculin-2 to N-AChE-S transfected cells indicated membranal localization. In cultured cell lines, N-AChE-S transfection activated the Tau kinase GSK3, induced Tau hyper-phosphorylation and caused apoptosis. N-AChE-S-induced cell death was suppressible by inhibiting GSK3 or caspases, by enforced overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins, or by AChE inhibition or silencing. Moreover, inherent N-AChE-S was upregulated by stressors inducing protein misfolding and calcium imbalances, both characteristic of AD; and in cortical tissues from AD patients, N-AChE-S overexpression coincides with Tau hyper-phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together, these findings attribute an apoptogenic role to N-AChE-S and outline a potential value to AChE inhibitor therapeutics in early AD.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In Alzheimer's disease (AD), premature death of cholinergic neurons is associated with accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, constituting of hyper-phosphorylated Tau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003108-Arriagada1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

It occurred to us that some, but not all, AChE variants, may lead to the neuronal cell death which occurs in AD. To challenge this theory, we studied AChE expression in the AD cortex, tested the effects of aberrant AChE gene expression in cultured cells, explored the molecular mechanism(s) involved by manipulating both AChE and key apoptotic proteins, and searched for pharmacological means capable of mitigating the observed apoptotic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>N-AChE-S expression induces caspase-mediated cell death</title><p>Overexpression of two short (AChE-S, AChE-R) and two N-terminally extended AChE variants(N-AChE-S, N-AChE-R) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003108-Meshorer1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003108-g001">Fig 1A</xref>), was induced by transient transfection of mouse primary cortical cells, HEK 293 embryonic kidney cells, U87MG glioblastoma, T84 lung epithel and CHO hamster ovary cells. In primary cortical cells expressing N-AChE-S, this invariably caused apoptosis, observed as increased TUNEL labeling and caspase 3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003108-g001">Fig 1B and C, respectively</xref>). Surviving cortical cells transfected with N-AChE-S showed similar cell body size to those expressing the other variants; however, they extended fewer and shorter processes from the cell body than cells expressing any of the other variants, indicating ill health for transfected surviving cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003108-g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Importantly, no other tested AChE variant exerted such effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003108-g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003108.s005">Table S1</xref>).We excluded the possibility of indirect effects of secreted AChE or other proteins, by demonstrating that pre-conditioned medium, removed 24 hr after transfection and added to non-transfected cells, caused no apoptotic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003108-g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003108.s005">Table S1</xref>).

Next, individual clones of CHO cells, which do not express any endogenous AChE variant were stably transfected with N-AChE-S or the shorter AChE-S, for comparison. Cloned cells presented considerably less N-AChE-S protein than clones stably transfected with AChE-S (also called &#x0201c;tailed&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003108-Massoulie1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>). This was reflected in considerably lower ACh hydrolytic activity than that of cells stably transfected with AChE-S (10&#x000b1;8.4 vs. 150&#x000b1;45 nmol substrate hydrolyzed/min/mg protein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003108-g002">Fig 2G, dashed line</xref>). Such low activities, lower than the average activity observed in the human brain, indicated a possible selective pressure against expression of N-AChE-S in high levels. Thus, microinjection as well as transient and stable transfections all suggested that excess N-AChE-S is incompatible with cell viability.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>N-AChE-S displays similar catalytic characteristics to other AChE variants</title><p>Fractionation and activity tests demonstrated that AChE-S and N-AChE-S largely remained within the cells, whereas AChE-R and N-AChE-R both showed a tendency to be secreted, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003108.s002">Fig S1A</xref>).Sequence analysis predicted that while the AChE signal peptide is likely masked by the N-extended terminus, the new N-AChE variants include an additional signal peptide. Higher expression levels for the shorter variants were observed by immunoblot analysis of transiently transfected cells. Enzymatic Activity (with acetyl-thiocholine) staining of native gels showed matched differences in enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003108.s002">Fig S1B</xref>), indicating proportional expression and activity of the various AChE proteins.

Thus, N-AChE-S was found to be expressed at lower levels than the shorter variants, but despite this, it was the only variant with an apoptogenic effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>N-ACHE-S promotes GSK3 activation and Tau hyper-phosphorylation</title><p>The relatively low levels of N-AChE-S could potentially be due to misfolded proteins activating ER stress-induced apoptosis.

We tested the potential involvement of GSK3 in N-AChE-S-induced apoptosis in U87MG cells, which are more readily amenable for transfection than primary neurons. Supporting such involvement, N-AChE-S expression selectively decreased the levels of inactive GSK3 carrying phosphorylated serine, whereas total GSK3&#x003b2; and the levels of hyper-activated GSK3&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; with phosphorylated tyrosine remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003108-g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Thus, larger GSK3 fractions were active under N-AChE-S expression. Moreover, N-ACHE-S overexpression induced progressive increases in the hyper-phosphorylation of Tau in cultured U87MG cells, reaching a 37&#x00025; increase by 48 hr post-transfection (P&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003108-g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

Our findings did not distinguish between these possibilities but demonstrate apparent association of Tau hyper-phosphorylation with the N-AChE-S apoptotic mechanism. We further predict that exposure to apoptotic stressors would likely induce N-AChE-S expression, particularly in the cholinergic neurons with higher basal AChE expression, and cause apoptotic cell death. At least part of the currently employed AD therapeutics may ameliorate the effect of this overexpression by preventing the N-AChE-S-induced apoptosis, thus delaying disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003108-Nordberg1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003108-Recanatini1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Further delineation of this induction and ways to manipulate it for preventing the premature death of cholinergic neurons at earlier stages of the disease would therefore merit special attention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Human brain tissue</title><p>Brain tissue from AD patients (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) and matched non-demented controls (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5) was obtained from The Netherlands Brain Bank.
