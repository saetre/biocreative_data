There, they are sorted and incorporated into the intralumenal invaginations of nascent multivesicular bodies, which function as transport intermediates to late endosomes. Receptor sorting is achieved by Hrs&#x02014;an adaptor-like protein that binds membrane PtdIns3P via a FYVE motif&#x02014;and then by ESCRT complexes, which presumably also mediate the invagination process. Eventually, intralumenal vesicles are delivered to lysosomes, leading to the notion that EGF receptor sorting into multivesicular bodies mediates lysosomal targeting. Here, we report that Hrs is essential for lysosomal targeting but dispensable for multivesicular body biogenesis and transport to late endosomes. By contrast, we find that the PtdIns3P-binding protein SNX3 is required for multivesicular body formation, but not for EGF receptor degradation. PtdIns3P thus controls the complementary functions of Hrs and SNX3 in sorting and multivesicular body biogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The cell's genetic program is modulated by extracellular signals that activate cell surface receptors and, in turn, intracellular effectors, to regulate transcription. For cells to function normally, these signals must be turned off to avoid permanent activation&#x02014;a situation often associated with cancer. For many receptors, signaling is repressed, or down-regulated, in a process that first internalizes and then degrades the receptors. After receptors are removed from the cell surface into structures called early endosomes, they are selectively incorporated within vesicles that form inside the endosome. During this process, endosomal membranes are pulled away from the cytoplasm towards the endosome lumen, against the flow of intracellular membrane traffic, eventually resulting in the formation of a &#x0201c;multivesicular body&#x0201d; (vesicles within vesicles). The common view is that these intralumenal vesicles are then delivered to lysosomes, where they are degraded along with their receptor cargo. We have investigated the mechanisms responsible for the biogenesis of intralumenal vesicles in multivesicular bodies. We find that the small protein SNX3, which binds the signaling lipid phosphatidyl inositol-3-phosphate, is necessary for the formation of intralumenal vesicles, but is not involved in the degradation of the cell surface receptor for EGF. Conversely, we find that Hrs, which also binds phosphatidyl inositol-3-phosphate and mediates receptor sorting into intralumenal vesicles, is essential for lysosomal targeting but dispensable for multivesicular body biogenesis. Phosphatidyl inositol-3-phosphate thus controls the complementary functions of Hrs and SNX3 in the sorting of signaling receptors and multivesicular body biogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>SNX3 plays a direct role in the formation of intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) but is not involved in EGF receptor degradation, whereas Hrs is essential for lysosomal targeting but dispensable for MVB biogenesis.

Ubiquitin coupled to the receptor then binds Hrs through its ubiquitin interacting motif, while Hrs also interacts simultaneously with membrane PtdIns3P via a FYVE domain and with clathrin, leading to the concentration of activated receptor molecules into specialized clathrin-coated regions of early endosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

Formation of ECV/MVBs appears to be itself under the control of EGF signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; and depends on annexin family members &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas conversion of the small GTPase Rab5 to Rab7 may occur on early endosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; or during early-to-late endosome transport &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Upon fusion with late endosomes, ECV/MVB lumenal vesicles are delivered to late endosomes, and are eventually packaged within lysosomes, where they are degraded together with their cargo of down-regulated receptors.</p><p>Evidence shows that the sorting process mediated by Hrs and ESCRTs is coupled somehow to the mechanism of membrane invagination towards the lumen of the endosome, including during the topologically equivalent process of HIV budding at the plasma membrane, which takes advantage of the ESCRT machinery &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. In yeast, mutation of the genes that encode ESCRTs and other components of this pathway leads to the formation of an aberrant endosomal compartment (Class E VPS phenotype). Then, endocytosed membrane proteins that would normally be degraded accumulate in this Class E compartment but also on the membrane of the vacuole (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; and reference therein), which is functionally equivalent to lysosomes.

Knockdown of Tsg101, an ESCRT-I subunit, causes pleiotropic changes in early endosome morphology, including tubulation, reduction in the number of lumenal vesicles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, and perhaps, the formation of a mammalian equivalent of the yeast Class E compartment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. While it is clear that Hrs and ESCRTs play an essential role in the lysosomal targeting of many ubiquitinated proteins, the mechanism controlling membrane invagination itself remains elusive. All proteins that are known to induce membrane deformation act in the topologically opposite direction&#x02014;towards the cytoplasm&#x02014;via direct insertion into the bilayer or protein&#x02013;lipid interactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Here, we have further investigated the mechanisms that control endosomal membrane dynamics, and in particular the role of PtdIns3P and its effectors.

SNX3 overexpression caused a dramatic accumulation of multivesicular structures without causing a general expansion of endosome vesicular regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060214-sg006">Figure S6</xref>; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), perhaps suggesting that only specialized regions of the early endosome are competent to become MVBs. Multivesicular elements after SNX3 overexpression were frequently clustered in groups of five to ten individuals, as revealed in low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060214-sg006">Figure S6</xref>) and high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">Figure 2</xref>F) magnification views, perhaps connected to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Immunogold labeling of cryosections showed that GFP-SNX3 itself was abundant on the limiting membrane of these multivesicular structures. These SNX3-positive structures all exhibited a similar multivesicular and spherical appearance (diameter &#x02248; 0.4 &#x003bc;m), which closely resembles the morphology of MVBs or ECVs that mediate early-to-late endosome transport &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;&#x02014;herein referred to as ECV/MVBs. However, in marked contrast to free ECV/MVBs during transport towards late endosomes, these SNX3-positive structures exhibited the characteristic features of early endosomes, including all early endosomal markers that were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g001">Figure 1</xref> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, the transferrin receptor, which is restricted to early and recycling endosomes, was found closely associated with these SNX3-positive ECV/MVB-like structures (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">Figure 2</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">2</xref>I), consistent with data from us (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and others &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. The transferrin receptor was often present in tubulo-cisternal elements connected to multivesicular elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">Figure 2</xref>I), presumably corresponding to forming recycling endosomes. It thus appears that SNX3 overexpression causes the accumulation of multivesicular regions on early endosomal membranes. These ECV/MVB-like structures fail to detach, or to mature, from early endosomes. Such a frustrated process of ECV/MVB formation accounts nicely for our observations that the transport of EGF receptor, VSV and bulk markers beyond early endosomes is then inhibited (see model, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060214-sg010">Figure S10</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0060214-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>SNX3 Colocalizes with Hrs, Ubiquitinated Proteins, and Clathrin on Rab5<sup>Q79L</sup> Enlarged Endosomes.</title><p>(A&#x02013;D) HeLa cells co-expressing both GFP-Rab5<sup>Q79L</sup> and mRFP-SNX3 were processed for immunofluorescence using different antibodies as indicated and analyzed by triple channel fluorescence.

To further characterize SNX3 distribution, we thus used the constitutively active mutant Rab5<sup>Q79L</sup>, which induces the formation of enlarged early endosomes by promoting their homotypic fusion. On these large endosomes, regions containing Hrs, clathrin, and ubiquitinated receptors could be resolved by light microscopy from those containing EEA1, indicating that components of the machinery that sorts down-regulated receptors into ECV/MVB internal vesicles are concentrated in specific early endosomal domains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. When GFP-Rab5<sup>Q79L</sup> was coexpressed with monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-SNX3, both proteins were present on enlarged early endosomes, as expected. Approximately 90&#x00025; of endosomes containing SNX3 were also labeled with Rab5<sup>Q79L</sup>, but some variation in SNX3 association with individual Rab5<sup>Q79L</sup>-endosomes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g003">Figure 3</xref>), presumably reflecting different angles of visualization in the confocal planes. SNX3 was clearly seen to colocalize preferentially with Hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), and clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) in regions that seemed devoid of EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). These observations further demonstrate that ectopically expressed SNX3 accumulates on early endosomal membranes. They also indicate that this accumulation occurs preferentially in multivesicular regions that contain, in addition to SNX3 itself, the protein machinery responsible for sorting into lumenal vesicles. It thus seems that the lumenal invagination process continues in the presence of excess SNX3, leading to the accumulation of multivesicular regions on early endosomes, but that more distal transport events, including ECV/MVB detachment&#x02014;or maturation&#x02014;(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g001">Figures 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g001">1</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">2</xref>D), are inhibited, perhaps because excess SNX3 limits the access or binding of downstream machineries.</p><p>Since overexpression of SNX3 caused an expansion of multivesicular regions on early endosomes, we investigated the impact of SNX3 down-expression on the formation of lumenal vesicles by electron microscopy.

The appearance and size of internal vesicles were otherwise undistinguishable from the controls. Altogether, our data thus indicate that SNX3 plays a direct and specific role in the formation of intralumenal membrane invaginations within nascent ECV/MVBs, since multivesicular regions are increased by overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g002">Figure 2</xref>F) and decreased by down-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>Interestingly, SNX3 knockdown did not affect virus fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) and caused only a small, marginal decrease in nucleocapsid release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Previously, we had found that the VSV envelope undergoes fusion primarily with the membrane of ECV/MVB internal vesicles, thus releasing the capsid into their lumen, where it remains hidden &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. In late endosomes, back fusion of these vesicles with the endosome-limiting membrane then ensures capsid delivery to the cytoplasm, indicating that VSV fusion and capsid release occur in sequential steps of the pathway. In particular, we found that depolymerization of the microtubules, which reduces early-to-late endosome transport &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, does not affect viral fusion, but efficiently inhibits VSV delivery to late endosomes and capsid release &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).

SNX3 knockdown thus appears to prevent the formation of intralumenal invaginations within endosomes without interfering with EGF receptor transport and degradation, indicating that the lysosomal targeting of signaling receptors is then uncoupled from sorting into ECV/MVBs.</p><p>Both Hrs and SNX3 seem to play a role in the membrane invagination process, but only Hrs, and not SNX3, appears to be involved in EGF receptor targeting to lysosomes, perhaps suggesting that Hrs acts upstream of SNX3 in receptor sorting and multivesicular body biogenesis. Consistent with this notion, Hrs knockdown selectively reduced the expression of SNX3&#x02014;without affecting any other protein involved in endosome membrane dynamics that we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g005">Figure 5</xref>A)&#x02014;and in particular decreased the membrane-associated pool of SNX3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060214-sg008">Figure S8</xref>B).

Parallel analysis of cells after proteinA-gold internalization revealed that these endosomes contained five to ten internal vesicles per profile, which were otherwise similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), whether microtubules were intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, right panel) or not (unpublished data)&#x02014;again much like after SNX3 knockdown and in contrast to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g004">4</xref>B). The multivesicular morphology of endosomes in cells treated with Hrs siRNAs could, however, be restored by overexpression of GFP-SNX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g005">Figure 5</xref>C; quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060214-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), despite that fact that Hrs expression remained silenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060214-sg008">Figure S8</xref>D). Structures labeled with 5-nm proteinA-gold then contained approximately 25&#x02013;30 lumenal vesicles per profile, similar to endosomes in mock-treated controls. These data thus strongly suggest that the morphological phenotype of endosomes in Hrs-depleted cells is at least in part due to low SNX3 levels, and also demonstrate that SNX3 is a component of the molecular machinery that drives intralumenal membrane invagination.</p><p>It has been suggested that EGF receptor is trafficked through a subpopulation of multivesicular endosomes in a process that involves annexin A1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Like VSV nucleocapsids, the toxin hijacks these vesicles to reach late endosomes, where back fusion with the limiting membrane releases the lethal factor into the cytosol, leading to the cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs), and in particular MEK1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;.

Then, intralumenal vesicles are transported to lysosomes, where they are degraded together with their receptor cargo. Our observations now demonstrate that lysosomal targeting can function independently of this multivesicular endosome sorting event, since the transport of EGF receptor to late endocytic compartments and its degradation are not affected by SNX3 knockdown, in the absence of ECV/MVB lumenal membranes (see model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060214-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). This agrees with previous observations that PI 3-kinase inhibition with wortmannin inhibits the formation of lumenal vesicles, but not the delivery of the EGF receptor to the lysosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. A corollary of these observations, however, is that Hrs indeed controls lysosome targeting, as expected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, but that this function can be uncoupled from the invagination process in the multivesicular pathway towards late endosomes. Even in the absence of ECV/MVB lumenal membranes after SNX3 knockdown, sorting into putative Hrs platforms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d; is sufficient to ensure, not only receptor transport to late endosomes, but also packaging into lysosomes and degradation.</p><p>Whereas Hrs is necessary for lysosomal targeting, the protein appears to be dispensable for the membrane invagination process that leads to ECV/MVB biogenesis. By contrast, SNX3, which is dispensable for lysosomal targeting, appears to function as a necessary component of the molecular machinery that drives the formation of membrane invaginations within forming ECV/MVBs. Indeed, SNX3 knockdown inhibits the invagination process, whereas excess SNX3 promotes the formation of intralumenal membranes and the accumulation of multivesicular regions on early endosomes. It thus appears that PtdIns3P signaling regulates differentially lysosomal targeting and the biogenesis of ECV/MVBs, via at least two PtdIns3P effectors, Hrs and SNX3, which act sequentially in the pathway. Although our data demonstrate that SNX3 regulates the membrane invagination process itself, the molecular mechanism is unclear. In yeast, the SNX3 homolog Grd19p is involved in selective retrieval of some membrane proteins from the prevacuolar compartment, presumably late endosomes, to the TGN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. It is not known whether the function of yeast Grd19p is somehow related to the function we propose for SNX3 in mammalian cells. However, it is possible that Grd19p and SNX3 play different roles, since endosome-to-Golgi transport of Shiga toxin B-subunit seems to require not SNX3 (this study), but SNX1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Several proteins and lipids were reported to play a role in the formation of intralumenal membranes, including Hrs and ESCRTs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, SNX3 (this study), ceramide &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, and perhaps, LBPA and Alix &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Future work will be needed to determine the precise relationships that may exist between these components. At present, our observations indicate that SNX3 functions downstream of Hrs, and one may speculate that it recruits other proteins, perhaps ESCRTs, which then drive the invagination process.

In this analysis, it was not possible to identify unambiguously cells that have been transfected. However, given the extent of knockdown observed on western blots (80&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025;), the corresponding protein (Hrs or SNX3) must be depleted in at least four out of five (or nine out of ten) cells, if depletion were complete in most cells, rather than partial in all cells. The latter view is consistent with observations that 100&#x00025; of the cells were labeled with fluorescently labeled siRNAs (unpublished data). In any case, to ensure unbiased electron microscopy analysis and quantification of both HRP and proteinA-gold experiments, samples were prepared in Geneva and analyzed by western blotting to ensure that knockdown and re-expression of SNX3 were efficient. Then, samples were shipped to Brisbane. There, each experiment was number coded and analyzed by electron microscopy.

Then, EGF-R interacts sequentially with ESCRT I, II, and III complexes and is incorporated into membrane invaginations (in green), giving rise to a forming ECV/MVB &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. The lumenal vesicles are transported to late endosomes and eventually to lysosomes, where they are degraded together with their receptor cargo. Our previous studies show that VSV envelope fuses with ECV/MVB lumenal membranes, thereby delivering the viral capsid to the lumen of these internal vesicles, where it remains hidden &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. After delivery to late endosomes, back fusion with the limiting membrane ensures capsid delivery to the cytoplasm. The delivery of anthrax toxin lethal factor to the cytoplasm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d; follows a pathway very similar to that of the nucleocapsid (not indicated here for the sake of simplicity).</p><p>(A) SNX3 Overexpression. Our observations indicate that SNX3 overexpression causes an accumulation of multivesicular regions on early endosomes and inhibits ECV/MVB detachment from early endosomes (or maturation) and thus interferes with more-distal transport steps. Then, VSV and EGF-R remain in early endosomes and viral RNA release is inhibited. By contrast, Hrs overexpression was reported to mimic its down-expression by RNAi &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>(B) SNX3 RNAi. We find that SNX3 knockdown reduces the formation of ECV/MVB lumenal vesicles, but not EGF-R transport to late endosomes and degradation in lysosomes, indicating that EGF-R sorting can be uncoupled from its incorporation into ECV/MVB lumenal vesicles. Presumably, Hrs (which is not affected by SNX3 knockdown) then ensures proper EGFR targeting to the lysosomes. Consistently, the delivery of viral RNA to the cytoplasm after SNX3 knockdown no longer requires transport to late endosomes, presumably because virions then fuse with the limiting membrane of &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; ECV/MVBs, devoid of internal vesicles.</p><p>(C) Hrs RNAi. Hrs knockdown reduces the formation of ECV/MVB lumenal vesicles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; and causes a concomitant decrease in SNX3, which is likely to be responsible for the reduction in lumenal vesicles. Indeed, these can be restored by SNX3 re-expression after Hrs knockdown. After Hrs knockdown, the delivery of viral RNA to the cytoplasm no longer requires transport to late endosomes, because virions then fuse with the limiting membrane of &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; ECV/MVBs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060214-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;&#x02014;much like after SNX3 knockdown.

Then, EGF-R sorting in early endosomes may be achieved by other components of the sorting machinery. Alternatively, a disruption of this machinery may allow uncontrolled EGF-R incorporation into the degradation pathway, including, for example, nonubiquitinated molecules.
