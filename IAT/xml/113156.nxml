The derived amino acid sequence (416 amino acids) shows 46&#x00025; identity with the human MBD4 and the conserved catalytic region at the C-terminal end (170 amino acids) has 90&#x00025; identity. The non-conserved region of the avian protein has no consensus sequence for the methylated DNA binding domain. The recombinant proteins from human and chicken have G&#x0002f;T mismatch as well as 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) DNA glycosylase activities. When tested by gel shift assays, human recombinant protein with or without the methylated DNA binding domain binds equally well to symmetrically, hemimethylated DNA and non-methylated DNA. However, the enzyme has only 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activity with the hemimethylated DNA. Footprinting of human MBD4 and of an N-terminal deletion mutant with partially depurinated and depyrimidinated substrate reveal a selective binding of the proteins to the modified substrate around the CpG. As for 5-MeC DNA glycosylase purified from chicken embryos, MBD4 does not use oligonucleotides containing mCpA, mCpT or mCpC as substrates. An mCpG within an A&#x0002b;T-rich oligonucleotide is a much better substrate than an A&#x0002b;T-poor sequence.

Deletion mutations show that G&#x0002f;T mismatch and 5-MeC DNA glycosylase are located in the C-terminal conserved region. In sharp contrast to the 5-MeC DNA glycosylase isolated from the chicken embryo DNA demethylation complex, the two enzymatic activities of MBD4 are strongly inhibited by RNA. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization with antisense RNA indicate that MBD4 is only located in dividing cells of differentiating embryonic tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8bc2280.0x9bb4898" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

These changes can possibly take place by a complex interplay between DNA methyltransferases, DNA demethylation activities and specific regulatory sequences and factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c3">3</xref> and references therein). Recently we have identified in chicken embryos several components of a DNA demethylation complex consisting of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c5">5</xref>), RNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c6">6</xref>) and a G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase combined with 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) DNA glycosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c7">7</xref>). One of the roles of the CpG-rich RNA present in the DNA demethylation complex is to target the DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c8">8</xref>). The RNA helicase in the presence of the CpG-rich RNA and ATP potentiates the activity of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c7">7</xref>). In contrast the same recombinant RNA inhibits the G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase activity. Recently, a family of methylated DNA binding proteins was isolated and sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c9">9</xref>). One of them, MBD4 (also known as MED-1) was shown to have G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase and endonuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c11">11</xref>). Here we show that a human MBD4 and a related chicken protein have both the G&#x0002f;T mismatch and 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activities. Unlike the 5-MeC DNA glycosylase isolated from the DNA demethylation complex, both glycosylase activities of MBD4 are strongly inhibited by RNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction and screening of a chicken cDNA library</title><p>The construction of the chicken cDNA library in phage &#x003bb; was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c6">6</xref>).

All substrates used in the present work are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd624tb1">1</xref>. The quality (methylation) of the synthetic methylated oligonucleotides was tested by chemical sequencing according to Maxam and Gilbert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c13">13</xref>). All oligonucleotides were gel purified. Oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5&#x02032;-ends with polynucleotide kinase and &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP to a specific activity of &#x0223c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> c.p.m.&#x0002f;&#x000b5;g duplex and the substrate concentration for the assay was &#x0003e;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup> M. Aliquots of 50&#x02013;200 ng of recombinant proteins were used per 100 &#x000b5;l assay.

Upon separation on a 20&#x00025; polyacrylamide&#x02013;urea sequencing gel, the quantitative determination of the reaction products of the glycosylases was carried out by cutting out the specific radioactive bands and counting them for radioactivity. A slice of equivalent size was also cut out from the blanks, counted and subtracted from the test values.</p></sec><sec><title>Gel mobility shift assay</title><p>End-labeled oligonucleotides (10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup> M) were incubated in the glycosylase assay buffer with 100&#x02013;200 ng of recombinant proteins at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The non-specific competing DNA was from <italic>E.coli</italic> (50&#x02013;250 ng&#x0002f;assay).

Separation was carried out in the cold room at constant current (15 mA) in 0.25&#x000d7; TBE. Upon autoradiography bands were cut out of the gel, the labeled DNA was extracted and then analyzed on a 20&#x00025; polyacrylamide denaturing gel.</p><p>Missing contact probing of recombinant protein with the labeled DNA substrate was carried out as described by Brunelle and Schleif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c14">14</xref>) and Liang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c15">15</xref>). The partial depurination was done with formic acid and the partial depyrimidination was carried out with hydrazine. All reaction products were analyzed on a 20&#x00025; polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Upon gel shift assay of the recombinant protein with the partial depurinated or depyrimidinated oligonucleotides, specific bands corresponding to the free and bound oligos were cut out of the gel, extracted and subjected to &#x003b2;-elimination with piperidine. The reaction product was analyzed on a 20&#x00025; polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel. Approximately 30 000 c.p.m. was loaded in each lane.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) on tissue sections</title><p>The probe used for ISH was part of the cloned human MBD4 gene covering the coding sequence from nucleotides positions 1276 to 1890.

The cover slides were removed from the sections in 5&#x000d7; SSC at 68&#x000b0;C and slides were washed for 1 h at 68&#x000b0;C in 0.2&#x000d7; SSC. Immunological detection of DIG-labeled hybrids was done as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 (DAPI) was performed on all slides.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemicals and enzymes</title><p>Polynucleotide kinase and DNA ligase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Hydrazine was obtained from Kodak Eastman and piperidine from Merck.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Cloning of a chicken cDNA related to human MBD4</title><p>Since we have recently discovered that the chicken G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase also has 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c7">7</xref>), it was of interest to see whether the human MBD4 and its chicken homolog also both had enzymatic activities. Six positive clones were obtained from 200 000 phage plaques. They all hybridized very strongly with the probes covering the C-terminal part of MBD4 but no hybridization was obtained with the other probes. A 1468 bp long chicken cDNA was cloned and sequenced (EMBL accession no. AF257107). The amino acid alignment of the chicken sequence with human MBD4 is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f1">1</xref>. At the N-terminal region of the chicken cDNA there is no sequence coding for the methylated DNA binding domain. The chicken cDNA has open reading frame coding for 416 amino acids whereas the human MBD4 codes for 580 amino acids. An in-frame stop codon was found upstream of the first ATG of the open reading frame, thus the chicken cDNA was believed to cover the whole coding region. The amino acid sequence upstream of the conserved catalytic region has no sequence identity with human MBD4 whereas the catalytic region at the C-terminus has 90&#x00025; identity with the human sequence. Data from mass spectrometry analysis of peptides derived from the highly purified chicken embryo DNA demethylation complex showed the absence of MBD4-related proteins in this complex (D.Hess, unpublished results).</p></sec><sec><title>The recombinant human MBD4 and its chicken homolog both have G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase and 5-MeC DNA glycosylase</title><p>The results shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f3">3</xref> indicate that, in the standard assay for glycosylases, both the recombinant human (upper panels) and chicken MBD4 (lower panels) have the same substrate specificity as the purified chicken 5-MeC DNA glycosylase from chicken embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c17">17</xref>). The activity of the G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd624tb1">1</xref>, oligo A) is &#x0223c;30&#x02013;40-times higher than the 5-MeC DNA glycosylase (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd624tb1">1</xref>, oligo B). Among the methylated DNA substrates, the hemimethylated DNA with a mCpG is the best substrate whereas symmetrically-methylated CpG is a poor substrate. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref> (NM&#x0002f;M, lane 1) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f3">3</xref> (mCpG, lane 1) the recombinant 5-MCDG only partially cleaves the abasic sugar at the 3&#x02032; position. A complete cleavage of the abasic sugar at the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; positions was only obtained upon alkaline hydrolysis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f3">3</xref>, lane 2) yielding a fragment 25 bases long (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd624tb1">1</xref>, oligo A) for G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase and 28 bases long (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd624tb1">1</xref>, oligo B) for 5-MCDG. Upon denaturation and separation of the reaction product on DNA sequencing gels, the complete cleavage of the abasic sugar from the DNA resulted in an increase in intensity of the band and in a shift in the migration of the labeled oligonucleotide fragment &#x0005b;compare lanes 1 and 2 of NM&#x0002f;M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref>) and mCpG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f3">3</xref>)&#x0005d;. At the same time alkaline hydrolysis, depending on the sequences used in the assays, revealed other non-specific minor cuts (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f4">4</xref>, lanes 2). Lanes 3 of Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f4">4</xref> are the controls of oligonucleotides incubated only with BSA and denatured before loading onto the sequencing gel.</p><p>It was also of interest to further investigate whether the base composition surrounding the mCpG had any influence on the glycosylase activity. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f4">4</xref>, mCpG surrounded by an A&#x0002b;T-rich sequence (92&#x00025;, oligo F, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd624tb1">1</xref>) is a better substrate than the one poorer in A&#x0002b;T (46&#x00025;, oligo G, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd624tb1">1</xref>). Both substrates had the same specific radioactivity of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> c.p.m.&#x0002f;&#x000b5;g DNA duplex and the same concentration of substrate (10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup> M) was tested.</p><p>These results suggest that the activity level of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase depends on the base composition surrounding the methylated CpG.</p><p>The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of the reaction for the hemimethylated DNA substrate (one hemimethylated CpG on a 50 bp long oligonucleotide, oligo B) with the human recombinant MBD4 is &#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup> M with a <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of &#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02013;11</sup> mol&#x0002f;h&#x0002f;&#x000b5;g protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f5">5</xref>). This very low activity could possibly be explained by a big loss of catalytic activity occurring during the denaturation and renaturation of the enzyme isolated from inclusion bodies, or by the absence of cofactors.</p></sec><sec><title>G&#x0002f;T mismatch and 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activities are localized in the same region, at the C-terminus of the recombinant enzyme</title><p>It has previously been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c10">10</xref>) that G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase activity is situated at the C-terminal region of MBD4 where exonuclease activity is also located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c11">11</xref>). The three N-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f6">6</xref>A and B) were expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and tested for 5-MeC DNA glycosylase and G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f7">7</xref>). As shown in Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f7">7</xref>, a deletion of up to 65&#x00025; of the total length of MBD4 covering the non-conserved region gradually depressed the G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase activity without affecting the activity of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase. This resulted in a change in the ratio of G&#x0002f;T mismatch over 5-MeC DNA glycosylase from 37 to 8. Furthermore, a deletion of the last 48 amino acid residues at the C-terminus of MBD4 completely abolished the G&#x0002f;T mismatch and the 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activities. These results suggest that the two enzymatic actives are located in the same conserved region, but they are differently affected by the change of protein structures. In addition, there is no need of the methylated DNA binding domain for G&#x0002f;T mismatch and 5-MCDG activities.</p></sec><sec><title>MBD4 and its deletion mutants bind equally well to methylated and non-methylated DNA</title><p>The difference in glycosylase activity observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref> could possibly be the consequence of a differential binding of MBD4 to the different oligonucleotides substrates. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref> shows that, at an oligonucleotide concentration of 10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup> M (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for hemimethylated oligo B), regardless of whether the substrate is methylated or not, there is a binding of human MBD4. Chicken MBD4, which does not have the methylated DNA binding domain, also gives a specific band shift with hemimethylated DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 10). Similarly, the deletion mutants of human MBD4 lacking the methylated DNA binding domain also give a discrete binding with the methylated and non-methylated probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref>, lanes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9). Under our incubation conditions, no selective binding of MBD4 to methylated oligonucleotides was observed. Since the above results could possibly represent a non-specific reaction of the DNA with other proteins present in the purified recombinant proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref>, lanes 1, 4, 7 and 10), it was of importance to determine whether the gel shift band assigned to the MBD4&#x02013;DNA complex (indicated by the arrowheads in lanes 1, 4, 7 and 10) did indeed display 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activity. The two different bands shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref> (lane 1) were cut out of the gel, the DNA extracted and analyzed on DNA sequencing gel. The resultant gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f9">9</xref>) clearly shows that the upper band a of lane 1 has all the glycosylase activity whereas band b and the free DNA (band c) had no activity. Similar results were obtained for the deletion mutants (results not shown). These results clearly indicate that once the glycosylase or its mutants have reacted with the hemimethylated DNA, they form a stable complex that does not easily dissociate. For example, at concentrations of up to 250 ng of <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA&#x0002f;20 &#x000b5;l reaction mixture there is no displacement of the complex between the mutant recombinants and the DNA substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f7">7</xref>, lanes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9). However, one exception was observed for the wild-type protein making a complex with the non-methylated oligonucleotide. In this case no glycosylase activity could be detected (data not shown). These results corroborate those presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref> (NM&#x0002f;NM, lanes 1, 2 and 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Footprinting of MBD4 with partially depurinated and depyrimidinated oligonucleotides (missing contact probing of protein&#x02013;DNA interactions)</title><p>Since the wild-type MBD4 and its mutants lacking the methylated DNA binding domain gave specific band shifts with the hemimethylated substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref>) it was of interest to see whether they bind to the same area on the DNA substrate. The basic principle of the assay is based on the partial depurination and depyrimidation of the DNA substrate. From the mixture of modified bases in the oligonucleotide, the protein only binds to those where the bases required for the specific amino acid&#x02013;base contact are intact. This is just the reverse for DNA repair enzymes such as MBD4 which preferentially recruits those sites which are damaged. In this case, one would logically expect to see a random distribution of MBD4 on the modified DNA. This is clearly not the case. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f11">11</xref> show that MBD4 preferentially recruits oligonucleotides with abasic sites around the target 5-mCpG. In addition, suppression of the methylated DNA binding domain (see mutant &#x00394;N273) gave the same pattern of binding as the wild-type protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f11">11</xref>). The strong signals observed for C in the upper non-methylated strand in the lanes B of A&#x0002b;G and C&#x0002b;T (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f10">10</xref>, lanes 8, 11, 20 and 23) are most probably not only due to the chemical modifications of the probe; they may represent specific nicks caused by the single strand nuclease activity still present in the highly purified recombinant protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of oligoribonucleotides on the activities of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase and G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase</title><p>As we have previously shown, DNA demethylation by the purified 5-MeC DNA glycosylase needs protein and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c5">5</xref>). It was also shown that oligoribonucleotides complementary to the methylated strand could stimulate the recombinant 5-MeC DNA glycosylase while inhibiting the G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c7">7</xref>). In sharp contrast, the results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f12">12</xref> (upper panel, human MBD4; lower panel, chicken MBD4) clearly indicate that the same oligonucleotide inhibited very strongly both the G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase and the 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activities. The oligoribonucleotide complementary to the opposite strand also inhibited the G&#x0002f;T mismatch glycosylase activity and, to a lesser extent, 5-MeC DNA glycosylase.</p></sec><sec><title>Developmental expression pattern of MBD4 RNA in the chicken embryo</title><p>Recently we described that transcription of one of the RNA clones (RNA clone 1) which is associated with the DNA demethylation complex is developmental-stage-specific but not tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c18">18</xref>). Here we investigated by ISH whether or not transcription of the G&#x0002f;T mismatch&#x0002f;5-MeC DNA glycosylase is also developmentally regulated. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f13">13</xref> shows the results of ISH on sections through the eye of a 5-day-old chicken embryo. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f13">13</xref>A shows that the expression of the glycosylase is restricted to the same tissues where the RNA helicase and the CpG rich RNA were expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c18">18</xref>). In the cells of the lens which produce the crystalline and which are mitotically inactive there is no trace of the glycosylase mRNA, whereas in the neuroepithelia of the optical cup specific transcripts were detected. As we have shown in the past this tissue consists of proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c18">18</xref>). Furthermore, in other differentiated tissues like the skeletal muscle in the somites there is no expression of the glycosylase mRNA (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>MBD4 was first discovered as a member of the family of mammalian methyl-CpG binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c9">9</xref>). This protein is expressed in many different somatic tissues as well as in ovary and testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c9">9</xref>). MBD4 is localized within the foci of heavily methylated satellite DNA and this localization is disrupted in cells that have a reduced level of CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c9">9</xref>). MBD4 (MED1) was independently discovered by Bellacosa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c11">11</xref>) using the yeast two hybrid system with the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 used as a bait. Later on Hendrich <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c10">10</xref>) found that neither glycosylase nor endonuclease activities could be detected with substrates containing either symmetrically-methylated CpGs or hemimethylated CpG sites. One possible reason for the discrepancy between their results and ours could be the sensitivity of their assay. With the fluorometric assay they could not possibly detect the activity of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase which is about 30-times lower than the G&#x0002f;T mismatch glycosylase. The small but significant activity of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase detected in recombinant MBD4 is most probably not an experimental artefact since the deletion mutants of MBD4 affect the G&#x0002f;T mismatch and 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activities very differently. In the mutants with increasing size of deletions at the N-terminus there is a sharp decrease in the G&#x0002f;T mismatch DNA glycosylase activity. Up to the deletion &#x00394;N378, however, there is basically no major change in the activity of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref>). The low activity of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase present in the recombinant MBD4 may have different reasons. For example, the denaturation and renaturation of the protein isolated from bacterial inclusion bodies may partially irreversibly inactivate 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activity. Alternatively, one cannot exclude specific covalent modifications and&#x0002f;or specific interactions of MBD4 with other proteins which could possibly control the activity of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f4">4</xref> the base composition surrounding the mCpG has an influence on the catalytic activity of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase. An A&#x0002b;T-rich sequence is a much better substrate than an A&#x0002b;T-poor one. In this case it is conceivable that for the glycosylase reaction it is necessary to have a partial melting of the DNA duplex. This would allow disruption of the hydrogen bonds between G and MeC for the glycosylase reaction to occur. The presence of the methylated DNA binding domain does not seem to be important for the activity of 5-MCDG present in MBD4. In addition, as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref> both the wild-type and the mutant protein lacking the methylated DNA binding domain bind to the DNA substrate. This, together with the results of the missing contact probing (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f11">11</xref>) of the proteins with the DNA showing similar footprints on the DNA substrate, strongly suggest that sequences different from the methylated DNA binding domain control the specificity of the binding of the protein to the CpGs. In addition, as also seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f8">8</xref> there is the formation of a complex between recombinant MBD4 and the non-methylated oligonucleotide. However, the formation of the complex did not result in any trace of glycosylase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd624f2">2</xref>, NM&#x0002f;NM, lanes 1 and 2).</p><p>One of the proposed functions of MBD4 (MED1) is to counteract the mutability of 5-MeC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c20">20</xref>). Recently it has been found that MBD4 is mutated in human carcinomas such as in the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancers which are characterized by microsatellite instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c19">19</xref>). Frameshift mutations affecting MBD4 were found in over 40&#x00025; of the microsatellite unstable sporadic colon cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c20">20</xref>). Based on these results it was proposed that MBD4 could have a tumor suppressor role similar to that for mismatch repair genes (including MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MLH1, PMS1 and PMS2) that are mutated or down-regulated by aberrant DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c20">20</xref> and references therein).</p><p>What are the actual biological functions of 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activity associated with MBD4? Since the enzyme prefers hemimethylated DNA over fully methylated CpG pairs one can speculate that in addition to its role in DNA G&#x0002f;T mismatch repair it has either a surveillance function in the genome by removing all random asymmetrically methylated CpGs in the replicating DNA, or it could, in conjunction with other factors, remove specific MeC on specific replicating genes creating non-methylated sites. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive and experiments to investigate them are underway. The concerted actions of MBD4 and 5-MCDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c7">7</xref>) could then have a dual role in embryos: the repair of DNA and the demethylation of specific genes in the differentiating tissues. However, it is unlikely that these two enzymes could be responsible for the genome wide demethylation in blastocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd624c21">21</xref>), since the glycosylase would create a very large number of abasic sites which could, if not immediately repaired, destabilize the DNA structure and jeopardize its integrity.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd624f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the chicken MBD4 (accession no.
