To find new interactors of Akt involved in cell survival, we performed a two-hybrid screening in yeast using human full-length Akt c-DNA as bait and a murine c-DNA library as prey. Among the 80 clones obtained, two were identified as Bcl-w. Bcl-w is a member of the Bcl-2 family that is essential for the regulation of cellular survival, and that is up-regulated in different human tumors, such as gastric and colorectal carcinomas. Direct interaction of Bcl-w with Akt was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays. Subsequently, we addressed the function of this interaction: by interfering with the activity or amount of Akt, we have demonstrated that Akt modulates the amount of Bcl-w protein. We have found that inhibition of Akt activity may promote apoptosis through the downregulation of Bcl-w protein and the consequential reduction in interaction of Bcl-w with pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Our data provide evidence that Bcl-w is a new member of the Akt pathway and that Akt may induce anti-apoptotic signals at least in part through the regulation of the amount and activity of Bcl-w.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Akt is a serine&#x02013;threonine kinase downstream of PTEN/PI3K, involved in cellular survival pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Manning1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Song1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Phosphorylation of these proteins prevents apoptosis through several mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-BlumeJensen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of elimination of unwanted cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Danial1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Apoptosis is triggered via two principal signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Hengartner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The extrinsic pathway is activated by the engagement of death receptors on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Okada1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The other pathway is triggered by various intracellular and extracellular stresses, such as growth&#x02013;factor withdrawal, hypoxia, DNA damage, and anticancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Okada1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Ghobrial1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Intrinsic-pathway induced-apoptosis is generally regulated by the fine balance of Bcl-2 family proteins in a cell- and tissue-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Danial1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Apoptosis is believed to be the major mechanism responsible for chemotherapy-induced cell death in cancer. However, tumor cells often retain the ability to evade drug-induced death signals because of the activation of anti-apoptotic mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Reed1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Longley1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Understanding these evading mechanisms is a first step needed for the design of rational anticancer therapy. Therefore, we decided to address the role of Akt in apoptosis resistance in human cancer by finding new partners involved in resistance to cell death. To this end, we performed a two hybrid screening in yeast using human full-length Akt c-DNA as bait and a murine c-DNA library as prey. Among the possible interactors of Akt, we decided to focus on Bcl-w, a member of the Bcl-2 family. Biochemical experiments confirmed the interaction of Akt with Bcl-w. Further, we demonstrate that Akt modulates the half-life of Bcl-w. We also found that Bcl-w is a substrate of Akt and, more importantly, that Akt regulates its anti-apoptotic activity and interaction with some of the pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Media, sera, and antibiotics for cell culture were from Life Technologies, Inc.

Therefore, we decided to address the role of Akt in apoptosis resistance in human cancer by finding new partners of Akt by two hybrid screening in yeast. Among the interactors of Akt that we found, we focused on Bcl-w, a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Russell1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Gibson1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> that has received less attention compared to its other family members. By genetic and biochemical methods, we have demonstrated here that Akt interacts with the N- and C-terminal sequences of the Bcl-w protein, and phosphorylates Bcl-w both in vitro and in the intact cell. The analysis of the Bcl-w sequence did not reveal a canonical Akt phosphorylation motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Trencia1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there is evidence that Akt may phosphorylate cellular substrates at the level of a partially conserved sequence motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Trencia1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Bcl-w posses at least 6 serine/threonines that are included in &#x0201c;degenerated&#x0201d; Akt phosphorylation sites. By site-directed mutagenesis, we mutated two of these sites (ser 62 and ser 83) substituting the serine with an alanine (data not shown). These mutations did not result in a change of Bcl-w phosphorylation state, so the hypothetical Akt phosphorylation site must be located elsewhere. We are now addressing this issue.</p><p>We have also demonstrated here that interfering with the activity or amount of Akt reduces the quantity of Bcl-w protein; oppositely, transfection of a dominant active Akt mutant increased the content of Bcl-w in cells.</p><p>Akt-mediated Bcl-w down-regulation was observed to occur also in glioma (data not shown). Thus, Akt affects Bcl-w function in various cell types at least in part by regulating its expression. The mechanisms underlying this are not clear, but the regulation of Bcl-w protein levels is unlikely mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, as evidenced by the negative result obtained with a proteasome inhibitor. Furthermore, Akt inhibition did not produce an effect on Bcl-w mRNA, as evaluated by Real Time PCR (data not shown). Other possible Akt-mediated regulatory effects on RNA or protein stability are under investigation in our laboratory.</p><p>Several studies have suggested that Akt may regulate the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic signals, at least in part by regulating the cellular localization of Bcl-2 family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Franke1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Zha1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, in this study we have analyzed the effect of Akt activation on the subcellular localization of Bcl-w.

The presence of the kinase-dead Akt mutant reduced the amount of Bcl-w linked to this fraction, but it did not increase Bcl-w in the cytosol; we obtained similar results with cells transfected with Akt siRNA. Thus, via binding and phosphorylating Bcl-w, Akt may control Bcl-w activity mainly through the regulation of Bcl-w protein expression. We are conducting experiments with Bcl-w phosphorylation mutants to formally prove this conclusion.</p><p>Moreover, with the intent to clarify the role of Akt-mediated regulation of Bcl-w on its anti-apoptotic functions, we established a Bcl-w overexpressing cell line. These cells exhibit a significant decrease of chemotherapy-mediated cell death. When we evaluated the effects of decreasing Akt activity on survival in Bcl-w/HeLa cells, we found a &#x0223c;20&#x00025; increase in cell death. However, when we analyzed cell death by western blot of PARP activation, the active PARP fragment was present exclusively in Bcl-w/HeLa cells incubated with Akt D&#x02212; cDNA. Thus, even though the differences that we observe with FACS analysis and cell vitality are of small entity, the end point, that is cell death evaluated as PARP activation, is reached only in Bcl-w cells where Akt has been inactivated.</p><p>On the other hand, our data provide evidence that Bcl-w is not the only defense mechanism of the cell toward chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and many other Bcl-2 family members may mediate anti-apoptotic signals.

We show here that Bcl-w/Bax, Bcl-w/Bad, and Bcl-w/Bik interactions were drastically reduced in cells overexpressing dominant-inactive Akt cDNA, indicating that Akt activity is necessary for these interactions. Therefore, Akt may regulate the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-w, reducing its amount in the cell and, thus, impairing the balance of homo- and heterodimer formation upon apoptotic stimuli.</p><p>Bcl-w can be up-regulated in tumors such as gastric and colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Wilson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004070-Lee1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, Bcl-w participates in a number of different systems that regulate survival and anti-apoptotic pathways.</p><p>The results that we have presented here provide the first evidence that Akt interacts with, and regulates the levels of, Bcl-w, moving the balance of the Bcl-2 family toward anti-apoptotic members. Enhancement of this Akt/Bcl-w anti-apoptotic pathway can be speculated as one mechanism responsible for the reduced sensitivity to apoptosis of cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapy-induced cell death. This finding may be of importance in optimizing a strategy for the treatment of cancers, such as gastric and colon adenocarcinoma, in which Bcl-w has been found to be increased.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004070-Manning1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
