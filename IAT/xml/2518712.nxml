Maturation of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV) involves the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) on its outer leaflet. SopB, a bacterial virulence factor with phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, was proposed to generate PI(3)P by dephosphorylating PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3. Here, we examine the mechanism of PI(3)P formation during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. SopB is required to form PI(3,4)P2/PI(3,4,5)P3 at invasion ruffles and PI(3)P on nascent SCVs. However, we uncouple these events experimentally and reveal that SopB does not dephosphorylate PI(3,4)P2/PI(3,4,5)P3 to produce PI(3)P. Instead, the phosphatase activity of SopB is required for Rab5 recruitment to the SCV. Vps34, a PI3-kinase that associates with active Rab5, is responsible for PI(3)P formation on SCVs. Therefore, SopB mediates PI(3)P production on the SCV indirectly through recruitment of Rab5 and its effector Vps34. These findings reveal a link between phosphoinositide phosphatase activity and the recruitment of Rab5 to phagosomes.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI(3)P, PI 3-phosphate; PIP, PI phosphate; PIP<sub>2</sub>, PI bisphosphate; SCV, <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole; SPI, <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island; T3SS, type III secretion system; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar <italic>typhimurium</italic> (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>Typhimurium</italic>) is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can cause disease in a variety of hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsolis et al., 1999</xref>).

These proteins are translocated directly into host cells via type III secretion systems (T3SSs), needle-like apparati on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galan and Wolf-Watz, 2006</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic> is endowed with two separate T3SSs encoded on <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and SPI-2 of the bacterial chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schlumberger and Hardt, 2006</xref>). The SPI-1&#x02013;encoded T3SS delivers effectors across the host cell plasma membrane during invasion. These initiate actin rearrangements by activating Rho family GTPases or by directly interacting with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schlumberger and Hardt, 2006</xref>). Modulation of phosphoinositide signaling also plays a key role in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic> invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drecktrah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilbi, 2006</xref>). Expression of the SPI-2 T3SS is stimulated several hours after invasion and allows intracellular survival and growth of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schlumberger and Hardt, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in bacterial entry, recent studies suggest that the SPI-1 T3SS also dictates the early intracellular traffic of the SCV. Accordingly, the intracellular growth of an SPI-1 T3SS&#x02013;defective mutant was found to be impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Steele-Mortimer et al., 2002</xref>). Among the SPI-1 effectors, SopB (also called SigD) was found to play a role in SCV maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>). SopB was shown to be required for the generation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) on the SCV and to promote lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) acquisition by this compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>). A <italic>sopB</italic> deletion mutant had attenuated intracellular growth, implying that its role in SCV maturation is critical for the establishment of a replicative niche in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In vitro SopB can hydrolyze a variety of inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides, including the PI3-kinase products PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Norris et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marcus et al., 2001</xref>). However, the in vivo substrates of SopB remain unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al. (2004)</xref> have proposed that SopB generates PI(3)P on the SCV in a direct manner via the dephosphorylation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. These authors also proposed that the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase activity of SopB may affect the progression of SCVs down the endocytic pathway, preventing their fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>). This model for the SopB-mediated generation of PI(3)P is in good accord with the broad in vitro substrate specificity reported for the phosphatase. However, other observations apparently conflict with such a model. First, SopB is required for the activation of Akt in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic>&#x02013;infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steele-Mortimer et al., 2000</xref>). Akt is recruited to the membrane and activated, at least in part, by PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, products of class I and II PI3-kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dummler and Hemmings, 2007</xref>). Dephosphorylation of PI3-kinase products should therefore inhibit Akt activation rather than promote it. Second, otherwise unstimulated cells have very low levels of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, and recent studies suggest that the main in vivo substrate of SopB is the much more abundant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Terebiznik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mason et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, despite clear evidence that SopB contributes to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic> invasion and early SCV trafficking, the mechanisms by which it acts are not completely understood. Here, we examine in more detail the mechanism of PI(3)P formation by SopB.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SopB is required for PI(3)P localization to SCVs and an elevation of cellular PI phosphate (PIP)</title><p>To investigate the localization of 3&#x02032;-phosphorylated phosphoinositides generated during <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection, we used chimeras consisting of GFP or RFP fused to the phosphoinositide-binding domains of various proteins.

PI(3)P persisted on the SCV for &#x0223c;1&#x02013;5 min. However, the 2FYVE-GFP probe was not detected in the ruffling areas of the plasma membrane where invasion occurred. Cells infected with the <italic>sopB</italic> mutant did not display recruitment of 2FYVE-GFP to the SCV at any time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and D</xref>; and Video 2). Similar results were seen with phox homology (PX)&#x02013;GFP, a different probe for PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scott et al., 2002</xref>; unpublished data). To simultaneously examine the production of PI(3)P and of its putative precursors, PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, during invasion, cells were cotransfected with 2FYVE-GFP and PH(Akt)-RFP. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, PH(Akt)-RFP was recruited exclusively to invasion ruffles that project from the plasma membrane at the site of bacterial entry during infection but not to nascent SCVs. Conversely, 2FYVE-GFP was found only on newly formed vacuoles where PH(Akt)-RFP was absent. Analysis of the dynamics of both signaling events, which is presented in Video 3, revealed that PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> was present at invasion ruffles before PI(3)P became apparent at the SCV. Jointly, these findings are consistent with the notion introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al. (2004)</xref> that PI(3)P accumulation on SCVs derives from the dephosphorylation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and that SopB is required for this conversion.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SopB is required for PI(3)P localization to SCVs and an elevation of cellular PIP.</bold> (A and B) Cells were transfected with 2FYVE-GFP and infected with WT <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (A) or a <italic>sopb</italic> deletion mutant (B).

(2004)</xref> analyzed the lipid composition of infected cells by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). As anticipated, they demonstrated an increase in PI phosphate (PIP) at the expense of PI bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). Although powerful, ESI-MS cannot distinguish among the different isomers of PIP (i.e., PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(5)P) or those of PIP<sub>2</sub> (PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wenk et al., 2003</xref>). To more directly identify the phosphoinositides altered by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic>, we labeled HeLa cells metabolically with [<sup>3</sup>H]inositol and analyzed the lipids extracted before and after infection by HPLC (see Materials and methods). The cells were infected with either WT or <italic>sopB</italic> mutant bacteria to assess the effects of the phosphatase. When considered jointly, the PIP isomers increased upon infection, although the change did not attain statistical significance in five experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In parallel, the PIP<sub>2</sub> species decreased significantly. Importantly, SopB was required to produce both changes. These data are in good agreement with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al. (2004)</xref> and are, in principle, consistent with their hypothesis that PI(3)P is generated by dephosphorylation of polyphosphoinositides by SopB. It must be borne in mind, however, that their reported analysis by ESI-MS failed to single out PI(3)P as the species elevated in infected cells.</p><p>To more precisely define the lipid species affected by SopB, we separately analyzed the contribution of the individual PIP and PIP<sub>2</sub> isomers to the global changes reported in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>. The results of the more detailed analysis are summarized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The HPLC system we used was able to resolve PIP into two distinct and separately quantifiable peaks: one containing PI(3)P and a separate peak containing PI(4)P and/or PI(5)P, hereafter referred to as PI(4/5)P. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, PI(4/5)P constitutes the vast majority (&#x0003e;90%) of the PIP present in control (uninfected) cells, with comparatively very low levels of PI(3)P. Contrary to our expectation, PI(3)P increased only modestly after infection by WT bacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>), whereas PI(4/5)P increased markedly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The increase in PI(4/5)P was observed in cells infected with WT bacteria but not the <italic>sopB</italic> mutant and was accompanied by a commensurate decrease in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, supporting our earlier contention that SopB dephosphorylates the latter at the 4&#x02032; and/or 5&#x02032; position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Terebiznik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mason et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SopB mediates PI3-kinase activation at the plasma membrane during <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion.</bold> (A) Lipids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC.

These findings imply that the ESI-MS data obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al. (2004)</xref> reflect primarily the changes in PI(4/5)P and not those in PI(3)P.

Therefore, the loss of PIP<sub>2</sub> reported by ESI-MS cannot be construed as evidence in favor of the formation of PI(3)P by SopB-mediated dephosphorylation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>SopB mediates PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production at the plasma membrane during <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion</title><p>In view of these apparent inconsistencies, we analyzed the origin of the changes in 3&#x02032;-phosphoinositides in more detail. Cells infected with WT bacteria displayed a significant increase in the cellular levels of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Although the source of this increase has not been identified, the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al. (2004)</xref> posits that PI(3)P is generated by SopB-mediated dephosphorylation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which are in turn generated by dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. This model predicts that the level of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> would be higher in cells infected with the <italic>sopB</italic> mutant. This prediction was not supported by the detailed HPLC analysis. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>, the accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in infected cells was in fact obliterated by omission of SopB. Consistent with this, we observed recruitment of PH(Akt)-GFP to invasion ruffles in cells infected by WT bacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref> and Video 4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804131/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804131/DC1</ext-link>) but not in <italic>sopB</italic> mutant&#x02013;infected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref> and Video 5).

These findings indicate a strict requirement of SopB for the accumulation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at invasion ruffles. Together, our analysis reveals that SopB initiates two discernible signaling events during <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic> infection: (1) the generation of PI3-kinase products PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at invasion ruffles and (2) the formation of PI(3)P on SCVs.</p></sec><sec><title>PI(3)P localization to the SCV is sensitive to pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3-kinase, but PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production at invasion ruffles is not</title><p>We were intrigued by the observation that SopB is required for the formation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>.

To determine whether SopB is similarly mediating the activation of class I PI3-kinases, we treated cells with two pharmacologic inhibitors of these enzymes, LY294002 and wortmannin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vlahos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woscholski et al., 1994</xref>). Remarkably, treatment of cells with LY294002 had no effect on recruitment of PH(Akt)-GFP to invasion ruffles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Analysis of infected cells by live imaging revealed that 100% of WT infected cells (49 ruffles analyzed in three separate experiments) had recruitment of PH(Akt)-GFP to invasion ruffles in the presence of LY294002. Similar results were obtained in wortmannin-treated cells (unpublished data). In agreement with the fluorescence data, analysis of lipid content by HPLC revealed that LY294002 had little effect on the generation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Class I PI3-kinases are sensitive to wortmannin/LY294002, and independent experiments verified that the concentrations used were sufficient to impair these enzymes. We therefore concluded that class I PI3-kinases are not involved in the SopB-dependent production of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>.

These findings suggest that the recruitment to SCVs of Rab5 and its effector Vps34 (as indicated by the formation of its product, PI(3)P) is mediated, at least in part, by the SopB-mediated dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>In principle, SopB could be acting through its ability to reduce PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels or by generation of its hydrolysis products, PI(4/5)P. To differentiate these possibilities, we sought to reduce the concentration of available PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> without generating PI(4)P or PI(5)P. This was accomplished by transfecting cells with a construct bearing two tandem PH domains of phospholipase C&#x003b4; fused to GFP (2PH(PLC&#x003b4;)-GFP). This construct has an enhanced avidity for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> compared with the single PH domain probe and, when overexpressed, can mask a significant fraction of the phosphoinositide at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mason et al., 2007</xref>). As an indicator of Vps34 recruitment to SCVs, PI(3)P was visualized by cotransfecting the cells with a construct bearing the PX domain of p40<sup>phox</sup> fused to mCherry (PX-mCherry). As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>, expression of 2PH(PLC&#x003b4;)-GFP caused a significant increase in PI(3)P localization to SCVs formed by <italic>sopB</italic>-deficient bacteria. In fact, PI(3)P accumulation was not significantly different in SCVs containing WT or <italic>sopB</italic>-deficient bacteria. Thus, diminution of available PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> without concomitant generation of PI(4)P or PI(5)P mimics the effects of SopB and synaptojanin-2. These data suggest that a localized decrease in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, rather than the accumulation of the products of its hydrolysis, is critical for the SopB-mediated recruitment of Rab5 and subsequent generation of PI(3)P on SCVs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we confirmed the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al. (2004)</xref>, demonstrating that SopB is required for the generation of PI(3)P on SCVs. Based on their observations, these authors concluded that SopB generates PI(3)P via the dephosphorylation of polyphosphorylated products of PI3-kinase (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, pathway 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dukes et al., 2006</xref>). However, multiple lines of evidence presented here suggest that this model does not fully account for the mechanism by which SopB activity leads to PI(3)P formation on the SCV: (1) the main PIP isomer formed during infection is PI(4/5)P, not PI3P as surmised from ESI-MS determinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>); (2) the production of PI(3)P is sensitive to wortmannin/LY294002, whereas production of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is not; (3) blocking production of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at invasion ruffles using the synaptojanin-2&#x02013;CAAX construct does not prevent PI(3)P formation at SCVs; and (4) expression of Vps34 is essential for the formation of PI(3)P on SCVs but not for the accumulation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at invasion ruffles. It therefore appears unlikely that SopB mediates PI(3)P formation by dephosphorylation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of SopB action in host cells during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</bold> During invasion, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic> injects SopB into host cells. At the plasma membrane, SopB mediates dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to generate PI(4/5)P. Through this event, SopB causes the accumulation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at invasion ruffles by a wortmannin/LY294002-insensitive mechanism. SopB-mediated dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> also allows SCV fission from the plasma membrane and the recruitment of Rab5 to nascent SCVs via their fusion with early endosomes. The Rab5 effector Vps34 catalyzes phosphorylation of PI to generate PI(3)P on SCVs, leading to downstream SCV maturation events such as the recruitment of LAMP-1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820741f09"></graphic></fig><p>Instead, we propose that SopB mediates PI(3)P formation on SCVs primarily via phosphorylation of PI by Vps34 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, pathway 2). This notion is consistent with the wortmannin and LY294002 sensitivity of the process and with the inhibitory effects of Vps34 siRNA. Furthermore, we suggest that Vps34 is recruited to the SCV by fusion with Rab5-positive vesicles. Rab5 is thought to recruit and/or activate Vps34 on early endosomes, and siRNA directed to all three Rab5 isoforms blocked PI(3)P localization to SCVs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate Rab5 recruitment to phagosomes and invasion vacuoles. Our analysis revealed that Rab5-containing vesicles are recruited to the SCVs in a SopB-dependent manner. The phosphatase activity of SopB was required for Rab5 recruitment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>), suggesting that dephosphorylation of a host cell substrate allows endosomes to acquire Rab5. Indeed, we were able to partially restore Rab5 recruitment to <italic>sopB</italic>-deficient SCVs by depleting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with synaptojanin-2, another inositide phosphatase. The mechanism whereby PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dephosphorylation promotes Rab5 recruitment to SCVs is unclear but may involve electrostatic interactions that are known to regulate the localization of Rab GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yeung and Grinstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>). The negative surface charge contributed by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, a tetravalent anion at physiological pH, may preclude Rab5 recruitment to endosomes/phagosomes. In support of this notion, we observed that masking the headgroups of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> could partially complement PI(3)P localization to <italic>sopB</italic>-deficient SCVs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Together, our findings reveal a link between phosphoinositide phosphatase activity and the recruitment of Rab5 to phagosomes.</p><p>An unexpected finding was the observation that SopB mediates the accumulation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at invasion ruffles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>; and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, pathway 3). How might SopB lead to the accumulation of these lipids? This effector can efficiently dephosphorylate a wide variety of phosphoinositides and inositol phosphates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Norris et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marcus et al., 2001</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that the main phosphoinositide substrate of SopB in vivo is PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Terebiznik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mason et al., 2007</xref>) and that SopB generates PI(5)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mason et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that this rare phosphoinositide leads to the activation of a PI3-kinase at invasion ruffles. Indeed, an important role for PI(5)P in intracellular signaling was recently suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pendaries et al. (2006)</xref>. These authors demonstrated that PI(5)P generation by IpgD is sufficient to activate class I PI3-kinase at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pendaries et al., 2006</xref>). Here we show that SopB is similarly involved in the generation of PI3-kinase products. However, the fact that wortmannin and LY294002 did not affect the formation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> during <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection implies that this is not the result of activation of class I PI3-kinases, which are sensitive to these agents. It is possible that members of the class II family of PI3-kinases, which are least sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Falasca et al., 2007</xref>), mediate PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> generation during infection. These findings suggest a potential difference in the mechanisms used by <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>S. flexneri</italic> to invade host cells.</p><p>An alternative mechanism of action of PI(5)P is suggested by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carricaburu et al. (2003)</xref>, who found that accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is antagonized by type II PI(5)P 4-kinase. These data were interpreted to mean that PI(5)P promotes the accumulation PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> by exerting an inhibition on polyphosphoinositide phosphatases. In support of this hypothesis, PI(5)P was reported to exert an inhibitory effect on the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 5-phosphatase activity of SHIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pendaries et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the marked accumulation of PI(5)P induced by SopB may result in inhibition of the phosphatases that normally eliminate the products of constitutively active PI3-kinases, perhaps those members of the class II family that are least sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition.</p><p>In summary, SopB appears to regulate different classes of PI3-kinases in distinct cellular compartments during <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection. At the invasion ruffle, SopB induces the accumulation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> by an incompletely understood process involving its phosphatase activity. At the SCV, SopB promotes the formation of PI(3)P by recruitment of Vps34 on fusion with Rab5-positive vesicles. Dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> appears to be the critical event that allows Rab5 recruitment to the SCV. The relationship between the events occurring at the ruffle and SCV and the precise mechanism underlying polyphosphoinositide induction remain incompletely understood and require additional study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs and bacteria</title><p>The vectors pEGFP&#x02237;AktPH and pEGFP&#x02237;PLC&#x003b4;PH encode the PH domain of Akt (GFP-PH-Akt; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weernink et al., 2000</xref>) and the PH domain of PLC&#x003b4; (PH-PLC&#x003b4;-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stauffer et al., 1998</xref>), respectively.
