Peripheral arthritis and enthesopathic lesions are also observed. The prototype of the disease is ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and other clinical features include reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, enteropathic arthritis and undifferentiated SpA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. All these diseases have a common genetic background, namely the Histocompatibility Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Class I B27, which is strongly associated to SpA and particularly to AS.</p><p>The pathophysiology of these diseases is not completely understood, but it is believed that the genetic component is directly involved as demonstrated by transgenic rats expressing human HLA-B27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Environmental factors also play a role in SpA, particularly bacterial antigens from the gut or the genitourinary tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Different cellular subsets are observed in the joints or entheseal structures of SpA including macrophages and neutrophils, and also CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been suggested that aberrant immune response occurs in SpA or that SpA results from molecular mimicry. It is thought that unregulated CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cell responses to bacterial or self antigens participate in SpA pathophysiology and that both responses involve the HLA-B27 molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Indeed, CD4+T cells are required for the development of the disease in the animal model of transgenic rat for human HLA-B27.</p><p>CD28 expressed on T cells and its ligands, CD80 and CD86, present on the antigen presenting cells (APC) are the prototypical costimulatory molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated molecule-4 (CTLA-4 or CD152) is expressed on T cells after activation, but it is constitutively expressed by CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells (Treg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This molecule is homologous to CD28 and binds to CD80 and CD86 with a higher affinity. Membrane bound CTLA-4 acts by interfering with CD28/CD80-CD86 interactions by competitive binding and also by mediating a negative signal interfering with T cell receptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, CTLA-4 triggering leads to a down regulation of T cell response, induction of apoptosis and/or immunological anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, CTLA-4 is absolutely required for the suppressive function of naturally occurring FoxP3+ Treg, at least in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells also express CTLA-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>A soluble form of CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) has also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This soluble molecule results from an alternative transcript of the <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>gene, which lacks the third exon encoding the transmembrane domain of the CTLA-4 molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This soluble form, detected in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and lymphoid organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], is able to bind CD80 and CD86. Recent data showed the increase of sCTLA-4 in the serum of patients with various autoimmune diseases, such as thyroiditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], myasthenia gravis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and systemic sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has been suggested that sCTLA-4 may interfere with normal immune response, favoring autoreactivity in these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, genetic studies revealed that there is an association between <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>gene polymorphism and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Abnormal T cell activation is observed in SpA, suggesting a possible defect of lymphocyte inhibitory molecules. Thus, here, we investigated the serum levels of sCTLA-4 in a large cohort of patients with SpA. Then, we analyzed the cellular expression of CTLA-4 on different peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) subsets, as well as <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>transcripts in PBL. The results obtained in SpA patients were compared with those obtained in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients with spondylarthropathy</title><p>We enrolled 165 consecutive patients who met the European Spondylarthropathy Study group criteria for SpA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and were receiving follow-up at our department (Rheumatology Department, Besan&#x000e7;on, France). Clinical assessment included the following demographic data: age, sex, disease duration, and extra-articular manifestations (uveitis). The clinical activity was evaluated using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and the functional score Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C reactive protein (CRP) levels were used as laboratory parameters to assess inflammation. Biologic assessment also included HLA-B27 determination. All the patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some of them had a second-line treatment such as sulfasalazine (n = 23) or methotrexate (n = 10). A limited number of patients had corticosteroids at a low dosage (daily prednisolone &#x02264; 10 mg; n = 8). In order to avoid anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agent as a confounding factor, patients under or who had previously received anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agent were excluded from this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis</title><p>Seventy-one patients with RA meeting 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] were included for purposes of comparison. For each of these patients, the following data were recorded: age; sex; disease duration; extra-articular manifestations (subcutaneous nodules, vasculitis, sicca syndrome, pulmonary, or cardiac involvement); tender and swollen joint counts; the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score; the ESR and CRP levels; and whether tests were positive for rheumatoid factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus</title><p>In order to have another comparative group (with previously determined elevated serum sCTLA-4 levels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], 14 patients with SLE (13 females, 1 male, mean age 44.1 &#x000b1; 5.5 years) responding to the 1982 revised American Rheumatism Association criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] were also recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Control subjects</title><p>The control group consisted of 88 healthy subjects without inflammatory conditions (platelets donors). HLA class I antigen determination was available in this group. As most of the patients with SpA were HLA-B27 positive and the frequency of this antigen in the normal population is around 8%, we selected 24 HLA-B27-positive subjects from the platelet donors for this control group.</p><p>All the patients and control subjects gave their informed consent to participate in the study according to the Helsinki declaration and our study protocol was approved by our local ethics committee (<italic>comit&#x000e9; d'&#x000e9;thique clinique du CHU de Besan&#x000e7;on</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of circulating soluble CTLA-4</title><p>Serum concentrations of sCTLA-4 in patients with SpA, RA, or SLE and control subjects were determined by ELISA using reagent kits for human sCTLA-4 (AbCys, Paris, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular expression of CTLA-4 on lymphocyte subsets</title><p>Absolute numbers of blood T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were determined by single platform flow cytometry using the TetraCXP<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>method, Flow-Count fluorospheres, and FC500<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. CTLA-4 is not expressed on human naive resting T cells and is only expressed after activation on the surface at low levels (less than 10% of total CTLA-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], so we decided to evaluate intracellular CTLA-4 expression in fixed and permeabilized lymphocytes to appreciate CTLA-4 expression in different lymphocyte subsets. Staining was performed on ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) venous blood samples after red blood cell lysis. Cells were stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated CD3, phycoerythrin-cyanin 7 (PE-Cy7)-conjugated CD4, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD8 antibodies (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France), then fixed, permeabilized and stained again using PE-conjugated anti-CTLA-4 (anti-CD152) antibody (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France) before being analyzed using FACS Canto II<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>cytometer (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France). The same experiments were also performed using conjugated anti-HLA-DR, FITC-conjugated anti-CD25, PE Texas Red (ECD) conjugated anti-CD69 (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France) or conjugated anti-FoxP3 (clone PCH101, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] antibodies. Intracellular expression of CTLA-4 was examined in CD3+ T cells, in activated (HLA-DR+) CD4+ T cells, in early activated (CD69+) CD4+ T cells, and in (CD25+ FoxP3+) CD4 + Treg. Non-specific staining was determined using labeled irrelevant control antibodies from the same antibody providers. Intracellular CTLA-4 analysis was performed in 32 SpA patients, 22 RA patients, and 15 healthy controls. These patients and healthy donors were randomly selected and corresponded to consecutive patients (samples were collected between August 2006 and April 2007).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of full length and spliced CTLA-4 transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells</title><p>The human CTLA-4 gene contains four exons. The full length <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>mRNA contains these four exons, encoding the CTLA-4 molecule expressed at the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. sCTLA-4 is generated by alternatively spliced mRNA. This splicing event deletes the entire transmembrane region of the CTLA-4 molecule (corresponding to exon 3). Thus, the spliced <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>mRNA contains only three exons, encoding for the soluble form of CTLA-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Total RNA was extracted from 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>of cells using the RNeasy<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Blood mini kit (QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and reverse transcribed using random hexamers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) to use as a template for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). QRT-PCR reactions were performed in duplicate using gene-specific probes and a universal master mix (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) on an iCycler iQ thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). For full length <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>transcript analysis, gene-specific primers and bi-fluorescent hydrolysis probes were obtained from Assays-on-DemandTM gene expression products (#Hs99999101_m1; Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). Expression of <italic>spliced CTLA-4 </italic>transcripts was analyzed using the following primer pair designed by ourselves (sense, anti-sense and probe respectively): 5'-CATCTGCAAGGTGGAGCTCAT-3', 5'-GGCTTCTTTTCTTTAGCAATTACATAAATC-3', and 5'-FAM-ACCGCCATACTACCTGGGCATAGGCA-TAMRA-3'. Analysis was carried out using the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] with the pool of 15 healthy donor PBL samples as a calibrator and <italic>18S </italic>as a housekeeping reference gene. Target gene expression was expressed as a fold change compared with healthy donor PBL.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM; range). Only non-parametric tests were used. Statistical analysis between the three groups (healthy controls, SpA, and RA) involved non-parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the Kruskal-Wallis test. This test was used to compare age, circulating sCTLA-4 levels, T cell subsets, and intracellular CTLA-4 expression. When a significant difference was found between the three groups, a two-group analysis was performed a second time (SpA <italic>vs </italic>controls, RA <italic>vs </italic>controls and SpA <italic>vs </italic>RA) using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. This test was also used to compare variables (disease duration, ESR, CRP) between SpA and RA patients and between SLE patients and healthy controls (sCTLA-4). Qualitative data (sex) were analyzed using the chi-squared test. Wilcoxon test was used to compare the relative expression of the full length and the spliced form of <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>transcripts in patients with SpA and in patients with RA. Spearman's <italic>r</italic>-test was used to calculate correlations between sCTLA-4 and indices of disease activity of SpA or RA, and between <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>transcripts and sCTLA-4 in patients with SpA. Values of <italic>P </italic>less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The demographic, clinical characteristics, and laboratory features of the patients with SpA, patients with RA and healthy controls (platelet donors) are reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Despite the absence of sCTLA-4 protein analysis, these data by Ueda and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] suggest that reduced sCTLA-4 (at least in CD4+ T cells) is associated with increased T cell activation and thereby autoreactivity.</p><p>On the contrary, further studies on circulating sCTLA-4-analyzed by ELISA- in several autoimmune diseases showed high levels of serum sCTLA-4 in patients with Graves' disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], Hashimoto thyroiditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], myasthenia gravis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and systemic sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In SLE, elevated serum sCTLA-4 levels were correlated with the clinical index of disease activity SLEDAI in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but not in a second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In systemic sclerosis, patients exhibited high levels of serum sCTLA-4 that correlated with disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, sCTLA-4 was associated with cutaneous extension of fibrosis and tended to decrease in parallel to skin sclerosis improvement in a longitudinal analysis of some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that high levels of circulating sCTLA-4 are observed in several autoimmune diseases and can be associated with disease severity and activity. This argues for a role of sCTLA-4 in enhancing T cell activation or preventing T cell regulation, leading finally to exacerbation of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The main finding of our study is that there are increased levels of serum sCTLA-4 in patients with SpA, compared with levels observed in patients with RA or in healthy volunteers. Circulating sCTLA-4 correlated with clinical index of disease activity BASDAI and CRP levels. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], serum sCTLA-4 was very low in our group of healthy controls, even in the 24 positive HLA-B27 subjects. We also confirm that patients with SLE had high circulating sCTLA-4 levels (around 70-fold more than control subjects). Our cohort of patients included mainly AS and undifferentiated SpA, but we did not observed significant differences between SpA subgroups (data not shown). As expected, the majority of patients with SpA expressed the HLA-B27 antigen, but again, this had no influence on the levels of sCTLA-4. In addition, no correlation was found between sCTLA-4, age, or the clinical characteristics of the patients. However, we found that male patients had higher sCTLA-4 levels than female patients but this may be explained by a predominance of male patients with SpA (73.3% in our series).</p><p>Our patients had conventional treatments for SpA (i.e. mainly NSAIDs) and a limited number of patients had a second-line treatment. However, it is considered that these treatments had no influence on T cell activation and costimulation pathways and therefore on the level of sCTLA-4. Eight SpA patients among the 165 analyzed here received oral prednisolone. Corticosteroids have been shown to decrease membrane CTLA-4 expression after human T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, oral prednisolone in asthmatic patients has been shown to reduce serum sCTLA-4 concentrations after two weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, this can not be evaluated in our cohort because the number of patients on prednisolone is very low and concentrations are different (&#x0003c;10 mg/day in our study <italic>vs </italic>30 mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). The impact of therapy on circulating sCTLA-4 is an interesting question to address.</p><p>The increase of sCTLA-4 in the serum of our patients with SpA contrasted with a normal percentage of cells positive for intracellular CTLA-4 (in comparison with the percentage found in healthy controls), suggesting a preferential expression of the spliced form of the <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>gene. Indeed, <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>mRNA analysis confirms this hypothesis because the spliced <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>RNA transcripts were found to be expressed at a higher level compared with the full length form. These results indicate that SpA patients had a high production of sCTLA-4 which was related to a preferential transcription of the <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>mRNA spliced form. The reason for the main expression of these <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>transcripts in SpA is not known but one may hypothesize that genetic background could play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, our cohort to date did not include a sufficient number of patients to appreciate the relation between circulating sCTLA-4, <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>mRNA spliced form, and <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>polymorphism.</p><p>SpAs are characterized by an infiltration of the sacroiliac joints, the synovium and entheseal structures by inflammatory cells. Different cells are found in these lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are described at the pathological sites as well as B cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These infiltrated T cells are activated and require the active participation of costimulation pathways. Thus, a high production of sCTLA-4 in SpA may potentially influence immune responses. As stated above, sCTLA-4 may block the down regulation of activated T cells mediated by CTLA-4-CD80/CD86 interactions, enhancing immune response <italic>in situ</italic>. Costimulation pathways have not been previously evaluated in SpA. However, in the HLA-B27 transgenic rat model of SpA, a decrease in formation of conjugates between dendritic cells expressing HLA-B27 and T cells was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This decrease in dendritic cell-T cell conjugates was not related to a decrease of CD80 or CD86 expression, but resulted from a defective CD86 costimulatory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. One may speculate that this defective APC function is due to the blockade of CD86 by sCTLA-4.</p><p>Treg are also implicated in the inflammatory response in SpA. Treg were found to be enriched in synovial tissues from patients with SpA, contrasting with a low percentage of Treg in the blood compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In our study, we did not observe a significant reduction in the percentage of circulating Treg in our SpA patients as compared with healthy controls and RA patients. Treg constitutively expressed CTLA-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and suppressive functions of some Treg subsets are dependent on CTLA-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, one may speculate that a high production of sCTLA-4 in SpA may interfere with Treg functions, leading to a sustained and/or enhanced immune response. As stated above, the relation between sCTLA-4 and disease activity in different autoimmune diseases argues for a blockade of the inhibitory signal resulting from CTLA-4/CD80-CD86 binding.</p><p>In this study, serum sCTLA-4 was found mildly elevated in patients with RA compared with healthy controls. In addition, the percentage of cells positive for intracellular CTLA-4 was found decreased in CD4+ T cells and also in Treg. These results were not explained by the relative lymphopenia that characterized our RA patients, which involved CD3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, while CD4+ T cells and Treg did not differ between patients and controls. On the other hand, intracellular CTLA-4 was found increased in the CD3-negative cell population, presumably B cells. Finally, there was no preferential expression of <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>transcripts in RA. Altogether, these results suggest that patients with RA had mild elevation of sCTLA-4 that may result from an increased expression of CTLA-4 in 'non T' cell subsets. RA is a chronic joint disease characterized by a major infiltration of the synovium by T cells. These cells are activated with the main implication of the CD28/CTLA-4 &#x02013; CD80/CD86 ligand pairs. Altered cell surface expression of CD28, CTLA-4, CD80, and CD86 has been described in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, high levels of sCTLA-4 (whatever the producing cell was) may sustain T cell activation leading to inflammation and 'autoaggression', as observed in other autoimmune diseases. Reduced CTLA-4 expression in Treg can be related to defective function previously reported in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A recent study reports that diminished CTLA-4 expression by Treg from RA patients was related to an increase rate of CTLA-4 internalization after activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Similar to other autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], SpA are characterized by high serum sCTLA-4 levels with a significant and positive correlation with disease activity. These high levels of circulating sCTLA-4 in SpA were not explained by altered intracellular expression of CTLA-4, but by a preferential expression of the spliced form of <italic>CTLA-4 </italic>transcripts, a result that was not observed in RA. This suggests a potential immunologic role for sCTLA-4 in SpA. These results also indicate that sCTLA-4 could potentially be used as a surrogate marker for measuring disease activity in SpA.</p><p>Finally, the implication of sCTLA-4 in SpA also suggests the potential use of agents blocking costimulation pathways in this group of disorders. Indeed, a recent manuscript reports the use of abatacept &#x02013; the fusion protein associating the CTLA-4 extracellular domain and the constant fragment region of human IgG1 and blocking CD28/CD80-CD86 costimulatory pathway- in a patient with undifferentiated SpA. After 12 months of treatment with abatacept, the patient was in complete remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: analysis of variance; APC: antigen presenting cells; BASDAI: Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index; BASFI: Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index; CRP: C-reactive protein; CTLA-4: cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4; EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; HAQ: Health Assessment Questionnaire; HLA: Histocompatibility Leukocyte Antigen; NSAIDs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PBL: peripheral blood lymphocytes; Pe-cy 7: phycoerythrin-cyanin 7; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; sCTLA-4: soluble cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4; SEM: standard error of the mean; SLE: systemic lupus erythematosus; SpA: spondylarthropathies; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; Treg: regulatory T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ET is the main investigator who conceived and designed the study and drafted the manuscript.
