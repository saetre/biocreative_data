However, the exact mechanisms are still unclear. As mice lacking the peroxidase peroxiredoxin1 (Prdx1) produce more cellular ROS and die prematurely of cancer, they offer an ideal model system to study ROS-induced tumorigenesis. Prdx1 ablation increased the susceptibility to Ras-induced breast cancer. We, therefore, investigated the role of Prdx1 in regulating oncogenic Ras effector pathways. We found Akt hyperactive in fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells lacking Prdx1. Investigating the nature of such elevated Akt activation established a novel role for Prdx1 as a safeguard for the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN, which is essential for its tumour suppressive function. We found binding of the peroxidase Prdx1 to PTEN essential for protecting PTEN from oxidation-induced inactivation. Along those lines, Prdx1 tumour suppression of Ras- or ErbB-2-induced transformation was mediated mainly via PTEN.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>peroxiredoxin1</kwd><kwd>PTEN phosphatase</kwd><kwd>transformation</kwd><kwd>tumour initiation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) are a superfamily of small non-seleno peroxidases (22&#x02013;27 kDa) currently known to possess six mammalian isoforms. Although their individual roles in cellular redox regulation and antioxidant protection are quite distinct, they all catalyse peroxide reduction to balance cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels essential for signalling and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Rhee, 2006</xref>). Prdxs I&#x02013;IV share the common CxxC motif and use thioredoxin (Trx) as an electron donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Chae <italic>et al</italic>, 1994a</xref>). On reaction with peroxides, the Prdxs' &#x02018;peroxidatic' cysteine (Cys51 in Prdx1) is oxidized into a sulfenic acid intermediate, which then forms a disulfide bond with the &#x02018;resolving' cysteine (Cys172 in Prdx1) from the other homodimer's subunit. Catalytic reduction of peroxides results in different oxidation states of the catalytic cysteine. Lower oxidation states (sulfenic acid) are reduced back to thiol by the Trx system. Higher oxidation states such as sulfinic acid can be reduced back to thiol by sulfiredoxin, whereas the oxidation to sulfonic acid is irreversible and results in Prdx degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Neumann and Fang, 2007</xref>). Loss of Prdx1 shortens the life span of mice due to the development of hemolytic anemia and cancer. Analysis of cells and mice lacking Prdx1 suggested that it not only regulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, but also that it possessed the properties of a tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Neumann <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), which was further supported by the finding that Prdx1 interacts with c-Myc thereby selectively inhibiting c-Myc transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Egler <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Peroxides are known to modify protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) by oxidation. PTP catalytic property depends on a thiolate anion of a low p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> cysteine residue (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> 4.7&#x02013;5.4) located in the conserved motif of its active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Zhang and Dixon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Peters <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). This highly nucleophilic group makes the initial attack on the phosphate group of the substrate, but renders the PTP extremely susceptible to oxidation resulting in its inactivation. The PTP and tumour suppressor PTEN exhibits phosphatase activity towards phosphoinositides and tyrosine phosphates and is known to be inactivated through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidation or through growth factor signalling, including epithelial growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Leslie <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kwon <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Analysis of human recombinant PTEN revealed that two of the five cysteines in its N-terminal phosphatase domain (PTD) (Cys71 and Cys124) form a disulfide bond after oxidation, which resulted in the transient inhibition of its phosphatase activity and allowed oxidized PTEN to migrate faster on a non-reducing SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kwon <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). In stimulated macrophages, PTEN oxidation led to the temporary inhibition of its phosphatase activity and in the phosphorylation of Akt on Serine 473 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Leslie <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>PTEN deficiency is a hallmark of many human tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Keniry and Parsons, 2008</xref>) and is accompanied by enhanced cell proliferation, decreased cell apoptosis and increased Akt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Stambolic <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Akt is regulated by PI3K and PTEN, thus playing a central role particularly in Ras- and ErbB-2-induced transformation. Akt activity has been proven crucial for the initiation of this transformation, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hutchinson <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lim and Counter, 2005</xref>) and phosphatase inactive PTEN (PTEN Cys124Ser) is incapable of suppressing Ras-induced transformation either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tolkacheva and Chan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Koul <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although it is known that PTEN activity is negatively regulated through oxidation, the existence of a protective mechanism inhibiting such inactivation has not been proposed. On the basis of our findings, we propose here that Prdx1 promotes PTEN tumour suppressive function by binding PTEN and protecting its lipid phosphatase activity from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced inactivation. This way, Prdx1 controls excessive cellular Akt activity and reduces the susceptibility to H-Ras and ErbB-2-induced transformation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Prdx1 inhibits Ras-induced transformation through its peroxidase activity</title><p>We tested first Prdx1 peroxidase activity under physiological conditions and measured endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release in growing cells over time.

Western blotting analysis further confirmed that Prdx1 was functioning as a peroxidase, as Prdx1<sup>WT</sup> protein formed mostly DTT-reducible (data not shown) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging dimeric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel), whereas Prdx1<sup>Cys51/172S</sup> did not, as dimer formation depends on Cys51 and Cys172 disulfides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Chae <italic>et al</italic>, 1994b</xref>). The remaining Prdx1 monomers were not over-oxidized and therefore active (unlike Prdx1 monomers in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;;Prdx1WT</sup>MEFs). Prdx1 peroxidase activity was required to suppress H-Ras-induced tumour suppression, as Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MEFs transduced with retrovirus expressing H-Ras<sup>V12</sup> formed two-fold more colonies in soft agar compared with Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). Expression of exogenous Prdx1<sup>WT</sup> reduced colony formation by 50&#x00025; in Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs and by 20&#x00025; in Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs, whereas exogenously expressed Prdx1<sup>C51/172S</sup> modestly increased colony formation in Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs and Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs. Western blot analysis ensured that re-expression of Prdx1 proteins in Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MEFs did not exceed those Prdx1 levels found in Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs appeared also more spindle-like than Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs, whereas expression of Prdx1<sup>WT</sup> in Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs reversed the spindle-like morphology.

Treatment of MEFs with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (50 &#x003bc;M) for increasing periods of time enhanced Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 (pAkt<sup>Ser473</sup>) and Thr308 (pAkt<sup>Thr308</sup>) at a higher level in Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MEFs compared with Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). This finding correlated with a steady increase of PTEN oxidation over time in Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MEFs, whereas in Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>MEFs PTEN oxidation plateaued after 6&#x02013;8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 (pAkt<sup>Ser473</sup>) and PTEN oxidation increased also in Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs compared with Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>MEFs when exposed to increasing amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2A and B</xref>). Similar data were obtained by inducing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> endogenously through treating cells with PDGF, as it led to a larger increase in (1) pAkt<sup>Ser473</sup> and pAkt<sup>Thr308</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>) and (2) PTEN oxidation in Prdx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MEFs when compared with Prdx1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Peroxidatic Cys51 may regulate the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced Prdx1:PTEN complex disruption as Prdx1<sup>C51S</sup> and Prdx1<sup>C51/172S</sup> proteins bind more to wild-type PTEN than Prdx1<sup>C172S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). We further confirmed a physical association between Prdx1 and PTEN by using GST-pull down of GST&#x02013;Prdx1 and His&#x02013;PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>). Mutational analysis suggested that Prdx1 interacts within the C2 domain of PTEN (amino acids 186&#x02013;274) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3C and D</xref>) and PTEN with the N terminus of Prdx1 (amino acids 1&#x02013;40) and the C terminus of Prdx1 (amino acids 157&#x02013;199) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>, lower schematic and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3G</xref>). Computational analysis allowed us to narrow those interaction surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>).

As shown for PTEN, the region of 186&#x02013;251 consists of two double-stranded anti-parallel sheets connected through two flexible loops. Similarly, the 1&#x02013;40 region of Prdx1 consists of a single double-stranded anti-parallel sheet and another, surface exposed single sheet strand. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>, the Prdx-1 protein is shown only as the monomer and the helical region that lies at the dimer interface, residues 183&#x02013;199, are also positioned in a surface exposed position that is obviously well poised to mediate a protein&#x02013;protein interaction.

However, under higher oxidative stress treatment (500 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which resulted in decreased binding of PTEN and Prdx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>), impaired PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity. Western blotting confirmed equal amounts of PTEN protein in the lipid phosphatase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>, lower panel). To complement those results, we exposed recombinant purified His-tagged PTEN to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of purified recombinant Prdx1 and assayed PTEN for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> utilization. As expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>), in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we found that low molar amounts of Prdx1 protein weakly protected PTEN lipid phosphatase activity, whereas equimolar Prdx1 fully restored and further increases in Prdx1 protein amount did not enhance PTEN lipid phosphatase activity any more. Pre-incubation of PTEN in this assay with N-and C-terminal Prdx1 peptide replica (P1 and P2, respectively; peptide sequences were based on Prdx1 interaction mapping as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3G</xref> and discussed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>) decreased PTEN lipid phosphatase activity efficiently to 53&#x00025;, which was comparable to PTEN activity observed with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in the absence of Prdx1 (50&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>).

However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>, the addition of His-purified PTEN to recombinant Prdx1 inhibited Prdx1 peroxidase activity. Under our experimental conditions, the kinetics of NADPH oxidation to NADP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> were linear and the Prdx1 inhibition was proportional to molar amount of PTEN and reached saturation (completed inhibition) at PTEN/Prdx1=1:1 (mol/mol) ratio. Moreover, an increase in PTEN ratio lowered the velocity of Prdx1 peroxidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Prdx1 suppresses H-Ras and ErbB-2-induced transformation mainly via promoting PTEN activity</title><p>Next, we examined in PTEN<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MEFs whether Prdx1 has an important function in PTEN-induced tumour suppression.

We then evaluated basal PTEN oxidation and pAkt<sup>Ser473</sup> in mammary epithelial cells (MECs) from 16-week-old mice that had not developed tumours. Lack of Prdx1 increased basal PTEN oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>) and pAkt<sup>Ser473</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Compared with Prdxs, catalase peroxidase activity decomposes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with a &#x0003e;1000-fold higher <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Chae <italic>et al</italic>, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Loewen <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and therefore eliminates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with much higher efficiency. Thus, we cannot expect that Prdx1 scavenges H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in considerable amounts, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>. Yet, Prdx1's peroxidase activity is important in preventing H-Ras<sup>V12</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>) or ErbB-2/neuT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>) induced transformation. Similar to the catalase knockout mice, all other currently published Prdxs knockout mice, show phenotypically no increased susceptibility to transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Ho <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Therefore, Prdx1 may have a unique function amongst cellular peroxidases in tumour suppression, by affecting signalling directly through physical interaction with target enzymes. This was shown for c-Abl tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Wen and VanEtten, 1997</xref>) and c-Jun terminal kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). As described here for PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>), oxidative stress induced Prdx1 to dissociate, which in case of c-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Neumann <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) and JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) resulted in kinase activation. The Prdx1:PTEN heterodimer is most likely formed in a 1:1 molar ratio, as (1) the Prdx1 preservation of PTEN lipid phosphatase activity under oxidative stress is achieved by a 1:1 (mol:mol) ratio of Prdx1 and PTEN and could not be further increased by excess of Prdx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>) and (2) Prdx1<sup>C51/172S</sup>, which is unable to form dimeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Chae <italic>et al</italic>, 1994b</xref>), bound to PTEN and did not dissociate under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, these data provide compelling evidence that Prdx1 may bind PTEN as a monomer.</p><p>We further propose that the Prdx1:PTEN interaction is essential for protecting PTEN from oxidation-induced inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>), as Prdx1 C- and N-terminal peptide replica, which were designed based on our mapping studies and computer modelling to block PTEN docking sites on Prdx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3E</xref>), resulted after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in a 47&#x00025; reduction of PTEN activity. This was comparable to PTEN activity after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in the absence of Prdx1 (50&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). The Prdx1 N terminus, which includes Cys51, may have an important function in regulating the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced dissociation of the Prdx1:PTEN complex, as Cys51 when replaced by a serine enhances Prdx1 binding to PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). X-ray crystallography of Prdxs suggested significant conformational changes, such as unwinding of the active site N-terminal helix, to form disulfides, as in reduced Prdxs, the sulfur atoms of the N- and C-terminal conserved cysteine residues are too far apart to react with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schroder <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Matsumura <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Therefore, in the Prdx1:PTEN complex, increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may oxidize Cys51 (Prdx1), thus, promoting unwinding of the PTEN-binding conformation of Prdx1 consequently inducing dissociation.</p><p>Over-oxidation of Prdx1 Cys51 occurs during catalysis and correlates with increasing amounts of Trx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The reduction of Cys51 by Trx inhibits the folding back of Cys51 into its pocket thereby exposing it to further oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The binding of PTEN to Prdx1 could have similar effects on Prdx1, thereby inhibiting sufficient reduction of Cys51 by Trx and decreasing Prdx1 peroxidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Alternatively, as it has been shown that Trx binds PTEN and inactivates its lipid phosphates activity, it could be that under our experimental conditions Trx is depleted from the Prdx1 scavenging system by binding PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Meuillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This seems unlikely though, as Trx was added in approximately 300-fold molar excess, which should provide a large Trx pool to reduce oxidized Prdx1 proteins.</p><p>We defined a novel interaction site of Prdx1 with PTEN in the C2 domain of PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3D and E</xref>), which together with the N-terminal PTD, are both required for enzyme activity. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the C2 domain is essential for high-affinity membrane binding of PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Das <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Our data support this finding, as it has been shown recently through chemical proteomic strategy using cleavable lipid baits, that Prdx1 is a potential novel phosphoinositides-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pasquali <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Prdx1 may, therefore, stabilize PTEN binding to the plasma membrane, which in a recent analysis using single-molecule TIRF microscopy, lasts only for a few hundred milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Vazquez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Such short time of membrane binding could explain why we (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B, C, E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2B and D</xref>) and others see only small amounts of PTEN oxidized after cell exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or PDGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kwon <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).

As discussed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Leslie <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), such finding may be attributed to the proximity of NOXs complexes and PIP<sub>3</sub>. Over-expression of Nox1, in PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells rapidly increases PIP<sub>3</sub> levels, in contrast to PI3K activity, suggesting that Nox1-induced superoxide enhances PIP<sub>3</sub> levels by inactivating PTEN rather than activating PI3K. Expression of a peroxidase inactive Prdx2 leads to a rapid increase of PIP<sub>3</sub> levels in growth factor stimulated cells, which is reversed by Prdx2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kwon <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).

Prdx1 tumour suppression seemed to occur largely via regulation of the PTEN and Akt. Knock down of Prdx1 in PTEN<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MEFs did not significantly enhance H-Ras or ErbB-2-induced transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), whereas in transformed PTEN-containing MEFs, decrease in Prdx1 levels resulted in a gain of transformation: 1.5-fold for H-RasV12 and only 1.35-fold for ErbB-2/neuT, which we contributed to decreased Prdx1 knock down in PTEN<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;;shPrdx1;GFP&#x02212;PTEN;ErbB&#x02212;2/neuT</sup>MEFs compared with PTEN<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;;shPrdx1;GFP&#x02212;PTEN;H&#x02212;RasV12</sup>MEFs).

Before lysis, cells were treated with increasing dosages of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as indicated for 15 min. Cell lysates were prepared under anaerobic conditions, and precipitated over night using HA-conjugated agarose beads. IPs were washed four times with argon-purged lysis buffer and analysed by western blotting. Proteins were detected with anti-PTEN, anti-Prdx1-SO<sub>2</sub>/-SO<sub>3</sub> and anti-Prdx1 antibodies. Epitope-tagged Prdx1 migrates slower electrophoretically than endogenous Prdx1, labelled as HA&#x02013;Prdx1. Epitope-tagged PTEN is labelled as Myc&#x02013;PTEN. Anti-Prdx1-SO<sub>2</sub>/-SO<sub>3</sub> can cross-react with Prdx2-4 and stains more intense in the IP proteins due to over night incubation and longer exposure to atmospheric oxygen.
