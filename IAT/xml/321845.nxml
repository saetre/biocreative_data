Two clones, designated pSM-1 and pSM-2, have cDNA inserts of 2498 and 2509 base pairs (bp), respectively, excluding the sizes of the guanylate tails, and the polyadenylate tracts. These clones are shorter than the estimated size of the c-sis mRNA of 4200 bp. Both of these clones can transform NIH 3T3 cells. The third clone, designated pSM-3 has a cDNA insert of 1421 bp and lacks transforming activity. The sequence of clone pSM-1 reveals a single long open reading frame (nucleotides 118-840) encoding chain A of platelet-derived growth factor, and two segments with homology to v-sis (nucleotides 182-871 and 1021-1325). Sequence homology is noted in the 3' untranslated region to the corresponding regions of the beta 1 interferon (IFN), human and murine beta-nerve growth factor (NGF), human interleukin 2 (IL2) genes, and tubulin pseudogenes. However, no typical AATAAA polyadenylation signal is present. An alternating (dCdA)n X (dGdT)n sequence is present in the 3' flanking cellular sequences similar to those in the corresponding position of the human proenkephalin gene, in the first intron of the gamma-IFN gene, and the second intron of the beta-NGF gene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0017-a" xlink:role="5014"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5007"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5008"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5009"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5010"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5011"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5012"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5013"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5014"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5015"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5016"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5017"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5018"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
