In mice, pDCs are uniquely characterized by high-level expression of Ly49Q, a C-type lectin-like receptor specific for class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Despite having a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, Ly49Q was found to enhance pDC function in vitro, as pDC cytokine production in response to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist CpG-oligonucleotide (ODN) could be blocked using soluble monoclonal antibody (mAb) to Ly49Q or H-2K<sup>b</sup>. Conversely, CpG-ODN&#x02013;dependent IFN-&#x003b1; production by pDCs was greatly augmented upon receptor cross-linking using immobilized anti-Ly49Q mAb or recombinant H-2K<sup>b</sup> ligand. Accordingly, Ly49Q-deficient pDCs displayed a severely reduced capacity to produce cytokines in response to TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, TLR9-dependent antiviral responses were compromised in Ly49Q-null mice infected with mouse cytomegalovirus. Thus, class I MHC recognition by Ly49Q on pDCs is necessary for optimal activation of innate immune responses in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: B6, C57BL/6; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; BST2, bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2; DOTAP, 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammonium-propane; ES, embryonic stem; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; mDC, myeloid DC; MCMV, mouse CMV; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; mPDCA-1, mouse PDC antigen 1; ODN, oligonucleotide; pDC, plasmacytoid DC; SHP, Src homology phosphatase; TLR, Toll-like receptor.</p></fn><fn><p>L.-H.

Also termed type I IFN-producing cells, pDCs secrete more type I IFN on a per-cell basis than any other cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). pDCs are especially important in controlling viral infections, a property highlighted by their selective expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), which recognize single-stranded RNA and double-stranded DNA, respectively. pDCs do not express TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5, explaining why they do not respond to common bacterial products recognized by other APCs.</p><p>pDCs represent a rare cell type constituting &#x0223c;1% of bone marrow or splenic leukocytes and &#x0003c;0.5% of lymph node and peripheral blood leukocytes. However, their frequency varies between mouse strains with 129Sv mice possessing a significantly higher proportion of pDCs than other mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Mouse pDCs do not express the lineage markers CD19, CD3, DX5, CD14, or TER119 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In addition to their selective pattern of TLR expression, pDCs and myeloid DCs (mDCs) are dissimilar in various other aspects. Unlike mDCs, pDCs are characterized by a CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Ly6C<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Like mDCs, pDCs express CD11c but they do so at a lower level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Resting pDCs have been referred to as immature APCs because they express only low levels of CD86 and class II MHC, and they display little or no endocytic activity. However, upon TLR stimulation all three of these characteristics are up-regulated to allow pDCs to present antigenic peptides and optimally stimulate CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In addition, pDCs have been implicated in promoting mDC maturation and terminal B cell differentiation to functional antibody-producing plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Five different mAb reagents have been reported to specifically recognize mouse pDCs: 120G8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), mouse PDC antigen 1 (mPDCA-1), 440c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), NS-34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), and 2E6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The 440c mAb recognizes Siglec-H, a DAP12-coupled receptor that inhibits pDC function, including IFN-&#x003b1; secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). 120G8 and mPDCA-1 both recognize bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). NS-34 and 2E6 recognize Ly49Q, a member of the type II C-type lectin-like Ly49 family. Interestingly, most other Ly49 family members are exclusively expressed on NK, NKT, and T cell subsets, where they are known to regulate cytokine production and cell-mediated cytotoxicity via interactions with cognate class I MHC&#x02013;related ligands on target cells.</p><p>Ly49Q is one of the more distantly related Ly49 family members, yet the receptor itself is highly conserved among three mouse haplotypes (C57BL/6 [B6], 129S6, and BALB/c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). To date, Ly49Q protein has been detected in all mouse strains tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), suggesting an important and conserved function for this receptor. The <italic>Ly49q</italic> gene defines the centromeric end of the B6, 129S6, and BALB/c <italic>Ly49</italic> gene clusters. Interestingly, a homologous segment comprising <italic>Ly49q</italic>- and <italic>Ly49e</italic>-like genes is repeated three times in the 129S6 genome because of gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Therefore, in addition to <italic>Ly49q<sub>1</sub></italic>, the 129-related mouse strains contain <italic>Ly49q<sub>2</sub></italic> and <italic>Ly49q<sub>3</sub></italic>, but the latter two genes are considered pseudogenes because they lack exons 6 and 7, which encode the ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>Ly49Q was first reported to be expressed at low levels on a proportion of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> bone marrow myeloid precursor cells, on peripheral blood neutrophils (Gr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and on IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, the function of the receptor on these cell types remains unknown. Ly49Q contains a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM), whereas it lacks a positively charged transmembrane residue, both of which are characteristics of inhibitory Ly49 receptors expressed by NK cells. Furthermore, similar to inhibitory Ly49 NK receptors, the Ly49Q ITIM has been reported to associate with the Src homology phosphatases (SHPs) 1/2 upon antibody-mediated cross-linking of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, Ly49Q is not expressed by NK cells. Moreover, Ly49Q cross-linking on activated macrophages has been reported to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement leading to formation of polarized filopodia and lamellopodia; this suggests a role for Ly49Q in macrophage migration and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>In subsequent reports, a population of cells expressing significantly higher levels of Ly49Q than neutrophils and macrophages was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). This cell population was originally defined as CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Gr1<sup>low</sup> and has been confirmed to represent pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Virtually all peripheral pDCs and the majority of bone marrow pDCs express Ly49Q. The subset of bone marrow pDCs lacking Ly49Q expression are thought to represent immature cells, such that acquisition of Ly49Q expression is linked to sequential development of functional pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). These Ly49Q<sup>&#x02212;</sup> pDCs do not respond to certain stimuli and are defective in the secretion of some cytokines. Ly49Q levels correlate well with pDC maturation, and receptor acquisition is further up-regulated by various stimuli, including IFN-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In some but not all inbred mouse strains, a subset of mDCs also expresses low levels of Ly49Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>We recently identified the classical class I MHC molecule, H-2K<sup>b</sup>, as the cognate Ly49Q ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Using reporter cell analysis, a high-affinity ligand for Ly49Q was detected on tumor and normal ex vivo cells derived from H-2<sup>b</sup> haplotype mice (B6 and 129) but not on cells from the other mouse MHC haplotypes tested. Direct MHC surveillance by pDCs and the implications of this interaction for innate immunity remain to be investigated.</p><p>The current study demonstrates a major role for Ly49Q&#x02013;H-2K<sup>b</sup> interactions in pDC production of IFN-&#x003b1; and, to a lesser extent, IL-12. Remarkably, the function of Ly49Q on pDCs appears to be stimulatory in nature, as revealed by cross-linking experiments despite the presence of a cytoplasmic ITIM. To confirm these in vitro findings and to ascertain the role of Ly49Q during immune responses, Ly49Q-null mice were generated and characterized. Ly49Q-null mice exhibit a severe defect in systemic IFN-&#x003b1; production after challenge with agonists and pathogens recognized by TLR7 and TLR9, which translates into weaker antiviral responses in vivo. We propose that Ly49Q recognition of self-MHC is necessary to regulate pDC cytokine responses to pathogens.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Ly49Q interactions with class I MHC are necessary for IFN-&#x003b1; secretion by pDCs</title><p>We have previously shown that H-2K<sup>b</sup> is a ligand for Ly49Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), suggesting that pDC function may be regulated by class I MHC. Therefore, we investigated the influence of Ly49Q&#x02013;class I MHC interactions on type I IFN secretion by pDCs in response to innate immune stimuli. As previously reported, overnight culture of splenic pDCs (129S1 strain) in the presence of CpG-oligonucleotide (ODN resulted in robust IFN-&#x003b1; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). However, when blocking mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) specific for either Ly49Q or H-2K<sup>b</sup> were added at the initiation of cell cultures, IFN-&#x003b1; secretion by pDCs was almost completely abrogated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). IL-12 secretion by pDCs could also be blocked using Ly49Q or H-2K<sup>b</sup> mAb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Thus, interaction of the ITIM-containing Ly49Q receptor with cognate H-2K<sup>b</sup> ligand appears to be necessary for efficient TLR9-induced cytokine production by pDCs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Ly49Q&#x02013;H-2K<sup>b</sup> interactions are necessary for pDC cytokine secretion after TLR9 stimulation.</bold> (A and B) Splenic pDCs from 129S1 mice were isolated using mPDCA-1 microbeads and cultured overnight in the presence or absence of CpG-ODN and the indicated mAb.

(C&#x02013;E) Splenic pDCs from B6 (C and D) or 129S1 (E) mice were isolated with mPDCA-1 microbeads and cultured overnight in wells that had been precoated with the indicated mAb or recombinant MHC molecule in the presence or absence of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml CpG.

ND, not detectable.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2053187f01"></graphic></fig><p>To test the possibility that Ly49Q is directly involved in activating pDCs and stimulating IFN-&#x003b1; production upon receptor ligation, plate-bound mAb-mediated cross-linking experiments were used. Because pDCs from B6 mice are low producers of type I IFN compared with 129 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), B6 pDCs were selected to enhance detection of increased IFN secretion. As previously reported, B6 pDCs cultured in the presence of CpG-ODN produced low levels of IFN-&#x003b1;. In contrast, when B6 pDCs were cultured on immobilized Ly49Q mAb, IFN-&#x003b1; production was increased 10&#x02013;15-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). IFN-&#x003b1; secretion was also induced using immobilized recombinant ligand (K<sup>b</sup>:Ig/OVA) showing that MHC directly activates pDCs. When this experiment was repeated with 129S1-derived pDCs, anti-Ly49Q cross-linking also significantly increased IFN-&#x003b1; production in response to CpG-ODN, albeit to a lesser extent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that pDCs are synergistically activated by class I MHC and TLR9 ligands.</p><p>The activation of pDCs through Ly49Q, an ITIM-bearing receptor, contrasts with the established functions of similar receptors in lymphocytes. However, our findings are complementary to those of recent studies reporting that immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors inhibit pDC activation, specifically IFN-&#x003b1; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). To determine the outcome of simultaneous ITIM- and ITAM-mediated signal transduction in pDCs, purified cells were cultured in the presence of CpG-ODN on immobilized anti-Ly49Q, anti&#x02013;Siglec-H (a DAP12-coupled receptor), or both. Using both B6- and 129-derived pDCs, inhibitory Siglec-H cross-linking blocked Ly49Q activation and suppressed IFN-&#x003b1; secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). Notably, the reported inhibitory effect of anti&#x02013;Siglec-H was only seen with 129-derived pDCs, likely because of the larger basal IFN-&#x003b1; response seen using 129 versus B6 strain pDCs. Thus, ITAM-mediated inhibitory signals appear to be dominant and suppress ITIM-mediated stimulatory signals in pDCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Targeted disruption of the <italic>Ly49q<sub>1</sub></italic> gene</title><p>To confirm the role of Ly49Q in pDC function, we sought to determine the effect of Ly49Q deficiency by targeted gene disruption in vivo.

To determine whether the localization of Ly49Q-null pDCs is normal, three-color immunofluorescent staining using mPDCA-1, CD3, and CD19 mAbs was performed on splenic sections from untreated and CpG-ODN&#x02013;treated animals. In the spleens of untreated animals, pDCs were mainly localized within the T cell zones and in lower numbers within marginal zone and red pulp (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In CpG-ODN&#x02013;treated animals, the number of pDCs was increased and they tended to form clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The majority of CpG-activated pDCs were found within the marginal zone and red pulp, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Thus, no significant differences were observed in the localization of pDCs in WT and Ly49Q-null mice before or after CpG-ODN treatment.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Age-dependent increase in pDC proportion in Ly49Q-null mice.</bold> (A) pDC size and morphology. pDCs were sorted as CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DX5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD19<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells from the spleen and cytocentrifuged on microspcope slides directly as resting pDCs or after incubation with 3 &#x003bc;g/ml CpG for 16 h.

Splenic pDCs were isolated from WT and Ly49Q-null littermates using mPDCA-1&#x02013;conjugated magnetic beads, cultured overnight in various concentrations of CpG-ODN, and the supernatant was assayed for IFN-&#x003b1;. Remarkably, Ly49Q-null pDC supernatants yielded approximately fivefold lower levels of IFN-&#x003b1; relative to supernatants from identically treated WT pDCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). This finding is consistent with the earlier observation that Ly49Q binding to H-2K<sup>b</sup> is necessary for TLR9-mediated IFN-&#x003b1; secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In parallel, Ly49Q-deficient pDCs showed a significant defect in IL-12 secretion in response to CpG-ODN compared with WT pDCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The IL-12 defect was not as pronounced as that observed for IFN-&#x003b1; but is consistent with the decrease in IL-12 production observed upon mAb-mediated blockade of Ly49Q&#x02013;H-2K<sup>b</sup> interactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).

To determine whether the in vitro cytokine defect of Ly49Q-null pDCs had in vivo consequences, mice were injected with CpG-ODN, and serum IFN-&#x003b1; levels were evaluated after 6 h. Importantly, IFN-&#x003b1; serum levels in CpG-injected Ly49Q-null mice were consistently 5&#x02013;10-fold less than those of WT littermates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). On the other hand, the sera of both cohorts showed similar levels of IL-12 (unpublished data). The normal serum IL-12 levels detected in Ly49Q-null mice after CpG injection were most likely caused by TLR9-mediated IL-12 production by cell types other than pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). A time-course experiment monitoring serum IFN-&#x003b1; levels confirmed that although maximal IFN-&#x003b1; levels occur 4&#x02013;6 h after injection in WT mice, Ly49Q-null mice failed to attain a similar magnitude of IFN-&#x003b1; levels at any time point assayed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Thus, Ly49Q-null mice display an inherent defect in IFN-&#x003b1; production in vivo, and IFN-&#x003b1; and IL-12 responses to CpG-ODN can be uncoupled in these mice. Although the absence of the receptor leads to clear defects in cytokine production, the effect of loss of the ligand is unknown. Thus, pDCs were isolated from H-2K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;null mice and were stimulated for IFN-&#x003b1; production by CpG-ODN. H-2K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;null pDCs showed &#x0223c;50% reduction in IFN-&#x003b1; secretion compared with WT pDCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Ly49Q&#x02013;MHC interactions are necessary for cytokine production in pDCs, whereas the inhibition of IFN-&#x003b1; secretion was not as pronounced as for Ly49Q-null pDCs. Possible reasons for this difference may include the mouse strain background or that Ly49Q may have other ligands in addition to H-2K<sup>b</sup>.</p><p>To address the question of whether Ly49Q/MHC interact in cis or trans to regulate pDC function, Ly49Q-null mice were crossed to H-2K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;null mice, and the resulting F1 mice were intercrossed to generate the four possible null phenotypes. pDCs from WT mice stain positively with soluble H-2K<sup>b</sup>/OVA tetramer, and this binding is caused by Ly49Q, as shown by the complete absence of binding in Ly49Q-null mice and by previous blocking experiments with anti-Ly49Q mAb (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, compare the top two dotplots) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).

First, Ly49Q deficiency may have caused down-regulation of TLR9. To exclude this possibility, TLR9 expression was determined by RT-PCR and intracellular flow cytometry given the localization of TLR9 in endosomes. TLR9 levels were measured and found to be similar in both Ly49Q-WT and -null pDCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and not depicted), suggesting that Ly49Q-null pDCs have an equal potential to bind CpG-ODN. Second, the almost complete lack of IFN-&#x003b1; secretion by Ly49Q-null pDCs may be caused by an inability of the cells to become fully activated. Downstream activation events in pDCs both in vivo (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>) and in vitro (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>) after CpG-ODN challenge were assessed by flow cytometry analysis of CD86 and class II MHC surface expression, and were found to be normal.

Similar observations were made for class II MHC (unpublished data). Collectively, these data suggest that the signaling pathways downstream of TLR9 that induce expression of CD86/class II MHC are different from those that lead to IFN-&#x003b1; production such that Ly49Q signaling modulates only the latter responses in pDCs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Normal TLR9 and CD86 expression by Ly49Q-null pDCs.</bold> (A) Splenocytes from Ly49Q-null and -WT mice were stained for Siglec-H and BST2, and were then permeabilized and stained for intracellular TLR9 or with an isotype control mAb.

Although not all experiments showed a statistically significant difference between the two cohorts (e.g., day 3, 6,000 PFU; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>), the detection of impaired viral immunity may be complicated by the susceptible Ly49H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> 129 background of these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Because the <italic>Ly49h</italic> gene conferring resistance to MCMV in B6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) is &#x0003c;300 kb away from the targeted <italic>Ly49q<sup>lox</sup></italic> allele, these experiments could not be repeated on the MCMV-resistant B6 background at this time. Notwithstanding this, the majority of experiments did reveal a statistically significant increase in Ly49Q-null MCMV titers when performed using either an early time point (1.5 d after infection) or a low initial MCMV inoculum (600 PFU), or both (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>).

Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that Ly49Q-null pDCs exhibit a functional deficiency in IFN-&#x003b1; production in response to MCMV infection in vitro, and this translates into an enhanced susceptibility of Ly49Q-null mice to MCMV infection in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><italic>Ly49q</italic> is a highly conserved <italic>Ly49</italic> found in all mouse strains characterized to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Ly49Q is also unique in being expressed on pDCs, in contrast to all other Ly49s. We have previously shown, using the BWZ lacZ-based reporter cell assay, that H-2K<sup>b</sup> is a high affinity ligand for Ly49Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In this study, we confirm the specificity of Ly49Q for H-2K<sup>b</sup> in a functional assay (IFN-&#x003b1; secretion) using fresh ex-vivo pDCs. Remarkably, Ly49Q&#x02013;H-2K<sup>b</sup> interactions appear to be required for optimal TLR7- and TLR9-dependent stimulation of cytokine production by pDCs, as indicated by the drastic reduction in CpG-mediated IFN-&#x003b1; and IL-12 secretion upon mAb-mediated blockade of either Ly49Q receptor or its cognate ligand, H-2K<sup>b</sup>. In further support of this hypothesis, purified pDCs cultured in the presence of low concentrations of CpG-ODN produced high levels of IFN-&#x003b1; when stimulated on immobilized Ly49Q mAb or H-2K<sup>b</sup>/Ig fusion protein but not in the presence of CpG-ODN alone. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Ly49Q&#x02013;class I MHC interactions positively regulate TLR signals and subsequent cytokine production in pDCs.</p><p>In confirmation of the in vitro mAb blocking experiments, Ly49Q-null mice show a severe defect in systemic IFN-&#x003b1; levels (75&#x02013;100% reduction) upon challenge with CpG-ODN. This defect is likely caused by the hyporesponsiveness of Ly49Q-null pDCs, as purified pDCs from these mice exhibit similarly decreased IFN-&#x003b1; responses upon CpG-mediated stimulation in isolation. Ly49Q-null pDCs also show a defect in the production of IFN-&#x003b1; after overnight culture with MCMV. Both CpG-ODN and MCMV stimulate IFN-&#x003b1; production by pDCs in a TLR9-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). However, TLR9 mRNA and protein expression levels in Ly49Q-null pDCs are normal, as deduced by semiquantitative RT-PCR and intracellular staining, respectively. The Ly49Q-null defect similarly affects TLR7, as TLR7-dependent stimulation of isolated Ly49Q-null pDCs results in highly decreased levels of IFN-&#x003b1; relative to WT pDCs. Notably, in addition to IFN-&#x003b1; levels, Ly49Q-null pDCs also exhibit decreased IL-12p70 levels in response to CpG-ODN or influenza stimulation. Thus, Ly49Q-null pDCs possess an intrinsic cytokine production defect in response to TLR7 and TLR9 agonists. Interestingly, however, the activation status of Ly49Q-null pDCs seems normal over a wide range of CpG-ODN concentrations, at least with respect to up-regulation of CD86 and class II MHC surface expression, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 production, morphological change, and migration within the spleen. This suggests that TLR9 stimulation results in multiple signaling pathways leading to pDC activation, but that Ly49Q regulates only the signal transduction pathway leading to IFN-&#x003b1; secretion.</p><p>The phenotype of pDCs from Ly49Q-null mice is similar to that observed for Ly49Q-negative pDCs from WT bone marrow. Omatsu et al. found that Ly49Q-negative pDCs produced significantly less IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; than their Ly49Q-positive counterparts when cultured in the presence of CpG-ODN or Sendai virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In contrast, Kamogawa-Schifter et al. observed comparable IFN-&#x003b1; production levels from the two pDC subsets in vitro after stimulation with CpG-ODN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). It is not immediately clear why there is a discrepancy in IFN-&#x003b1; production among Ly49Q-positive versus -negative pDCs in these two studies, as similar isolation procedures and the same mouse strain (BALB/c) were used. The data presented in this paper agree with the former study, in that the ability of pDCs to produce large amounts of IFN-&#x003b1; appears to depend on Ly49Q expression and function.</p><p>The positive regulation of TLR9 signaling by Ly49Q is at first counterintuitive, given that the ITIM-bearing Ly49Q receptor has the characteristics of an inhibitory Ly49 family member. Similar Ly49 receptors expressed by NK cells undergo tyrosine phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic ITIM in response to receptor engagement, resulting in the recruitment of SHP-1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Ly49-associated SHP-1/2 are then thought to antagonize stimulatory signals initiated through ITAM-bearing adaptor molecules such as DAP12. For example, the ITIM-bearing Ly49G receptor has been demonstrated to suppress DAP12-dependent Ly49D-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Notably, the ability of the Ly49Q ITIM to associate with SHP-1/2 is intact, at least in reconstitution experiments using transfected cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Thus, if Ly49Q is an inhibitory receptor, how does it function to relay TLR7/9-induced signals or amplify TLR7/9-mediated signal transduction? Interestingly, there are clues from experiments performed using DAP12-null mice that may offer a possible mechanism. Specifically, DAP12-null pDCs were reported to produce significantly more IFN-&#x003b1; after CpG-ODN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), as opposed to the decreased response of Ly49Q-null mice. The resulting conclusion was that DAP12 may negatively regulate TLR7/9 signal transduction and, in turn, that DAP12-coupled receptors on pDCs may inhibit IFN-&#x003b1; secretion upon cross-linking. In support of this hypothesis, the pDC-expressed and DAP12-associated surface proteins Nkp44 and Siglec-H do indeed inhibit CpG-induced IFN-&#x003b1; secretion upon mAb-mediated ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In this respect, macrophages and pDCs are functionally similar, as macrophages from DAP12-null mice produce more cytokines after TLR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Furthermore, the DAP12-coupled TREM2 surface receptor appears to deliver constitutive inhibitory signals in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>The apparent stimulatory role of Ly49Q in pDCs could be caused by antagonism of inhibitory DAP12 signal transduction by SHP-1/2 recruited as a result of Ly49Q&#x02013;MHC interaction. In this model, DAP12 signaling would be constitutive like TREM2 function in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Although the convergence point between the DAP12 and TLR9 signaling pathways is unclear, another possibility is that downstream Ly49Q signaling molecules may directly regulate the TLR9 signaling cascade independently of DAP12 function. A third mechanism behind Ly49Q function may include an alternative signaling pathway found in pDCs, one which is distinct from canonical inhibitory Ly49 signaling in NK cells and does not involve the recruitment of tyrosine phosphatases. Evidence for this possibility includes Ly49Q-transfected macrophage cell lines, which show an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in whole-cell lysates after mAb-mediated cross-linking of Ly49Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>The mechanistic link between Ly49Q function and IFN-&#x003b1; secretion is unknown. However, an interesting parallel may exist between NK cells and pDCs in this regard. Two reports have suggested that mature splenic NK cells lacking all self-specific MHC-binding inhibitory receptors (NKG2A and Ly49C/I in B6 mice) are hyporesponsive with respect to the killing of target cells and the production of IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Thus, B6 strain NK cells expressing NKG2A and/or Ly49C/I have been referred to as being &#x0201c;licensed&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;armed.&#x0201d; It is tempting to speculate that pDCs like NK cells may also require the expression of at least one self-specific MHC-binding inhibitory receptor to become fully functional IFN-&#x003b1; producers. This hypothesis is consistent with the hyporesponsiveness observed for immature Ly49Q-negative pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Because Ly49Q binds with high affinity to H-2K<sup>b</sup>, a self-specific determinant expressed in 129 strain Ly49Q-null mice, the lack of a self-MHC&#x02013;specific inhibitory signal during pDC development in Ly49Q-null mice may render these cells anergic. However, the recapitulated phenotype using WT pDCs in mAb blocking experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) argues against Ly49Q-null pDCs being anergic.</p><p>Type I IFN is indispensable for resistance to a wide range of viruses, as shown by studies using IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;R-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Ly49Q-null mice, which are on the Ly49H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> 129 background, also display a severe IFN production defect, as well as a consistent and statistically significant increase in susceptibility to MCMV. However, the susceptibility of Ly49Q-null mice to virus infection is not as profound as that observed in IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;R-null mice. There are several possible reasons for this observation. First, although the magnitude of the IFN-&#x003b1; response to CpG-ODN challenge in WT mice far exceeds that of Ly49Q-null mice, the latter still yield up to 15&#x02013;25% of WT serum IFN-&#x003b1; levels. This lower yet detectable IFN-&#x003b1; production may be sufficient to mount resistance to viral infection. This hypothesis is consistent with the phenotype of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B6 mice, which produce low levels of IFN-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) but are nonetheless sufficient for protection against MCMV and other viruses. In agreement with our study, TLR9-null mice on a BALB/c (MCMV susceptible; Ly49H<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) background also only show a small increase in susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), as would be expected if Ly49Q does indeed regulate TLR signaling. Furthermore, normal systemic IFN-&#x003b1; levels were observed in Ly49Q-null mice 36 h after MCMV infection despite their defective IFN-&#x003b1; responses to synthetic CpG-ODN. Therefore, although pDC cytokine production is compromised in Ly49Q-deficient mice and does confer limited susceptibility to viral infection, the residual capacity of these mice to produce antiviral cytokines probably affords sufficient protection. Whether these residual cytokines are made by Ly49Q-null pDCs or other cell types is not clear.</p><p>Based on the data generated from mAb-mediated blocking assays and functional analyses of Ly49Q-null pDCs in vitro, as well as in vivo analyses of Ly49Q-null mice, we conclude that pDC function, in particular IFN-&#x003b1; secretion, is regulated by class I MHC. The ability of pDCs to recognize class I MHC molecules is imparted by the lectin-like Ly49Q receptor, which in turn potentiates the capacity of pDCs to produce cytokines in response to TLR7 and TLR9 agonists. Loss of this self-recognition mechanism results in severe defects in IFN-&#x003b1; and IL-12 production by pDCs. Thus, Ly49Q&#x02013;MHC interactions positively regulate pDC cytokine production triggered through TLR. Therefore, the down-regulation of class I MHC by certain viruses like MCMV could also result in the attenuation of pDC antiviral defense mechanisms in addition to evasion of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses. Interestingly, despite bearing a consensus ITIM sequence, the function of Ly49Q on pDCs appears to be stimulatory in nature. Although this is somewhat paradoxical, it is nonetheless consistent with the reported counterregulatory function of DAP12-coupled receptors in pDCs, which appear to be inhibitory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>129S1 and B6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. <italic>H-2Kb<sup>tm1</sup>H-2Db<sup>tm1</sup></italic> (K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b</sup>-KO) mice on a B6 background were purchased from Taconic.
