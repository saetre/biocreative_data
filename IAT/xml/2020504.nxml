We have developed a novel system in which progression of phenotypes in a mouse model of pancreatic islet cell tumorigenesis can be used to measure the effects of genes introduced by cell-type-specific infection with retroviral vectors. In this system, bitransgenic mice, in which the rat insulin promoter (RIP) drives expression of both the SV40 T antigen <italic>(RIP-Tag)</italic> and the receptor for subgroup A avian leukosis virus <italic>(RIP-tva),</italic> are infected with avian viral vectors carrying cDNAs encoding candidate progression factors. Like <italic>RIP-Tag</italic> mice, <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> bitransgenic mice develop isolated carcinomas by &#x0223c;14 wk of age, after progression through well-defined stages that are similar to aspects of human tumor progression, including hyperplasia, angiogenesis, adenoma, and invasive carcinoma. When avian retroviral vectors carrying a green fluorescent protein marker were introduced into <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> mice by intra-cardiac injection at the hyperplastic or early dysplastic stage of tumorigenesis, approximately 20&#x00025; of the TVA-positive cells were infected and expressed green fluorescent proteins as measured by flow cytometry. Similar infection with vectors carrying cDNA encoding either of two progression factors, a dominant-negative version of cadherin 1 (dnE-cad) or Bcl-xL, accelerated the formation of islet tumors with invasive properties and pancreatic lymph node metastasis. To begin studying the mechanism by which Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, promotes invasion and metastasis, <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> pancreatic islet tumor cells were infected in vitro with RCASBP-<italic>Bcl-xL</italic>. Although no changes were observed in rates of proliferation or apoptosis, Bcl-xL altered cell morphology, remodeled the actin cytoskeleton, and down-regulated cadherin 1; it also induced cell migration and invasion, as evaluated using two-chamber transwell assays. In addition, myosin Va was identified as a novel Bcl-xL-interacting protein that might mediate the effects of Bcl-xL on tumor cell migration and invasion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cancer cells accumulate multiple genetic alterations. Some of these contribute to tumor development while others are a mere by-product of genomic instability. To determine whether a candidate gene can promote tumor development, we have developed a novel experimental system using engineered viruses to deliver genes into premalignant lesions. We used genetically engineered mice in which both an oncogene (SV40 T antigen) and a specific docking molecule for the virus are produced in &#x003b2; cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Tumors form in only a subset of the islets expressing this oncogene, indicating that tumor development requires other events. Since these precancerous cells also express the virus docking molecule, we could deliver candidate progression genes via the virus to see whether they contributed to tumor progression. We show that genes encoding two proteins (a survival factor, Bcl-xL, and an inhibitory form of the cell adhesion molecule cadherin 1) can be delivered into premalignant &#x003b2; cells and thereby enhance tumorigenesis. Both of these proteins were previously implicated in tumor progression, confirming that our technique can identify such progression genes. Moreover, we find that Bcl-xL promotes tumor cell migration and invasion by a mechanism distinct from its known role in cell survival.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A new technique using lentivirus to deliver genes into targeted cell types reveals that the tumor progression gene<italic>Bcl-xL</italic> not only promotes cell survival in premalignant cells but also promotes tumor cell invasion.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Du YN, Lewis BC, Hanahan D, Varmus H (2007) Assessing tumor progression factors by somatic gene transfer into a mouse model: Bcl-xL promotes islet tumor cell invasion.

However, in most mouse models, mutant genes have been more clearly implicated in the initiation than in the progression of cancer, even when newer methods, such as Cre/<italic>loxP</italic>-mediated recombination or tetracycline- or estrogen-based gene regulation, are used to produce a particular gene product conditionally in a tissue-specific and time-controlled manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, it is time-consuming and expensive to generate alterations in the mouse germ line for each gene of interest.</p><p>Seeking to improve means for studying later stages in tumorigenesis, we have developed a strategy for assessing causal links between individual genes and specific cellular changes during tumor progression. The strategy is based on the use of a transgene that encodes the receptor for subgroup A avian leukosis virus, TVA, allowing cell-specific infection with avian retroviral vectors during tumor development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

In this well-characterized model, SV40 T antigen is expressed under the control of the Rat insulin promoter (RIP) in the &#x003b2; cells of pancreatic islets, providing the driving force for tumor initiation by blocking the activities of the Rb and p53 tumor suppressors. The transgenic mice develop multifocal pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell tumors through well-defined stages that resemble lesions of human tumor development and progression. The natural focal distribution of the target tissue, into &#x0223c;400 focal nodules, has facilitated identification and quantification of the distinguishable stages in islet tumorigenesis, which include hyperplasia or low-grade dysplasias (&#x0201c;hyperplastic islets&#x0201d;), high-grade angiogenic dysplasias (&#x0201c;angiogenic islets&#x0201d;), encapsulated, noninvasive islet tumors (IT, adenomas), and distinctive grades of invasive carcinoma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Using a <italic>RIP-tva</italic> transgene to express the TVA receptor in &#x003b2; cells of the pancreas, we demonstrate that candidate genes can be introduced somatically into developing neoplastic &#x003b2;- cell lesions in <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> bitransgenic mice by infection with a subgroup A avian retroviral vector, termed RCASBP (subgroup A replication-competent avian leukosis virus with a splice acceptor and the Bryan-RSV <italic>pol</italic> gene) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, thereby modulating tumorigenesis. By doing so, we have established the functional roles of two candidate progression factors, a dominant-negative form of cadherin 1 (dnE-cad) and Bcl-xL, when introduced stochastically in incipient neoplasias. Our study also reveals an unexpected activity of Bcl-xL in altering the actin cytoskeleton and promoting invasiveness, findings substantiated by analysis of cultured tumor cells. Our results suggest that targeted somatic delivery of candidate progression factors via retrovirus vectors will be useful for identifying factors and dissecting mechanisms that underlie advanced stages of tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation and Characterization of <italic>RIP-tva</italic> Transgenic Mice</title><p>The general strategy employed in this work involves equipping pancreatic &#x003b2; cells with TVA, the cell surface receptor for subgroup A avian leukosis viruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, so that the cells are susceptible to the RCASBP vector &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; derived from those viruses.

This system utilizes RCASBP avian retroviral vectors to deliver cDNAs into pancreatic &#x003b2; cells in <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> bitransgenic mice during tumorigenesis. This approach has the advantage of introducing somatic genetic changes in a tissue-specific and time-controlled fashion, which more faithfully mimics sporadic tumor development. It also avoids any potential perturbation of normal tissue formation due to the ectopic expression of the gene of interest during development. It is much faster to generate vectors carrying genes of interest than to generate transgenic mice. In addition, using cell lines derived from &#x003b2;-cell tumors in <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> bitransgenic mice, further biochemical and phenotypic analysis can be performed, taking advantage of the high efficiency of viral infection in vitro.</p><p>The low efficiency of in vivo infection has been a limitation of using the RCAS-TVA system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we were able to achieve 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; in vivo infection efficiency in hyperplastic pancreatic islet &#x003b2;-cell lesions using high viral titer (&#x0003e;10<sup>8</sup> infectious units per milliliter) and the intra-cardiac route to deliver the RCASBP viruses into mice. Since not all the premalignant lesions are infected with the RCASBP vectors and 2&#x00025;&#x02013;4&#x00025; of islets develop into tumors in the <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> bitransgenic mice without viral infection, only the factors that confer a selective advantage over the natural course of tumorigenesis in <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> mice can be identified. Moreover, the percentage of RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic>-positive tumors decreases over time as the uninfected <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> cells gradually develop into tumors. In particular, RCASBP vectors carrying genes that promote metastasis will be most easily recognized, because metastasis to pancreatic lymph nodes or other organs does not normally occur in <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> mice. Although tumors are likely to be clonally expanded from single cells infected with RCASBP vectors carrying progression factors, we were not able to show whether the tumors were clonal because of the limited DNA materials isolated from the small tumors in this study.</p><p>We delivered RCASBP viruses carrying tumor progression factors into <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> bitransgenic animals at 7 wk of age, when hyperplastic islets develop. Analogous to the results obtained from <italic>RIP1-Tag2; RIP1-dnE-cad</italic> bitransgenic mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, we demonstrated that introduction of RCASBP<italic>-dnE-cad</italic> into the hyperplastic islets of <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> animals promoted invasive tumor formation and metastases to the pancreatic lymph nodes. Mice at other ages could also be used to study whether the time at which the candidate factors are introduced influences the outcome, as long as islet cells undergo cell division to allow infection. For example, the transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 (TGFB1) receptor can act as a tumor suppressor at early stages of tumor development, but at later stages TGFB1 responsiveness promotes invasion and metastasis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, a combination of several RCASBP viruses encoding different factors of interest could be used for infection simultaneously or sequentially, and the proviral DNA could be isolated from especially metastatic malignant tumors to identify single factors or combinations of factors that may contribute to the malignancy. However, this approach is limited by the inability of the RCASBP vector to accommodate cDNAs greater than 2.5 kb in size.</p><p>The effects of overproducing Bcl-xL via somatic gene transfer were provocative and unexpected. First, no significant protection against apoptosis was found either in the tumors from mice infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic> or in the tumor cells infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic> in vitro. These findings are quite distinct from the demonstrable anti-apoptotic effect seen when Bcl-xL was expressed via a transgene in all islet &#x003b2; cells throughout tumorigenic ontogeny in the <italic>RIP1-Tag2</italic> model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, as well as in MYC transgenic mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. It remains possible that Bcl-xL contributes to cell survival at earlier stages (hyperplasia/angiogenesis) or a later stage (metastasis) in mice infected with RCASBP-<italic>Bcl-xL</italic>. Additionally, we cannot exclude episodic effects on apoptosis when tumors were forming, as opposed to chronic effects detectable at the later time points of our analysis. This apparent insensitivity of &#x003b2;-cell tumors to the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-xL deserves future investigation. Notably, a similar phenotype of increased invasiveness without suppression of apoptosis has been observed when another apoptotic modulator was overexpressed in the <italic>RIP1-Tag2</italic> mice. Exogenous production of IGF1R for the IGF1/2 survival factors in all islet &#x003b2; cells caused increased invasiveness and lymph node metastasis, with increased (not decreased) apoptosis in the premalignant stages, while having no impact on the tumor stages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Yet elimination of the gene encoding IGF2 produced highly apoptotic tumors with reduced growth, demonstrating the importance of anti-apoptotic signaling for islet tumorigenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. The similar consequences of ectopically expressing Bcl-xL and IGF1R may imply mechanistic similarity that should be further explored.</p><p>Second, we observed that the actin cytoskeleton was rearranged in invasive tumors infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL,</italic> presumably contributing to increased motility. In addition, tumor cells infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic> in vitro displayed altered morphology, abnormal cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton, and elongated cell shape. The morphological changes in tumor cells infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic> may contribute to enhanced cell migration and invasion as observed in the two-chamber assays.</p><p>Third, as measured by Western blotting and cDNA microarray expression profiling, the epithelial cell&#x02013;cell junction protein, cadherin 1, was down-regulated and a transcriptional repressor of cadherin 1, snail homolog 1, was up-regulated in the tumor cells infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic>. These changes may contribute to the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and diminish the strength of cellular adhesion. Indeed, tumor cells infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic> exhibited a strong capability to migrate through transwell membrane and to invade through Matrigel, but the mechanism by which Bcl-xL regulates cadherin 1 remains to be determined.</p><p>Finally, the identification of a novel Bcl-xL-interacting protein, myosin Va, may help to explain the pro-invasive activity of Bcl-xL. Myosins belong to a superfamily of actin-based motor proteins comprising at least 15 classes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. There are two main groups of myosins: the conventional, well-characterized myosin II class of muscle and non-muscle cells and the unconventional myosins. The myosin II class is referred to as &#x0201c;conventional myosin&#x0201d; because for many years this was the only class of myosin known; members of this class are able to form filaments and are involved in muscle contraction, cell migration, and cytokinesis. The functions of most of the unconventional myosins are not known, but some have been shown to participate in the extension of processes at the leading edge of crawling cells. For example, myosin I is required for formation of pseudopod extensions in the amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium,</italic> and myosin V for extension of filopodia in neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>By comparing the effects of suppressing the function of cadherin 1 with dnE-cad and overproducing Bcl-xL, we have highlighted the provocative pro-invasive activity of Bcl-xL. Cadherin 1 is a well-established barrier to invasive growth in many other epithelial cancers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, and its suppression enables invasive growth of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell tumors in transgenic mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Yet Bcl-xL produced a more highly invasive phenotype in a Matrigel invasion assay of cultured tumor cells than did dnE-cad, supporting the proposition that Bcl-xL has roles other than suppression of cadherin 1 that enhance the invasive growth phenotype. The levels of endogenous cadherin 1 in these two types of cells could contribute to the differences. Whereas endogenous cadherin 1 protein levels were not affected when the dominant-negative form was introduced into the cells, cadherin 1 was down-regulated in the tumor cells infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic>. This effect could reduce cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and also affect the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand, the frequency of lymph node metastasis was similar in <italic>RIP-Tag; RIP-tva</italic> mice infected with RCASBP<italic>-Bcl-xL</italic> and RCASBP<italic>-dnE-cad</italic>.

However, several lines of evidence indicate that they are not functionally equivalent in tumorigenesis. In primary breast cancer, overexpression of <italic>Bcl-xL</italic> is associated with higher tumor grade and nodal metastasis, and overexpression of <italic>Bcl2</italic> is correlated with lower tumor grade and smaller tumor size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our findings suggest that Bcl-xL enhances cell motility, remodels the actin cytoskeleton, down-regulates cadherin 1, and interacts with myosin Va without affecting cell proliferation or apoptosis. It remains to be investigated whether these properties are unique to Bcl-xL among the BCL2 family members.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a mouse model to assess the effect of candidate genes in tumor progression, without the need to generate conditional transgenic lines in which genes of interest are expressed at different stages of tumorigenesis. Thus far, we have employed this approach to improve our knowledge of the contribution of Bcl-xL to tumor invasion and metastasis. We postulate that Bcl-xL has a pro-invasive function other than its anti-apoptotic activity. Given that many somatic gene mutations and altered expression of thousands of genes have been discovered in cancers, it will not be a simple task to verify that each candidate gene is important during carcinogenesis. By delivering libraries of retroviruses encoding candidate factors or inhibitory RNAs into transgenic mice, it may be possible to screen many of the genes for effects during tumorigenesis in a variety of tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse strains.</title><p>The elastase-<italic>tva</italic> transgene construct &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050276-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d; was digested with BamHI and HindIII to release a 800-bp <italic>tva</italic> cDNA fragment encoding the glycosylphosphatidylinisotol-anchored form of the receptor.
