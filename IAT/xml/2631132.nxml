Colonization of the host plant is initiated by direct penetration of cuticle and cell wall of maize epidermis cells. The invading hyphae are surrounded by the plant plasma membrane and proliferate within the plant tissue. We identified a novel secreted protein, termed Pep1, that is essential for penetration. Disruption mutants of <italic>pep1</italic> are not affected in saprophytic growth and develop normal infection structures. However, <italic>&#x00394;pep1</italic> mutants arrest during penetration of the epidermal cell and elicit a strong plant defense response. Using Affymetrix maize arrays, we identified 116 plant genes which are differentially regulated in <italic>&#x00394;pep1</italic> compared to wild type infections. Most of these genes are related to plant defense. By <italic>in vivo</italic> immunolocalization, live-cell imaging and plasmolysis approaches, we detected Pep1 in the apoplastic space as well as its accumulation at sites of cell-to-cell passages. Site-directed mutagenesis identified two of the four cysteine residues in Pep1 as essential for function, suggesting that the formation of disulfide bridges is crucial for proper protein folding. The barley covered smut fungus <italic>Ustilago hordei</italic> contains an ortholog of <italic>pep1</italic> which is needed for penetration of barley and which is able to complement the <italic>U. maydis &#x00394;pep1</italic> mutant. Based on these results, we conclude that Pep1 has a conserved function essential for establishing compatibility that is not restricted to the <italic>U. maydis</italic> / maize interaction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>For many fungi that infect plants, successful invasion is coupled to a series of differentiation steps that are necessary to breach the plant cuticle. Such fungi form specialized infection structures which allow direct penetration of the plant cuticle. The smut fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> establishes a biotrophic interaction with its host plant maize in which the infected host cells stay alive. During biotrophic growth, the intracellularly growing hyphae are encased by the host plasma membrane. We show here that a small effector protein, which is secreted by fungal hyphae during penetration, is absolutely essential for fungal entry into plant cells. When this effector is absent, hyphal cells penetrate the plant cell wall and invagination of the plant plasma membrane is observed, but any further fungal development is arrested. This arrest coincides with the induction of massive plant defense responses. Thus, this effector, which is conserved in related fungal species, plays an essential role in suppression of plant defense responses and is critical for establishing compatibility. This is the first example where a single effector protein assumes such a crucial role for infection-related development in a plant pathogenic fungus.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The initial step of pathogenic development for both necrotrophic and biotrophic fungal pathogens is the successful penetration of the plant surface. Penetration can occur directly via specialized infection structures, called appressoria, which promote the localized secretion of plant cell wall degrading enzymes or build up turgor and allow penetration through mechanical force. Alternatively, fungal pathogens may use natural openings like stomata or wounds for entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Tucker1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The infection strategy does not appear to be linked to the subsequent lifestyle of the fungal pathogen, i.e. necrotrophs like <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> as well as hemibiotrophs such as <italic>Colletotrichum ssp.</italic> and <italic>Magnaporthe grisea</italic> directly penetrate the plant surface via appressoria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-CaracuelRios1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-vanKan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Some biotrophs like most rust fungi invade plant tissue via stomata, while other biotrophs like the smut fungi and the powdery mildew fungi form appressoria that allow direct entry into the plant epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Mendgen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Klosterman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Necrotrophic pathogens kill the invaded cell by secretion of toxic compounds or induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and subsequently feed on dead plant material. In biotrophic interactions and during the initial stages of hemibiotrophic interactions the infected plant cell stays alive. In such interactions, the plant plasma membrane is invaginated and encases the infecting hyphae, thereby forming a biotrophic interface. This interface, which can be established by intracellularly growing hyphae or by specialized structures (haustoria), provides nutrients to the pathogen and facilitates exchange of signals maintaining the interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Mendgen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-OConnell1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Compatibility in a biotrophic interaction requires the pathogen to overcome basal plant defense responses that are elicited by recognition of conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and which can lead to pathogen arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Jones1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This initial PAMP-triggered immunity needs to be overcome by successful pathogens that use secreted effectors to interfere with these processes, and use such effectors to trigger susceptibility. Effectors may also be specifically recognized by R proteins, leading to effector triggered immunity which is often associated with cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Jones1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Haploid <italic>U. maydis</italic> cells mate on the leaf surface and the resulting dikaryon switches to filamentous tip growth. The growing tip cell is separated from the older parts of the hypha by a septum, and the older septated hyphal parts appear empty and are often collapsed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Snetselaar1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The need of two compatible wild type strains complicates generation of deletion mutants. Therefore, the solopathogenic strain SG200 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Kmper1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, which is a haploid strain engineered to carry composite mating type loci is frequently used. This strain forms filaments on the maize surface and causes disease without prior mating. On the leaf surface, SG200 as well as the dikaryon formed after mating of two compatible haploid wild type strains, develops non-melanized appressoria that directly penetrate the host tissue and establish a biotrophic interaction. Gene-for-gene systems, i.e. effectors that are specifically recognized by cognate resistance genes of the plant have not been described in this pathosystem. After penetration <italic>U. maydis</italic> grows intracellularly and during this stage the hyphae are surrounded by the host plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Snetselaar1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Snetselaar2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>U. maydis</italic> does not develop haustoria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Banuett1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and the intracellular hyphae pass from one cell to the next. At later stages fungal hyphae accumulate in mesophyll tissue and are found mostly in apoplastic cavities that arise in the developing tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Doehlemann1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In these tumors plant cells enlarge, undergo mitotic divisions and the hyphal aggregates differentiate into spores.</p><p>The genome sequence of <italic>U. maydis</italic> revealed that this organism is poorly equipped with plant cell wall degrading enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Kmper1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, which is in line with its biotrophic life style where the infected plant cells stay alive. However, <italic>U. maydis</italic> codes for a large set of novel secreted effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Mller1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and many of the respective genes are arranged in clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Kmper1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. During biotrophic development, the majority of these clustered effector genes is upregulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Kmper1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. 12 of these gene clusters encoding secreted proteins were deleted and five of the respective mutants were significantly altered in virulence. Deletion of one cluster resulted in increased virulence, while mutants of the four other clusters were attenuated in virulence and showed defects at different stages of pathogenic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Kmper1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, none of these clusters was reported to be essential for the initial step of biotrophic development, the penetration of epidermal cells.</p><p>Based on these studies it became clear that the repertoire of effectors with a function during disease was unlikely to be restricted to effectors whose genes reside in clusters. We have therefore initiated a systematic analysis of effector genes in <italic>U. maydis</italic> which is solely based on two criteria: the protein should carry a secretion signal and the predicted product should be novel i.e. should not match data base entries.

Since the fungal cytoplasm moved into the intracellularly growing hyphae, hyphal sections on the leaf surface did not contain cytoplasm any more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000290-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). 24 hpi, hyphae of SG200&#x00394;pep1rfp could not be detected inside epidermal cells; instead, mutant hyphae were arrested immediately after penetration of the epidermal cell wall. The plant plasma membrane was found to be invaginated around mutant hyphal tips; however, no progression of mutant hyphae into the lumen of the epidermal cell was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000290-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>). To test whether the <italic>&#x00394;pep1</italic> phenotype is also evident when haploid wild type strains are used instead of the solopathogenic SG200 strain, the <italic>pep1</italic> gene was deleted in the two compatible <italic>U. mayd</italic>is wild type strains FB1 and FB2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Banuett2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

In SG200&#x00394;pep1, infection-related development like filamentation and appressorium formation were unaffected. Since &#x00394;<italic>pep1</italic> mutant hyphae were found to invaginate the plant plasma membrane after appressorium formation, this must indicate that lysis of the plant cell wall itself is still possible when Pep1 is absent. This was even more evident when plants were infected with a mixture of compatible FB1&#x00394;pep1 and FB2&#x00394;pep1 strains. In this case the dikaryon formed short penetration pegs and this was associated with the collapse of the invaded cell. Similarly, the dikaryon of <italic>U. hordei</italic> &#x00394;<italic>pep1</italic> strains initially penetrated the epidermal cell but was arrested,in the penetrated cell that underwent cell death. The finding, that the <italic>U. hordei pep1</italic> can fully complement <italic>U. maydis pep1</italic> mutants shows complete functional conservation of Pep1 in the both pathosystems. The slight difference in arrest point between <italic>U. maydis</italic> and <italic>U. hordei</italic> mutants is likely to be caused by different responses or cell wall composition of the two host plants. This is also supported by the observation that <italic>U. maydis</italic> is arrested in the first epidermal cell when non-host barley plants are infected (G.D., unpublished). It is obvious, that both <italic>U. maydis</italic> and <italic>U. hordei &#x00394;pep1</italic>-mutants are not defective in the ability to penetrate plant cell walls but fail to establish a biotrophic interaction immediately after entry into the host plant.</p><p>Colonization of epidermal cells by biotrophic fungi requires the establishment of a biotrophic interface which mediates nutrient uptake and provides the contact zone where suppression of defense responses by the fungus takes place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-OConnell1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In infections with <italic>U. maydis</italic> strain SG200 early plant defense responses are induced and these are downregulated upon penetration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Doehlemann2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of <italic>pep1</italic> this downregulation was not observed, i.e. of the 37 defense related genes which were significantly repressed in the interaction with SG200 24 hpi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Doehlemann2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, 23 genes were found to be highly induced 24 hpi in SG200&#x00394;pep1 infected maize tissue. Another major difference concerned genes associated with JA signaling. These were strongly upregulated after infection with SG200 but not in response to SG200&#x00394;pep1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Doehlemann2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, two Bowman-Birk type trypsin inhibitors were highly induced after infection with SG200 but induction was absent after infection with SG200&#x00394;pep1. For Bowman-Birk type trypsin inhibitor genes in rice it has been demonstrated that they are transcriptionally induced by JA but repressed by salicylic acid (SA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Rakwal1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that the typical transcriptional response to biotrophic pathogens that coincides with elevated JA levels and a repression of SA signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Glazebrook1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> is not established after infections with SG200&#x00394;pep1. Moreover, production of ROS, papilla formation and the transcriptional induction of PR genes observed in response to SG200&#x00394;pep1 are typical for non-host responses in incompatible plant-pathogen interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Hckelhoven1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To understand the function of secreted effector proteins it is necessary to establish where they localize. Most extensive work on localization and function has been done on bacterial effectors which are translocated into the host cell via the type III secretion systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Bttner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkable advances have also been made in the oomycete field where many effectors carry a RXLR-EER motif that mediates translocation of effectors into the plant cell while a second group of effectors that lack this motif function in the apoplast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Tyler1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-MisasVillamil1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The described secreted fungal effectors follow similar principles, i.e. they either have an apoplastic function or act inside the plant cell. However, the group of fungal effectors which are translocated to plant cells lack common motifs. Among these are <italic>M. grisea</italic> AVR-Pita, <italic>Uromyces fabae</italic> RTP1 and the flax rust effectors AvrM, AvrL657, AvrP123; AvrP4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Catanzariti1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Jia1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Apoplastic fungal effectors like <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic> effectors Avr2, Avr4 and Ecp6 have been directly isolated from apoplastic fluid of infected tomato plants and several oomycete effectors were detected in isolated apoplastic fluid after antibodies had been raised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Tian1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Westerink1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Pep1 secretion from intracellularly growing hyphae could be shown by generating biologically active GFP and mCherry fusions and this did not require overexpression. Secretion of Pep1 and accumulations at sites where hyphae passage from cell to cell was confirmed by immunolocalisation of HA-tagged Pep1 protein. However, it was impossible to determine in which plant compartment Pep1 resides because of the tight encasement of the intracellular hyphae by plant plasma membrane. This problem could be solved by inducing plasmolysis, which allowed to detect Pep1:mCherry now in the drastically enlarged apoplastic space around intracellular hyphae. By immunoprecipitation full length HA-tagged Pep1 could be isolated from infected plant tissue. This contrasts the situation in tomato where it was not possible to recover affinity-tagged secreted effectors from infected plant after overexpressing the genes via a PVX system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-vanEsse1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, immunoprecipitations of a mCherry-HA tagged Pep1 allowed to demonstrate that a significant amount of full-lengh fusion protein could be isolated from infected plant tissue. However, some material being significantly smaller than mCherryHA (which is therefore unlikely to show fluorescence) was detected. Another fragment of about 35 kD is indicative of processing/degradation within the Pep1 part of the fusion protein. This was not observed when immunoprecipitating Pep1-HA and therefore we consider it likely that this form was generated during protein extraction. Since this clearly shows that no cleavage of full length mCherryHA from Pep1 occurs inside the plant tissue, we conclude that the observed fragments, even if they were present in the infected tissue, should not affect the Pep1-localization shown by fluorescence microscopy. Collectively, the presented data suggest an apoplastic localization of Pep1.</p><p>The elicitation of plant defense responses typically results in the massive accumulation of PR proteins in the apoplast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-vanLoon1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of these PR proteins have enzymatic functions and &#x000df;-1,3 glucanases or proteases can directly harm the pathogen or degrade secreted effectors with the result of disabling the pathogen. For several fungal and oomycete effectors it has been demonstrated that they target such PR proteins: The <italic>C. fulvum</italic> effector protein Avr2 has been shown to inhibit the apoplastic tomato proteases RCR3 and PIP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Rooney1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Shabab1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>; and <italic>Phytophtora infestans</italic> secretes several inhibitors for apoplastic proteases of tomato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Tian1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Tian2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Tian3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. A different function has been shown for Avr4, which prevents hydrolysis of fungal cell walls by plant chitinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-vandenBurg1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. While the role of individual protease inhibitors for disease progression has not been analyzed in <italic>Phytophtora</italic>, silencing of <italic>avr</italic>2 and <italic>avr</italic>4 leads to decreased virulence of <italic>C. fulvum</italic> on tomato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-vanEsse2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-vanEsse3">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly the <italic>C. fulvum</italic> effector Ecp6 (whose function is unknown) is required for full virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Bolton1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to these effectors which are virulence factors, Pep1 is essential for compatibility. When absent, <italic>U. maydis</italic> and <italic>U. hordei</italic> fail to establish a biotrophic interface. <italic>pep1</italic> mutants are recognized by their respective host plants and elicit defense responses that are so strong that a host now acts as if it was a non-host. This, however, does not suffice as an explanation for host specificity. In this case we would have expected that all smuts that express <italic>pep1</italic> should cause disease on the same host plants (which is not the case). Therefore, we propose that <italic>pep1</italic> affects compatibility on an early level that precedes the action of host specificity factors.</p><p>Which is the molecular function of Pep1? At present, we can only speculate about its mode of action. Pep1 of <italic>U. maydis</italic>, which is predicted to comprise 152 aa after signal peptide cleavage, is unrelated to proteins or functional domains of described database entries. This makes it unlikely that Pep1 has an enzymatic function. A glycine-rich domain of 37 aa at the C-terminus was deleted without affecting biological activity. This domain is considerably less conserved between <italic>U. maydis</italic> Pep1 and <italic>U. hordei</italic> Pep1 than the central domain. Given the apoplastic localization and the importance of the four cysteine residues for secretion of Pep1 we consider a compact structure of Pep1 that requires disulfide bridge formation most likely. Fungal and Oomycete plant pathogens have been shown to secrete a broad range of putative enzyme inhibitors to counteract plant hydrolases and many of these are cysteine-rich and attain their compact structure through disulfide bridge formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-MisasVillamil1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Among these are small cysteine-rich apoplastic proteins like Avr2, the EPI and EPIC proteins of <italic>Phytophtora</italic> that all target specific pathogenesis related plant proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Tian1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Shabab1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Tian3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-vanEsse3">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Another small effector of <italic>P. sojae</italic> specifically targets &#x000df;-1,3-glucanases of soybean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Rose1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to selective pressure, both, the genes encoding the plant enzymes and the genes encoding the fungal/oomycete inhibitors exist in large gene families. These features were proposed to provide robustness to the systems but at the same time limit the effects of individual genes due to redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-MisasVillamil1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. With respect to Pep1 these criteria do not apply, i.e. paralogous genes for <italic>pep1</italic> are neither found in <italic>U. maydis</italic> nor in <italic>U. hordei</italic>. We have not analyzed allelic variation, however, the degree of sequence conservation and the preference of synonymous nucleotide substitutions over non-synonymous substitutions in the central domain is remarkably high. This likely indicates that this domain adopts a defined structure that cannot be altered by mutation without affecting the function of the protein. And finally, the phenotype of <italic>pep1</italic> deletion is dramatic, reinforcing the absence of redundant functions. Thus, if Pep1 is an enzyme inhibitor, we would predict that it should have little or no specificity, i.e. interacts with many enzyme isoforms. Fungal effectors like the <italic>C. fulvum</italic> protease inhibitor Avr2 which specifically interacts with two plant proteases shows strong diversifying selection, and this is likely the consequence of preventing recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Shabab1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. This contrasts the situation in Pep1 where we find a high conservation of the central domain which is essential for Pep1 function. Alternatively, Pep1 could act as a kind of chaperone protecting/activating other secreted effectors or facilitate the establishment of the fungal/host interface by binding toxic compounds or interfere with plant signaling. Solving the molecular structure of Pep1 and identification of interacting molecules will help to disclose its function and the processes it interferes with. As two-hybrid screens were unsuccessful, presumably due to incorrect folding of the protein (G.D., unpublished), biochemical approaches are now under way. The understanding of how Pep1 affects plant defense responses is likely to provide fundamental new insights into the initial steps that are required for the establishment of a compatible, biotrophic interaction between fungi and their host plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fungal strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>U. maydis</italic> SG200 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Kmper1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and its derivatives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000290-t001">Table 1</xref>) were grown at 28&#x000b0;C in YEPSL (0.4&#x00025; yeast extract, 0.4&#x00025; peptone, 2&#x00025; sucrose) and used in plant infections as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000290-Molina1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.
