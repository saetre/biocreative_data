DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1), an adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, promotes many of these functions in vitro. However, because NK cells and CD8 T cells express multiple adhesion molecules, it is unclear whether DNAM-1 has a unique function or is effectively redundant in vivo. To address this question, we generated mice lacking DNAM-1 and evaluated DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient CD8 T cell and NK cell function in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that CD8 T cells require DNAM-1 for co-stimulation when recognizing antigen presented by nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells; in contrast, DNAM-1 is dispensable when dendritic cells present the antigen. Similarly, NK cells require DNAM-1 for the elimination of tumor cells that are comparatively resistant to NK cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity caused by the paucity of other NK cell&#x02013;activating ligands. We conclude that DNAM-1 serves to extend the range of target cells that can activate CD8 T cell and NK cells and, hence, may be essential for immunosurveillance against tumors and/or viruses that evade recognition by other activating or accessory molecules.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>S.

Moreover, in secondary lymphoid organs, adhesion molecules facilitate CD8 T cell and NK cell interactions with professional APCs, which induce their activation, expansion, and differentiation. Adhesion molecules act directly as signaling molecules, initiating intracellular pathways that trigger activation and adhesiveness of cytotoxic lymphocytes. They also act as accessory molecules, sustaining cellular contacts that are necessary for the TCRs and NK cell receptors to engage their cognate ligands and deliver intracellular signals.</p><p>CD8 T cells and NK cells express multiple adhesion molecules. Although several studies have addressed the importance of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), attention has recently focused on a novel Ig superfamily adhesion molecule called DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1; also known as CD226). In humans, DNAM-1 is normally expressed on NK cells and CD8 T cells, as well as CD4 T cells and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In mice, &#x0223c;40&#x02013;50% of NK cells and all CD8 T cells constitutively express DNAM-1, whereas CD4 T cells express DNAM-1 preferentially upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). DNAM-1 binds to CD155, also known as Necl-5 or poliovirus receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). CD155 is expressed on epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and APCs. DNAM-1 also binds CD112 (Nectin-2), which is found on epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). In vitro studies have shown that DNAM-1 triggers NK cell&#x02013;mediated killing of tumor cells expressing CD155 and CD112 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). DNAM-1 also facilitates NK cell interaction with subsets of DCs that express CD155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Moreover, DNAM-1 promotes co-stimulation of CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and mediates adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells facilitating transendothelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). DNAM-1 physically associates with the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (&#x003b1;L&#x003b2;2) and modulates its activation and capacity to bind intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Mechanistically, DNAM-1 recruits actin-binding proteins such as Discs-large and 4.1G, which rearrange actin cytoskeleton, promoting clustering of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 and formation of an adhesive complex that polarizes lymphocytes toward other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>In summary, DNAM-1 appears to contribute to multiple innate and adaptive responses, which include (a) leukocyte migration; (b) activation, expansion, and differentiation of CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells; and (c) effector responses of T cells and NK cells. However, because cytotoxic lymphocytes express multiple adhesion molecules, it is difficult to determine whether DNAM-1 plays a unique role in these functions or is redundant. To address this question, we generated mice lacking expression of DNAM-1 and evaluated DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient CD8 T cell and NK cell function in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that CD8 T cells require co-stimulation by DNAM-1 when the antigen is presented by nonprofessional APCs, whereas DNAM-1 is dispensable in the presence of DCs. Thus, DNAM-1 can promote CD8 T cell responses to tumors expressing CD155 and/or CD112. In an analogous fashion, NK cells require DNAM-1 for elimination of tumor cells that are relatively resistant to NK cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity caused by the absence of other NK cell&#x02013;activating ligands. In brief, DNAM-1 broadens the range of target cells that can activate CD8 T cells and NK cells and, hence, it may be critical for immunosurveillance of tumors and/or viruses that escape recognition by other activating or accessory molecules.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Normal development of DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient mice</title><p>To generate DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we designed a targeting vector to replace exons two and three, encoding the start site and the first 129 amino acids of DNAM-1 with an MC1-neo<sup>r</sup> gene flanked by loxP sites (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081752/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081752/DC1</ext-link>). One targeted E14.1 (129P2/OlaHsd) embryonic stem cell was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and resulting chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 mice expressing a Cre transgene under the CMV promoter to delete the MC1-neo<sup>r</sup> gene. The DNAM-1 deletion was then backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background. Homozygote DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were obtained at expected frequencies from intercrosses of heterozygote mice. DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were phenotypically normal and healthy, and developed no gross abnormalities up to 1 yr of age. Flow cytometric analysis of DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not reveal major differences in the lymphoid cell populations (NK cells, CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, DCs, plasmacytoid DCs, and B cells) in the spleen, thymus, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes or in bone marrow precursor populations (Figs. S1&#x02013;S3; and not depicted). Therefore, DNAM-1 appears to be dispensable for development, including that of the immune system. Additionally, lack of DNAM-1 did not result in any compensatory change in the expression of CD96, the alternative lymphocyte receptor for CD155 (Fig. S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DNAM-1 is essential for CD8 T cell responses to nonprofessional APCs</title><p>To assess the co-stimulatory function of DNAM-1 on CD8 T cells, we isolated T cells from WT and DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, labeled them with CFSE, and stimulated them in vitro with APCs pulsed with graded doses of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) superantigen. As APCs, we used the B cell line A20, which expresses MHC class II, or A20 cells transfected with murine CD155 (mCD155; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). After 72 h, we harvested cells and evaluated CD8 T cell division. The percentage of dividing WT CD8 T cells was significantly higher when T cells were stimulated with A20-mCD155 rather than A20 parental cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>). In contrast, CD155 had a relatively minor effect on the proliferation of DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD8 T cells; the percentage of dividing DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD8 T cells was only slightly higher when SEB was presented by A20-mCD155 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Similar results were obtained when the CD8 T cell proliferative response to SEB was measured by thymidine incorporation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These data demonstrate a clear role of DNAM-1 in priming and expansion of CD8 T cells in response to a superantigen presented by B cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DNAM-1 augments CD8 T cell division in response to superantigen.</bold> (A and B) FACS analysis of CFSE dilution 72 h after (A) WT or (B) DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells were co-cultured with A20 cells or A20 cells expressing mCD155 in the presence of the indicated concentrations of SEB.

In this setting, OT-1 CD8 T cells lacking DNAM-1 proliferated less efficiently than WT OT-1 cells and also failed to become activated, as demonstrated by a lack of increase in size and granule content detected in forward scatter (FSC)/side scatter (SSC) profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Collectively, these data firmly establish that DNAM-1 provides an important co-stimulatory signal for CD8 T cell proliferation when T cells are stimulated by nonprofessional APCs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DNAM-1 promotes CD8 T cell proliferation in response to antigen presented by nonprofessional APCs.</bold> DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> OT-1 transgenic CD8 T cells proliferate less efficiently than WT OT-1 cells in response to SIINFEKL peptide presented by EL-4 T lymphoma cells expressing mCD155.

To evaluate this possibility, we first determined whether CD155 is expressed on mouse DCs, as has been shown for human monocyte-derived DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Consequently, we established a mCD155-specific antibody (Fig. S1) and stained immature and activated bone marrow&#x02013;derived DCs (BMDCs). BMDCs constitutively expressed mCD155 and the expression level was further augmented by stimulation with Toll-like receptor agonists, including LPS, poly I:C, zymosan, and CpG oligonucleotides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To determine whether mCD155 is expressed on primary DCs involved in antigen presentation, we applied a mixture of a green fluorescent cell tracker and a mild irritant to the ears of mice. We extracted draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) 48 h later and examined DC by flow cytometry. mCD155 was selectively expressed on cell tracker<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs that had migrated from the skin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). DCs that migrate to the CLNs at this time point are mainly dermal DCs, whereas Langerhans cells reach the CLNs at later time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Thus, mCD155 is expressed on dermal DCs that migrate into the lymph nodes. In contrast, we were unable to detect mCD155 expression on primary spleen mouse DCs (unpublished data). We conclude that mCD155 is expressed on primary DCs that migrate from the periphery into the lymph nodes and, therefore, may potentially contribute to DC-mediated priming of T cell responses.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DC-induced CD8 T cell stimulation is DNAM-1 independent.</bold> (A) BMDCs express of CD155, which is up-regulated by Toll-like receptor&#x02013;induced DC maturation.

We used immature BMDCs and mature BMDCs activated with a CpG oligonucleotide. In contrast to our results obtained using A20 and EL-4 as APCs, lack of DNAM-1 had no impact on the capacity of OT-1 T cells to proliferate in response to DCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). We conclude that co-stimulation by DNAM-1 is not required when T cells are stimulated by professional APCs, at least in vitro. To assess the impact of DNAM-1 deficiency on the generation of antigen-specific T cells in vivo, we immunized WT and DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in the footpad with OVA peptide 257&#x02013;264. After 1 wk, we removed draining lymph nodes and restimulated all cells in vitro with either BMDCs or EL-4&#x02013;mCD155 pulsed with OVA peptide 257&#x02013;264. The frequency of OVA-specific CD8 T cells was determined by intracellular staining for IFN-&#x003b3;.

However, NK cells express additional receptors that mediate antitumor activity. NKG2D triggers NK cell surveillance against tumor cells expressing stress-induced MHC class I&#x02013;related ligands such as MIC-A, MIC-B, and UL16-binding protein in humans, and Rae1, H60, and Mult1 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Natural cytotoxicity receptors, such as NKp46, NKp44, and NKp30, have also been shown to mediate an important role in antitumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The relative contribution of DNAM-1 versus other receptors has not been addressed in vivo. We first examined the cytotoxic ability of purified DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT NK cells cultured with IL-2 to kill target cells in vitro. As target cells, we chose YAC-1 and B16F10. YAC-1 expresses the ligands for NKG2D, whereas B16F10 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>); both targets express ligands for DNAM-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). We found that IL-2&#x02013;cultured NK cells efficiently killed YAC-1 cells whether or not they expressed DNAM-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In contrast, although WT NK cells were capable of killing B16F10 tumors, DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells did not appreciably kill this tumor target (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Interestingly, DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> OT-1 CD8 T cells killed B16 cells pulsed with OVA peptide 257&#x02013;264 less effectively than WT OT-1 CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), indicating that DNAM-1 may contribute to the cytotoxic function of both innate and adaptive lymphocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Lack of DNAM-1 impairs NK cell and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity.</bold> (A) Differential expression of DNAM-1 ligands on B16F10 and YAC cells.

Tumor cells were injected i.v. and lung metastases were counted 2 wk after inoculation. At lower tumor doses (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> cells), DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had significantly higher numbers of B16F10 lung metastases than did WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). At the highest dose of B16F10 (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells), DNAM-1 deficiency had no effect, suggesting that the host response was completely overwhelmed at this dose. The rejection of B16F10 was entirely NK cell dependent, as illustrated by the lack of rejection of metastases after depletion of NK cells by the anti-asGM1 antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Interestingly, the augmented tumor growth caused by DNAM-1 deficiency was not as severe as that caused by NK cell depletion, indicating that DNAM-1&#x02013;CD155 interaction is not the only mechanism by which NK cells mediate rejection of B16F10. Accordingly, we observed that only a subset of &#x0223c;50% of NK cells expresses DNAM-1 (Fig. S1). Similar results were obtained in another experimental metastases model based on the injection of the mouse prostate carcinoma, RM-1, that also expresses mCD155 (unpublished data).

We chose MC38-OVA because this tumor cell line expresses ligands for DNAM-1, CD112, and CD155 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). In addition, our initial studies demonstrated that s.c. inoculation of MC38-OVA induces marked tumor growth in WT mice depleted of CD8 T cells and RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in comparison to control Ig&#x02013;treated WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>), which indicates that CD8 T cells are critical for MC38-OVA tumor rejection. MC38-OVA grew similarly for the first 5 d after injection into DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice. Subsequently, however, DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice failed to reject the tumor as compared with WT control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). We conclude that DNAM-1 contributes to CD8 T cell&#x02013;mediated tumor immunosurveillance, most likely by co-stimulating CD8 T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>This report is the first describing mice specifically lacking DNAM-1 and definitively establishes an in vivo role for DNAM-1 during CD8 T cell and NK cell responses. Our results demonstrate that CD8 T cells require DNAM-1 for efficient stimulation by APCs that are weakly immunogenic, whereas a lack of DNAM-1 has no detectable impact on CD8 T cell stimulation by DCs. Thus, although DNAM-1 accessory function may be redundant in secondary lymphoid organs, it may be essential in peripheral tissues to promote optimal activation and effector functions of CD8 T cells that recognize their cognate MHC-peptide antigen on cells with limited expression of co-stimulatory ligands, such as tumor cells. Intraepithelial lymphocytes, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, and lamina propria lymphocytes may also depend on DNAM-1 for co-stimulatory signals from epithelial cells expressing CD155. Intraepithelial and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells have been shown to rely on NKG2D-mediated co-stimulation and are in some cases directly activated by NKG2D ligands on tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Given this, DNAM-1 may either augment or, in some cases, compensate for NKG2D.</p><p>As indicated by our results with the B16F10 melanoma, expression of DNAM-1 enables NK cells to more efficiently kill tumor cells that are comparatively resistant to NK cell&#x02013;mediated death because they lack NKG2D ligands. In contrast, DNAM-1 is dispensable for NK cell&#x02013;mediated killing of highly susceptible targets that express NKG2D ligands, like YAC-1. Overall, our data suggest that DNAM-1 may play an important role in immunosurveillance against tumors and perhaps viral infections that are weakly immunogenic and refractory to NK cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, we have shown that DNAM-1 significantly contributes to CD8 T cell&#x02013;mediated surveillance against tumor cells expressing CD112 and/or CD155. We and others have shown that T cells express at least one additional receptor for CD155, CD96, which has distinct functional characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Although it is possible that the lack of DNAM-1 is at least in part compensated by CD96, future studies will be necessary to determine the relative contributions of these two receptors to T cell and NK cell stimulation.</p><p>Genome-wide analysis of type I diabetes has recently revealed robust association of type I diabetes with a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism within the <italic>DNAM-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). This observation, together with the observed expression of both DNAM-1 and CD155 in thymocytes (Fig. S3), suggests that DNAM-1&#x02013;CD155 interactions may regulate the generation of autoreactive T cells, further emphasizing the importance of DNAM-1 in the immune response. We have shown that DNAM-1 considerably expands the range of cells that can activate CD8 T cells and NK cells. DNAM-1 is also up-regulated on CD4 T cells after Th1 differentiation but is down-regulated on Th0 and Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). How DNAM-1 influences CD4 T cell and perhaps T reg cell responses remains an open question.</p><p>In conclusion, this report provides the first demonstration that DNAM-1 promotes CD8 T cell co-stimulation and NK cell responses in vivo, broadening the spectrum of target cells that are effectively recognized. It has been shown that human CMV reduces expression of CD155 in infected cells through UL141 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Moreover, some tumors overexpress CD155 and release it as a soluble molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), possibly to block DNAM-1 and prevent recognition of tumor cells. These mechanisms of evasion underscore the potential importance of DNAM-1&#x02013;CD155 interactions in immunosurveillance against tumors and/or viral infections, particularly those that are weakly immunogenic because they do not engage major activating or accessory molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</title><p>A targeting vector was designed to replace exons two and three (encoding the start site and first 129 amino acids) of DNAM-1 with an MC1-neo<sup>r</sup> gene flanked by loxP sites (Fig. S1). The construct was linearized and electroporated into E14.1 (129P2/OlaHsd) embryonic stem cells; 747 clones from two independent experiments were expanded and screened by Southern blotting using an external probe. One targeted clone was identified and confirmed using multiple restriction enzyme digests and external and internal probes. The clone was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and resulting chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 mice expressing a Cre transgene under the CMV promoter to delete the MC1-neo<sup>r</sup> gene. Germline transmission was assessed by coat color and the presence of the DNAM-1 mutation by PCR. The DNAM-1 deletion was backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background, facilitated by a genome-wide screening of polymorphic microsatellite markers at 10-centiMorgan intervals at each generation (performed by the Rheumatic Disease Core Center's Speed Congenics Laboratory, Washington University School of Medicine). A 96% C57BL/6 male (B6N4) was identified for further backcrossing; B6N6 heterozygotes were intercrossed to generate the DNAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice used for this study.
