Comparison of these sequences reveals a higher than expected level of similarity between the nucleic acids and encoded proteins. Analysis of this data in relation to that for phosphoglycerate kinase sequences of mammals, prokaryotes and yeasts suggests that the wheat genes have recombined. This has resulted in the chloroplast and cytosolic kinases being more similar to each other than would be expected if the chloroplast enzyme had evolved directly from that of a prokaryotic progenitor.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6569"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6570"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6571"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6572"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6573"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6574"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6575"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6576"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6577"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6578"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6579"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00133-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6580"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
