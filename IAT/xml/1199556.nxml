MBT demarcates transition from synchronous short cell cycles of S and M phases exclusively to full cycles encompassing G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> phases. Transcriptional profiling and RT&#x02013;PCR analyses during these phases enabled us to determine that this shift corresponds to decreased transcript levels of S/M phase cell cycle control genes (e.g. <italic>ccna2</italic>, <italic>ccnb1</italic>, <italic>ccnb2</italic> and <italic>ccne</italic>) and increased transcript levels of <italic>ccnd1</italic>, encoding cyclin D1, and orthologs of <italic>p21</italic> (<italic>p21</italic>-like) and retinoblastoma (<italic>Rb-</italic>like <italic>1</italic>). To investigate the regulation of this process further, the translation of <italic>ccnd1</italic> mRNA, a G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint control element, was impaired by microinjection of <italic>ccnd1</italic>-specific morpholino phosphorodiamidate (MO) 20mer or hydroxyprolyl-phosphono peptide nucleic acid (HypNA-pPNA) 16mer antisense oligonucleotides. The resulting downregulation of cyclin D1 protein resulted in microophthalmia and microcephaly, but not lethality. The phenotypes were not seen with 3-mismatch MO 20mers or 1-mismatch HypNA-pPNA 16mers, and were rescued by an exogenous <italic>ccnd1</italic> mRNA construct with five mismatches. Collectively, these results indicate that transcription of key molecular determinants of asynchronous cell cycle control in zebrafish embryos commences at MBT and that the reduction of cyclin D1 expression compromises zebrafish eye and head development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Control of cell cycle progression is central to maintaining homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Loss of cell cycle control may lead to imbalances in proliferation and cell death that contribute to various disease states including neoplasia. Current knowledge of cell cycle regulation has largely been instructed by studies on cells and tissues in the adult organism and the extensive use of knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). These studies have illuminated the complex interplay of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and regulators thereof, which control progression through the G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub> and M phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, they highlighted the existence of cell cycle checkpoints, i.e. molecular switches controlling cell cycle progression. In malignant tumor cells, molecular determinants of checkpoint control are frequently inactivated permitting unchecked cell cycle progression and relaxed genome surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Cell cycle checkpoints are also absent during very early stages of amphibian development as initially described in fertilized <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, synchronous, rapid cycling and the absence of the G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle characterize the first rounds of DNA replication and cell division. The molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon are poorly understood.</p><p>We used the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) as a simple model to study cell cycle regulation during vertebrate embryogenesis. The zebrafish has in recent years evolved as a novel and facile <italic>in vivo</italic> model to study human disease since many key genes are highly conserved between the two vertebrate species; these include cyclins, cdks and inhibitors of cdks. Importantly, zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos share the absence of G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> cell cycle phases during very early development, followed by the establishment of asynchronous cell cycles within a short time frame (&#x0223c;3 h) after fertilization, coincident with the mid-blastula transition (MBT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>The onset of cell cycle regulation in zebrafish embryos occurs when zygotic transcription commences, raising the issue whether and how these two phenomena are linked. Here, we describe global transcription profiles in zebrafish embryos at distinct stages of embryonal development before and after establishment of cell cycle checkpoints. We observed that key cell cycle regulators involved in S to M phase transition, specifically <italic>ccnb1</italic>, encoding cyclin B1, <italic>ccnb2</italic>, encoding cyclin B2, and <italic>ccne</italic>, encoding cyclin E, were expressed at high levels in pre-MBT embryos followed by a rapid decline in post-MBT, congruent with the expected pattern of these cell cycle regulators during early zebrafish development. These observations led us to evaluate the expression profiles of other cell cycle regulatory genes, including those involved in G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint control that is established several hours after fertilization. We identified three genes involved in the G<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;S transition in vertebrates: <italic>ccnd1</italic>, encoding cyclin D1, and the orthologs of <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>Rb</italic>, with initial low expression levels, followed by increased expression correlating with the onset of cell cycle asynchrony. Of these three, <italic>ccnd1</italic> mRNA expression was most markedly upregulated after MBT, in accordance with an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). This prompted us to investigate the consequences of interfering with <italic>ccnd1</italic>/cyclin D1 expression in developing zebrafish embryos.</p><p>Morpholino phosphorodiamidate (MO) oligonucleotides are used frequently for sequence-based knockdown studies in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Recently, we and others have described the hybridization strength and activity of antisense oligonucleotides with alternating <italic>trans</italic>-4-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-proline peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and phosphono PNA residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). The hydroxyprolyl-phosphono PNA (HypNA-pPNA) oligomers are more specific than conventional MOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The highly soluble HypNA-pPNA analog exhibited higher affinity towards DNA and RNA, and more stringent mismatch discrimination than MOs. Hence, we compared both MOs and HypNA-pPNAs for their ability to knock down <italic>ccnd1</italic> mRNA translation to cyclin D1 protein based on the published <italic>ccnd1</italic> cDNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). We report that the reduction of cyclin D1 expression was associated with impaired development of the eye and the head region in zebrafish embryos, the two anatomical sites with the highest cyclin D1 expression levels during early zebrafish development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Embryo harvesting and maintenance</title><p>Zebrafish husbandry, embryo collection, dechorionation and embryo maintenance were performed according to the Standard Operating Procedures as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and with approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Thomas Jefferson University.

Each chip was scanned and quantified using a ScanArray Express laser scanner (Packard BioScience). Raw gene expression data were normalized to housekeeping gene controls on each chip. The data were exported to MS Excel for further analysis. After local background correction, each chip was normalized globally by dividing each array by its respective median signal.

During this early phase, cells rapidly cycle through DNA synthesis (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) without transition through either G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). After 10 divisions and &#x0223c;3 h post-fertilization (hpf) embryos enter MBT characterized by the start of zygotic transcription and the gradual lengthening of the cell cycle. The coincident start of zygotic transcription and onset of G<sub>1</sub> phase at MBT raises the question of which early zygotic transcripts direct the establishment of cell cycle control post-MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). To gain a representative view of gene expression patterns during this important transition, we analyzed transcription profiles before and after MBT. To this end, we used a 17&#x02009;000-oligonucleotide microarray platform containing most of the cell cycle regulatory genes known in zebrafish to date. The analysis was performed in triplicates on RNA preparations collected in three different experiments performed independently of each other. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the results of these experiments revealed massive changes in gene expression reflecting the shift from maternal transcripts pre-MBT to zygotic transcription post-MBT. Normalized mean mRNA levels from each time point investigated were directly compared with the expression level at all other time points using pairwise analysis. Thus, a total of six possible comparisons were made for each expressed gene on the microarray (1.5 &#x000d7; 3 hpf; 1.5 &#x000d7; 6 hpf; 1.5 &#x000d7; 24 hpf; 3 &#x000d7; 6 hpf; 3 &#x000d7; 24 hpf; and 6 &#x000d7; 24 hpf). Of the 16&#x02009;399 zebrafish genes represented on the array, 293 demonstrated a &#x0003e;10-fold difference in expression level in &#x02265;3 of the 6 pairwise comparisons per gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). At the &#x0003e;5-fold and &#x0003e;3-fold threshold levels, 1024 and 2464 genes were differentially expressed, respectively. Of note, the expression patterns before MBT at 1.5 and 3 hpf were virtually unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In fact, between 1.5 and 3 hpf significant changes in transcript levels were observed only in nine cases. This result was expected based on the observation that zygotic transcription commences after MBT, i.e. after 3 hpf. In contrast, sequential waves of gene expression were apparent at subsequent stages of embryonal development after MBT. At lower threshold levels (single pairwise comparisons), more extensive changes in gene expression at 6 and 24 hpf were apparent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> provides a visual representation of all genes that changed &#x0003e;10-fold over the observation period and demonstrates a high degree of fidelity among the three sets of experimental samples for each of the time points chosen. Of note, 3 of the 96 genes with at least a 10-fold higher expression level before MBT were found to be the S to M phase cell cycle regulators, <italic>ccnb1</italic>, <italic>ccnb2</italic> and <italic>ccne</italic>. The complete set of annotated genes in this set can be found in Supplementary Material of this report.</p></sec><sec><title>Stage-dependent expression of cell cycle regulatory genes in zebrafish development</title><p>Next, we focused our analysis of the microarray results to transcripts encoding cell cycle regulators and genes involved in checkpoint control. This analysis revealed that transcripts for S/M phase cyclin genes, <italic>ccna2</italic>, <italic>ccnb1</italic>, <italic>ccnb2</italic> and <italic>ccne</italic>, were expressed at high levels of pre-MBT and declined thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, genes of major importance to G<sub>1</sub>/S phase transition, including orthologs of the <italic>Rb</italic>, <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>ccnd1</italic>, were expressed at very low levels initially and increased markedly between 3 and 6 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), with the greatest increase being seen for <italic>ccnd1</italic>. We confirmed the expression patterns of these genes by RT&#x02013;PCR analysis. Collectively, these results underscore that several key molecular determinants of G<sub>1</sub>/S transition, including cyclin D1, are expressed as a result of zygotic transcription consistent with the delayed establishment of cell cycle checkpoints after MBT.</p></sec><sec><title>MO and HypNA-pPNA-mediated knockdown of cyclin D1 in zebrafish embryos</title><p>Whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of <italic>ccnd1</italic> mRNA demonstrated ubiquitous expression during gastrulation, and was prominently expressed in the retina and brain from the 18-somite stage to 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). After 48 hpf, expression remained strong in the retina and tectum of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The distinctive expression pattern of <italic>ccnd1</italic> mRNA in zebrafish embryos prompted us to investigate the functional contribution of cyclin D1 protein expression to embryonal development in zebrafish larvae. To this end, we used antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the <italic>ccnd1</italic> mRNA encoding cyclin D1 in order to block translation of the targeted message; thereby, reducing the level of the target protein. To test the efficacy of MOs and HypNA-pPNAs in reducing cyclin D1 expression in zebrafish embryos, target sequences were selected as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The MO&#x02022;RNA and HypNA-pPNA&#x02022;RNA <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) revealed that the MO 20mer was only 5&#x000b0;C more stable than the HypNA-pPNA 16mer. A single mismatch in the latter lowered <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> by 6&#x000b0;C. In the MO 20mer, three mismatches lowered <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> by 26&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The effects of MO and HypNA-pPNA injections on cyclin D1 protein expression in the developing embryos were assessed by western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) showing that both treatments were equally effective in downregulating target protein expression. This analysis was performed at 24 hpf, at which time substantial expression of cyclin D1 was expected based on the transcription profiles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of cyclin D1 downregulation on zebrafish embryos by MO and HypNA-pPNA antisense strategies</title><p>The developmental consequences of <italic>ccnd1</italic>-targeted MO and HypNA-pPNA injections were assessed first at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Cyclin D1 knockdown by MO and HypNA-pPNA injection was associated with comparable phenotypic changes confined to the head and eye regions. Knockdown of <italic>ccnd1</italic> did not markedly affect body size, but did decrease eye and head size. Closer examination revealed that these changes consisted largely of growth inhibition as evidenced by the reduced circumference of the eye and the reduced size of the head region without overt evidence for necrosis or gross malformation. A quantitative analysis of the effects of <italic>ccnd1</italic>-targeted HypNA-pPNA and MO treatments based on measuring the diameters of the eyes clearly confirmed the visual impression of microophthalmia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Histological analysis of <italic>ccnd1</italic> HypNA-pPNA-treated or MO-treated fish larvae further confirmed reduced gross size of the eyes throughout the observation period. Representative examples of control, MO-treated and HypNA-pPNA-treated larval eyes at day 5 of development are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. The most striking antisense effects were a sharp reduction in the number of retinal cells and in the thickness of the inner plexiform layer (white arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This difference was not due to programmed cell death as only a few apoptotic cells were observed between days 2 and 5 of larval development in all experimental conditions (data not shown).</p><p>Importantly, the developmental consequences of both MO and HypNA-pPNA cyclin D1 knockdown were sequence-specific. Even a one-base mismatch control, in the case of HypNA-pPNA injections, was sufficient to prevent the phenotypic changes produced by <italic>ccnd1</italic>-targeted HypNA-pPNA. In contrast, in the case of MOs, three-base mismatch controls were necessary to prevent inhibitory effects. To further assess the specificity of the effects observed, we performed rescue experiments by co-injection of <italic>ccnd1</italic> mRNA and either HypNA-pPNA or MO. In either case, almost complete rescue was observed, confirming that the effects of either antisense construct were sequence-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In summary, these results revealed similar phenotypic effects produced by <italic>ccnd1</italic> antisense oligonucleotides with quite divergent structures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study identifies molecular mechanisms controlling the establishment of cell cycle control during early zebrafish development. The delayed onset of G<sub>1</sub>/S transition control in this vertebrate model system allowed us to monitor expression of cell cycle regulators that contribute to the establishment of G<sub>1</sub>/S transition. The transcription profile analysis enabled simultaneous assessment of temporal changes in the expression patterns of multiple cell cycle regulators, cyclins, cdks and cdk inhibitors in early zebrafish development. Specifically, we observed high expression levels of cyclin genes <italic>ccna2</italic>, <italic>ccnb1</italic>, <italic>ccnb2</italic> and <italic>ccne</italic> before the onset of zygotic transcription. This pattern was expected as these cyclins play prominent roles in S and M phases of the cell cycle, which are prevalent in the first hours of embryonal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that zygotic transcription is necessary for the gradual slowing of cell cycle progression after MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In agreement with this earlier study we describe here that the expression of various molecular determinants of G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint control, the putative <italic>Rb</italic> and <italic>p21</italic> gene orthologs, and <italic>ccnd1</italic>, commences after MBT. It should be noted that, as yet, zebrafish orthologs of <italic>ccnd2</italic> and <italic>ccnd3</italic> are not fully validated. Previous work demonstrated that, in zebrafish, <italic>ccnd1</italic> expression occurred after MBT at the onset of G<sub>1</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Our results are consistent with this earlier report, and raised the question of what role cyclin D1 plays in zebrafish embryogenesis.</p><p>We found that downregulation of cyclin D1 by use of two antisense oligonucleotides with different backbones resulted in a phenotype restricted to the organ sites characterized by highest expression of cyclin D1 during gastrulation, i.e. the developing eye and the head region. Elimination of knockdown effects by a single mismatch in the HypNA-pPNA 16mer correlated with our previous observations of non-activity with one and two mismatches in 18mers, versus the need for four mismatches in an MO 25mer to abrogate activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>The main effect of cyclin D1 downregulation on eye development was a proportional decrease in the size of the organ owing to reduced cellularity, but not overt cell death. This result is remarkably similar to results described in cyclin D1-deficient mice generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). As in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), <italic>cnnd1</italic> mRNA expression is very high in the developing retina and brain of mice. Furthermore, cyclin D1 deficiency in mice led to impaired development of all layers of the retina in a fashion very similar to the results described in this study. Collectively, these results show a remarkable degree of functional conservation of cyclin D1 function across species and open the door to the study of other cell cycle regulators in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_15_4914__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="nar_33_15_4914__gki799.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Michael Choob and Dr John Archdeacon of Active Motif for their contribution of <italic>trans</italic>-4-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-proline PNA/phosphono PNA oligomers.
