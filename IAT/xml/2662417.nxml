They contain a matrix which is surrounded by a single membrane and consists mainly of soluble proteins.

The carbon flow through peroxisomal pathways presupposes a continuous metabolite transfer across the peroxisomal membrane. The mechanism of this transfer represents a long-standing problem in the biology of peroxisomes. Two contrasting models have been discussed for more than 40 years: (1) the membrane of the peroxisome contains pore-forming proteins and is freely permeable to solutes, and (2) the peroxisomal membrane is completely impermeable to small solutes and contains a set of selective transporters (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Antonenkov1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Visser1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Transporters specific for ATP have been characterized in yeast and mammalian peroxisomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Visser1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Palmieri1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The examples of poor phenotype of the mouse models deficient in certain peroxisomal protein are numerous and include multifunctional enzyme type 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Qi1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, racemase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Savolainen1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, liver isoform of fatty acid binding protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Newberry1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, and peroxisomal membrane ABC transporters (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Wanders2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>). The functional redundancy might be limited or even abolished by harsh environmental conditions. To examine this possibility we challenged <italic>Pxmp2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice with diets containing clofibrate (a known proliferator of mouse liver peroxisomes) or phytol (methyl-branched fatty alcohol metabolized via &#x003b1;-oxidation only in peroxisomes). These treatments did not trigger development of phenotypes in Pxmp2-deficient mice different from those of wild-type animals (data not shown). However, our in depth analysis of the effect of Pxmp2 deletion on female mice reveals some unexpected results. In addition to disturbances in uric and oxalic acids metabolism (see above), these mice were unable to nurse their pups due to low production of milk. <italic>Pxmp2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> female mice showed retarded growth of mammary glands and limited abnormalities in reproductive organs during pregnancy (Rokka A. and Vapola M, unpublished results). It's not yet clear how Pxmp2 deficiency affects mechanisms responsible for normal development of mammary glands. This specific problem is under of our current investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Cluster organization of the Pxmp2 channel</title><p>To describe the nature of the sub-conductance levels of the isolated Pxmp2 channel, one would have to discriminate between two possibilities: (i) whether the large channel represents a cluster of small channels as in the case of some antibiotics forming membrane pores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Kaulin1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> or bacterial porins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Benz1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> or (ii) whether the sub-conductance states are the result of channel gating, as was shown for the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Ujwal1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The transition of the high conductance level (1.3 nS in 1.0 M KCl) to lower conductance levels (0.9 nS and 0.45 nS in 1.0 M KCl, respectively) can be observed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005090-g004">Figure 4B&#x02013;4D</xref>). If this last observation were to reflect the closure of the channel, it would then be reasonable to expect: (i) the pore radii of the large and small channels should be different, and (ii) cation-anion selectivity of the channel would be affected by the closure event, as was shown for mitochondrial VDAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Ujwal1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. If large conductance channels represent clusters of smaller ones, then both of them should demonstrate very similar size and ion selectivity. Our data showing high similarity in ion selectivity and predicted size between Pxmp2 channels with different conductance rates favor the cluster organization model for the channel.</p><p>In view of the homotrimeric composition of Pxmp2 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005090.s008">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005090.s005">Figure S5</xref>), it would be reasonable to predict that each subunit of the protein cluster forms a channel on its own. This architecture, a cluster of three identical monomers, each forming a discrete transmembrane pore, is not unique, since most bacterial porins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Benz1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and the preprotein translocation channel (TOM complex channel) of the outer membrane of mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Kunkele1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> show similar multimeric assemblies. Interestingly, the freshly isolated TOM complex shows three conductance levels. However, after sonication or multiple freeze-thaw cycles, channels having only two main conductance levels were observed, prompting the authors to suggest that physical treatments may lead to inactivation of one of the pores in the complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Kunkele1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation resembles our finding indicating three conductance levels for the isolated Pxmp2 channel instead of one conductance level of around 1.3 nS in 1.0 M KCl as would have been expected from the data obtained using peroxisomal membranes from Pxmp2 deficient mice and membranes from transfected insect cells.</p><p>The results presented here demonstrate a function for Pxmp2 and predicts a mechanism by which water-soluble metabolites penetrate the peroxisomal membrane. The overall transport function of this membrane is derived from exploitation of pore-forming proteins and transporters specific for certain metabolites. This arrangement of two different transport systems in one membrane may not be limited only to the mammalian peroxisomes, but it could be a property of the other members of the microbody organelle family. For instance, glycosomes of trypanosomatids, unicellular parasites that cause sleeping sickness in humans, contain almost the whole set of glycolytic enzymes and conduct several functions attributable to mammalian and yeast peroxisomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Michels1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The low diversity of glycosomal membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Colasante1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> suggests that these organelles may rely on a transmembrane transfer mechanism similar to that of mammalian peroxisomes, avoiding the requirement for specific transporters while preserving the tight regulation of glycolysis that, as has been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Bakker1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, is vitally important for survival of the parasite in erythrocytes of host mammals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Targeted disruption of Pxmp2 in mice</title><p>The mouse <italic>Pxmp2</italic> gene is located head to head with the <italic>PoleI</italic> gene encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase <bold>&#x02208;</bold>.

Samples from cytosol (marked as c) and homogenate (h) were used for immunodetection of peroxisomal proteins: 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (thiolase), sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2, this protein shows dual, peroxisomal/cytoplasmic, localization in the liver of rodents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Antonenkov1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>), sterol carrier protein 2/3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (SCP2/Thiolase), peroxisomal membrane protein 70 (PMP70), and Pxmp2. The peroxisomal membrane proteins PMP70 and Pxmp2 were not detected in the cytosolic fraction (data not shown) indicating that only soluble matrix proteins leaked out of the particles during homogenization. Note an increased leakage of matrix proteins from Pxmp2-deficient peroxisomes. (C) Immunodetection of peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (Thiolase) and peroxisomal membrane protein 70 (PMP70) in fractions obtained after Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation of the postnuclear homogenates prepared from livers of wild-type (upper bands) and Pxmp2&#x02212;/&#x02212; (lower bands) mice. Proteins from equal volumes of each fraction of the gradient were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Note that the peroxisomal membrane marker PMP70 is found only in the bottom gradient fractions, indicating that the wild-type and Pxmp2-deficient peroxisomes enter the gradient. In contrast, the soluble matrix protein thiolase shows a dual distribution with a significant part of the enzyme detected in the top fractions containing mainly cytosolic proteins. It is noteworthy that, like L-&#x003b1;-hydroxyacid oxidase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005090-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), thiolase shows more extensive leakage from Pxmp2-deficient peroxisomes than from wild-type control. (D) Distribution of protein and marker enzymes for different organelles: peroxisomes (urate oxidase), microsomes (esterase), mitochondria (GDH), and lysosomes (AP), and activity of a marker for cytosol (fructose phosphate isomerase/FPI/) in fractions obtained after Nycodenz gradient centrifugation of postnuclear homogenates from wild-type (dark gray bars) and Pxmp&#x02212;/&#x02212; (light gray bars) mouse livers. The total amounts of protein and enzymes activity loaded on the gradients were: protein 150 mg and 166 mg for wild-type and Pxmp2-deficient samples respectively; esterase 55.2 U and 57.0 U; AP 7.2 U and 7.4 U; urate oxidase 2.4 U and 2.5 U; GDH 11.6 U and 11.0 U, and FPI 39.0 U and 42.4 U. The yield of a total protein in the fractions enriched with peroxisomes (fractions 2&#x02013;5) was 2.10&#x000b1;0.05&#x00025; (wild-type) and 1.64&#x000b1;0.04&#x00025; (Pxmp2&#x02212;/&#x02212;, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.044, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) relative to a protein amount loaded on the gradients. Note that the localization of the peroxisomal nucleoid marker urate oxidase near the bottom of the gradient is similar to the distribution of PMP70 (marker for peroxisomal membrane, see Figure S2C). The results agree with data from electron microscopy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005090-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and Figure S2E) showing the presence in the bottom gradient fractions of near intact peroxisomes side by side with particles that contain membrane and nucleoid but are poor in matrix proteins (peroxisomal &#x0201c;ghosts&#x0201d;). The gradient distribution of PMP70 indicates that the Pxmp2-deficient samples contain more peroxisomal &#x0201c;ghosts&#x0201d; (which have lower equilibrium density relative to intact peroxisomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Wanders1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>) than wild-type samples. As seen from the figure, the Pxmp2 deficiency does not influence the distribution in the gradient of subcellular organelles other than peroxisomes, such as mitochondria, lysosomes and fragments of endoplasmic reticulum (microsomes). (E) Electron micrograph of peroxisomes purified from livers of wild-type (panels 1 and 2) and Pxmp2&#x02212;/&#x02212; (panel 3) mice. Original magnification, &#x000d7;8400; bar, 500 nm (panels 1 and 3) or &#x000d7;15000; bar 200 nm (panel 2), respectively. The electron density of peroxisomes roughly reflects the amount of soluble matrix proteins inside the organelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Wanders1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Visser1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The particles with high density, visible in preparations from wild-type mice (panels 1 and 2, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005090-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), represent near intact peroxisomes filled with matrix proteins and surrounded by a single membrane (marked by an arrow on panel 2). The same preparations also contain peroxisomes with intermediate electron density (marked by asterisks on panel 1) as well as particles with low electron density (marked by arrow on panel 1) showing that some peroxisomes have been partially disrupted during isolation. The poor electron density of most of the particles in the peroxisomal fraction isolated from livers of Pxmp2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (panel 3, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005090-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) indicates leakage of soluble matrix proteins from the organelles, leading to formation of peroxisomal &#x0201c;ghosts.&#x0201d; (F) Effect of PEG1500 in the isolation medium on the leakage of enzymes from different organelles. The activity of the enzymes and protein content were measured in the cytosolic fraction and are presented as a percentage of the total amount in postnuclear homogenate which has been obtained using isolation medium containing 0.25 M sucrose (dark gray bars) or 0.16 M sucrose and 12&#x00025; (w/v) PEG1500 (light gray bars) as osmoprotectants (see legend to Figure S2B and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Wanders1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> for more details). HAOX: &#x0002a;P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.006, &#x0002a;&#x0002a;P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.00012; Catalase: &#x0002a;P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0005, &#x0002a;&#x0002a;P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.007. Note that PEG1500 decreases the leakage of the soluble matrix enzymes (HAOX, catalase) not only from wild-type peroxisomes but also from the Pxmp2-deficient particles. Moreover, in contrast to higher fragility of the Pxmp2-deficient peroxisomes relative to wild-type control when 0.25 M sucrose has been used as an osmoprotectant, the particles show the same level of fragility in the presence of PEG1500. However, the latency of urate oxidase was similar in peroxisomal preparations isolated with or without PEG1500 as an osmoprotectant in both groups, wild-type and Pxmp2-deficient mice. (G) Activity of L-&#x003b1;-hydroxyacid oxidase in fractions obtained after Nycodenz gradient centrifugation of the postnuclear homogenates prepared from livers of Pxmp2-deficient mice. The homogenization medium contained 0.25 M sucrose (light gray bars) or 0.16 M sucrose and 12&#x00025; (w/v) PEG1500 (dark gray bars). Recoveries of the enzyme were 110&#x00025; (sucrose) and 108&#x00025; (PEG1500), respectively. See legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005090-g001">Figure 1C</xref> for more details. Note decrease in the leakage of HAOX from peroxisomes when homogenates were prepared using PEG1500 as an osmoprotectant. (H) Immunodetection of peroxisomal thiolase in fractions obtained after Nycodenz gradient centrifugation of liver homogenates from Pxmp2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. The homogenates were prepared in the presence of 0.25 M sucrose (upper band) or 0.16 M sucrose and 12&#x00025; (w/v) PEG1500 (lower band) as osmoprotectants. See legend to Figure S2C for more details. (I,J) Illustration explaining an osmotic behavior of peroxisomes during isolation. I, Homogenization using an isolation medium containing an inappropriate osmoprotectant (e.g., sucrose is a very poor osmoprotectant for mammalian peroxisomes because it easily penetrates the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Wanders1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Palmieri1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>) leads to an abrupt dropin the concentration of solutes outside peroxisomes, provoking a flow of water into the particles and an outflow of solutes, the movement of water occurs by spontaneous diffusion across the phospholipids bilayer as well as through the channels; J-1, movement of water (small black circles) and solutes (large gray circles) in wild-type peroxisomes containing at least two types of channels, marked on the picture with single and double walls, respectively; J-2, The same picture as before, but one type of channels (with double walls) is missing. Note that outflow of solutes is restricted; J-3 Presence of PEG1500 prevents water to flow into the particles decreasing an osmotic pressure in peroxisomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005090.s009">Text S2</xref>).</p><p>(0.92 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005090.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005090.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Permeability of Pxmp2-deficient peroxisomal membrane to substrates of peroxisomal enzymes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. (A) Effect of Pxmp2 deletion on the latency of peroxisomal enzymes: L-&#x003b1;-hydroxyacid oxidase (HAOX), catalase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH). The last two enzymes are NADH-dependent. &#x0201c;Free&#x0201d; activity of the enzymes in peroxisomes isolated from wild-type (dark gray columns) and Pxmp2&#x02212;/&#x02212; (light gray columns) mouse livers is presented as a percentage of the &#x0201c;total&#x0201d; activity, &#x0002a;P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0001, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7&#x02013;8.

(B) Illustration explaining the mechanism of peroxisomal enzyme latency. Substrate (dark square) penetrating the membrane through the channel with velocity V1 is converted by the peroxisomal enzyme into the corresponding product (dark circle) with velocity V2. (C) Dependence of urate oxidase activity on substrate concentration. Activity of urate oxidase was measured in a purified peroxisomal fraction treated with 0.05&#x00025; (v/v) Triton X-100 to recover &#x0201c;total&#x0201d; activity of the enzyme. The concentration of uric acid was detected spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficient &#x003b5;292 nm&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7.6&#x000d7;103 M-1 cm-1.

(D) A Lineweaver-Burk plot was calculated using data points from Figure S3C. The results indicate that the dependence of urate oxidase activity on substrate concentration follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. (E) Samples of postnuclear homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted and stained with anti-urate oxidase antibodies (Santa-Cruz biotechnology). Note that the content of urate oxidase protein is similar in wild-type and Pxmp2-deficient mice. (F) Detection of oxalic acid in urine. Oxalic acid is the final product of glycolic acid oxidation. The metabolism of glycolic acid in mammals proceeds in cytoplasm with formation of oxalic acid and in peroxisomes with production of glycine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005090-Antonenkov2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. One can expect that restriction in access of glycolic acid to peroxisomes might cause elevated oxidation of this compound in cytoplasm, resulting in an increase in the production of oxalic acid. Wild-type (dark circle) and Pxmp2&#x02212;/&#x02212; (open circle) mice were injected with glycolic acid and excretion of oxalic acid in urine was measured. The absolute quantity of excreted oxalic acid was calculated as &#x000b5;moles in the total urine collected within 24 h per 100 g body mass (left panel). The urine was collected for 24 h before glycolate injection (1), for 24 h after injection (2) and from 24 h to 48 h after injection (3). The difference between the content of oxalic acid excreted in urine collected 24 h before and 24 h after the injection of glycolic acid is shown in the right panel. The difference was calculated for each mouse. &#x0002a;P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.035. The data for female mice are shown. Note that the levels of oxalic acid excreted before injection of glycolic acid were similar in both groups of mice. However, after injection of glycolic acid, a higher rate of oxalic acid excretion in Pmpx2-deficient mice, as compare to wild-type control, was detected. Measurements of the &#x0201c;total&#x0201d; activity of enzymes participating in oxidation of glycolic acid in peroxisomes (HAOX, alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase) or in cytoplasm (LDH) in liver homogenates did not reveal any difference between Pxmp2&#x02212;/&#x02212; and wild-type mice, respectively (data not shown).</p><p>(1.86 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005090.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005090.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Figure S4. Detection of channel-forming activity in insect cells. (A) Isolation of a Pxmp2-enriched membrane fraction from insect cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details). According to marker enzyme activity detection (see Figure S4B), the postmitochondrial particle fraction (PPF) was enriched with fragments of endoplasmic reticulum (microsomes) and (micro)peroxisomes. Samples from each fraction containing an equal amount of protein (40 &#x000b5;g) were subjected to SDS/PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against mouse Pxmp2. Control: mock transfected cells. (B) Characterization of subcellular fractions isolated from insect cells. Catalase, GDH, esterase, AP, and LDH were used as markers for (micro)peroxisomes, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and cytosol, respectively. Specific activities of the enzymes were measured in the corresponding fractions isolated from mock-transfected (dark gray columns) and Pxmp2-transfected (light gray columns) insect cells and are presented as percentage of activity in post-nuclear homogenates (100&#x00025;). Note that in addition to the marker for endoplasmic reticulum (esterase), the postmitochondrial particle fraction (PPF) shows a high catalase activity, implying that this fraction contains a significant amount of (micro)peroxisomes. The PPF also contains the highest concentration of recombinant Pxmp2 (see Figure S4A) and was used for detection of the pore-forming activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005090-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>).

The calibration curve was generated by plotting the log of the molecular mass of the standards versus mobility on the column. The molecular mass markers are: (1) catalase, 240 kDa; (2) lactate dehydrogenase, 140 kDa; (3) bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; (4) carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; and (5) cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa. The void volume was determined using Blue Dextran (2000 kDa), which was detected in fractions 1&#x02013;3. The mobility of the different forms of Pxmp2 are marked by arrows: (I) Pxmp2 partially purified in the presence of Genapol (see Figure S5B, upper panel); (II) partially purified Pxmp2 treated with DDM (see Figure S5B, lower panel); (III) Pxmp2 after thermal treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005090-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, lower panel) or after solubilization from the membrane using 2.0&#x00025; (w/v) SDS (blot not shown).

Traces of Pxmp2 visible in fraction 36 are apparently caused by retention of some molecules of denaturized protein on the column. (E) Cross-linking and immunoblot analysis of purified Pxmp2. The protein eluted from a SuperdexTM200 column was treated with ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate) (Sulfo-EGS, right lane). Control sample did not have cross-linker (left lane). The immunoreactive product of the cross-linking is marked by an asterisk. (F) Cross-linking of the His-tagged Pxmp2 protein. The expression of the His-tagged Pxmp2 was carried out using the BAC-TO-BACTM Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) and Sf9 insect cell line (A. Isomursu, unpublished data). The postmitochondrial particles fraction (PPF) was isolated and the proteins were solubilized with 0.5&#x00025; (v/v) Genapol X-080. The aliquots of the solubilized proteins (about 50 &#x000b5;g) were treated with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. DSS concentrations were: 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 mM (lanes 2,3,4,5). Control sample was without cross-linker (lane 1). After cross-linking, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-His-Tag antibodies (Novagen). It appears that application of these antibodies led to more valid results if compare with the anti-Pxmp2 antibodies which produced the only low signal with the cross-linked protein. Note that, similar to purified Pxmp2 (see Figure S5E), the cross-linking of the recombinant protein leads to appearance of molecules with the size (about 80 kDa) three times larger than the size of the His-tagged Pxmp2 protein (about 27 kDa). It is highly unlikely that the mouse recombinant Pxmp2 produces heteromers with the insect cell proteins. Therefore, the data support the notion that the Pxmp2 protein forms a homotrimer in the membrane.</p><p>(1.32 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005090.s005.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005090.s006"><label>Figure S6</label><caption><p>Electrophysiological analysis of purified Pxmp2.
