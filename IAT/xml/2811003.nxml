However, not all bacteria encode homologs of the well-studied <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA replication restart primosome proteins, suggesting that there might be distinct mechanistic differences among DNA replication restart pathways in diverse bacteria. Since reactivation of repaired DNA replication forks requires coordinated DNA and protein binding by DNA replication restart primosome proteins, we determined the crystal structure of <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB at 2.7 &#x000c5; resolution and investigated its ability to physically interact with DNA and PriA helicase. Comparison of the crystal structures of PriB from <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> reveals a well-conserved homodimeric structure consisting of two oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding (OB) folds. In spite of their overall structural similarity, there is significant species variation in the type and distribution of surface amino acid residues. This correlates with striking differences in the affinity with which each PriB homolog binds single-stranded DNA and PriA helicase. These results provide evidence that mechanisms of DNA replication restart are not identical across diverse species and that these pathways have likely become specialized to meet the needs of individual organisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Complete and faithful duplication of cellular genomes is essential for the propagation of life. Accordingly, the process of replicating the DNA genome has evolved to be remarkably efficient. For example, the replication machinery in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is capable of synthesizing new DNA at a rate of approximately 1000 nucleotides per second with remarkable fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This accomplishment is impressive considering the dynamic nature of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome. The replication machinery must share the DNA template with other factors, such as those involved in transcription, DNA repair and architectural maintenance. Furthermore, the DNA genome on which all of these factors operate is an imperfect template that is continually marred by DNA damage. Whether arising from the environment or from cellular metabolism, chemical damage to the DNA creates barriers that hinder the progression of the replication machinery (replisome), causing it to stall or dissociate altogether from the DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In order to survive, cells must be able to reactivate replisomes that are disrupted in this manner. In bacteria, this process is termed &#x0201c;DNA replication restart&#x0201d; and it is driven by a group of proteins called primosome proteins.</p><p>Reactivation of disrupted replisomes by DNA replication restart primosome proteins is mechanistically distinct from the initial loading of replisomes onto template DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). Initiation of DNA replication is normally restricted to a specific DNA sequence element called an origin of replication. However, advancing replisomes can encounter DNA damage at sites far removed from the origin of replication, so cells require an alternate means of reinitiating DNA replication at non-origin sequences where a replisome has been disrupted. This type of initiation of DNA replication requires recognition of specific DNA structures (such as branched, fork-like structures or D-loop recombination intermediates), as opposed to specific DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the primosome proteins that catalyze this process include PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT and Rep proteins.</p><p>A current model for DNA replication restart in <italic>E. coli</italic> involves stepwise assembly of primosome proteins onto DNA to form a nucleoprotein complex. First, PriA helicase binds to a repaired DNA replication fork. PriB binds to the PriA:DNA complex and stabilizes PriA on the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Interactions between PriB and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) result in stimulation of PriA&#x02019;s helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), which is thought to produce a tract of ssDNA onto which the replicative helicase, DnaB, can be reloaded. DnaT is recruited to the ternary PriA:PriB:DNA complex, possibly leading to release of ssDNA that had been bound by PriB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Recruitment and reloading of DnaB onto the template DNA results in reactivation of the repaired DNA replication fork, allowing DNA synthesis to resume.</p><p>While many studies have focused on DNA replication restart pathways in <italic>E. coli</italic>, relatively little is known of the mechanistic underpinnings and biological importance of DNA replication restart in other bacterial species. Given the broad conservation of <italic>priA</italic> genes among sequenced prokaryotic genomes, it is likely that the general importance of DNA replication restart pathways extends throughout much of the bacterial world. However, many prokaryotic genomes do not harbor the full complement of DNA replication restart primosome genes found in <italic>E. coli</italic>, suggesting that mechanistic details of DNA replication restart, its regulation, and the extent to which cells rely upon it for growth and survival probably vary greatly among diverse bacterial species.</p><p><italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, the causative agent of gonorrhea, provides a prime example of how DNA replication restart pathways in some bacterial species might differ significantly from those of the well-studied <italic>E. coli</italic> model organism. <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> is a gram-negative bacterium that is highly adapted to survive oxidative damage to its genome incurred by neutrophil attack in infected individuals, suggesting that DNA replication restart pathways might play an expanded and essential role in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). PriA has been shown to play a critical role in DNA repair in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and contributes to the ability of this bacterium to resist the toxic effects of oxidative damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Furthermore, PriA has been identified as an important virulence determinant in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, in which it is important for promoting cell growth and resisting oxidative injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Clearly, a direct link exists between the function of DNA replication restart pathways in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species and bacterial growth and survival.</p><p>Curiously, while <italic>Neisseria</italic> species encode homologs of <italic>priA</italic> and <italic>priB</italic>, they lack recognizable homologs of <italic>priC</italic> and <italic>dnaT</italic>. This suggests that there might be distinct mechanistic differences between DNA replication restart pathways in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species compared to those that operate in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In this study, we examined the mechanistic underpinnings of DNA replication restart in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> by solving the crystal structure of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB and investigating its DNA-binding and PriA-binding activities. Comparison of the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB homologs reveals differences in their structure and function that could translate into different mechanisms of DNA replication restart in these diverse bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning <italic>priA</italic> and <italic>priB</italic> variants</title><p>The <italic>priA</italic> gene of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> was amplified from strain FA1090 genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers oML172 (5&#x02032;-GCG TAT TCC ATA TGA TCT ACC ATC GCA TCG CTG TA) and oML173 (5&#x02032;-GTC ACG GAT CCT CAA GCC TCC TGC GGA TCG AC).

However, examination of the crystal structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB reveals that the positions of many of the amino acid residues that are important for binding ssDNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB correspond to basic amino acid residues in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB that could presumably facilitate physical interactions with ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, while these ssDNA-binding amino acid residues have not been well conserved in the primary sequences of these proteins, they appear to have been positionally conserved at the level of protein structure. This led us to hypothesize that the most likely location of the ssDNA-binding site on <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB lies along the L<sub>45</sub> loops and adjacent &#x003b2; strands and includes amino acid residues such as K15, R20, K34, R55, K81, R83, R84 and R91.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we generated single alanine-substitution mutants of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae priB</italic> and tested the ability of the PriB variants to interact with ssDNA using fluorescence polarization spectroscopy. As expected, substituting basic amino acid residues that map to the classic ligand-binding surface of PriB&#x02019;s OB folds for alanine results in PriB variants that show significant defects in their ssDNA-binding activity. PriB variants K34A and K81A produce increases in fluorescence anisotropy of a 36-base fluoro-ssDNA oligonucleotide only at high concentrations of protein and the interactions do not saturate even at high concentrations of PriB, precluding determination of an apparent dissociation constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These variants migrate through a size exclusion chromatography column in a manner nearly identical to wild type PriB, suggesting that substitution of these surface residues with alanine does not perturb the overall structure of the PriB variants (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that amino acid residues K34 and K81 make important contributions to ssDNA binding. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Identification of PriB&#x02019;s binding site for ssDNA.

This aromatic amino acid residue occupies a position in the crystal structure of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB that is not conserved with a ssDNA-binding residue of <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB but is otherwise in close proximity to the presumed ssDNA-binding site. The Y21A PriB variant shows a modest defect in ssDNA binding relative to wild type <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The apparent dissociation constant for the Y21A PriB variant is 641 &#x000b1; 41 nM, indicating that this variant interacts with ssDNA only 1.3-fold weaker compared to wild type PriB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that amino acid residue Y21 does not likely make significant contributions to ssDNA binding under these conditions. Overall, these observations support the hypothesis that <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB binds ssDNA at the classic ligand-binding surface of its OB folds and likely utilizes a mechanism of ssDNA binding that is similar to that used by <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB.</p><p>While amino acid residues located on the classic ligand-binding surface of PriB&#x02019;s OB folds appear to be involved in binding ssDNA, we sought to examine the effects of substituting amino acid residue E41 for alanine. Amino acid residue E41 is virtually invariant among known PriB homologs, suggesting that it has an important and well-conserved function. The analogous amino acid residue in <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB, E39, is important for interactions with PriA but does not appear to be involved in binding ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The E39A <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB variant has a 2.4-fold higher affinity for ssDNA than wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB, likely due to eliminating charge repulsion forces between the glutamate side chain and the negatively charged backbone of ssDNA. Likewise, we observed that the E41A <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB variant has a higher affinity for ssDNA than wild type <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The apparent dissociation constant for the E41A <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB variant is 139 &#x000b1; 26 nM, a 3.4-fold increase in affinity relative to wild type <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). It is likely that the E41 residue of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB plays a role similar to that of the E39 residue of <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB.</p></sec><sec><title>Conservation of the putative PriA-binding pocket</title><p>Given the relatively large number of PriB homologs whose genes have been sequenced to date, we analyzed the surface of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB for regions where amino acid residues have been well-conserved throughout evolution. A solvent-accessible surface map of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB that is colored according to amino acid sequence variability reveals two prominent, well-conserved surface patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). One of these patches includes two notable structural features. One feature is a type II &#x003b2; turn that creates a sharp bend in the polypeptide backbone between the &#x003b2;1&#x02032; and &#x003b2;2 strands. The proline and glycine residues that give rise to this hairpin are commonly found in this type of structural element because they help facilitate the 180&#x000b0; reversal of the polypeptide backbone. Hence, the high degree of conservation of the amino acid residues in this region of PriB is likely due to architectural maintenance of the &#x003b2;-barrel. The second feature of this well-conserved surface patch is amino acid residue R20. This basic amino acid residue is positioned on the classic ligand-binding surface of PriB&#x02019;s OB folds and is likely well-conserved because of its ability to facilitate interactions with ssDNA. Consistent with this interpretation, the analogous residue in <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB, K18, appears to make direct contacts with ssDNA in the crystal structure of an <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB:ssDNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>The second well-conserved surface patch on PriB lies in a shallow pocket between the two monomers of the PriB homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the physical interaction between PriA and PriB has been partially mapped to this shallow pocket and two amino acid residues that map to this region, R44 and E39, form an ion pair and have been shown to play important roles in the <italic>E. coli</italic> PriA:PriB interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB encodes a glutamate residue, E41, that is positionally conserved with the E39 residue of <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB and we hypothesize that this residue likely plays a role in interactions with PriA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). At the position analogous to that of residue R44 of <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB lies residue C46 in the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB homolog. However, there are two arginine residues, R55 and R91, positioned near residue C46 in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB that might serve the same role as R44 of <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Thus, the architecture of this shallow pocket appears to have been remodeled in the time since <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> shared a common ancestor. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Potential PriA-binding site on PriB.

However, the physical interaction between <italic>E. coli</italic> PriA and PriB is weak in the absence of DNA, precluding determination of a binding constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). To determine if <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA and PriB form a complex and ascertain what effect the remodeled PriA-binding site might have on PriA:PriB interactions, we performed pulldown experiments using His-tagged <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA and tagless <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB to probe for a direct, physical interaction between the two proteins. If PriA and PriB physically interact in a manner that is dependent upon the presence of appropriate DNA substrates, there should be little tagless PriB associated with His-tagged PriA in the pulldown experiment unless DNA is included in the binding reaction. Contrary to expectations, we observed a significant amount of tagless PriB associating with His-tagged PriA in the pulldown experiment that does not require addition of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). This suggests that <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA and PriB form a stable complex in the absence of DNA.</p><p>To measure the affinity of the PriA:PriB interaction, we labeled <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and measured the fluorescence anisotropy of FITC&#x02013;PriB in the presence and absence of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA. If the two proteins form a stable complex, a PriA-dependent increase in FITC&#x02013;PriB fluorescence anisotropy should be observed due to the greater mass of the PriA:FITC&#x02013;PriB complex relative to unbound FITC&#x02013;PriB. When <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA protein was serially diluted and incubated with a fixed concentration of FITC&#x02013;PriB, we observed a <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA-dependent increase in FITC&#x02013;PriB fluorescence anisotropy that is saturable with 1&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;M <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The apparent dissociation constant is 137 &#x000b1; 16 nM, indicating that a robust PriA:FITC-PriB complex forms under these conditions. Furthermore, the interaction between <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA and FITC-PriB is not affected by the presence of 0.1 g/l DNaseI or 0.1 g/l RNaseA, indicating that the affinity of the interaction is not being augmented by trace levels of nucleic acids that might be contaminating the protein preparations (data not shown). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>PriA and PriB interact with high affinity.

However, there is significant variation in the surface properties of the two PriB homologs that correlates with dramatically different DNA-binding and PriA-binding activities: <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB has a high affinity interaction with ssDNA and a low affinity interaction with <italic>E. coli</italic> PriA, while <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB has a low affinity interaction with ssDNA and a high affinity interaction with <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA. While the biological consequences of this affinity reversal are unknown with respect to the function of DNA replication restart pathways, our results, coupled with the apparent lack of <italic>priC</italic> and <italic>dnaT</italic> genes in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, suggest that significant mechanistic differences might exist between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> DNA replication restart pathways.</p><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the ssDNA-binding activity of PriB is thought to be important for stabilizing PriA on DNA and for enhancing its helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The PriA-stabilizing effect is likely due to increased binding energy made available within a ternary PriA:PriB:DNA complex, while helicase activity enhancement is probably attributed to PriB&#x02019;s ability to bind the ssDNA products of PriA-mediated duplex DNA unwinding. Indeed, when surface residues of <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB that are important for ssDNA binding are substituted for alanine, the mutated PriB variants interact with ssDNA with lower affinity than wild type PriB and lose their ability to enhance PriA&#x02019;s DNA-binding and unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). This suggests that the affinity of <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB for ssDNA is well-tuned to its function in <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA replication restart pathways.</p><p>It is unknown if <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB is capable of stabilizing <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA on DNA and enhancing its helicase activity. Given the low affinity with which <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB interacts with ssDNA, it is possible that <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB does not enhance PriA activity in a manner analogous to the <italic>E. coli</italic> model system. On the other hand, the low affinity with which <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriB binds ssDNA might be compensated for by the high affinity with which it binds PriA, thereby producing a stable PriA:PriB:DNA ternary complex analogous to the <italic>E. coli</italic> PriA:PriB:DNA ternary complex. If the overall stability of the PriA:PriB:DNA ternary complex is equivalent between the two species, what might be the advantage of tuning the affinities with which individual components interact with one another? One possible explanation for the high affinity interaction between <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PriA and PriB is that it could allow <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> cells to respond more quickly to disruptions in DNA replication by maintaining pre-formed PriA:PriB complexes. This could presumably benefit an organism such as <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> whose natural habitat is replete with DNA damaging agents. Furthermore, since there is evidence that <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaT functions to dissociate ssDNA from <italic>E. coli</italic> PriB, perhaps to facilitate DnaB loading onto the template DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), an organism that lacks DnaT might require its PriB homolog to have a lower affinity for ssDNA to allow for dissociation of ssDNA from PriB without assistance. Further experimentation will be required to address these questions.</p></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBER</title><p>3K8A.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>University of Dayton Research Council (3782350005 to M.E.L.); University of Dayton Graduate School (J.D.); University of Dayton Department of Chemistry (K.L.D.).
