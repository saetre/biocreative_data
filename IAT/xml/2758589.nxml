Staphylococcal &#x003b1;-hemolysin is an essential virulence factor in mouse models of CA-MRSA necrotizing pneumonia. <italic>S. aureus</italic> &#x003b1;-hemolysin has long been known to induce inflammatory signaling and cell death in host organisms, however the mechanism underlying these signaling events were not well understood. Using highly purified recombinant &#x003b1;-hemolysin, we now demonstrate that &#x003b1;-hemolysin activates the Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing gene family, pyrin domain containing 3 protein (NLRP3)-inflammasome, a host inflammatory signaling complex involved in responses to pathogens and endogenous danger signals. Non-cytolytic mutant &#x003b1;-hemolysin molecules fail to elicit NLRP3-inflammasome signaling, demonstrating that the responses are not due to non-specific activation of this innate immune signaling system by bacterially derived proteins. In monocyte-derived cells from humans and mice, inflammasome assembly in response to &#x003b1;-hemolysin results in activation of the cysteine proteinase, caspase-1. We also show that inflammasome activation by &#x003b1;-hemolysin works in conjunction with signaling by other CA-MRSA-derived Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) to induce secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18. Additionally, &#x003b1;-hemolysin induces cell death in these cells through an NLRP3-dependent program of cellular necrosis, resulting in the release of endogenous pro-inflammatory molecules, like the chromatin-associated protein, High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). These studies link the activity of a major <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence factor to a specific host signaling pathway. The cellular events linked to inflammasome activity have clear relevance to the disease processes associated with CA-MRSA including tissue necrosis and inflammation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>CA-MRSA is the most commonly identified cause of skin infections seen in emergency rooms in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Moran1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

We sought to determine whether we could see similar induction of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion by &#x003b1;-hemolysin in THP-1 cells, a human monocyte-derived cell line. Commercial preparations of &#x003b1;-hemolysin are relatively crude, with manufacturers reporting &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of preparations being protein and the homogeneity of the protein present not reported. In order to study &#x003b1;-hemolysin-induced inflammatory signaling we sought to prepare highly purified <italic>S. aureus</italic> &#x003b1;-hemolysin. Recombinant &#x003b1;-hemolysin bearing a hexa-histidine-tag was prepared after expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The recombinant &#x003b1;-hemolysin was isolated from crude <italic>E. coli</italic> homogenates using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. In order to eliminate the possibility of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS contamination of our preparation, the protein was washed extensively in pyrogen free buffers. After elution, the recombinant protein was exchanged into pyrogen free phosphate buffed saline using size exclusion chromatography. The resulting recombinant &#x003b1;-hemolysin runs as a single homogenous protein band on Coomasie Blue stained SDS PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). This protein is immunoreactive with multiple anti-&#x003b1;- hemolysin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

In order to confirm that the ability to activate IL-1&#x003b2; secretion depended on functional &#x003b1;-hemolysin, and not a contaminating substance in the preparation, we prepared an inactive mutant of &#x003b1;-hemolysin (H35L) that lacks hemolytic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-BubeckWardenburg3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The mutant &#x003b1;-hemolysin was highly purified, just as the wild-type preparation, yet failed to elicit IL-1&#x003b2; secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g001">Fig. 1A, B, &#x00026; C</xref>). A monoclonal antibody that neutralizes &#x003b1;-hemolysin activity and has been shown to protect mice from <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia also reduced IL-1&#x003b2; secretion induced by &#x003b1;-hemolysin when preincubated with the toxin prior to treatment of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Ragle1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to demonstrate that &#x003b1;-hemolysin was inducing IL-1&#x003b2; secretion through activation of caspase-1, caspase-1 activation was assessed by immunoblot analysis for the p10 subunit of active caspase-1 after THP-1 cells were treated with wild type or H35L mutant &#x003b1;-hemolysin.

Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates treated with HKSA, &#x003b1;-hemolysin, or both demonstrated that HKSA did indeed induce production of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; while &#x003b1; hemolysin alone did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Processing of IL-1&#x003b2;, reflected by reduced pro-IL-1&#x003b2; levels and detectable secreted processed IL-1&#x003b2;, could only be detected by immunoblot in the HKSA-primed, &#x003b1;-hemolysin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>).

We tested whether &#x003b1;-hemolysin treatment also led to the secretion of IL-18, another caspase-1 processed cytokine. As expected, control THP-1 cells secreted IL-18 in response to &#x003b1;-hemolysin. Like IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, IL-18 secretion was also enhanced by pretreatment with HKSA. THP-1 cells lacking either NLRP3 or ASC expression failed to secrete significant levels of IL-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The activation of caspase-1 could be also be detected in THP-1 cells treated with &#x003b1;-hemolysin using immunoblot analysis for the active p10 subunit of caspase-1 in the absence of HKSA-priming.

Activation of NLRP3 by &#x003b1;-hemolysin induces cytokine processing and programmed necrosis, both of which can explain many of the pro-inflammatory properties of &#x003b1;-hemolysin that have been observed in the past. In fact, these studies identify the mechanism by which &#x003b1;-hemolysin induces IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, an observation that was published almost twenty years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Bhakdi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the initial report of <italic>S. aureus</italic> activating NLRP3-mediated IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, Mariathasan <italic>et. al</italic>. found that <italic>S. aureus</italic> lacking &#x003b1;-hemolysin, &#x003b2;-hemolysin, or &#x003b3;- hemolysin still activated IL-1&#x003b2; secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Mariathasan1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings using purified toxin clearly demonstrate that NLRP3 is activated by &#x003b1;-hemolysin. Because bone marrow derived macrophages do not respond robustly to &#x003b1;-hemolysin in our studies, the findings of Mariathasan <italic>et al</italic>. are not surprising. Additionally, given the large number of pore-forming and membrane disrupting toxins produced by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, it seems likely <italic>S. aureus</italic> may have redundant factors that activate NLRP3-signaling. Supporting this possibility, we have found that other pore-forming <italic>S. aureus</italic> toxins (particularly Panton Valentine Leukocidin) also induce NLRP3-dependent cytolysis (data not shown). Since some of these toxins exert differential cytolytic activity based on cell type, the ability to activate NLRP3-mediated signaling may be important in establishing infection in a variety of infection sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Bhakdi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The ability of &#x003b1;-hemolysin to activate programmed cell death in host cells has been the subject of numerous studies. In early studies, &#x003b1;-hemolysin was shown to activate apoptotic machinery in studies carried out primarily in lympocyte derived cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Bantel1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. This report demonstrated that apoptotic caspases were activated and down stream apoptotic effects were observed, including cleavage of &#x003b1;-fodrin and intranucleosomal DNA cleavage. However, these effects were studied at times between 4 and 24 hours. A second report by this group later demonstrated that &#x003b1;-hemolysin induced cell death, as measured by loss of membrane integrity, occurred even if apoptotic machinery was inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Essmann1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, they demonstrated that &#x003b1;-hemolysin induced death was accompanied by morphologic features of necrosis and release of HMGB1 into the culture supernatant. We now show that pyronecrosis is activated very rapidly by &#x003b1;-hemolysin, in a timeframe earlier than has previously been characterized for &#x003b1; hemolyin-induced death and with features consistent with these other reports. Namely, we report &#x003b1;-hemolysin induced death is independent of caspase-activation, has morphologic features of necrosis, and is accompanied by early release of HMGB1. Interestingly, when taken out to 16 hours, we did observe some cells with sub-G1 DNA content, which may represent activation of apoptotic machinery in cells from the population that resisted activation of pyronecrosis. Overall, we have demonstrated that, in monocytic cells, activation NLRP3-dependent pyronecrosis by &#x003b1;-hemolysin is the primary mechanism underlying the cytolytic activity of the toxin.</p><p>The activation of host NLRP3 by &#x003b1;-hemolysin requires the hemolytic activity of the toxin. Our data demonstrates that mutations in the toxin that eliminate hemolytic activity also eliminate the toxin's cytolytic activity in monocyte derived cells and ability to induce NLRP3-inflammasome signaling. A recent study of a similar &#x003b1;-hemolysin mutant demonstrates that this mutant toxin is capable of inducing an apoptotic host response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Srivastava1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Our experiments also demonstrate that although mutant &#x003b1;-hemolysin does not induce NLRP3-dependent IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, it does induce cell death with a time delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). We suspect that this death may represent apoptotic death observed by others using mutant &#x003b1;-hemolysin, though formal demonstration of this requires further investigation. Interestingly, this mutation also renders the toxin incapable of causing death in animal models of &#x003b1;-hemolysin induced peritonitis, presumably due to reduced activation of inflammatory signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Menzies1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. The &#x003b1;-hemolysin gene, <italic>Hla</italic>, is a critical virulence factor in cellulitis, mastitits, and pneumonia models of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Bramley1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Patel1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. We speculate that activation of inflammatory signaling through the inflammasome may be essential for &#x003b1; -hemolysin to mediate virulence. In support of this hypothesis, &#x003b1;-hemolysin deficient <italic>S. aureus</italic> fail to establish lethal infection or induce significant pulmonary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-BubeckWardenburg1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-BubeckWardenburg2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, immunization with mutant &#x003b1;-hemolysin protects mice from <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia and reduces IL-1&#x003b2; production in the lungs of the challenged mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-BubeckWardenburg3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we have now shown a monoclonal antibody, which is protective against <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia in passive immunization studies of mice, inhibits NLRP3-mediated signaling in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007446-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007446-Ragle1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It is certainly possible that host inflammatory responses and programmed necrosis could damage host tissue architecture and compromise the innate capacity of these tissues to resist infection. Further experimentation is clearly required to determine the role of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in the pathogenesis of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.
