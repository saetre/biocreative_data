TFIIF of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contains a small subunit, designated Tfg3, in addition to two conserved subunits, TFIIF&#x003b1; (Tfg1) and TFIIF&#x003b2; (Tfg2). In this study, we characterized Tfg3 of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Using Tfg3 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), we found that Tfg3 is located in nuclei, and it is assembled into the C-terminal domain phosphatase (Fcp1)&#x0002f;TFIIF&#x0002f;pol II complex via interactions with TFIIF&#x003b1; and TFIIF&#x003b2;. As in the case of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Tfg3 in <italic>S.pombe</italic> forms part of another GTF, namely TFIID. The TFIID complex isolated from <italic>S.pombe</italic> that had been cultured at elevated temperatures included increased levels of Tfg3. The interaction of recombinant Tfg3 with TATA-binding protein (TBP), the central subunit of TFIID, was temperature-dependent. Moreover, a mutant of <italic>S.pombe</italic> that lacked the gene for Tfg3 was sensitive to a battery of stresses including temperature up-shift. Starting from a mutant with <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation, we isolated five species of multicopy suppressors. Expression levels of the suppressor genes were lower in the mutant cell than in wild-type cell at an elevated temperature. Taken together, we propose that Tfg3 is involved in transcriptional regulation under stress conditions, in particular, at high temperatures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The transcription factor TFIIF, which consists of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits, was originally isolated from mammalian cells as the pol II-associating proteins, RAP74 and RAP30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c1">1</xref>), and it was characterized as a member of GTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c2">2</xref>). TFIIF was also purified from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as transcription factor g, which, in contrast, has three subunits: Tfg1, Tfg2 and Tfg3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c3">3</xref>). The two larger subunits, Tfg1 and Tfg2, are homologs of human TFIIF&#x003b1; and TFIIF&#x003b2;, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c4">4</xref>). Although Tfg3 resembles the human leukemogenic proteins ENL and AF-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c5">5</xref>), these latter proteins are not GTFs. To date, no counterpart of Tfg3 has been found in mammalian cells. The primary function of TFIIF is the recruitment of pol II to a promoter, leading to generate a preinitiation complex (PIC). In the sequential model of PIC assembly, the TFIID&#x0002f;TFIIA&#x0002f;TFIIB complex is first formed on a promoter and thereafter the pol II&#x0002f;TFIIF complex is recruited to this preformed PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c6">6</xref>); finally, TFIIE and TFIIH associate to form the complete PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c8">8</xref>). A recently proposed alternative model suggests that TFIIF is incorporated into the pol II holoenzyme, which then binds to a promoter as a preassembled complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c10">10</xref>). In addition, TFIIF has been suggested to function as an elongation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c11">11</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, we isolated another TFIIF complex from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which contained Fcp1 and pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c12">12</xref>). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II consists of heptapeptide repeats, which undergo reversible phosphorylation throughout the transcription cycle. The enzyme Fcp1 has been identified as the CTD-phosphatase. Thus, this Fcp1&#x0002f;TFIIF&#x0002f;pol II complex was considered to represent a complex for CTD dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c12">12</xref>). In this complex, TFIIF might play a regulatory role for enhancement of the Fcp1&#x02013;pol II interaction by binding to both pol II and Fcp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c13">13</xref>). In this ternary complex, we identified an <italic>S.pombe</italic> homolog of Tfg3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c12">12</xref>). In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Tfg3 is included in three types of the transcription complex, i.e. TFIID with core promoter-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c4">4</xref>), the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI&#x0002f;SNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c5">5</xref>) and the nucleosomal histone-acetyltransferase complex NuA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c14">14</xref>). The <italic>TFG3</italic> gene was originally isolated as the actin non-complementing gene <italic>ANC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c15">15</xref>). However, little is known about the functions of Tfg3 in these various complexes. We have performed a detailed characterization of Tfg3 in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and the results herein described suggest that Tfg3 is involved in the regulation of transcription under stress conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains of <italic>S.pombe</italic></title><p>Strains JY741 (<italic>h</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1</italic>) and JY746 (<italic>h</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><italic>ade6-M210 ura4-D18 leu1</italic>) were the parental strains used in this study. For the genetic manipulations, we used standard methods and media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c17">17</xref>). Strain JY741&#x0002f;f-rpb3 was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c12">12</xref>). Strains JY741&#x0002f;f-tfg3 and JY741&#x0002f;gfp-tfg3 were constructed by two-step gene replacement, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c18">18</xref>), by transforming JY741 cells with pUC-ftfg3-ura4 and pUC-GFPtfg3-ura4, respectively, after digestion of plasmids with XhoI. To construct strain JY741&#x0002f;tfg3::ura4, we digested pBS-tfg3::ura4 with NdeI and SalI, and introduced the fragment into JY741. Strain JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394; was generated by growing JY741&#x0002f;tfg3::ura4 cells on a plate prepared with 5-fluoroorotic acid. Strain JY741&#x0002f;tfg3::LEU2 was constructed by transforming JY741 with a PCR-amplified DNA fragment that corresponded to nucleotide (nt) &#x02212;895 to nt &#x0002b;2062 of the <italic>tfg3</italic> sequence in pBS-tfg3::LEU2. To generate the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;<italic>tfg3::ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> diploid strain, we used pBS-tfg3::ura4, digested with NdeI and SalI, for transformation of a diploid strain generated by mating JY741 and JY746. The designations of all the strains we constructed here were confirmed by PCR and Southern-blotting. Derivatives of JY741 that expressed FLAG-TAF72 and FLAG-TAF73 were a gift from Dr H.

Plasmid pET-GSTtfg3 is a derivative of pET21b (Novagen) that encodes a glutathione S-transferase (GST)&#x02013;Tfg3 fusion protein between the NheI and XhoI sites of pET21b. Plasmid pET&#x02013;GST&#x02013;TFIIF&#x003b2;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-H is a derivative of pET21b that encodes the GST&#x02013;TFIIF&#x003b2; fusion protein under control of a T7 promoter, an internal T7 promoter and TFIIF&#x003b1; between the NheI and XhoI sites of pET21b. The expressed TFIIF&#x003b1; protein (TFIIF&#x003b1;-H) carries a C-terminal hexahistidine (His<sub>6</sub>)-tag.

The cDNA inserts encoding TBP and TFIIB were cloned by PCR from an <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA library. Plasmid pET-TFIIA&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;-H was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified cDNA that encoded the large subunit of TFIIA between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET21b for expression of a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tagged protein (TFIIA&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;-H).

Plasmid pET-fcp1-H which encodes C-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Fcp1 (Fcp1-H) was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c12">12</xref>).

As in the case of GFP&#x02013;Rpb1 (pol II subunit 1) and GFP&#x02013;Rpb3 (pol II subunit 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c21">21</xref>), GFP&#x02013;Tfg3 was localized in the nucleoplasm but not in the nucleolus or the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>A). This observation agrees with the prediction that Tfg3 functions in nucleosomes as a part of the transcriptional machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>Tfg3 is a subunit of TFIIF</title><p>Mammalian TFIIF consists of two subunit components, TFIIF&#x003b1; and TFIIF&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c2">2</xref>). In contrast, TFIIF of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> is composed of three components, Tfg1 (TFIIF&#x003b1; homolog), Tfg2 (TFIIF&#x003b2; homolog) and Tfg3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c4">4</xref>). To determine the molecular composition of TFIIF in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, we examined the binding of Tfg3 to a TFIIF&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2; binary complex in a GST pull-down assay. We incubated Tfg3 with His<sub>6</sub>-tag at the C-terminus (Tfg3-H) with either the GST&#x02013;Tfg3 fusion protein or the GST&#x02013;TFIIF&#x003b2;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-H complex that contained a GST-fused (at the N-terminus) &#x003b2; subunit and a His<sub>6</sub>-tagged (at the C-terminus) &#x003b1; subunit. We found that Tfg3-H bound to GST&#x02013;Tfg3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f1">1</xref>C), which suggested the formation of dimers (or oligomers) of Tfg3-H and GST&#x02013;Tfg3. Tfg3-H also bound to the GST&#x02013;TFIIF&#x003b2;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-H complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f1">1</xref>C). Since the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain had a <italic>ts</italic> phenotype (see below), we examined the dimerization of Tfg3 and the formation of a complex between Tfg3 and TFIIF&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2; at various temperatures. At all temperatures tested, Tfg3-H bound to GST&#x02013;Tfg3 and to GST&#x02013;TFIIF&#x003b2;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-H. The binding of Tfg3-H to GST&#x02013;Tfg3 was limited (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f1">1</xref>C), perhaps because both the GST&#x02013;Tfg3 and the Tfg3-H formed dimers prior to mixing. To examine this possibility, we mixed Tfg3-H and GST&#x02013;Tfg3 together and treated the mixture with guanidine hydrochloride. After dialysis to remove guanidine hydrochloride, we found that more Tfg3-H formed complexes with GST&#x02013;Tfg3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f1">1</xref>D), confirming our hypothesis that Tfg3 forms dimers or multimers. Our observations indicated that Tfg3 is a component of TFIIF in <italic>S.pombe</italic> as it is in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation is associated with thermo-sensitive phenotype</title><p>To determine whether <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is an essential gene, we constructed a diploid strain in which one copy of <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was replaced by a <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker gene. The <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;<italic>tfg3::ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> diploid strain was induced to sporulate, and tetrads were dissected on a YE (&#x0002b;Ade &#x0002b;Ura) plate. Four spores from each tetrad grew (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>B) and each tetrad contained two Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and two Ura<sup>&#x02212;</sup> spores (data not shown), indicating that <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was nonessential for cell growth under the conditions employed. In order to investigate the phenotype of <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutants, we constructed two haploid strains: JY741&#x0002f;tfg3::ura4, in which <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was disrupted by <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; and JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394;, with the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker removed. Then we examined viability at various temperatures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>C). At 30&#x000b0;C, JY741&#x0002f;tfg3::ura4 grew faster than the parental strain JY741, presumably as a result of addition of the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene. At 38&#x000b0;C, however, the growth rate of both JY741&#x0002f;tfg3::ura4 and JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394; was significantly reduced than JY741, and only small-sized colonies were detected after prolonged incubation, indicating that <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was essential for cell growth at elevated temperatures.</p><p>We also examined the effects of overexpression of Tfg3 by expressing it on the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> background via a multicopy plasmid in which the gene was under the control of a thiamine-repressible promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>D). Although no change was observed in cell morphology after the over-expression of Tfg3, it inhibited cell growth at both 30 and 38&#x000b0;C. These observations together suggested that the intracellular concentration of Tfg3 must be maintained at some optimum level for maximum growth. To examine our hypothesis, we expressed Tfg3 at various levels on the <italic>tfg3</italic>&#x00394; background and monitored cell growth at 30 and 38&#x000b0;C. Confirming the results noted above, the basal-level expression of Tfg3 suppressed the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>F) better than induced-level expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>E). Since the expression level of Tfg3 seemed to be critical for cell growth, we measured the intracellular level of Tfg3 directly, by quantitative western-blotting, in an exponential-phase culture of the parental strain JY741 that had been grown in YE medium at 30&#x000b0;C. As summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh1000tb1">1</xref>, we found a total of &#x0223c;20 000 molecules of Tfg3 in a single cell of <italic>S.pombe</italic>, which, according to our previous calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c21">21</xref>), contains &#x0223c;10 000 molecules of pol II and &#x0223c;3500 molecules of Fcp1.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation is associated with other stress-sensitive phenotypes</title><p>Next, we examined the growth of <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains under osmotic stress.

In contrast, <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were able to grow (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>G). We obtained essentially the same results when <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains were grown on a plate that contained 2 M glucose (data not shown). We also examined the sensitivity of <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant to a heavy metal. When strains JY741 and JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394; were streaked on a plate that contained 0.5 mM CdSO<sub>4</sub>, only JY741 grew (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>H), and when liquid cultures of these strains were exposed to various concentrations of CdSO<sub>4</sub>, the mutant survived less than the wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>I). In an experiment that the cultures of these strains were exposed to oxidative-stress, JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394; showed slightly higher sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than JY741 (data not shown).

We found that Tfg3 formed stable complexes with TBP and that the TBP&#x02013;Tfg3 interaction was clearly temperature-dependent, with the affinity being higher at higher temperatures. To examine the association <italic>in vivo</italic> of cellular Tfg3 with TFIID at various temperatures, we isolated TFIID from strains of <italic>S.pombe</italic> that contained the gene for FLAG-tagged Taf72 or Taf73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c19">19</xref>) using FLAG-specific antibody-conjugated resin. In agreement with our results <italic>in vitro</italic> (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f3">3</xref>A), the isolated TFIID was associated with more Tfg3 when cells had been grown at a higher temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f3">3</xref>C), even though the intracellular level of Tfg3 decreased in cells grown at the higher temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f3">3</xref>B).

We found that GST&#x02013;TFIIF&#x003b2;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-H formed complexes with His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Fcp1 (Fcp1-H) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f4">4</xref>A) and with FLAG-tagged pol II (f-pol II) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f4">4</xref>B) but, under the same conditions, neither Fcp1-H (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f4">4</xref>A) nor f-pol II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f4">4</xref>B) formed stable complexes with GST&#x02013;Tfg3. Neither the Tfg3&#x02013;Fcp1 nor the Tfg3&#x02013;pol II interaction was detected at higher or lower temperatures (data not shown). These observations indicate that Tfg3 is assembled into the Fcp1&#x0002f;TFIIF&#x0002f;pol II complex through molecular interactions with TFIIF&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;, but not with Fcp1 or pol II.</p><p>It has been reported that TFIIF interacts with TFIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c24">24</xref>) and with TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c26">26</xref>). We examined possible direct interactions of <italic>S.pombe</italic> Tfg3 with TFIIA and TFIIB by GST-pull-down assays. GST&#x02013;Tfg3 did not bind to the recombinant large subunit of TFIIA, namely TFIIA&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;, whereas GST&#x02013;TFIIF&#x003b2;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-H formed a stable complex with TFIIA&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f4">4</xref>C).

Thus, it appeared that TFIIF associated with TFIIA via &#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2; subunits, while both TFIIF&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2; and Tfg3 interacted with TFIIB.</p></sec><sec><title>Multicopy suppressors of the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype associated with the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation suggest a function for Tfg3</title><p>We isolated five species of multicopy plasmids that encoded suppressors of the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype associated with the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation from an <italic>S.pombe</italic> genomic library (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f5">5</xref>A and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh1000tb2">2</xref>; see also Materials and Methods). SPCC1529.01 is a putative gene, whose identity was inferred from homology to the gene for a multidrug efflux transporter. SPBC3B8.09 encodes a homolog of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Sas10, whose overproduction disrupts chromatin silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c27">27</xref>). SPAC25H1.02 encodes a JmjC domain-containing protein. It has been proposed that proteins with the JmjC domain participate in transcriptional regulation by modulating the structure of the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c29">29</xref>). SPBC1734.11 encodes a protein similar to heat-inducible molecular chaperone Ydj1 (Mas5) of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, which is a homolog of DnaJ of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c31">31</xref>). SPAC30D11.13 encodes Hus5 (Ubc9), an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c32">32</xref>). This gene might also function in chromatin remodeling, since the ubiquitination of histones is one of the mechanisms that regulate gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c33">33</xref>). In this screening, we failed to isolate the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene, but this result is not unexpected since the overexpression of Tfg3 inhibited cell growth (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>).</p><p>To examine the effect of <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation on transcription of these suppressor genes at a higher temperature, we analyzed the levels of total poly(A) RNA by slot-blotting and specific mRNA by northern-blotting in both strains JY741 and JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394;. Total RNA was isolated from the cells cultured at 30&#x000b0;C, and the cells incubated at 38&#x000b0;C for 1 and 4 h after the temperature up-shift. The level of poly(A) RNA increased slightly after the temperature shift to almost the same extent for both strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f5">5</xref>B), indicating that the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation did not affect the transcription level after the temperature shift. However, the expression level of each suppressor gene was different between the two strains especially at the elevated temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f5">5</xref>C). The heat-inducibility of the suppressor genes in JY741 was consistent with the result of systematic analysis of transcriptional response to environmental stress (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh1000tb2">2</xref>). SPCC1529.01 was induced in JY741 after 1 h of the temperature-shift, but this heat-induction was not prominent in JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394;. Though SPBC3B8.09 was not heat-induced in JY741, the mRNA level was reduced in JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394; after the temperature-shift. The mRNA level of SPAC25H1.02 was less in JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394; after 4 h at 38&#x000b0;C than in JY741. Two species of transcript were detected for SPBC1734.11 and the larger one was heat-induced. In this case, slightly less mRNA was detected in JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394; after 4 h at 38&#x000b0;C. SPAC30D11.13 expressed less in JY741&#x0002f;tfg3&#x00394; at 30&#x000b0;C and much less at 38&#x000b0;C than in JY741. All these indicated that Tfg3 functions at higher temperatures to regulate transcription in a gene-specific manner. None of our five suppressors of the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype associated with the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation suppressed the osmotic-stress-sensitive phenotype (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1000f2">2</xref>G; data not shown). Thus it appeared that they suppressed the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation in a heat-stress-specific manner.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We report here that <italic>S.pombe</italic> Tfg3 is incorporated into the Fcp1&#x0002f;TFIIF&#x0002f;pol II complex via interaction with TFIIF&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;, but not with Fcp1 or pol II. We prepared the recombinant TFIIF&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2; complex as GST&#x02013;TFIIF&#x003b2;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-H because we were unable to express TFIIF&#x003b1; and TFIIF&#x003b2; separately in <italic>E.coli</italic> as soluble proteins. When TFIIF&#x003b1; or TFIIF&#x003b2;, prepared separately in denaturing buffer, was mixed with Tfg3 and then the mixture was dialyzed, Tfg3 associated with both TFIIF&#x003b1; and TFIIF&#x003b2; (data not shown). In addition, like TFIIF&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;, Tfg3 also binds to TFIIB. Thus, we concluded that Tfg3 is the third subunit of <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIF as is the case in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. The TFIIF in mammals, however, lack the corresponding subunit (or Tfg3 homolog). The assembly of Tfg3 into <italic>S.pombe</italic> TFIIF is rather unexpected because <italic>S.pombe</italic> is more similar, in many respects, to higher eukaryotes than <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> [for example, see ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c34">34</xref>)].</p><p>We found that Tfg3 of <italic>S.pombe</italic> formed dimers (or multimers). In human TFIIF, the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits form a hetero-tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c35">35</xref>). If TFIIF&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2; of <italic>S.pombe</italic> is also a tetramer, the overall structure of TFIIF of <italic>S.pombe</italic> should be a hetero-hexamer or a larger complex, providing a wide surface for molecular contacts with other transcription factors. In fact, we found that Tfg3 of <italic>S.pombe</italic> was incorporated into TFIID as a TAF. In the <italic>S.pombe</italic> gene database (Sanger Institute), Tfg3 is denoted as Taf14 because of the strong homology to its counterpart in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. In addition, Tfg3 of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> is known to be a component of the SWI&#x0002f;SNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c5">5</xref>) and NuA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c14">14</xref>) complexes. Tfg3 is also involved in molecular interactions with TFIIB.</p><p>The <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation was associated with stress-sensitive phenotypes, and the result of our tetrad assay under mild conditions indicated that <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is a nonessential gene. Therefore, Tfg3 may be needed only under certain stress conditions. Since <italic>S.pombe</italic> contains a putative paralog of <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, namely SPAC17G8.07, which is probably an ortholog of YNL107W of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, it is also possible that it supports cell growth via functional redundancy under mild conditions. The temperature dependence of the Tfg3&#x02013;TBP interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> and the incorporation of Tfg3 into TFIID <italic>in vivo</italic> suggest that Tfg3 plays a regulatory role in transcription at elevated temperatures. In fact, the results of mRNA analysis from the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant after temperature up-shift indicated that Tfg3 functions in transcription regulation at higher temperatures in a gene-specific manner. The most plausible function of Tfg3 is to gather and organize various GTFs and chromatin-related factors into transcription apparatus, and to stabilize the transcription complex at higher temperatures.</p><p>We have isolated five species of multicopy suppressor genes of the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype associated with the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutation. According to the analysis of expression pattern of these genes, the most probable mechanism of the suppression is that the multicopy plasmids compensated the expression levels of suppressor genes, which were reduced in the <italic>tfg3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant. However, because the overexpression of only one species of the genes was sufficient to suppress the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype, suppression mechanisms which include interactions of protein functions might be possible for some suppressors. Indeed, three suppressor genes encoded factors with chromatin-modulating function. SPBC3B8.09 is a homolog of <italic>SAS10</italic>. This gene in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> was originally isolated in a screening for genes whose overproduction disrupted gene silencing, which <italic>SAS10</italic> achieves in a sir- and silencer-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c27">27</xref>). SPAC25H1.02 encodes a JmjC domain protein and is denoted as <italic>jmj1</italic> in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> gene database. It has been proposed that the JmjC domain plays a role in the regulation of chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c29">29</xref>). Several genes in the genome of <italic>S.pombe</italic> contain sequences that encode JmjC domains, e.g. <italic>epe1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>lid2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. The <italic>epe1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene was isolated in a genetic screening for mutations that promote silencing beyond the <italic>IR-L</italic> heterochromatin boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c36">36</xref>). Epe1 counteracts transcriptional silencing via a negative effect on the stability of heterochromatin, and the JmjC domain is essential for its activity. The expression of <italic>epe1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was induced by temperature up-shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c37">37</xref>) and Lid2 in <italic>S.pombe</italic> appears to be related to the modification of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c38">38</xref>).

It has been reported that Ydj1 functions in the import of protein into mitochondria and to the endoplasmic reticulum. SPCC1529.01 encodes a putative multidrug efflux transporter and the expression of SPCC1529.01 is also heat-inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1000c34">34</xref>). From the intracellular localization and the physiological roles of these two proteins, the suppression of <italic>tfg3</italic> mutation is not attributable to the direct interaction between Tfg3 and the SPBC1734.11 and SPCC1529.01 proteins.</p><p>Suppressors of the <italic>tfg3</italic> mutation herein isolated suppressed the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype, but none of these suppressed the high-osmolarity sensitivity of the <italic>tfg3</italic> mutant. One possibility is that Tfg3 is needed to stabilize the transcription complexes at elevated temperatures, but not under high-osmolarity conditions. Overall our findings suggested that Tfg3 of <italic>S.pombe</italic> functions in the regulation of transcription by connecting and organizing GTFs and chromatin-modulating factors under stress conditions in a gene-specific manner.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh1000f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of Tfg3 from <italic>S.pombe</italic> (GenBank accession no.
