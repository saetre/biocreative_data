The EGF-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 (<italic>cox-2</italic>) expression is mediated through p38<sup>MAPK</sup> signaling pathway and positively correlates with NF-IL6&#x003b2; expression in A431 cells. NF-IL6&#x003b2; coordinated with c-Jun on <italic>cox-2</italic> transcriptional activation by reporter and small interfering RNA assays. NF-IL6&#x003b2; could directly bind to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) sites of the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter by <italic>in vitro</italic>-DNA binding assay. The C/EBP site was important for basal and, to a lesser extent, for EGF-regulated <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription, while the CRE site was a more specific response to EGF inducibility of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene. SUMO1 expression attenuated EGF- and NF-IL6&#x003b2;-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activities. NF-IL6&#x003b2; was found to be sumoylated by <italic>in vivo</italic>- and <italic>in vitro</italic>-sumoylation assays, and the SUMO1-NF-IL6&#x003b2; (suNF-IL6&#x003b2;) lost its ability to interact with p300 in <italic>in vitro</italic>-binding assay. NF-IL6&#x003b2; was also acetylated by p300, and acetylation of NF-IL6&#x003b2; enhanced the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity stimulated by NF-IL6&#x003b2; itself. <italic>In vivo</italic>-DNA binding assay demonstrated that EGF stimulated the recruitment of p300 and NF-IL6&#x003b2; to the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter, yet promoted the dissociation of SUMO1-modificated proteins from the promoter. These results indicated that NF-IL6&#x003b2; plays a pivotal role in the regulation of basal and EGF-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Prostaglandins play important roles in many biological processes, including cell division, immune responses, blood pressure regulation, ovulation, bone development and wound healing. The cyclooxygenase (COX, prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase) is a key enzyme in prostaglandin, prostacyclin and thromboxane biosynthesis from arachidonic acid. Two COX isoforms were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and cells in animal species. COX-2 is induced by a wide-range of stimulators, such as IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) or LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), in many distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and is regulated mainly at the level of transcription. Human <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter region contains a twin arginine translocation A and multiple regulatory elements, including two putative nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) binding sites, one nuclear factor interleukin-6 (NF-IL6)/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) binding site and one cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Recent studies on human <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter have shown that <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription is regulated by different transcription factors, including NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), NF-IL6/C/EBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), C/EBP&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and activation protein 1 complex (AP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), supporting that regulation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene expression could involve complex interactions among diverse transcription factors. Thus, transcriptional mechanism of <italic>cox-2</italic> induction relies on cell type-specific as well as combined interactions of several <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements, transcription factors and signal transduction pathways.</p><p>The C/EBP family contains three main activating members, C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4;, that recognize the same DNA sequence. These three members have a common structure: an N-terminal domain bearing the transaction domain, a basic DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal leucine zipper domain that allows the homo- or hetero-dimerization of these factors. C/EBP&#x003b4; is involved in the ligand-stimulated transcriptional regulation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). However, the detail molecular mechanism of human C/EBP&#x003b4;, NF-IL6&#x003b2;, in the regulation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene transcription is unclear.</p><p>Post-translational modification of proteins by sumoylation is an important regulatory mechanism and has been found to be utilized in many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). SUMO modification of several transcription factors has been reported, including the androgen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), LEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), c-Myb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), TEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), Sp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and C/EBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). SUMO conjugation has been shown to regulate several different protein functions including protein stability, subcellular localization and transcriptional activation regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The consensus sequence, (I/L)KXE, for sumoylation has been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The C/EBP family belongs to the large family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. The repression domain I of C/EBP&#x003b5; was demonstrated to be modified by SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), and this modification was proposed to be important for the inhibitory function of this domain. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) also reported that conserved SUMO target sequences are present in C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4;, and that these isoforms can be conjugated to SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). However, the function of sumoylated C/EBPs is largely unknown, especially in the case of NF-IL6&#x003b2;.</p><p>Coactivator p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) serve as an integrator for gene transcription. Several reports have suggested involvement of p300 coactivator in <italic>cox-2</italic> transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). p300 contains histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity that modulates the acetylation of histones or transcription factors, thus affecting the DNA binding and transcriptional activation. p300 and CBP have been shown to participate in C/EBPs-mediated gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). C/EBP family members trigger the phosphorylation of p300 and consequently increase p300-mediated transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>Several reports have shown C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4;'s involvement in <italic>cox-2</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). However, the effects of C/EBPs on <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription are dependent on cell type and stage of differentiation. Gain or loss of function of C/EBP&#x003b4; and C/EBP&#x003b2; regulate <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). In our previous study, we found that induction of c-Jun is involved in EGF-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In addition, we found that the level of NF-IL6&#x003b2; is also elevated by EGF treatment in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). In this study, we extended our work to investigate the functional role of NF-IL6&#x003b2; in regulating <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity in the basal and EGF-induced transcriptional state, and the effects that sumoylation and acetylation of NF-IL6&#x003b2; play function roles on the promoter. Our results indicated that NF-IL6&#x003b2; mediates the basal and EGF-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter state, and sumoylation of NF-IL6&#x003b2; attenuates the activation of <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter, while p300 can acetylate NF-IL6&#x003b2; and participate in the NF-IL6&#x003b2;-enhanced <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Human EGF was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ).

NF-IL6&#x003b2; was generated from human liver cDNA library by PCR using BD Advantage GC&#x02122; PCR kit and using the following oligonucleotides: 5&#x02032;-CGGGATCCAGCGCCGCGCTCTTCAGCCTG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGCCTCGAGGCCGCGCGTTACCGGCAGTC-3&#x02032;.

Hence prior to this study, we have verified the expression of C/EBPs in the presence of EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). According to these data, the expression pattern of C/EBP&#x003b1; is not affected by EGF treatment, whereas C/EBP&#x003b2; expression can be greatly increased by EGF treatment, but only after a 6 h delay. Otherwise, NF-IL6&#x003b2; pre-existed before EGF treatment and enhanced by EGF treatment. The induction pattern of NF-IL6&#x003b2; is similar with c-Jun and COX-2 expression patterns after EGF treatment.</p><p>We previously found that the p38<sup>MAPK</sup> signaling pathway mediates the EGF-induced <italic>NF-IL6&#x003b2;</italic> transcription in A431 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). To examine the possibility that NF-IL6&#x003b2; regulates <italic>cox-2</italic> gene expression in A431 cells, we first studied the correlation between p38<sup>MAPK</sup> activation and <italic>NF-IL6&#x003b2;/cox-2</italic> gene transcription. RT&#x02013;PCR assay was carried out for this study. The levels of EGF-induced <italic>NF-IL6&#x003b2;</italic> mRNA and <italic>cox-2</italic> mRNA were attenuated by pretreatment with p38<sup>MAPK</sup> inhibitor, SB203580, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, overexpression of NF-IL6&#x003b2; enhanced <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. The effect could be enhanced by EGF treatment. The results suggest that NF-IL6&#x003b2; might play a functional role in the basal and EGF-induced expression of COX-2.</p><p>To investigate the effect of endogenous NF-IL6&#x003b2; on transcriptional activation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene, complementary specific oligonucleotides aimed to inhibit NF-IL6&#x003b2; gene expression by RNA interference were designed. Transfection of A431 cells with the NF-IL6&#x003b2; siRNA expression vector resulted in reduction of EGF-induced NF-IL6&#x003b2; mRNA and a concomitant decrease of <italic>cox-2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel). Consistent with the RT&#x02013;PCR results, cells cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct controlled by <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter, pXC918 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), and an NF-IL6&#x003b2; siRNA expression vectors, pSi-1, expressed significantly less luciferase activity than that cotransfection with negative control, pSi-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel). Cotransfection of HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; expression vectors with pSi-C increased COX-2 expression, but the transfectant with pSi-1 decreased the COX-2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that NF-IL6&#x003b2; plays a role in regulating COX-2 expression. Since c-Jun is involved in EGF-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> transcriptional activation through the CRE binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), we examined whether activation of <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter, which bears a CRE binding site, by NF-IL6&#x003b2; requires the cooperation with c-Jun. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, cells cotransfected with c-Jun siRNA expression vector reduced NF-IL6&#x003b2;-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity, indicating that the activation of <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter by NF-IL6&#x003b2; is, at least in part, dependent on c-Jun. Furthermore, cotransfection of cells with c-Jun and NF-IL6&#x003b2; expression vectors resulted in a synergistic activation of the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that NF-IL6&#x003b2; and c-Jun likely co-regulate EGF-dependent <italic>cox-2</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>C/EBP and CRE motifs are important for <italic>cox-2</italic> gene activation in A431 cells</title><p>To further study whether C/EBP and CRE motifs are involved in the basal and EGF-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> gene regulation, reporter expression controlled by the wild-type or mutant <italic>cox-2</italic> gene promoter was assessed in transient transfection studies. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. A point mutation at the C/EBP motif resulted in 60&#x02013;70% loss of the basal promoter activity, but only a 20&#x02013;30% decrease in EGF-inducible increase of the promoter activity (compare &#x02212;207/+49wt with &#x02212;207/+49mCEBP). In contrast, a point mutation at the CRE motif lost &#x0223c;40% of the basal promoter activity and &#x0223c;45&#x02013;55% of EGF-inducible activity (compare &#x02212;207/+49wt with &#x02212;207/+49mCRE). The stimulatory effect of EGF was abolished when both CRE and C/EBP sites were mutated (&#x02212;207/+49mCE/C), suggesting that C/EBP and CRE motifs are essential for <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity. These results demonstrate that CRE motif is more important in EGF response, while C/EBP site is more important in regulating the basal <italic>cox-2</italic> expression. To evaluate the effect of NF-IL6&#x003b2; on C/EBP and CRE motifs, the NF-IL6&#x003b2; expression vector was cotransfected with various mutant <italic>cox-2</italic> promoters in A431 cells. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. The mutation at C/EBP and CRE sites diminished 75 and 40%, respectively, of the stimulatory effect of NF-IL6&#x003b2; on the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter (lanes 2 and 3). While the NF-IL6&#x003b2; effect seems to be more prominent at the C/EBP motif, double mutation at both sites almost completely abolished the NF-IL6&#x003b2; response (lane 4). Since NF-IL6&#x003b2; played a functional role in the transcriptional activity of <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter, we examined whether NF-IL6&#x003b2; binds to the C/EBP or CRE motifs of <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter. To test the binding activity between CRE and C/EBP motifs, DNA affinity precipitation assay was performed with nuclear extracts prepared from control and EGF-treated A431 cells. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (lanes 5 and 8), EGF apparently increased the amount of NF-IL6&#x003b2; bound to the C/EBP and CRE motifs of <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Sumoylation plays a negative regulatory role in <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activation</title><p>Base on these results, we have verified that NF-IL6&#x003b2; play a functional role in <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription. We then tried to elucidate the mechanism in which NF-IL6&#x003b2; modulates the basal and EGF-induced transcriptional regulation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene. C/EBP&#x003b4; was reported to be a SUMO1 substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and a K120A mutant of the Gal4-C/EBP&#x003b4;(1&#x02013;142) fusion protein lost &#x0223c;60% of its repressive activity, as compared with the wild-type Gal4-C/EBP&#x003b4;(1&#x02013;142) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). To investigate whether sumoylation acts on the transcription factors for the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter, transient reporter assay was performed. Cotransfection of the SUMO1 expression vector significantly repressed the NF-IL6&#x003b2;-enhanced pXC918 reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). To specifically examine whether the C/EBP-binding complex participated in the SUMO-mediated repressive effect, a heterologous reporter pGL2 promoter-C/EBP was used, and the NF-IL6&#x003b2;-enhanced pGL2 promoter-C/EBP reporter activity could be attenuated by exogenously expressed SUMO1 (compare lanes 9 and 10 with lanes 11 and 12). These results suggest that sumoylation might suppress <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity under the EGF-deprived condition, and that the C/EBP motif might be the site of SUMO-mediated effect.</p></sec><sec><title>NF-IL6&#x003b2; is a SUMO substrate</title><p>Although the mouse C/EBP&#x003b2; has been shown to be a target for SUMO1, sumoylation of human C/EBP&#x003b4; (NF-IL6&#x003b2;) and its biological function have not been elucidated. By sequence comparison between mouse C/EBP&#x003b4; and NF-IL6&#x003b2;, the consensus sequence for SUMO attachment, LKREP, in the regulatory domain motif (RDM) was conserved. To examine whether NF-IL6&#x003b2; is a SUMO substrate, <italic>in vitro</italic>-sumoylation assay was carried out with purified E1 (SAEI and SAEII), E2 (Ubc9) and <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed/translated HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2;. SUMO1 or SUMO3 could be covalently conjugated to HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). To map the site of sumoylation, we first examined the sequence and found a region between amino acid 110 and 151 in HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; contained a potential sumoylation site (data not shown). The lysine 120 in this region has been reported to be a potential site of sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). A K120A mutation was then generated by mutagenesis in HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; to see whether sumoylation of the protein was affected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (lane 4), the K120A mutant protein could not be sumoylated by <italic>in vitro</italic>-sumoylation assay, suggesting that lysine 120 is the site of sumoylation. Since post-translational modifications of transcription factor often affect their DNA binding, the DNA-binding activity of NF-IL6&#x003b2; and suNF-IL6&#x003b2; was examined by gel-shift assay using <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; protein and labeled CRE or C/EBP probes. NF-IL6&#x003b2; bound to DNA as a homodimer (our observation, data not shown). The homodimerized HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; could bind to the C/EBP motif at the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 2). Interestingly, it also bound to the CRE motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 5), a result subsequently confirmed with purified His/NF-IL6&#x003b2; protein (data not shown). Using equal amount of the proteins, we found no appreciable differences between HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; and sumoylated HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2;, in term of DNA-binding and homodimerization activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 3, or lane 5 with lane 6). We next examined whether the turnover rates (half-life) of NF-IL6&#x003b2; and NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A are different. Transfected cells were harvested at different time points post-cycloheximide treatment, and exogenously expressed HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2;wt or HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A in cell lysates were analysed by western blotting. We measured the different time points of remained HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; proteins and separately normalize with the &#x02018;0&#x02019; time point. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the turnover half-life of HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2;wt was &#x0223c;3.5&#x02013;4 h, similar to that of HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A. There was also no appreciable difference in the patterns of nuclear localization between the wild-type and K120A mutant NF-IL6&#x003b2; proteins (data not shown). These results suggest that NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A has the same DNA-binding activity, protein half-life and nuclear localization as NF-IL6&#x003b2;wt. We then moved on to address the issue of whether NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A is involved in the transactivation activity of <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription.</p><p>The regulatory domain motif of C/EBPs is critical for inhibitory domain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). To test whether the SUMO-conjugated NF-IL6&#x003b2; is important for silencing <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription, we first examined whether NF-IL6&#x003b2; is a sumoylated protein in A431 cells. The <italic>in vivo</italic>-sumoylation assay was performed by transfecting cells with expression vectors of SUMO1 active form and HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; or HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A. western blotting analysis indicated that the suHA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; was detectable in A431 cells. HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; was endogenously sumoylated in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, compare lane 1 with lane 3), and the sumoylated HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; was increased when cells were cotransfected with SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, compare lane 3 with lane 4). However, the no SUMO-conjugated patterns were seen when HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A was cotransfected with the SUMO1-GG expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). Sumoylation of proteins is agent-dependent. For example PMA can induce Elk-1, but not I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, sumoylation in COS7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). The constitutive sumoylation is also observed for STAT1 at the lysine703 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). We therefore investigated whether EGF regulates SUMO1 conjugation to NF-IL6&#x003b2; in A431 cells. Using immunoprecipitation and western analysis, we found EGF attenuated the content of suNF-IL6&#x003b2; in A431 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, compare lane 1 with lane 2, and lane 3 with lane 4). Finally, the transactivation activity of NF-IL6&#x003b2;wt and NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A mutant was evaluated in co-transfection studies. The results indicate that the K120A mutant contributes higher reporter activities than the wild-type NF-IL6&#x003b2; on the &#x02212;207/+49wt reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6) suggesting that an intact lysine 120 of NF-IL6&#x003b2; is necessary for the repression in <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>NF-IL6&#x003b2; is a HAT (p300) substrate</title><p>A previous study reported that PU.1 could enhance p300 mediated-C/EBP&#x003b2; acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).

To address this issue and verify that EGF regulates <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription through p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), we investigated whether acetylated NF-IL6&#x003b2; (acNF-IL6&#x003b2;) is detectable in A431 cells. Using &#x003b1;-acetyl-lysine antibodies, we were able to analyse immunoprecipitated products, from the cell lysates containing endogenous p300. We found that EGF enhanced the acetylation of HA/NF-IL6&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, compare lanes 3 with 4). Furthermore, exogenously expressed p300-enhanced NF-IL6&#x003b2; acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6).

To examine whether NF-IL6&#x003b2; was involved in an increase in p300 transactivation activity, we perform a reporter assay by cotransfection of p300 and NF-IL6&#x003b2; expression vectors with or without knockdown expression vectors of NF-IL6&#x003b2;.

By gel-shift assay, we found that purified or <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated NF-IL6&#x003b2; could directly bind to the C/EBP and CRE motif on <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and EGF treatment enhanced the binding of NF-IL6&#x003b2; to the CRE site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The same phenomenon of C/EBP&#x003b4; binding to the C/EBP and CRE sites was also observed in the LPS- and TPA-regulated <italic>cox-2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of NF-IL6&#x003b2; transactivated not only C/EBP motif but also CRE motif on <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and cotransfection of cells with c-Jun and NF-IL6&#x003b2; expression vectors resulted in a synergistic activation of the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter bearing CRE site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results support the notion that NF-IL6&#x003b2;-bound C/EBP motif coordinates with the CRE motif transactivated by NF-IL6&#x003b2; and c-Jun in the promoter activation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene upon by EGF treatment. EGF activated heterologous pGL2 promoter-C/EBP reporter activity about 4- to 5-folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that C/EBP motif is responsive to EGF stimulation. Activation of the basal transcription activity by overexpression of NF-IL6&#x003b2; was observed using pXC918 (&#x02212;918/+49)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 3), &#x02212;207/+49wt (JM Wang <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data) and C/EBP-heterologous reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 9). However, EGF could not obviously enhance these <italic>cox-2</italic> reporter activities, suggesting that the overexpressed NF-IL6&#x003b2; may have enough ability to directly recruit the cofactors and create a more intact transcription initiation complex, such as CBP or p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), to mimic EGF stimulation. These results suggested that NF-IL6&#x003b2; plays a role at the switch control in <italic>cox-2</italic> transcriptionalregulation.</p><p>In resting cells, a low-level of mRNA expression and SUMO-mediated suppression of the promoter have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Sumoylation plays a role in <italic>cox-2</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Several possible regulating proteins have been proposed for the transcription regulation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene, such as histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), C/EBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). However, nobody has yet examined the transient change between basal level and ligand-stimulation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene expression. Our study focuses on a novel NF-IL6&#x003b2;-regulated pathway, involving post-translational modification of the protein to regulate <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription. Recently, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) reported the inhibitory function of C/EBPs by Gal4 fusion protein assay system and showed that lysine 120 was a potential SUMO-conjugated site on C/EBP&#x003b4;. Therefore, we demonstrated NF-IL6&#x003b2; is a SUMO1 and HAT substrate and can regulate the <italic>cox-2</italic> transcriptional regulation. We introduced the same point mutation into NF-IL6&#x003b2; and confirmed that lysine 120 was likely a SUMO-conjugated site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). The K120A mutant of NF-IL6&#x003b2; retained the same DNA binding activity, homodimerization activity, protein stability and nuclear localization as the wild-type NF-IL6&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). However, comparing with NF-IL6&#x003b2;wt, it enhanced the transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) suggesting that the post-translational modification might be involved in the modulation of critical protein&#x02013;protein interaction. Although our reporter assay suggested that suNF-IL6&#x003b2; plays a repressive function role on <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), we did not rule out the possibility that other SUMO-modified proteins might be involved in the maintenance of the state of repression. Several SUMO-regulated transcription factors could interact with various HDACs resulting in gene repression. For example, sumoylation of Elk-1 results in the recruitment of HDAC-2 and hence transcriptional repression at Elk-1 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). HDAC1 decreases LPS-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> gene expression had been reported, although the mechanism of recruitment is still not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Our preliminary results from the DNA affinity precipitation assay demonstrated that suNF-IL6&#x003b2; could increase the interaction with some HDACs including HDAC1 (JM Wang <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data.) These results suggest that suNF-IL6&#x003b2; has the ability to recruit HDACs to regulate gene expression.</p><p>p300 acts as a coactivator for many transcription activators to modulate basal- and enhancer-regulated transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b2; binding and p300 recruitment are required for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). We previously reported that p300 plays a functional role in EGF-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Transcriptional activation by C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; coordinated the coactivators, CBP and p300, which promote transcription by acetylating histones and recruiting basal transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). p300/CBP acetylates the histone tails of nucleosomes, thus favoring chromatin remodeling and activation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). In this study, exogenously expressed p300 could increase the NF-IL6&#x003b2;-mediated <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We also demonstrated that p300 could directly acetylate NF-IL6&#x003b2; <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and EGF enhances acetylation of NF-IL6&#x003b2; <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The most interesting thing is lysine 120 of NF-IL6&#x003b2; can be a sumoylation or acetylation site. The same phenomenon occurs in Sp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). The <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of something site capable of being both sumoylated and acetylated are difficult to carry out. Nevertheless, it can explain why the repression and activation effect of NF-IL6&#x003b2;K120A is not obvious. In addition, our experiments in this paper suggest that p300 and NF-IL6&#x003b2;/AcNF-IL6&#x003b2; were involved in the EGF-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription. This covalent modification might further enhance the architectural stability of the whole general basal transcription factors on <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter. By ChIP assays, we showed that EGF enhanced <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter binding activities of both p300 and NF-IL6&#x003b2;. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The inability of suNF-IL6&#x003b2; to interact with p300 was also demonstrated by <italic>in vitro</italic>-binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that suNF-IL6&#x003b2; and acNF-IL6&#x003b2; are involved, respectively, in the silencing and activation of <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription. The dynamic pattern of histone H4 acetylation has been demonstrated to associate with <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription by bradykinin and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). Thus, different acetylation patterns of histones, in conjunction with acNF-IL6&#x003b2; or other modulators, may result in conformational changes of chromatin and selective association of transcription factor to the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter. We provided evidence to support that NF-IL6&#x003b2; is a sumoylated protein and also acetylated by EGF treatment in A431 cells. It brings us to deliberate the interplay between the post-translational modification and ligands-induction of NF-IL6&#x003b2; in downstream target genes. C/EBP proteins could be modified by SUMO-1 attachment within their RDM sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>-acetylation assay shown NF-IL6&#x003b2; at least have two acetylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The RDM sequences of C/EBP proteins exist in the related region. Moreover, C/EBP&#x003b2; was identified to be an acetylated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). The similar phenomenon of acetylation site of C/EBP&#x003b2; occurs nearby to its DNA binding domain. Align and compare the lysine residues in NF-IL6&#x003b2;&#x02212;lysine 184, mouse C/EBP&#x003b4;-lysine 184, human C/EBP&#x003b2;-lysine 264 and mouse C/EBP&#x003b2;-lysine 215, we found these lysine residues close to DNA binding domain are conserved. However, the exact acetylation site on NF-IL6&#x003b2; and whether the reciprocal action of suNF-IL6&#x003b2; and acNF-IL6&#x003b2; is involved in chromatin remodeling needs to be examined.</p><p>In addition to stabilization and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of transcription activators, a gene can also be regulated by post-translational modifications of pre-existing transcription factors. Here, we use the NF-IL6&#x003b2;-regulated <italic>cox-2</italic> system to establish a model that links pre-existing NF-IL6&#x003b2; and its post-translationally modified form to regulate <italic>cox-2</italic> transcription. The present study clearly indicated that NF-IL6&#x003b2; and its sumoylation and acetylation modifications play a functional role in the regulation of <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter. NF-IL6&#x003b2; regulated the basal and EGF-induced <italic>cox-2</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In resting cells, sumoylation of NF-IL6&#x003b2; attenuated the activation of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene promoter. Upon EGF treatment, the recruitment of p300 and NF-IL6&#x003b2; to the <italic>cox-2</italic> gene promoter is enhanced, while the sumoylated form of NF-IL6&#x003b2; on gene promoter is attenuated. It suggests that EGF treatment could result in a decrease in SUMO1-modified proteins or suNF-IL6&#x003b2;, an increase of NF-IL6&#x003b2; protein bound to the <italic>cox-2</italic> promoter and the recruitment of p300 and involvement of NF-IL6&#x003b2; acetylation activate the promoter activity of <italic>cox-2</italic> gene. These results demonstrated a possible interaction between p300 and the post-translational modification of NF-IL6&#x003b2; in controlling the <italic>cox-2</italic> gene expression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks are due to Drs Wai-Ming Kan and Rong-Fong Shen for critical review of this manuscript.
