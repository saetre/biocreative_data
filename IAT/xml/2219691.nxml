The first is poorly mobile and activates short-range target genes. The second is specifically packed for efficient spreading to induce long-range targets. Subcellular mechanisms involved in the discriminative secretion of these two forms remain elusive. Wnt and Hedgehog can associate with membrane microdomains, but the function of this association was unknown. Here we show that a major protein component of membrane microdomains, reggie-1/flotillin-2, plays important roles in secretion and spreading of Wnt and Hedgehog in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Reggie-1 loss-of-function results in reduced spreading of the morphogens, while its overexpression stimulates secretion of Wnt and Hedgehog and expands their diffusion. The resulting changes in the morphogen gradients differently affect the short- and long-range targets. In its action reggie-1 appears specific for Wnt and Hedgehog. These data suggest that reggie-1 is an important component of the Wnt and Hedgehog secretion pathway dedicated to formation of the mobile pool of these morphogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hedgehog</kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>reggie/flotillin</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd><kwd>wingless</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogens are molecules spreading from the region of production and inducing tissue patterning in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lawrence, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lander, 2007</xref>). Different threshold levels of the morphogen concentrations exist, which through appropriate levels of receptor activation are translated into transcriptional induction of different target genes.</p><p>Examples of morphogens include the families of Wnt, Hh (Hedgehog) and TGFbeta-secreted proteins, which can bear multiple post-translational modifications. Wnt proteins are doubly <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) and bear palmitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Willert <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and palmitoylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Takada <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) groups. Hh is palmitoylated and cholesterol-modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Porter <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Pepinsky <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). These modifications are necessary for the proper secretion and activity of the morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Miura and Treisman, 2006</xref>), and require specific mechanisms for Wnt and Hh secretion and spreading. Multipass transmembrane proteins Wntless/Evi and Dispatched are indispensable for secretion of Wnt and Hh, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burke <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Banziger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bartscherer <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Due to the hydrophobic nature of the modifications, secreted Wnt and Hh are not freely diffusible in their isolated form. In aqueous solutions, Wnt proteins aggregate and precipitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Willert <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, Wnt and Hh bind to the cell surface and extracellular matrix, which strongly reduces their diffusion properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Papkoff and Schryver, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>).</p><p>How is effective long-range diffusion of Wnt and Hh achieved <italic>in vivo</italic>? It has been speculated that two routes for their secretion exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Coudreuse and Korswagen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hausmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The first would involve a &#x02018;default' secretion pathway, releasing monomeric or low-degree oligomeric forms of the morphogens, whose diffusion would be very limited. Accumulation of these forms close to the source of production turns on short-range target genes. The second route, poorly understood, is predicted to produce the morphogens specifically packed for efficient spreading permitting induction of the long-range targets. Multiple ways to pack morphogens for long-range diffusion may exist. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Wnt and Hh can associate with fat body-derived lipoprotein particles, promoting spreading and activation of long-range target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Panakova <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In cell culture, mammalian Hh can form highly diffusive, biologically active aggregates of a high molecular weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>It remains elusive what kind of intracellular mechanism can direct the morphogens into the long diffusion range-specific secretion, as opposed to the default secretion route. Wnt and Hh can associate with the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Rietveld <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Zhai <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), which has been proposed important for Hh packing into high-order aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>); lipid modifications of Wnt and Hh are required for the DRM association. Membrane microdomains are involved in a variety of cellular functions, for example, being platforms for specific signal transduction cascades, as well as for particular types of intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Pike, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Le Roy and Wrana, 2005</xref>). Different types of microdomains can be described by their major resident proteins, such as annexin, reggie/flotillin, or caveolin (absent in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Le Roy and Wrana, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this article, we show that a major component of the membrane microdomains, reggie-1/flotillin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Langhorst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Stuermer and Plattner, 2005</xref>), plays important roles in Wnt and Hh secretion in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Overexpression of reggie-1 leads to increased secretion and enhanced spreading of these morphogens. Loss of function of reggie-1 results in the reciprocal reduction in the morphogen gradient. Our results suggest that reggie-1 is an integral part of the intracellular trafficking events directing Wnt and Hh morphogens along the secretion route destined for the long-range spreading.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Overexpression of reggie-1 in Drosophila wing results in loss of a subset of Wnt-signalling responses</title><p>Two reggie isoforms (reggie-1/flotillin-2 and reggie-2/flotillin-1) exist in mammals and fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoehne <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Langhorst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Co-overexpression of both isoforms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> results in massive morphological defects, whereas reggie-2 alone produces no phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoehne <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). To investigate whether reggies affect Wg (Wingless, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wnt-1) signal transduction, we repeated the overexpression in a more controlled manner using the <italic>MS1096-Gal4</italic>, <italic>engrailed-Gal4</italic> (<italic>en-Gal4</italic>), <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> or <italic>tubulin-Gal4</italic> (<italic>tub-Gal4</italic>) lines. As we obtained identical initial results by expression of reggie-1 alone or coexpression of reggie-1&#x0002b;2, experiments presented in this paper describe expression of reggie-1 alone.</p><p>Adult wings lost wing margin structures in the regions of reggie-1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Since such phenotypes can arise from defective Wg signalling, we analysed the expression of Wg target genes in wing imaginal discs of late third instar larvae. We found downregulation of the short-range Wg target genes Cut and Senseless (Sens) in the reggie-1 overexpression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref> shows wild-type Sens expression). Another readout for high Wg signalling is the zone of non-proliferating cells (ZNC) forming close to the source of Wg synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Johnston and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>). The ZNC was eliminated in the region of reggie-1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1G</xref>). Similar effect can be obtained by expression of Axin (an inhibitor of Wg signalling) or cyclin E (which forces exit from the cell-cycle arrest; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Johnston and Edgar, 1998</xref>). However, unlike Axin and reggie-1, cyclin E was unable to downregulate Sens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Thus, analysis of responses to high levels of Wg signalling revealed that overexpression of reggie-1 reduced Wg signalling.</p><p>Loss of Wg signalling can result in misexpression of the hinge marker Homothorax in the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Azpiazu and Morata, 2000</xref>). Overexpression of reggie-1 reduced the size of the pouch (but not hinge) domain in an autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>; also compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). As Wg signalling controls growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Day and Lawrence, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Johnston and Gallant, 2002</xref>), this reduction in pouch size could be attributed to a defective Wg signalling. However, pouch expression of Homothorax was not induced by reggie-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, expression of a long-range Wg target Distalless (Dll) was not reduced by reggie-1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1H</xref>), and in fact was often enhanced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02032;</xref> shows wild-type Dll expression). Thus, only short-range Wg targets were downregulated by reggie-1. And among those, Sens in the reggie-1-overexpressing domain could be rescued in the vicinity of the wild-type region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). These observations suggested that reggie-1 was not affecting Wg signal transduction <italic>per se</italic>, but Wg gradient formation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Overexpression of reggie-1 expands the Wg diffusion gradient</title><p>In wild-type discs, the majority of anti-Wg staining is localized close to the stripe of Wg-producing cells, and the concentration of Wg rapidly decays away from the source of production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Overexpression of reggie-1 by various drivers resulted in erosion of the Wg gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B and C</xref>): Wg could be seen spreading far into the disc at the expense of reduced levels at the source of Wg production. High magnification revealed far-spreading punctate anti-Wg staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02032;</xref>); the number of Wg puncta and their apparent size were also increased upon reggie-1 overexpression.</p><p>We also found a dramatic autonomous increase in extracellular Wg in the reggie-1 overexpression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Wg puncta were not seen without cell permeabilization and thus likely reflected Wg endocytosed by the receiving cells.</p><p>Thus, reggie-1 activated Wg secretion and spreading. Erosion of the Wg gradient resulted in reduction of the short-range targets requiring high levels of Wg, whereas long-range targets were normal or even upregulated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reggie-1 changes Wg properties in the Wg-producing and not -responding cells</title><p>To analyse whether reggie-1 acted in the Wg-producing or -receiving cells, we restricted reggie-1 overexpression to the domain of Wg production by two independent means. First, we used the <italic>wg-Gal4</italic> line to overexpress reggie-1 only in the endogenous Wg-producing stripe. Remarkably, this reproduced many phenotypes of reggie-1 overexpression in a broader domain: notched adult wings, abnormal Sens expression and reduced wing pouch size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G, J and K</xref>). Most importantly, Wg gradient also became abnormal: a more diffuse pattern of Wg was seen both looking at total and extracellular anti-Wg staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3H and L</xref>). Interestingly, the total anti-Wg signal was eroded at the apical level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C and I</xref>), but unaffected basolaterally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>), indicating that reggie-1 stimulated the apical secretion of Wg, which is the normal way of Wg secretion in polarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Simmonds <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Pfeiffer <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Second, we expressed Wg in somatic clones using the <italic>tub-Gal4</italic> line, either alone or together with reggie-1; in this way we could also exclude the possibility that reggie-1 was indirectly affecting Wg production. Expression of Wg alone in this manner resulted in ectopic activation of the short-range target Sens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3O</xref>). Further, it resulted in downregulation of the endogenous Wg production at the dorso-ventral border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3N</xref>), a phenomenon known to arise from strong overactivation of Wg signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Rulifson <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). Remarkably, coexpression of reggie-1 with Wg drastically reduced the capacity of this ectopic Wg to induce ectopic Sens or downregulate endogenous Wg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3S and T</xref>). In contrast, the long-range target Dll was upregulated in both conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). We also observed enhanced Wg diffusion from the clones coexpressing Wg and reggie-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Thus, overexpression of reggie-1 changes the way Wg-producing cells release Wg. This change apparently involves higher secretion and produces a more mobile form of Wg, affecting gradient formation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Loss of reggie-1 reduces Wg spreading</title><p>Reggie-1 loss-of-function flies are viable and fertile and do not show obvious morphological defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoehne <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). This might be due to redundancy with other reggie-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Langhorst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) or compensatory pathways. However, more acute loss of reggie-1 function by expression of a <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> construct against reggie-1 by <italic>apterous-Gal4</italic> (<italic>ap-Gal4</italic>) or <italic>en-Gal4</italic> resulted in aberrant wings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>).</p><p>As reggie-1 overexpression broadened the Wg gradient, we expected the reciprocal phenotypes upon reggie-1 loss of function. Indeed, we found that the gradient of Wg protein, both total and extracellular, was shortened in <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A&#x02013;D</xref>), but that <italic>wg</italic> transcription was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). We found a similar reduction in the Wg gradient when <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> somatic clones were induced and intersected the Wg production stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4L</xref>). High magnification revealed a strong decrease in the amount of Wg puncta emanating from the Wg-producing cells of the <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4L&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02032;</xref>). Similar decrease in Wg diffusion and puncta formation could be seen by reggie-1-RNAi expression by <italic>en-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4M and N</xref>) and <italic>ap-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Counting Wg puncta in the RNAi-expressing and wild-type halves of same discs revealed a twofold decrease in Wg puncta formation upon reggie-1 loss of function; the apparent size of Wg puncta was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4N and O</xref>).</p><p>We next analysed expression of Wg target genes in <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> discs. The domain of the long-range target Dll was narrowed approximately twofold and its intensity reduced in discs deficient for reggie-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4I and J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>); quantification of eight <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type discs stained together revealed a threefold decrease in the Dll expression levels in <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4K</xref>). A decrease in Dll expression was also seen when <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> clones were induced; this decrease could be non-autonomous resulting from reduced Wg spreading from the <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> tissue within the Wg-producing stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4L</xref>). Narrowing of the Dll expression domain was also seen in the region of reggie-1-RNAi expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> discs had normal expression of the short-range target Sens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4G and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>); reggie-1 RNAi also did not prevent Sens expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). As a result, wing margin structures were normal in <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> wings and wings expressing reggie-1-RNAi (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Interestingly, in discs homozygous mutant for reggie-1 and heterozygous for a mutation in the <italic>wg</italic> gene, a slight but significant narrowing of the zone of Sens expression could be seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>).</p><p>Thus, reggie-1 is required for the proper Wg gradient formation. The range of Wg spreading and the number of Wg puncta is significantly decreased upon loss of reggie-1, resulting in a strong decrease in expression of the long-range Wg target. In contrast, short-range targets are not affected by loss of reggie-1, unless a concomitant reduction in Wg levels is performed.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reggie-1 increases Wg and Hh secretion in tissue culture and markedly stimulates Wg endocytosis by co-cultured cells</title><p>We next switched to a cell culture to address molecular mechanisms of reggie-1 action. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines co-overexpressing reggie-1 and Wg, reggie-1 localized to the plasma membrane as well as to intracellular compartments; the Wg signal was mostly intracellular (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>). We could observe a limited colocalization of Wg and reggie-1, both intracellularly and at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>). This limited colocalization might reflect a specific portion of Wg secreted through a reggie-1-dependent pathway. However, by Western blots we did not see a significant increase in Wg secretion upon transfection of Wg-producing S2 cells with reggie-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Wg secreted by cultured cells can stay attached to the cell membranes and is released by heparan sulphate treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Reichsman <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). Heparan extraction produced similar amounts of Wg from control and reggie-1-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Wg-signalling activity was also not changed by reggie-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>).</p><p>Western blot analysis is insufficiently sensitive to see small differences. Thus, we used a Wg-<italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Rluc) fusion protein to quantify secretion more accurately. We also prepared an Hh-Rluc fusion to monitor whether secretion of Hh might be affected by reggie-1. When we examined the ratio of Rluc activity in media to that in the cells, we observed a statistically significant enhancement of the morphogen secretion by S2R&#x0002b; cells upon reggie-1 transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>): Wg levels in the medium increased by approximately 25&#x00025; and levels of Hh by approximately 50&#x00025;. However, no significant effect on morphogen secretion was seen by treating the cells with dsRNA against reggie-1 (89&#x000b1;7 and 103&#x000b1;9&#x00025; of control for Wg and Hh, respectively), indicating that amounts of reggie-1 in S2R&#x0002b;cells were too low or unimportant for the net morphogen secretion. In contrast, the dominant-negative reggie-1 construct (see Materials and methods) significantly decreased Wg secretion by approximately 20&#x00025;, potentially affecting other proteins of the reggie-like family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Langhorst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), but did not have a significant effect on Hh secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to Wg and Hh, release of a secreted form of luciferase was not affected by reggie-1 transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>), demonstrating that reggie-1 did not non-specifically stimulate exocytosis.</p><p>We wondered whether the effects of reggie-1 on morphogen secretion could be masked by re-uptake by the cultured cells. Indeed, immunostaining Wg-secreting cells revealed higher intracellular Wg levels upon reggie-1 transfection (not shown). This could be explained by enhanced retention/re-uptake of Wg by the reggie-1-transfected cells. Alternatively, reggie-1 overexpression in the Wg-producing cell could change the properties of this Wg, such that it became more uptakable by surrounding cells regardless of their own reggie-1 levels.</p><p>To discriminate between these possibilities, we separately transfected S2 cells with Wg plus reggie-1 (or Wg plus control) and DsRed or EGFP (for independent labelling) and co-cultured these lines. We then analysed whether the co-cultured cells could uptake Wg differently depending on its source. We found a dramatically higher uptake of Wg by DsRed cells when Wg was provided by the reggie-1-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). To prove that this intracellular Wg staining resulted from endocytosis, we performed pulse&#x02013;chase assays with fluorescent dextran beads and found that Wg provided by reggie-1-expressing cells colocalized with dextran in early endocytic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F</xref>) whose particulate appearance was reminiscent of the punctate staining seen in wing discs. In contrast, Wg obtained from control-transfected cells was poorly endocytosed by the co-cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5G</xref>). We could also demonstrate that reggie-1 overexpression did not increase Wg uptake cell-autonomously: overexpression of reggie-1 in the cells co-cultured with Wg-producing cells did not increase Wg uptake by these co-cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5H</xref>). Thus, reggie-1 overexpression was changing the properties of Wg in the Wg-producing cells, such that this Wg became markedly more internalizable by the co-cultured cells. This conclusion agrees well with our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations.</p><p>Such increased uptake of Wg might be solely due to enhanced secretion of Wg by reggie-1-overexpressing cells, or also due to a molecular change in the form Wg is secreted. For example, reggie-1 overexpression could enhance Wg packing into lipoprotein particles. To investigate this possibility, we performed sucrose-density ultracentrifugation of the Wg medium from reggie-1- or control-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). We found that Wg had identical migration in sucrose gradients in both samples and peaked at the density of approximately 1.24 g/ml; identical results were obtained using GFP-Wg and non-tagged Wg. No signal was detected at the level of lipoprotein particles, which migrate close to the top of the gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Panakova <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), despite the fact that the cells were cultured in the presence of bovine serum which contains lipoprotein particles of various sorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chapman, 1986</xref>). However, it is possible that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wg can principally not pack into serum lipoprotein particles. The high density of the Wg signal probably reflects Wg multimers; it is heavier than exosomes, which have the density of approximately 1.13 g/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fevrier and Raposo, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in the cell culture we find an effect of reggie-1 on Wg and Hh secretion. Wg produced by reggie-1-transfected cells is more prone to uptake by surrounding cells; the resulting Wg accumulation in early endosomes is similar to the punctate Wg localization stimulated by reggie-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The nature of Wg produced by cultured cells is probably multimers, reminiscent of the form mammalian Hh is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hh diffusion and target gene expression is affected by reggie-1, whereas Dpp and GFP-GPI are not</title><p>The cell culture experiments demonstrate that reggie-1 affects secretion of Wg and Hh, but not luciferase, whereas <italic>in vivo</italic> reggie-1 controls Wg secretion and spreading.

Cubitus interruptus (Ci) is a crucial transducer of Hh signalling and exists in multiple forms.

We found dramatic Hh phenotypes: massive infiltration of Hh into the dorsal anterior domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B&#x02032;&#x02032;</xref>), and as a result strong thickening of the high-Hh response region expressing Ptc and Ci<sup>&#x0002a;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B&#x02032; and B&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02032;&#x02032;</xref>).

In adult wings, the outcome was the broadening of the region between veins 3 and 4 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref> for overexpression of reggie-1 by <italic>en-Gal4</italic>, another posterior expression line). Reggie-1 also induced a dramatic upregulation of extracellular Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6F and D</xref>) and enhanced spreading of extracellular Hh into the anterior domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D&#x02032; and F&#x02032;</xref>). Thus, similar to our findings concerning the Wg gradient formation, we find that overexpression of reggie-1 increases Hh secretion and spreading, changing the pattern of expression of Hh targets.</p><p>We next investigated Hh diffusion and signalling in <italic>reggie-1</italic> loss-of-function. There was a slight reduction in the extracellular Hh in <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6H</xref>) as compared with wild-type discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6F</xref>) stained in parallel.

The wild-type Wg gradient in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc can be modelled using the experimentally determined parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kicheva <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>); the threshold Wg concentrations for short- and long-range targets can be roughly set based on the known sizes of Sens and Dll expression domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). We can now simulate the effects of reggie-1 on Wg by varying the diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic>: a fivefold decrease in <italic>D</italic> could faithfully model the Wg phenotypes of reggie-1 loss of function, whereas a fivefold increase in <italic>D</italic> could simulate the Wg phenotypes of reggie-1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A and B</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments clearly show an important role of reggie-1 for formation of the Wg and Hh gradients. However, the functional consequences of changes in reggie-1 levels differed between the two morphogens. For example, overexpression of reggie-1 led to reduction of the Wg short-range targets but expanded the Hh short-range targets. We hypothesized that some of these differences were due to different production levels of Wg and Hh: Wg is produced by a narrow stripe of cells along the dorso-ventral boundary, whereas Hh is produced by the whole posterior half of the disc. Indeed, modelling predicts that broadening of the Wg production zone threefold, with a subsequent fivefold increase in the diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic>, will result not in a reduction, but broadening of the short-range targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>); a reciprocal narrowing of the Hh production zone with a concomitant increase of the diffusion coefficient predicts a Wg-like behaviour and reduction in the short-range targets.</p><p>To test these predictions, we induced Wg production in the broad zone of the <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> line. This massive misexpression of Wg induced ectopic Sens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7D</xref>) and Dll expression (not shown). We next co-overexpressed reggie-1 and Wg by <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic>. As expected from the earlier experiments, this resulted in broader diffusion of the ectopic Wg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E</xref>); further, a more punctate Wg staining was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E&#x02032;&#x02032; and D&#x02032;&#x02032;</xref>). As predicted, this broadly produced Wg co-overexpressed with reggie-1 was now fully capable of inducing the short-range target Sens, in a domain broader than when induced by Wg alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E&#x02032; and D&#x02032;</xref>). Thus, provided that Wg is in excess, its enhanced mobility does not lead to loss of the short-range targets.</p><p>In the case of Hh, we performed the reciprocal experiment reducing Hh amounts. Previous overexpression of reggie-1 by <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> was performed at 17&#x000b0;C and diminished the Hh-producing domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). At 25&#x000b0;C reggie-1 overexpression was higher and the posterior domain became even smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7F</xref>). Hh spread deeper into the anterior compartment of such discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). Importantly, we found that expression of the intermediate target Col was dramatically narrowed in <italic>hh-Gal4; UAS-reggie-1</italic> discs grown at 25&#x000b0;C, while the domain of the long-range target Ci-155 was significantly broadened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7F&#x02032; and F&#x02032;&#x02032;</xref>). These changes in expression of short-range versus long-range targets are very similar to what we see when endogenous Wg targets are analysed upon overexpression of reggie-1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the differential activities of reggie-1 on short-range versus long-range targets of Wg and Hh are determined by the properties of these morphogens, such as the broadness of their production zone. Reggie-1 controls spreading efficiency, but not formation of a particular signalling form of the morphogens, which would be able to induce only long-range targets and not short-range targets.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>With their dual lipid modifications, Wnt and Hh morphogens would be predicted to travel poorly through the extracellular space. Yet they are able to act over long distances, suggesting that specific mechanisms facilitating their spreading must exist, as well as alternative secretion pathways in the morphogen-producing cells, resulting in release of the poorly diffusive and the more mobile pools of the morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Panakova <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Coudreuse and Korswagen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hausmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, it is unclear how morphogen secretion can be directed for one or the other of the alternative secretion routes.</p><p>Here we show that reggie-1/flotillin-2 plays an important role in the morphogen-producing cells, promoting secretion and long-range spreading of Wg and Hh in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc and cell culture. Reggie-1 appears to be specific for these lipid-modified morphogens, as it neither affected spreading of Dpp and GPI-linked GFP in wing discs, nor secretion of an unrelated protein (luciferase) in cultured cells.</p><p>The net secretion of Wg and Hh can be stimulated by reggie-1 <italic>in vivo</italic> and in cell culture, whereas changes in the morphogen gradient shapes cannot be explained solely by changes in the morphogen secretion rates. For example, overexpression of reggie-1 erodes the Wg gradient, resulting in a loss of the short-range but not long-range targets, whereas loss of reggie-1 makes the gradient steeper, narrowing the domain of expression of the long-range targets, but not affecting the short-range target genes. From Equation 1 it becomes clear that an increase in the secretion rate can only shift the gradient curve on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref> to the right, to the same extent as broadening of the morphogen production zone achieves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>), but cannot erode the gradient. Modelling shows that only an increase in the diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic> can erode the gradient such that short-range targets are lost whereas long-range are not, and only a decrease in <italic>D</italic> can make the gradient steeper such that the long-range targets are narrowed whereas the short-range are unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Thus, reggie-1 does change the way Wg and Hh morphogens are released, promoting their packing for the long-range spreading. The Wg phenotypes we observe in discs can be modelled <italic>in silico</italic> by changing the effective diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic> fivefold (up for reggie-1 overexpression and down for loss-of-function), giving an idea how significantly reggie-1 changes spreading properties of the morphogens. We predict that reggie-1 stands on one of the two alternative secretion pathways, and thus overexpression of reggie-1 also results in enhanced net secretion. Thus, reggie-1 becomes the first protein identified, which is specifically required within the morphogen-producing cell for secretion of the long-range-spreading forms of Wg and Hh.</p><p>Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, reggie-1 affects the number and intensity of intracellular Wg puncta, which in the cell culture colocalize with dextran beads and can be identified as endosomes. Enhanced endocytosis would be expected to impede morphogen spreading through the tissue, rather than promote it. However, we think that the enhanced endocytosis of Wg we see upon reggie-1 overexpression (or reduced upon reggie-1 loss-of-function), is a secondary effect of the reggie-1 action on morphogen secretion and spreading. Indeed, increased secretion of Wg by the producing cells should already be sufficient to see more Wg endocytosed by the Wg-receiving cells. Moreover, enhanced spreading of the morphogen through the tissue due to increased mobility would allow detect Wg-containing endosomes in Wg-receiving cells further away from the source of production. Thus, the number and brightness of the Wg-containing intracellular puncta is rather a consequence and readout of Wg secretion and spreading under the control of reggie-1.</p><p>It is not clear whether reggie-1 promotes packing of Wg and Hh into lipoprotein particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Panakova <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) or high-order multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), or into another yet unidentified form promoting efficient spreading. Our experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> suggest that Wg is multimerized by cultured cells. In wing discs, loss of reggie-1 produces stronger phenotypes on Wg long-range target activation than the previously reported loss of lipoprotein particles: a threefold reduction in Dll expression is observed in <italic>reggie-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4K</xref>), compared with a slight decrease in the lipoprotein-RNAi animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Panakova <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, additional experiments are required to determine whether the S2 cells-derived Wg could associate with lipoprotein particles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (rather than serum) origin, and whether <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of reggie-1 are lipoprotein-dependent or not. It is also possible that the reggie-dependent pathway is redundant with another way of long-range morphogen spreading, and removal of both might produce additive effects.</p><p>It is also possible that the reggie-dependent pathway may utilize additional reggie-related proteins. Reggie-2 is unstable in the absence of reggie-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoehne <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Solis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and reggie-2 overexpression or loss-of-function produces no phenotypes ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoehne <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and this work). However, a certain redundancy with other members of the SPFH (Stomatin/Prohibitin/Flotilin/HflK/C) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Tavernarakis <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) might be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Langhorst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Eleven <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes, including reggie-1 and -2, are listed in InterPro as encoding proteins with the SPFH domain (also known as Band 7 domain); most of these genes are poorly studied and described in the Flybase as components of the cytoskeleton based on electronic annotation.</p><p>Reggie-1 and possibly other members of the SPFH family function as protein platforms for organizing specific types of membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Langhorst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Stuermer and Plattner, 2005</xref>). Based on our observations, we can speculate that association of Wg and Hh with reggie-1-based membrane microdomains is crucial for the efficient formation of the mobile forms of these morphogens. We could observe partial colocalization of Wg and reggie-1 in cultured cells, but the exact identification of the intracellular compartment(s), where reggie-1-dependent secretion of Wg and Hh occurs, requires additional investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, we have uncovered an important function of the membrane microdomain-scaffolding protein reggie-1 in secretion and gradient formation of the lipid-modified Wg and Hh morphogens in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Reggie-1 is the first protein identified, which is specifically required <italic>in cis</italic> for the long-range-directed spreading of these morphogens.
