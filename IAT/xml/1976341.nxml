The molecular processes that govern and facilitate this mitochondrial translation remain unclear. Many key factors have yet to be characterized&#x02014;for example, those required for translation termination. All other systems have two classes of release factors that either promote codon-specific hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA (class I) or lack specificity but stimulate the dissociation of class I factors from the ribosome (class II). One human mitochondrial protein has been previously identified in silico as a putative member of the class I release factors. Although we could not confirm the function of this factor, we report the identification of a different mitochondrial protein, mtRF1a, that is capable in vitro and in vivo of terminating translation at UAA/UAG codons. Further, mtRF1a depletion in HeLa cells led to&#x000a0;compromised growth in galactose and increased production of reactive oxygen species.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A central mitochondrial function is that of oxidative phosphorylation, the process of coupling respiration to ATP production. Thirteen of the polypeptides critical for this function are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Mitochondrial protein synthesis is therefore central to the life of aerobic eukaryotic cells; however, our understanding of mammalian mitochondrial gene expression is far from complete, particularly concerning the mechanisms governing mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is essential that we redress this situation, as it has become increasingly clear that defects of mitochondrial translation constitute an important subset of mitochondrial disorders (<xref rid="bib11 bib20 bib25 bib36 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Coenen et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Jacobs and Turnbull, 2005; Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Smeitink et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Valente et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial translation apparatus employs a different codon usage from the universal code, with some species decoding AUA as methionine and the majority converting the universal STOP codon UGA into a tryptophan. Thus, most mitochondrial translation systems have reduced the number of termination codons from three to two (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Elzanowski and Ostell, 2000</xref>). Although the human mitochondrial code also employs these two changes, it varies still further by commandeering two additional termination codons, AGA and AGG, that would conventionally encode arginine (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barrell et&#x000a0;al., 1979</xref>). Once the translation complex has reached a termination codon, the completed protein must be dissociated from the final tRNA, the ribosome, and its cognate mRNA. The proteins responsible for fulfilling these functions are the release factors (RFs), of which there are two classes (for review, see <xref rid="bib21 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kisselev et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Poole and Tate, 2000</xref>). Class I is codon specific with peptide motifs that distinguish the STOP codons. In prokaryotic RFs, this is an SPF or PXT tripeptide motif (<xref rid="bib19 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ito et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Nakamura et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). There is also a GGQ loop/motif facilitating the termination of translation by hydrolysis of the ester bond between the tRNA and the nascent polypeptide (<xref rid="bib15 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Frolova et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Seit-Nebi et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). Eubacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic release factors differ in their class I constituents. Eubacteria utilize three STOP codons and require two release factors, RF1 and RF2. Both recognize UAA, but RF1 also interacts with UAG and RF2 with UGA. Thus, although each bacterial RF recognizes a pair of STOP codons, both are necessary for appropriate translation termination of the entire mRNA population. Most eukaryota and archaebacteria utilize the same three stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA), but each organism requires only a single omnipotent protein, named eRF1 or aRF1, respectively, that can recognize all three STOP triplets (<xref rid="bib15 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Frolova et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Konecki et&#x000a0;al., 1977</xref>). This leaves the intriguing question of whether human mitochondria resemble more closely the eukaryota and archaebacteria and have evolved a single release factor that can recognize all four codons that are used, or whether they follow the eubacterial paradigm of two RFs, each recognizing a pair of stop codons, which would more closely reflect their &#x003b1;-proteobacterial origins.</p><p>Thus far, no human mitochondrial release factor has been characterized. A candidate, mtRF1, was proposed several years ago from bioinformatic analyses (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Spremulli, 1998</xref>) and has since been assimilated into the scientific literature (for example, <xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib6 bib8 bib16 bib21 bib29 bib31 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Antonicka et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Askarian-Amiri et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Bulygin et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Chavatte et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Frolova et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Kisselev et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Oparina et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Petry et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Smeitink et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Class I release factors of the RF1 type contain a PXT tripeptide motif responsible for codon recognition. Human mtRF1, however, exhibits a hexapeptide PEVGLS across this region.</p><p>Here we report that we have now identified an alternative gene product with greater similarity across the tripeptide recognition motif of the bacterial RF1. Moreover, we ascribe mitochondrial localization and release activity to this protein, mtRF1a, which exhibits specific recognition of the main codons used, UAA and UAG, consistent with it being a release factor in human mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Human mtRF1 Is a Mitochondrial Protein</title><p>A number of papers now state that human mitochondria have a single release factor, mtRF1, which was identified <italic>in silico</italic> a number of years ago (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Spremulli, 1998</xref>). To identify whether this protein is indeed mitochondrial, we generated a GFP fusion construct C-terminal to the predicted mtRF1 N-terminal targeting sequence. HeLa cells were transiently transfected and after 24 hr were treated with mitotracker-CMH<sub>2</sub>X ROS to visualize the mitochondria. Concordance of the fluorescence signals indicated mitochondrial localization of the fusion protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Does Human mtRF1 Function as a Release Factor?</title><p>To assess whether mtRF1 could function as a release factor, we adopted an in vitro and an in vivo approach. In vitro release factor assays were performed essentially as established by Caskey and colleagues (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Caskey et&#x000a0;al., 1971</xref>). Briefly, ribosomes were incubated with AUG synthetic triplet and f[<sup>3</sup>H]Met-tRNA<sup>Met</sup> to load the ribosomal P site prior to addition of purified mtRF1 and the synthetic stop codon to be assessed. Free f[<sup>3</sup>H]Met was then quantified to indicate release activity. The exact size of the N-terminal presequence that might be cleaved from the full-length protein upon mitochondrial import is unknown, and predictions from targeting programmes vary from 17&#x000a0;up to 70 residues. Moreover, sequence alignment indicates that the first 63 amino acids of the mtRF1 N-terminal extension do not align with the bacterial RF1. Therefore, to simulate possible mature polypeptides without the loss of recognized functional domains, two proteins carrying N-terminal truncations and increased solubility, mtRF1&#x00394;49 and mtRF1&#x00394;69 (data not shown), were purified. These were tested against the universal and mitochondrial-specific stop codons, but no activity could be detected with UAA, AGA, or AGG codons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B).</p><p>For in vivo studies, we assessed whether human mtRF1 could suppress the phenotype caused by loss of the endogenous release factor from yeast. Mutations of <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae MRF1</italic> cause a respiratory dysfunction associated with the loss of intact mtDNA (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pel et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). Such mtDNA instability is known to result from defects in the general mitochondrial translation machinery (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Myers et&#x000a0;al., 1985</xref>). Expression of the entire human <italic>mtRF1</italic> cDNA in a heterozygous &#x00394;<italic>mrf1 rho<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> diploid, followed by sporulation, did not yield any <italic>&#x00394;mrf1</italic> spores that could grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (glycerol, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). Similarly, there was no restoration of cytochrome spectra, consistent with a lack of mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory complex assembly (data not shown). In fact, the <italic>&#x00394;mrf1</italic> spores producing human mtRF1 could still not maintain their mtDNA. This raised the possibility that complementation occurred but was too weak to allow mtDNA maintenance, thus preventing nonfermentable growth. To address this problem, a new <italic>mrf1</italic>-deleted strain was engineered in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, a <italic>petite</italic>-negative yeast, for which mtDNA loss events are highly counterselected. The &#x00394;<italic>mrf1Sp</italic> strain showed reduced growth at 28&#x000b0;C on galactose, which forces respiration, and it stopped growing at 36&#x000b0;C on the same medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D, see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>B in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> available with this article online) but retained mtDNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). Transfectants of this strain expressing the cDNA encoding human mtRF1 were also unable to respire, and there was no restoration of growth on glycerol/ethanol or galactose, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D, despite the presence of an intact mtDNA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Identification of an Alternative Candidate Human Mitochondrial Release Factor</title><p>The lack of release activity in vitro could have been due to the necessity to use the heterologous bacterial 70S ribosomes rather than 55S mitoribosomes. To date, it has not been possible to establish a reproducible in vitro assay with mammalian mitoribosomes, unlike with yeast components (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Askarian-Amiri et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>), perhaps explained by recent cryo-electron microscopy studies, which have revealed that isolated mammalian mitoribosomes retain deacylated mt-tRNA in the P site (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Second, the failure of mtRF1 to restore respiration in either of the yeast &#x00394;<italic>mrf1</italic> strains may be explained by yeast Mrf1p recognizing only UAA/UAG as termination codons (as all yeast mt-mRNAs contain UAA or UAG as stop codons), while those recognized by the human mtRF1 could potentially be AGG and AGA. If this is the case, then there may be a second human mitochondrial release factor. Searching of the human databases revealed a second candidate that we will call mtRF1a (UniprotKB/TrEMBL Q96EX4). This predicted polypeptide of 380 amino acids shows an overall sequence identity of approximately 42% with mtRF1, 34% with yeast mRFs (<italic>S. pombe</italic>, <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>K. lactis</italic>), 40% with bacterial RF1s, and 41% similarity to the RF from a close evolutionary relative <italic>R. prowazeckii</italic> (<xref rid="bib2 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Andersson et&#x000a0;al., 1998; Gray, 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). Moreover, mtRF1a contains a PXT motif that&#x000a0;more closely resembles other RF1s, containing the triamino acid recognition motif PKT, rather than the hexapeptide sequence in mtRF1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>As with mtRF1, a C-terminal GFP fusion protein construct was generated for mtRF1a and transiently transfected into HeLa cells before staining with mitotracker after 24 hr. Mitochondrial targeting was shown by colocalization of the fluorescence signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). To confirm intramitochondrial uptake, import experiments were performed with in vitro-translated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled mtRF1a and isolated mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>). Import was shown to be dependent on a mitochondrial membrane potential (FCCP, lanes 4 and 5) and resulted in cleavage of the presequence (lanes 2 and 3). The matured protein was resistant to added Proteinase K, confirming mitochondrial uptake (lane 3).</p><p>Any factor involved in mitochondrial protein translation would be predicted to be present in all cell types. Antisera were raised against purified recombinant mtRF1a and affinity purified. Mitochondrial protein isolated from human skeletal muscle and a variety of human cell lines were analyzed by western analysis, and mtRF1a was found to be ubiquitous (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C). Further, by comparison of HeLa extracts against a standard curve of purified mtRF1a, we were able to calculate approximately 30,000 molecules per cell (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Human mtRF1a Is a Translation Release Factor</title><p>Purified recombinant mtRF1a was tested in the termination assay described above. Initial assays showed release of f[<sup>3</sup>H]Met when either UAA or UAG was used as a synthetic stop codon, confirming that mtRF1a could function as a release factor. Assay conditions were optimized for the human mitochondrial release factor (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). Using these assay parameters, the human recombinant mtRF1a was interrogated with a full panel of codons. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D clearly demonstrates that mtRF1a mediated codon-specific release of f[<sup>3</sup>H]Met from the termination complex. There is significant recognition of UAA and UAG stop codons by human mtRF1a but only residual noncatalytic levels comparable to those obtained when no codon was present for the noncognate stops AGA and AGG. Crucially, the UGA codon, encoding tryptophan in the human mitochondrion, did not stimulate release activity. Elongating the stop codon 3&#x02032; to include three further adenosine&#x000a0;residues to mimic the context with the poly(A) tail&#x000a0;made no significant change to the release activity observed.</p><p>Although the human mtDNA utilizes four triplet sequences as stop signals, the usage is not evenly distributed at the end of the 13 mitochondrial open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et&#x000a0;al., 1981</xref>). The noncanonical AGA and AGG stops are used only once each, for <italic>MTCOI</italic> and by <italic>MTND6</italic>, respectively. Of the remaining 11 ORFs, <italic>MTCO2</italic> and <italic>MTATP8</italic> employ UAG as stop codons, and the final nine all use UAA encoded directly by the genome or completed by the addition of a poly(A) tail. Thus, 11 of the 13 transcripts utilize stop signals recognized by human mtRF1a.</p><p>In vivo analyses were performed concomitantly. Complementation by human mtRF1a was assessed in both &#x00394;<italic>mrf1</italic> yeast strains as described for mtRF1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>). Western blots of cell fractions confirmed the mitochondrial localization of the human protein in yeast, albeit at different level to wild-type. Whereas only a faint mtRF1a signal was detected in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria, a strong signal was obtained in <italic>S. pombe</italic> mitochondria, with a small fraction of protein being detected in the postmitochondrial fraction, suggesting that in <italic>S. pombe</italic> the human protein was either better expressed, more stable, and/or more efficiently imported into mitochondria (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>A). In contrast to expression of mtRF1, the presence of human mtRF1a was sufficient to stably maintain mtDNA in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> &#x00394;<italic>mrf1</italic> strain (data not shown) and restore growth on respiratory substrates for both yeasts (glycerol for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A; galactose and glycerol at 28&#x000b0;C for <italic>S. pombe</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B; and 36&#x000b0;C on galactose for <italic>S.&#x000a0;pombe</italic>, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>B), consistent with the observed increase in cytochromes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B, right-hand panels) and partial restoration of steady-state levels of mitochondrial proteins (Cox2, Cyt <italic>b</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C).</p><p>Mitochondrial translation in several <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains was also monitored by in vivo <sup>35</sup>S labeling of mitochondrial proteins. No de novo synthesis was detected in the deletion mutant. In contrast, the isogenic strain producing the wild-type yeast Mrf1p exhibited high levels of protein synthesis. Production of the human mtRF1a also resulted in mitochondrial translation, albeit at decreased levels when compared to the wild-type strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D). These data confirm that mtRF1a can function to restore translation in yeast strains deficient in endogenous mitochondrial translation termination factors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Depletion of Human mtRF1a Causes a Growth Phenotype</title><p>To determine the role of human mtRF1a in the mitochondrion, siRNA was used to deplete the factor in HeLa cells. Three siRNA molecules were designed to different positions of the mtRF1a transcript, and each was shown to decrease the steady-state level of the release factor by more than 75% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). Crude analysis of cell proliferation revealed lower levels of confluency when cells were monitored for 6 days with each siRNA independently (data not shown). As the three siRNA duplexes gave a similar phenotype, all subsequent experiments were performed with siRNA 2 alone. Detailed cell counts were then performed for siRNA2- or nontargeted siRNA-treated HeLa cells cultured in standard DMEM-promoting glycolysis or glucose-free media supplemented with galactose to force dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. As can be seen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A), the siRNA2-treated cells showed an increase in population doubling time, which was particularly marked when cells were forced to respire in the galactose media.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Depletion of mtRF1a Does Not Affect the Steady-State Levels of Mitochondrially Encoded RNA or Protein</title><p>To explore the exact mechanism causing this phenotype, we analyzed mitochondrially encoded RNA and protein. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref> shows that the steady states of the mitochondrially encoded members of the OXPHOS complexes I (ND6) and IV (COXI and COXII) were virtually unaffected after 3&#x000a0;or&#x000a0;6 days of siRNA-mediated mtRF1a knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). This was consistent with the absence of any effect on de novo mitochondrial protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B). One corollary was that nascent polypeptides remained associated with ribosomes, affecting the assembly of the nascent polypeptide into OXPHOS complexes. Thus, to assess the levels of fully assembled complexes, Blue Native PAGE was employed. After separation of intact complexes, no apparent difference was seen in the steady-state level or migration of these multisubunit enzymes (complexes I, III, and IV, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C), suggesting that nascent peptides are eventually released from the ribosome.</p><p>Although the levels of OXPHOS complexes were similar, it was possible that electron transfer rates or coupling to ATP synthesis was affected, causing the growth phenotype. Polarographic analysis of control and siRNA-treated cells was performed, and results are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D. No significant differences in coupled or uncoupled rates of electron transfer were found, and the respiratory control ratios were comparable between samples, again consistent with release of the nascent and assembled polypeptide from the ribosome.</p><p>Critically, a previous report has demonstrated that loss of an mt-mRNA termination codon does not prevent protein synthesis, complex formation, or activity (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Temperley et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it appears that neither loss of the termination codon nor depletion of the release factor has an effect on the steady-state or de novo synthesis of human mitochondrial proteins. In those transcripts lacking termination codons, there was marked translation-dependent degradation of the poly(A) tail and rapid turnover (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Temperley et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Northern analysis (data not shown) and MPAT assays on <italic>MTCO1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>MTND1</italic>, <italic>3</italic> transcripts, however, confirmed that depletion of mtRF1a caused no&#x000a0;effect on mt-mRNA stability or poly(A) tail length (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>Depletion of mtRF1a Causes Increased Mitochondrial ROS Production, Mitochondrial Mass, and mtDNA Copy Number</title><p>The role of a release factor is to promote hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the nascent peptide to the terminal tRNA. Hydrolysis can occur independent of the factor, which would potentially make the release factor redundant, but this noncatalytic rate is believed to be relatively slow (W.T., unpublished data). Moreover, peptidyl-tRNA can also &#x0201c;drop off&#x0201d; the ribosome (reviewed in <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Das and Varshney, 2006</xref>), and a recent report of a human mitochondrial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, PTH2 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">De Pereda et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), suggests this enzyme would hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA complex, allowing the recycling of the tRNA. It is therefore difficult to predict the exact defect that would occur on depletion of the factor in human mitochondria. Our initial data showed that a growth phenotype was apparent, but this was not due to any dramatic effect on mt-mRNA stability, protein synthesis, OXPHOS complex assembly, or function. If, however, newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins are not being perfectly assembled, the activity of some OXPHOS complexes may be subtly compromised, resulting in electron escape during the natural electron transfer and generating increased reactive oxygen species. Superoxide and peroxide production in the mitochondria were therefore measured with mitoSOX and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), respectively, at day 3 of siRNA-mediated mtRF1a depletion. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B shows a significant increase of these levels over control, which was maintained through to day 6 (data not shown).</p><p>Increased ROS has recently been implicated as a messenger for increased mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Moreno-Loshuertos et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Levels of mitochondrial cardiolipin (quantified using NAO) and mtDNA copy number were assessed as a measure of increased mitochondrial bulk/mass. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, a significant increase was also noted using both methods, consistent with mtRF1a depletion causing an increase in mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial mass. To use mtDNA copy number per cell as an indicator of mitochondrial mass, DNA was isolated from HeLa cells following exposure to the nontargeting and mtRF1a-directed siRNAs and real-time PCR employed to quantify mtDNA (ND1) relative to nuclear DNA (18S rDNA) (see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>). After depletion of mtRF1a by siRNA, there was a relative 2.2-fold increase in the mtDNA levels compared to untreated controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, mt/nuc), consistent with the 1.6-fold increase identified with NAO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, NAO).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report the characterization of a human mitochondrial translation release factor, mtRF1a, based on the following criteria: (1) sequence similarity to known release factors; (2) mitochondrial localization, import, and cleavage of the preprotein; (3) presence in mitochondria of all cell types and tissues tested; (4) demonstration of release factor activity in vitro with <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes; (5) rescue of the &#x00394;<italic>mrf1</italic> respiratory deficiency in fission and budding yeast in vivo; and (6) demonstration of a growth phenotype in mtRF1a-depleted human cells. Scrutiny of the primary structure of mtRF1a reveals similarities to the many other release factor sequences retaining the classic GGQ tripeptide of the peptidyl-tRNA interaction site in the M domain (<xref rid="bib15 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Frolova et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Song et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). There is greater similarity to the eubacterial RF1-type factors than to the omnipotent eRF1, consistent with this protein recognizing only UAA and UAG codons. Human mtRF1a showed no activity with UGA as codon. There are two class I release factors in most prokaryotes. Both are able to decode UAA, while UAG and UGA are recognized by only RF1 or RF2, respectively. It has previously been shown that the basis of this sequence discrimination is due to a tripeptide sequence in a structurally similar region, PXT in RF1 types or SPF for RF2 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ito et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). MtRF1a carries PKT at position 206&#x02013;208, rather than the hexapeptide found in mtRF1, consistent with this being an RF1-type release factor, terminating protein synthesis at UAA and UAG codons.</p><p>Is mtRF1 a mitochondrial release factor? The identification of mtRF1 was skillfully made through bioinformatic mining of an EST database but without any data to support either localization or function (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Spremulli, 1998</xref>). We have now shown that both mtRF1 and mtRF1a are localized to mitochondria, but only mtRF1a was capable of decoding UAA/UAG codons in our assays. Furthermore, addition of mtRF1 to release assays programmed either with mtRF1a or <italic>E. coli</italic> RF1 failed to compete for the ribosomal A site when UAG/UAA were present, suggesting that mtRF1 was unable to recognize these codons (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>). Although for mtRF1 neither detectable in vitro release activity nor suppression of a respiratory deficiency of the yeast &#x00394;<italic>mrf1</italic> was observed, we hypothesize that it is indeed a mitochondrial release factor and is responsible for decoding the noncognate stop codons AGG and AGA. The absence of release activity with the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes may be due to the imposed use of a heterologous assay system, as the <italic>E. coli</italic> system does not naturally terminate with either codon. Sequence comparisons provide a compelling case for this hypothesis, since it contains the GGQ domain, has strong sequence similarity to other RF1-type proteins, and has a three residue extension immediately C-terminal to the PXT domain that is absent in all comparators (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that may underlie AGA/AGG decoding. Further, since yeast exclusively use UAA/UAG as stop codons, this could explain the lack of observed complementation in vivo.</p><p>In vivo and in vitro studies showed that mtRF1a does possess release factor activity. Expression in yeast strains devoid of their endogenous release factor restored mitochondrial translation, indicating ability to decode UAA/UAG, while depletion in human cells led to a growth phenotype and elevated ROS production. How might the loss of mtRF1a lead to increased ROS? The major source of cellular ROS is the mitochondrial electron transfer chain, in particular at the sites of electron transfer to and from respiratory complexes I and III. All 13 polypeptides encoded by the human mtDNA are members of four of the five complexes that couple oxidative phosphorylation. These complexes contain many polypeptides imported from the cytosol and integrated together with the mitochondrially encoded proteins in a complicated and incompletely understood process of assembly. The 13 mitochondrial polypeptides are highly hydrophobic, being putatively translated at the membrane surface and nursed by the membrane protein Oxa1 that aids in the assembly process (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Spremulli, 2000</xref>). In the absence of translation termination, nascent proteins will be inserted into the membrane but will also still be attached to the ribosome via the P site bound peptidyl-tRNA. It is understood that this ester bond can be spontaneously hydrolyzed over time, but release factor activity at the ribosome dramatically accelerates this natural process (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schmeing et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). However, it is possible that subtle temporal effects on the assembly process following siRNA-mediated knockdown may lead to assembled complexes with minor defects in electron transfer, leading to increased loss of electrons in the form of ROS. A similar situation has recently been reported for <italic>trans</italic>-mitochondrial murine cybrids, in which the same mtDNA polymorphism in different nuclear backgrounds led to modulations in ROS production and mitochondrial cell mass without any dramatic effect on OXPHOS complex activities (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Moreno-Loshuertos et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). A second possibility, that we have discounted, is that the ribosome might stall at the termination site and in the absence of a release factor shift-reading frame, leading to C-terminal extensions mainly of polylysine due to the proximity of the poly(A) tail. First, in the only characterization of a human mt-mRNA lacking a termination codon, the mt-mRNA was rapidly degraded following translation, probably due to the translating ribosome pushing away the natural poly(A)-associated protein(s) leaving naked RNA prone to RNase digestion (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Temperley et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). In the study presented here, there is no evidence of decreased mt-mRNA stability. Second, although only short polylysine extensions would be predicted to be added to most mitochondrial polypeptides, ATPase 8, in contrast, would increase substantially in size, as it is translated from the 5&#x02032; part of the bicistronic <italic>RNA14</italic>. Following depletion of mtRF1a, there is no evidence of increased size in this or any newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins. Third, when we have used an antibody specific to polylysine, we do not see any new mitochondrial products (data not shown).</p><p>In summary, we report the identification and biochemical characterization of a human mitochondrial translation release factor, mtRF1a, that decodes the major stop codons UAA and UAG. This should now be included in the growing list of mitochondrial translation factors, mutations of which could underlie the mitochondrial dysfunction in an increasing number of patients for whom nuclear-encoded mutations have yet to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Production of GFP and GST Fusion Constructs and Cloning into Yeast Expression Vectors</title><p>Exact details of primers and construct design are given in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Yeast Growth Conditions, Plasmid and General Strain Constructions, and Complementation Assays</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study are detailed in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>.</p><p>Yeast media, general genetic techniques, and transformation protocols were as described in <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chiron et&#x000a0;al.

HeLa cells (1&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) grown in targeted (siRNA2-mtRF1a) and untargeted (siRNA-N) siRNA for 3 days were subjected to high-resolution respirometry as detailed. Standard errors were calculated from three measures of respiratory control and capacity. UCR compares the fully uncoupled and resting respiratory rates to give an indication of the respiratory reserve and RCR compares the fully uncoupled respiratory rates to the oligomycin inhibited state 4 respiratory rate, while RCRp combines these ratios to indicate the level of phosphorylation-related respiratory capacity.</p><p>(E) The poly(A) tail of mitochondrial mRNA is unaffected by depletion of mtRF1a.
