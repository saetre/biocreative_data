The recruitment of immune cells into the damaged kidney is a main feature of many renal diseases. These infiltrating inflammatory cells (monocytes/macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils) mediate the initiation and progression of damage by direct cytotoxicity, the secretion of soluble factors, such as proinflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases, and growth factors, which modulate the local response and increase inflammation within the damage of kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005406-Eddy1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. However, regulation renal inflammation is complex, involving activation of transcription factors and induction of chemokines and other proinflammatory mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005406-Inan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005406-Segerer1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data implicates that the proinflammatory properties of Ang-(1&#x02013;7) and the Mas receptor in the kidney are primarily stimulated by a local activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, and the upregulation of proinflammatory genes under its control, like MCP-1 and IL-6, rather than by systemic effects as stimulating bone marrow-based progenitors of inflammatory cells. This conclusion is also supported by direct stimulating effects of the heptapeptide on cultured renal cells to stimulate the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and related genes.</p><p>Importantly, Ang-(1&#x02013;7) stimulates proinflammatory factors independently from Ang II receptors. Furthermore, the absence of renal Mas significantly brakes their stimulation of NF-&#x003ba;B and downstream factors and blunts the stimulatory effects of Ang-(1&#x02013;7). While some experimental studies based on the interference with chemokine expression or inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B have shown beneficial effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005406-Esteban1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005406-Segerer2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, under certain circumstances, this may worsen the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005406-Segerer3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.
