As mammalian cells cannot synthesize folates <italic>de novo</italic>, tightly regulated cellular uptake processes have evolved to sustain sufficient levels of intracellular tetrahydrofolate cofactors to support biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and some amino acids (serine, methionine). Though reduced-folate carrier (RFC) is one of the major proteins mediating folate transport, knowledge of the developmental expression of RFC is lacking. We utilized <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunolocalization to determine the developmental distribution of RFC message and protein, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the mouse, RFC transcripts and protein are expressed in the E10.0 placenta and yolk sac. In the E9.0 to E11.5 mouse embryo RFC is widely detectable, with intense signal localized to cell populations in the neural tube, craniofacial region, limb buds and heart. During early development, RFC is expressed throughout the eye, but by E12.5, RFC protein becomes localized to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Clinical studies show a statistical decrease in the number of neural tube defects, craniofacial abnormalities, cardiovascular defects and limb abnormalities detected in offspring of female patients given supplementary folate during pregnancy. The mechanism, however, by which folate supplementation ameliorates the occurrence of developmental defects is unclear. The present work demonstrates that RFC is present in placenta and yolk sac and provides the first evidence that it is expressed in the neural tube, craniofacial region, limb buds and heart during organogenesis. These findings suggest that rapidly dividing cells in the developing neural tube, craniofacial region, limb buds and heart may be particularly susceptible to folate deficiency.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Folates are highly lipophobic, bivalent anions that can only minimally traverse biological membranes by simple diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Because they pass so inefficiently through biological membranes, supply of folates through mammalian cell plasma membranes must occur by a mediated process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Reduced-folate carrier (RFC; additionally known as RFC-1, FOLT, RFT-1 or SLC19A1) (M<sub>r </sub>60 kDa) is a typical transport protein with 12 membrane-spanning domains. RFC preferentially transports reduced folates, such as N<sup>5</sup>-methytetrahydrofolate (MTF), the most common form of circulating folate. In adult tissues, RFC is expressed in the brush-border membrane of jejunum, ileum, duodenum and colon and in the basolateral membrane of renal tubular epithelium, hepatocytes, choroid plexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The importance of RFC during embryogenesis has been demonstrated by the use of targeted gene deletion. Mice with targeted deletions of RFC die at an early embryonic age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, although it is evident the RFC is needed for normal embryonic development, the tissue-specific requirements for RFC during embryogenesis remain largely a mystery. In the present study we offer the first developmental analysis of the embryonic tissue Distribution of RFC message and protein in mouse placenta and developing embryo.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of RFC mRNA and protein in E10.0 mouse uterine sections</title><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization analysis was performed on cryosections of mouse uterus obtained at embryonic day (E)10.0 of gestation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows that RFC message is expressed in trophoblast cells of all layers of the placenta, with the expression most abundant in the trophoblast cells surrounding blood lacunae. RFC message was expressed also in the trophoblastic giant cells, labyrinth, junctional zone, yolk sac and within the neural tube of the developing embryo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Specificity of the staining was verified by hybridization of placental sections with an RFC specific sense probe as a negative control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).

While studies by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] suggested that RFC expression in adult tissues is confined to specialized cell types such as the brush-border membrane of the jejunum, ileum, duodenum, and colon or the basolateral membranes of renal tubular epithelium, hepatocytes and choroid plexus, more recent studies suggest a more ubiquitous expression in adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In accordance with these recent findings, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunolocalization analysis of whole-mount embryos revealed that RFC mRNA and protein were widely present. At E9.0 the signal was most intense in the optic vesicles, forebrain, mandible, heart, somites and tail bud. By E10.5 RFC was also detectable in the neural tube, limb buds and nasal pits. In the eye RFC mRNA and protein were expressed ubiquitously through E12.0. By E12.5, However, the RFC protein was no longer present throughout the developing eye; instead it had segregated to the apical plasma membrane of the RPE, its adult location in the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>This study has important clinical implications concerning the mechanism by which the beneficial effects of folate supplementation during pregnancy are derived. Many studies have shown a statistically significant decrease in the number of neural tube defects (NTD's) suffered in offspring of female patients who were given supplemental vitamins containing folate during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To a lesser extent, folate supplementation has also been shown to decrease the incidence of craniofacial abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], cardiovascular defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and limb abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] in humans. This work demonstrates that RFC mRNA and protein are present in rapidly dividing cell populations of the mouse embryo during early organogenesis of these structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The pattern of RFC mRNA and protein expression is developmentally regulated. While RFC expression is most strongly present in specialized cell-types in adult mice, during development RFC mRNA and protein are expressed in the placenta, yolk sac and throughout the embryo, with higher levels of expression being confined to cell populations in the neural tube, forebrain, hindbrain, craniofacial region, eye, limb buds, heart, somites and tail. Mutations in the RFC gene or deficient maternal folate intake may lead to developmental defects by decreasing proliferation rates in the cell populations determined by this study to express high levels of RFC during development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse Breeding</title><p>ICR male and female mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN).

Whole embryos were processed for immunohistochemistry by fixation in 4% PFA for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C followed by rinsing in PBS. Embryos were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and the tissues were re-fixed with methanol:dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1) overnight at room temperature followed by methanol:DMSO:30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(4:1:1) at room temperature for 4 h. Embryos were rehydrated through reverse ethanol series. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the embryos in PBSTMD (2% skim milk powder, 1% DMSO in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20). The RFC-1 anti-peptide antibody was raised against the peptide sequence RPKRSLFFNRDDRGRC, corresponding to residues 205&#x02013;220 of human RFC-1 and was used at a 1:500 dilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The specificity of this antibody has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Control experiments were carried out by incubating the antibody with the RPKRSLFFNRDDRGRC peptide at a concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g/ml for 30 minutes prior to beginning the experiment. Incubations were carried out in PBSTMD overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The antibody solution was removed and embryos were rinsed twice with PBS following which they were washed 4 &#x000d7; 1 h in PBST. Embryos were blocked with PBSTMD for 4 h, the secondary horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies were added in PBSTMD (1:100) and the embryos were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.
