On early endosomes, within a spatially restricted domain enriched in phosphatydilinositol-3-phosphate &#x0005b;PI(3)P&#x0005d;, Rab5 coordinates a complex network of effectors that functionally cooperate in membrane tethering, fusion, and organelle motility. Here we discovered a novel PI(3)P-binding Rab5 effector, Rabankyrin-5, which localises to early endosomes and stimulates their fusion activity<italic>.</italic> In addition to early endosomes, however, Rabankyrin-5 localises to large vacuolar structures that correspond to macropinosomes in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Overexpression of Rabankyrin-5 increases the number of macropinosomes and stimulates fluid-phase uptake, whereas its downregulation inhibits these processes. In polarised epithelial cells, this function is primarily restricted to the apical membrane. Rabankyrin-5 localises to large pinocytic structures underneath the apical surface of kidney proximal tubule cells, and its overexpression in polarised Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stimulates apical but not basolateral, non-clathrin-mediated pinocytosis. In demonstrating a regulatory role in endosome fusion and (macro)pinocytosis, our studies suggest that Rab5 regulates and coordinates different endocytic mechanisms through its effector Rabankyrin-5. Furthermore, its active role in apical pinocytosis in epithelial cells suggests an important function of Rabankyrin-5 in the physiology of polarised cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Rabankyrin-5, which is activated by the small GTPase Rab5, coordinates two disparate methods that cells use to take in solids and fluids, playing a key role in both endosome fusion and macropinocytosis</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammalian cells multiple mechanisms of endocytosis operate within a single cell to perform nutrient uptake, cellular homeostasis, neurotransmission, signal transduction, antigen presentation, and defence against pathogens. Endocytosis comprises two major categories, phagocytosis and pinocytosis, depending on the uptake of particles or fluid, respectively (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Conner1">Conner and Schmid 2003</xref>). Pinocytosis encompasses various membrane entry routes and mechanisms. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the best-studied route at the molecular level to date, primarily serves receptor-mediated uptake. Caveolae assemble on sphingolipid and cholesterol rafts and may internalise molecules partitioning in these lipid microdomains. To a certain extent, ligand-receptor complexes and raft components can follow both entry routes but can also be internalised via clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis. Large volumes of fluid are engulfed by the closure of plasma membrane protrusions in a process termed macropinocytosis. Although it was the first mode of pinocytosis reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Lewis1">Lewis 1931</xref>), little is known on the molecular mechanisms underlying this physiologically very important endocytic process. Constitutively active in immature dendritic cells, macropinocytosis favors antigen sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Steinman1">Steinman and Swanson 1995</xref>). However, it can be transiently induced in most cells by growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Haigler1">Haigler et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Shao1">Shao et al. 2002</xref>), tumor-promoting chemicals such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or oncogenes like H-Ras or v-Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Bar-Sagi1">Bar-Sagi and Feramisco 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Veithen1">Veithen et al. 1996</xref>), and it has been proposed to downregulate signalling molecules from the cell surface. Since macropinosomes arise from membrane ruffles, regions of intense actin remodelling which are also a trait of motile cells, they have been implicated in directed cell locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Carpentier1">Carpentier et al. 1991</xref>). Macropinocytosis is exploited by several invasive pathogens as entry route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Francis1">Francis et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Sansonetti1">Sansonetti 1997</xref>) but differs from phagocytosis with respect to regulation (e.g., receptor mediated) and cargo (e.g., uptake and degradation of opsonised particles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Galan1">Galan and Zhou 2000</xref>). Macropinosomes are distinct from early endosomes, morphologically and biochemically. In epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated A431 cells, whereas macropinosomes can fuse homotypically, they seldom fuse with early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hewlett1">Hewlett et al. 1994</xref>). However, this partition is not absolute, since in dendritic cells macropinosomes do fuse with endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Racoosin2">Racoosin and Swanson 1993</xref>). The intracellular trafficking properties of macropinosomes may therefore be governed by cell type-specific mechanisms and fulfil specialised functions. Finally, macropinocytosis shares mechanistic features with apical fluid-phase endocytosis in polarised cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Gottlieb1">Gottlieb et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Jackman1">Jackman et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Holm1">Holm et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Amyere2">Amyere et al. 2002</xref>). In kidney, apical pinocytosis contributes an essential function to the physiology of the renal system by contributing to vectorial fluid-phase transport across the membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Goligorsky1">Goligorsky and Hruska 1986</xref>).</p><p>Given the dependence on actin remodelling, it is no surprise that Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-West2">West et al. 2000</xref>), ARF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Radhakrishna1">Radhakrishna et al. 1996</xref>), and type 1 phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3-Ks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hooshmand-Rad1">Hooshmand-Rad et al. 1997</xref>) are involved in macropinocytosis, presumably through their role in membrane ruffling. Much less clear is the function of two Rab GTPases, Rab5 and Rab34/Rah, both of which are implicated in the formation of macropinosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Li1">Li et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Sun1">Sun et al. 2003</xref>). Rab34/Rah colocalises with actin to membrane ruffles and nascent macropinosomes and its overexpression promotes macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Sun1">Sun et al. 2003</xref>). Rab5 regulates fluid-phase and receptor-mediated uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Bucci1">Bucci et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-McLauchlan1">McLauchlan et al. 1998</xref>), and its activity has been linked to Ras-stimulated fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Li1">Li et al. 1997</xref>). However, Rab5 colocalises to some, but not all, macropinosomes harbouring Rab34/Rah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Sun1">Sun et al. 2003</xref>). Furthermore, Rab5 together with its effector PI3-K, hVPS34, regulates the recruitment of a set of cytosolic FYVE-finger effector proteins on early endosomes. These molecules cooperate in the tethering and fusion of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) with early endosomes and homotypic endosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Gorvel1">Gorvel et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Bucci3">Bucci et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Rubino1">Rubino et al. 2000</xref>) as well as the motility of early endosomes along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Nielsen1">Nielsen et al. 1999</xref>). However, in view of the function of Rab5 on the early endosomes, its role in macropinocytosis is difficult to assess. Specifically, it is unclear whether the large vacuoles induced by Rab5 activation, either via the expression of activated mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Stenmark1">Stenmark et al. 1994</xref>) or via signalling molecules that stimulate the GTP loading on Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Lanzetti1">Lanzetti et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Tall1">Tall et al. 2001</xref>), correspond to either macropinosomes or enlarged endosomes originated by increased homotypic early-endosome fusion, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hewlett1">Hewlett et al. 1994</xref>). Here, the identification of a novel Rab5 FYVE-finger effector, Rabankyrin-5, led us to revisit the role of Rab5 in fluid-phase (macro)pinocytosis in both nonpolarised and polarised cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of a Novel 130-kDa Rab5 Effector</title><p>We have previously purified a large number of Rab5 effectors by an affinity chromatography approach based on glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Rab5-GTP&#x003b3;S (Christoforidis et al.1999a). Among the numerous proteins purified, we focused on a prominent 130-kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The protein was digested with trypsin and the amino acid sequences of the tryptic fragments were determined by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Wilm1">Wilm et al. 1996</xref>). The identified peptides matched the mouse sequence of Ankhzn (unpublished data). The corresponding human cDNA was obtained by PCR, using primers derived from the mouse DNA sequence and a random primed HeLa cDNA library as template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Zerial2">Zerial et al. 2001</xref>). The sequence of the human cDNA matched the recently revised hAnkhzn gene sequence (NP 057460.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Kuriyama1">Kuriyama et al. 2000</xref>). The predicted human p130 primary sequence consists of an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain, a C-terminal FYVE-finger, and 21 successive ankyrin (ANK) repeats in between these two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In light of the fact that p130 is a Rab5 effector (this study), we propose to amend its name to Rabankyrin-5 (<bold>Rab5</bold> binding and <bold>ankyrin</bold> repeats containing protein).</p><p>To investigate the function of human Rabankyrin-5, we raised antibodies against the recombinant full-length protein. By Western blotting, these antibodies detected a predominant band of 130 kDa in both bovine brain and HeLa cytosol, in the corresponding GST-Rab5-GTP&#x003b3;S but not GST-Rab5-GDP affinity column eluates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Evidence for a direct interaction with Rab5 was obtained by incubating in vitro-translated Rabankyrin-5 with beads displaying GST-Rab5, -Rab4, -Rab7, and -Rab11, preloaded with either GDP or GTP&#x003b3;S. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g001">Figure 1</xref>D shows that human Rabankyrin-5 binds to GST-Rab5-GTP&#x003b3;S, but neither to beads containing GST-Rab5-GDP nor to other Rab proteins. We conclude that Rabankyrin-5 binds to Rab5 specifically, directly, and GTP dependently.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Association of Rabankyrin-5 with Two Types of Rab5-Positive Vesicles</title><p>After EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Stenmark2">Stenmark et al. 1996</xref>) and Rabenosyn-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Nielsen2">Nielsen et al. 2000</xref>), Rabankyrin-5 is the third Rab5 effector containing a FYVE-finger. Since the FYVE-finger is a key determinant for targeting these proteins to early endosomes via its binding to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate &#x0005b;PI(3)P&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Kutateladze1">Kutateladze et al. 1999</xref>), we tested whether this holds true also for Rabankyrin-5. First, recombinant Rabankyrin-5 interacted significantly with PI(3)P in a liposome-binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Second, endogenous Rabankyrin-5 colocalised significantly with EEA1 and Rab5-positive early endosomes (approximately 80&#x00025;) in A431 cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g003">3</xref>B below).</p><p>We next investigated whether Rabankyrin-5 plays a role in homotypic early endosome fusion as well as fusion of CCVs with early endosomes, similar to EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Christoforidis2">Christoforidis et al. 1999a</xref>) and Rabenosyn-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Nielsen2">Nielsen et al. 2000</xref>). Quantitative immunodepletion of the cytosolic pool of Rabankyrin-5 using anti&#x02013;Rabankyrin-5 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) had only minor effects on early endosome fusion in vitro compared to preimmune serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Considering the possibility that the early-endosome&#x02013;associated pool of Rabankyrin-5 may still be sufficient for fusion, we attempted to neutralise its function by the addition of anti&#x02013;Rabankyrin-5 antibodies on top of Rabankyrin-5&#x02013;depleted cytosol. This treatment strongly inhibited early-endosome fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The fusion of CCVs with early endosomes was minimally affected under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), suggesting that Rabankyrin-5 is not essential in this process, at least in vitro. However, addition of increasing amounts of recombinant Rabankyrin-5 (at concentrations in the range of the endogenous protein; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) on either immunodepleted cytosol or nontreated cytosol significantly enhanced both homo- and heterotypic fusion activity. We conclude from these experiments that endogenous Rabankyrin-5 colocalises with EEA1 on Rab5 endosomes in vivo, through the interaction with Rab5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) and PI(3)P (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). It plays a modulatory role in early-endosome fusion since it can stimulate both homotypic and heterotypic fusion of CCVs with early endosomes. However, it does not appear to be strictly required in the latter reaction in vitro.</p><p>Surprisingly, we noted that some peripheral structures harbouring Rabankyrin-5 overlapped with Rab5 but either poorly or not at all with EEA1 in A431 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, arrows). Upon overexpression, Rabankyrin-5 induced the accumulation of several vesicles of variable size in the periphery of the cells, most of them lacking EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, arrows). The irregular size, intracellular distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Swanson1">Swanson 1989</xref>), and lack of endosomal markers (see &#x0201c;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2c">Rabankyrin-5 localises to macropinosomes</xref>&#x0201d; below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hewlett1">Hewlett et al. 1994</xref>) of these structures were suggestive of (macro)pinocytic vesicles. We therefore set out to investigate the putative role of Rabankyrin-5 in macropinocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Rabankyrin-5 Localises to Macropinosomes</title><p>Macropinosomes have been so far defined by a combination of criteria rather than specific molecular markers. To test whether the Rabankyrin-5 vesicles fulfil the previously described requirements of macropinosomes, we determined whether they (1) are stimulated by growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Haigler1">Haigler et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-West1">West et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Amyere1">Amyere et al. 2000</xref>), (2) do not promote receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, (3) engulf large amounts of extracellular fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hewlett1">Hewlett et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Amyere1">Amyere et al. 2000</xref>), (4) depend on PI3-K activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Araki1">Araki et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Zhou1">Zhou et al. 1998</xref>), and (5) follow actin rearrangements at the plasma membrane. A431 and NIH3T3 cells are established experimental systems that exhibit different features in the regulation of macropinocytosis. In A431 cells, macropinocytosis can be transiently induced upon growth factor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hewlett1">Hewlett et al. 1994</xref>), whereas NIH3T3 cells exhibit constitutive macropinocytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Dharmawardhane1">Dharmawardhane et al. 2000</xref>). We first tested whether EGF can induce the formation of Rabankyrin-5&#x02013;positive macropinocytic structures. Upon treatment of A431 cells with rhodamine-conjugated EGF, endogenous Rabankyrin-5 colocalised to enlarged structures which, importantly, were largely devoid of simultaneously internalised transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Interestingly, EGF was not excluded but rather enriched in these structures. In addition, we observed that such vesicles were also enriched in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, presumably EGF-receptor and downstream signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g003">Figure 3</xref>D).</p><p>In NIH3T3 fibroblasts, the staining pattern of endogenous Rabankyrin-5 was similar to that of EGF-stimulated A431 cells. Rabankyrin-5 was detected on enlarged structures, predominantly at the outermost periphery and in membrane protrusions of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, arrows). Consistent with these observations, immunoelectron microscopy revealed that antibodies to Rabankyrin-5 labelled electron-lucent vesicular structures underlying the plasma membrane in the cell periphery and in cell protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The labelled structures were sparse in untransfected cells, but in Rabankyrin-5&#x02013; overexpressing cells fortuitous sections revealed concentrated areas of Rabankyrin-5&#x02013;labelled structures. Unfortunately, we failed to distinguish these structures from conventional early endosomes by double immunolabelling experiments due to technical limitations. By light microscopy, the appearance of vacuole-shaped structures devoid of the early endosomal marker EEA1 was dramatically increased upon Rabankyrin-5 overexpression. In addition, after a 3-min pulse, these structures were intensively labelled by a fluid-phase marker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, arrows) but not by transferrin (unpublished data). Given the potent induction of macropinosomes by Rabankyrin-5 in NIH3T3 cells, we used this experimental system to explore further the regulatory parameters of macropinocytosis.</p><p>In NIH3T3 cells, Rabankyrin-5&#x02013;enlarged structures were labelled by an 8-min uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (MW, 10.000). Consistent with their macropinocytic nature, these structures were largely depleted of transferrin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, arrows) and susceptible to the PI3-K inhibitors wortmannin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g004">Figure 4</xref>D) and LY 294002 (unpublished data). These drugs both reduced the formation of peripheral enlarged vesicles and almost completely blocked the internalisation of high-molecular-weight dextran (MW, 70.000) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>A) that enters the cell almost exclusively via macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Dharmawardhane1">Dharmawardhane et al. 2000</xref>). Interestingly, we noted that, unlike EEA1, Rabankyrin-5 did not readily dissociate from membranes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g004">Figure 4</xref>D) upon inhibition of PI3-K activity, suggesting that endosome-targeting determinants other than PI(3)P contribute to its localisation. Neither markers of late endosomes (Rab7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Chavrier1">Chavrier et al. 1990</xref>), nor of caveosomes (caveolin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Pelkmans1">Pelkmans et al. 2001</xref>), nor of the clathrin-independent pathway which is used by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins (GFP-GPI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Sabharanjak1">Sabharanjak et al. 2002</xref>) overlapped significantly with the peripheral enlarged Rabankyrin-5 structures (unpublished data).</p><p>To confirm that the Rabankyrin-5 structures originated from the plasma membrane through an actin-driven process, we employed time-lapse video fluorescence microscopy on NIH3T3 cells transiently coexpressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Rabankyrin-5 and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-&#x003b2;-actin.

Some newly formed vesicles shed off Rabankyrin-5 over time and seemed to regurgitate back to the plasma membrane via an actin comet-tail. Altogether, the data support the hypothesis that the enlarged structures containing Rabankyrin-5 are macropinosomes and can be molecularly distinguished from early endosomes by being mostly, albeit not exclusively, devoid of EEA1. Moreover, and contrary to earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-West1">West et al. 1989</xref>), we found that in A431 cells, EGF but not transferrin could be enriched in macropinosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Both Rab5 and Rabankyrin-5 Are Required for Macropinocytosis</title><p>The GTP-dependent interaction with Rab5 suggests that Rabankyrin-5 may function as a downstream effector of Rab5 in the macropinocytic pathway.

We found that Rab5 indeed colocalises with Rabankyrin-5 on macropinosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g003">3</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g006">6</xref>A; unpublished data), which are operationally defined as vesicles (1) enriched in fluid-phase marker but depleted of transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Racoosin1">Racoosin and Swanson 1992</xref>), (2) of large size (0,2&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Swanson1">Swanson 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hewlett1">Hewlett et al. 1994</xref>), and (3) negative for EEA1 but positive for Rabankyrin-5. Consistent with a requirement for Rab5 in macropinocytosis, overexpression of RN-tre, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Lanzetti1">Lanzetti et al. 2000</xref>), significantly reduced (by 60&#x00025; &#x000b1; 10&#x00025;) the uptake of large fluorescent dextran (MW, 70.000) into transferrin- and EEA1-negative structures in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g006">6</xref>C).

To distinguish between the two pathways, we compared the effects of Rabankyrin-5 overexpression on transferrin and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) uptake in NIH3T3 cells, biochemically. A recombinant adenovirus was generated to overexpress Rabankyrin-5 in these cells. In comparison with mock-infected cells, Rabankyrin-5 overexpression increased the uptake of HRP, particularly after longer (10 min) incubation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In contrast, the rate of transferrin uptake was unaffected, suggesting that the increase of fluid phase was not due to increased clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). The increased intracellular accumulation of HRP induced by Rabankyrin-5 seems to be due to increased uptake rather than inhibited recycling, as the latter process was only slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).</p><p>To determine whether Rabankyrin-5 is also required for macropinocytosis, we attempted to ablate the protein by RNA interference using endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNA (esiRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Yang1">Yang et al. 2002</xref>). Since we optimised this technique in human cells, we conducted these experiments in EGF-stimulated A431 cells where an approximately 55&#x00025; knock-down of Rabankyrin-5 was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). EGF stimulation of control-treated cells enhanced HRP uptake 2-fold versus control-treated, non-EGF-stimulated cells, as reported previously. Reduction of Rabankyrin-5 expression in esiRNA-transfected cells caused an inhibition of HRP of up to approximately 50&#x00025; by selectively affecting the burst of pinocytosis induced by EGF (within 5 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g007">Figure 7</xref>E). Under the same conditions, transferrin uptake was marginally inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g007">Figure 7</xref>F). We conclude from these experiments that inhibition of fluid-phase uptake occurs due to an inhibition of (macro)pinocytosis rather than of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>To confirm the requirement of Rabankyrin-5 for fluid-phase endocytosis we used an independent method: quantification of the uptake of fluorescent dextran in NIH3T3 cells microinjected with affinity-purified anti&#x02013;Rabankyrin-5 antibodies.

In view of the role of Rab5 in endocytic trafficking of polarised cells such as epithelial cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Bucci2">Bucci et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-de2">de Hoop et al. 1994</xref>), we explored the role of Rabankyrin-5 in apical endocytosis in polarised epithelial cells. First, we determined the intracellular localisation of Rabankyrin-5 on cryosections of adult mouse kidney, since the epithelial cells in this organ, especially proximal tubule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Christensen1">Christensen et al. 1998</xref>), exhibit high levels of apical pinocytosis under physiological conditions. Apical endocytic vesicles were pulse-labelled by injecting mice with HRP followed by fixation of the kidney through perfusion after 5 min. Prominin-1 was used as marker for the apical brush border of proximal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Weigmann1">Weigmann et al. 1997</xref>) in combination with affinity-purified anti&#x02013;Rabankyrin-5 antibodies. Basement membrane staining was demonstrated by immunolabelling of endogenous mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g008">Figure 8</xref>, Rabankyrin-5 immunoreactivity was mainly detected on vesicle-like structures underneath the apical, prominin-1&#x02013;labelled brush border. Most of the vacuole-like Rabankyrin-5 structures contained HRP, suggesting that they correspond to apical endocytic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g008">Figure 8</xref>D, arrows). By further investigating the nature of these Rabankyrin-5&#x02013; and HRP-labelled structures, we observed that some vesicles were immunoreactive for LAMP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g008">Figure 8</xref>D, arrowheads), suggesting that Rabankyrin-5 (macro)pinocytic vesicles can acquire characteristics of late endocytic compartments.</p><p>This was confirmed and extended by immunogold electron microscopy on ultrathin frozen sections of mouse proximal tubule. Rabankyrin-5 showed weak labelling of the apical microvilli-covered surface of proximal tubule cells but labelled large electron-lucent structures underlying the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g009">Figure 9</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g009">9</xref>B). Consistent with the immunofluorescence analysis, double labelling with LAMP-1 antibodies confirmed that many of these structures were LAMP-1 negative or weakly labelled. However, a significant number of Rabankyrin-5&#x02013;positive structures were also LAMP-1 positive. Rabankyrin-5 immunoreactivity was also observed in distal tubule cells and other segments of the nephron.</p><p>To functionally address the role of Rabankyrin-5 in pinocytosis, we used filter-grown Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells as an established system to study polarised trafficking. Alexa 488 dextran was internalised for 13 min from either the apical or the basolateral chamber. Although endogenous Rabankyrin-5 exhibited partial colocalisation with fluid-phase marker internalised from the basolateral side (unpublished data), a striking degree of overlap between the internalised tracer and Rabankyrin-5 on often ring-shaped structures underlying the apical region was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g010">Figure 10</xref>A). These large vesicles were neither detectable in the nuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g010">Figure 10</xref>B) nor close to the basolateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g010">Figure 10</xref>C). We next tested whether Rabankyrin-5 overexpression could stimulate fluid-phase uptake from the apical plasma membrane domain. Rabankyrin-5 was overexpressed using the recombinant adenovirus system in MDCK cells grown on coverslips and the cells stained for Rabankyrin-5 and EEA1. As in A431 and NIH3T3 cells, and similar to endogenous Rabankyrin-5 in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g011">Figure 11</xref>A), the overexpressed protein exhibited significant colocalisation with endogenous EEA1, but in addition, it induced the formation of enlarged structures devoid of EEA1 in the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g011">Figure 11</xref>B). The recombinant adenovirus was next applied to infect filter-grown MDCK cells. In these cells, it induced enlarged Rabankyrin-5 structures predominantly underlying the apical domain that contained dextran internalised from the apical side. Some of these structures were EEA1 positive, whereas others lacked this marker of early endosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g010">Figure 10</xref>D, arrows). These structures were also detectable to some extent in the nuclear region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g010">Figure 10</xref>E) and basolateral membrane domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g010">Figure 10</xref>F). In addition, there were some enlarged Rabankyrin-5 vesicles that were labelled for neither dextran nor EEA1. These may correspond to macropinosomes that were formed prior to the labelling with the fluorescent fluid-phase marker.</p><p>We next measured fluid-phase uptake biochemically by quantifying the internalisation of HRP either from the apical or the basolateral side for various periods of time. Filter-grown MDCK cells were either infected with adenovirus encoding Rabankyrin-5 or control virus prior to HRP internalisation. While internalisation of HRP from the basolateral plasma membrane did not significantly vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g011">Figure 11</xref>D), uptake from the apical membrane was increased up to 65&#x00025; in cells overexpressing Rabankyrin-5 when compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g011">Figure 11</xref>C). Given that Rabankyrin-5 was overexpressed in only 50&#x02013;60&#x00025; of the cells, this value may be an underestimate. Since the kinetic profiles resembled the ones obtained in NIH3T3 cells, we also tested whether the increase in HRP uptake may have been due to an inhibition of recycling or transcytosis. Neither of these trafficking pathways was significantly affected (unpublished data). To verify that the increase in fluid-phase uptake was not due to stimulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we measured the internalisation of FcLR 5&#x02013;27, a chimeric receptor between the IgG Fc receptor and the LDL receptor which, when expressed in MDCK cells, is targeted to, and internalised from, both apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Matter1">Matter et al. 1992</xref>). Rabankyrin-5 overexpression did not affect significantly the internalisation of FcLR 5&#x02013;27, as revealed by the uptake of a biotinylated Fab-fragment of the 2.4G2 monoclonal anti-FcRII antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g011">Figure 11</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g011">11</xref>F). Taken together, these findings indicate that Rabankyrin-5 is predominantly localised to apical endocytic structures and specifically stimulates apical, non-clathrin-mediated fluid-phase endocytosis upon overexpression in polarised epithelial cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Rabankyrin-5 in Macropinocytosis</title><p>Since the pioneering work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Bar-Sagi1">Bar-Sagi and Feramisco (1986)</xref> almost two decades ago, it has been established that certain oncogenes and signalling molecules induce actin-dependent membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis. Subsequent work has advanced our understanding of the signalling pathway that led to growth factor-dependent actin remodelling and membrane ruffling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Ridley1">Ridley 1994</xref>). Despite macropinocytosis being the most ancient form of pinocytosis and an endocytic process of high physiological importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Amyere2">Amyere et al. 2002</xref>), progress in determining the molecular mechanisms that regulate the generation and trafficking of macropinosomes has advanced to a lesser extent. It has been demonstrated that macropinocytosis differs from clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-West1">West et al. 1989</xref>) and that the two pathways lead to distinct endocytic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hewlett1">Hewlett et al. 1994</xref>). Rab5, an established regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosome dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Gorvel1">Gorvel et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Bucci1">Bucci et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-McLauchlan1">McLauchlan et al. 1998</xref>), has also been implicated in macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Li1">Li et al. 1997</xref>). This hypothesis was based on the expression of mutants that induced or inhibited fluid-phase endocytosis and formation of giant endocytic vesicles. In those studies, however, an accurate assessment of whether the enlarged compartments corresponded to macropinosomes or were produced by the coalescence of multiple endosomes by homotypic fusion was not determined.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that Rabankyrin-5 is a novel Rab5 effector which, in addition to being localised to early endosomes, is associated with macropinosomes and promotes their formation according to previously established criteria. First, Rabankyrin-5 localised to enlarged vesicles that were stimulated by growth factors (e.g., EGF). Second, these vesicles differed from early endosomes by the lack of constitutively endocytosed molecules, such as transferrin, and components of the transport machinery, such as EEA1. Third, the vacuoles originated from the plasma membrane and engulfed extracellular fluid. Fourth, their formation depended on PI3-K activity, and fifth, they followed actin rearrangements at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Possible Functions of Rabankyrin-5</title><p>Macropinosomes are formed by the closure of membrane protrusions generated upon actin-mediated membrane ruffling. Although membrane ruffling is required for macropinocytosis, it seems not to be sufficient for macropinosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Araki1">Araki et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-West2">West et al. 2000</xref>). Our data suggest that Rabankyrin-5 is a novel regulator of this endocytic mechanism. One possibility is that it could play an active role in the generation of macropinosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The deduced primary structure of Rabankyrin-5 predicts the existence of several protein-protein interaction motifs, suggesting a role as a multifunctional adaptor protein. The N terminus of Rabankyrin-5 contains a BTB/POZ motif, which is present in proteins involved in signalling, development, and tumorigenesis and mediates homo- and heterodimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Bardwell1">Bardwell and Treisman 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Kobayashi1">Kobayashi et al. 2000</xref>). It contains 21 ANK repeats which, by analogy with the function of ANKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Bennett1">Bennett and Chen 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Denker1">Denker and Barber 2002a</xref>), could interact with different proteins on the membrane, including Rab5, and mediate the assembly of a multiprotein complex. Such a scaffolding function has been postulated to bridge the membrane to the actin cytoskeleton but also to link proteins involved in endocytosis and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Pryciak1">Pryciak and Hartwell 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Lubman1">Lubman et al. 2004</xref>). Rabankyrin-5 could assemble a membrane-cytoskeleton scaffold committing the ruffling membrane to generate a pinocytic vesicle or directly participate in the closure of the plasma membrane sealing the vesicle. Alternatively, Rabankyrin-5 could be recruited onto macropinosomes concomitantly or following their formation to prevent their back-fusion with the plasma membrane or regulate their onward trafficking. This possibility receives support from our time-lapse video microscopy analysis, where the dissociation of Rabankyrin-5 from the membrane precedes what appears to be the regurgitation of macropinosomes back to the plasma membrane (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). Interestingly, it has recently been proposed that ANK repeats may not be simply anchoring domains but may be part of a mechanical sensory system that transmits tension from the cytoskeleton to ion channels in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Corey1">Corey and Sotomayor 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Howard1">Howard and Bechstedt 2004</xref>). In the case of Rabankyrin-5, the ANK repeats may confer a sensory function to detect and adapt to rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton during membrane ruffling and membrane closure. Interactions of the ANK repeats with ion channels may sense changes in water-salt homeostasis and pH, and respond to them via modulation of macropinocytosis and macropinosome trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-de1">de Baey and Lanzavecchia 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Morris1">Morris and Homann 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Denker2">Denker and Barber 2002b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Functional Relation between Macropinosomes and Endosomes</title><p>How does the function of Rab5 and Rabankyrin-5 in macropinocytosis relate to early endosome trafficking? We have previously proposed a model whereby Rab5, via the recruitment of its effectors, generates and maintains a spatially restricted and functionally specialised membrane domain on the early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Zerial1">Zerial and McBride 2001</xref>). The Rab5 effector hVps34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Christoforidis3">Christoforidis et al. 1999b</xref>) is a PI3-K that generates PI(3)P. Together with Rab5, this phosphoinositide serves as a binding determinant for the FYVE-finger Rab5 effectors EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Simonsen1">Simonsen et al. 1998</xref>) and Rabenosyn-5 on the early-endosome membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Nielsen2">Nielsen et al. 2000</xref>). The Rab5 effectors form oligomeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-McBride1">McBride et al. 1999</xref>) and play distinct but cooperative roles in membrane tethering, fusion, and motility of early endosomes along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Nielsen1">Nielsen et al. 1999</xref>). Our data extend the list of PI(3)P-binding Rab5 effectors to Rabankyrin-5. Rabankyrin-5 colocalises with Rab5 and EEA1 to early endosomes and plays a role in homotypic early-endosome fusion, further underscoring the activity of Rab5 as organiser of an endosomal Rab5 domain enriched in PI(3)P-binding effector proteins. Rabankyrin-5 played a minor modulatory role in the fusion of CCVs with early endosomes, suggesting mechanistic differences between homotypic early-endosome fusion and the heterotypic fusion of CCVs with early endosomes. Clearly, Rabankyrin-5 exerted the most striking effects on fluid-phase rather than clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>Clathrin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis are independent but interconnected pathways. Whereas macropinosomes and early endosomes remain segregated in EGF-stimulated A431 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Hewlett1">Hewlett et al. 1994</xref>), they can fuse in other cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Racoosin2">Racoosin and Swanson 1993</xref>). Rabankyrin-5 alone may not be sufficient for macropinosomes to fuse with endosomes, and this activity may require the additional recruitment of EEA1 and Rabenosyn-5. The extent to which macropinosomes can recruit Rabankyrin-5, release or retain it, and further acquire late endocytic components or other Rab5 effectors acting in endosome tethering and fusion may depend on the cellular context. In kidney cells, for example, several Rabankyrin-5&#x02013;positive structures appeared also to contain EEA1 and late endocytic markers (LAMP-1), suggesting that macropinosomes can communicate with other endocytic organelles and undergo maturation as it has been described for phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Allen1">Allen and Aderem 1996</xref>). Also intriguing is the weak interaction of Rabankyrin-5 with PI(5)P (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020261-g001">Figure 1</xref>E) and recent findings that BTB domain-containing proteins interact with ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Furukawa1">Furukawa et al. 2003</xref>). Since both components have been implicated in the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Katzmann1">Katzmann et al. 2001</xref>), Rabankyrin-5 may function in the trafficking to late endocytic components, as it was described previously for PIKfyve, another FYVE-finger&#x02013;containing protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Ikonomov1">Ikonomov et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Stimulation of epithelial cells with either EGF or phorbol esters increases fluid-phase uptake while reducing internalisation via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Sandvig1">Sandvig and van Deurs 1990</xref>). Our results provide a possible explanation for how the two endocytic routes can be quantitatively balanced. Since Rab5 appears to be rate limiting for both receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis, its activity could be shifted between these two endocytic pathways, depending on the stimuli and the cell type. The shared activity of Rab5 and Rabankyrin-5 would ensure coordination between endosome trafficking and macropinocytosis, regulate the kinetics, and limit the extent of both endocytic processes, thus preserving plasma membrane homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Rabankyrin-5 in Apical, Actin-Dependent Endocytosis in Polarised Epithelial Cells</title><p>In addition to macropinocytosis in nonpolarised cells, we have found that Rabankyrin-5 regulates apical, non-clathrin-mediated pinocytosis in polarised epithelial cells.

However, apical pinocytosis depends on other components of receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways such as PI3-K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Tuma1">Tuma et al. 1999</xref>) and protein kinase C and can be induced by oncogenes (e.g., v-Src) that stimulate macropinocytosis in nonpolarised cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Holm1">Holm et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Amyere2">Amyere et al. 2002</xref>). It is not known which PI3-K subtype functions in apical pinocytosis, but an attractive candidate is PI3-K&#x003b2;, as it has been identified as a Rab5 effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Christoforidis3">Christoforidis et al. 1999b</xref>). Its activity could be regulated by Rab5 constitutively and/or be subjected to stimulation by apical or axonal signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Pillion1">Pillion et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020261-Kryl1">Kryl et al. 1999</xref>).

It will be interesting to determine whether Rabankyrin-5 and the macropinocytic machinery play a role in this event.</p><p>In conclusion, the identification of Rabankyrin-5 opens new opportunities for investigating the molecular principles underlying macropinocytosis and its regulation by signalling molecules. The dual role of Rab5 and Rabankyrin-5 in endosome and macropinosome function argues for a role in coordinating these two different endocytic mechanisms. Future work is required to identify the molecular partners of Rabankyrin-5 and to establish the mechanisms responsible for its membrane targeting and its role in endocytic membrane dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Reagents and cell lines.</title><p>Phospholipids were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri, United States) and Calbiochem (San Diego, California, United States).

Cells were then incubated for 13 min with 5 mg/ml Alexa 488 dextran, added to the apical medium, fixed, and stained for the indicated antigens. Images represent confocal scans just beneath (A and D) the apical plasma membrane, (B and E) the nuclear area, and (C and F) the basal plasma membrane. Endogenous Rabankyrin-5 and EEA1 localise to several dextran-labelled structures, often with ring-shaped appearance in the apical region. Overexpression of Rabankyrin-5 seems to increase the number of enlarged and dextran-labelled structures, some of which are depleted of EEA1 (arrows) (B).

Under both conditions EEA1 colocalised almost completely with Rabankyrin-5, while there were some Rabankyrin-5 structures devoid of EEA1. Upon Rabankyrin-5 overexpression these EEA1-lacking structures were enlarged macropinocytic-like vesicles localised predominantly in the periphery of the cell, while other enlarged compartments containing EEA1 were centripetally located.</p><p>(C&#x02013;F) Filter-grown MDCK cells were either mock-infected or infected with recombinant adenovirus for full-length Rabankyrin-5. HRP (5 mg/ml) or biotinylated Fab fragments (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) were internalised from the indicated chambers for various time points. Whereas Rabankyrin-5 overexpression (C) specifically increased HRP uptake from the apical domain, (D) basolateral HRP uptake and (E and F) Fab uptake at both domains were unaffected (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0,01).
