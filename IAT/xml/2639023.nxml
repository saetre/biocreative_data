SlTPR1 protein with a GFP fluorescent tag was localized in the plasmalemma and nuclear membrane in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and SlTPR1-CFP and NR-YFP fusion proteins were co-localized in the plasmalemma and nuclear membrane following co-bombardment of onion cells. Overexpression of SlTPR1 in tomato resulted in ethylene-related pleiotropic effects including reduced stature, delayed and reduced production of inflorescences, abnormal and infertile flowers with degenerate styles and pollen, epinasty, reduced apical dominance, inhibition of abscission, altered leaf morphology, and parthenocarpic fruit. Similar phenotypes were seen in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> overexpressing SlTPR1. SlTPR1 overexpression did not increase ethylene production but caused enhanced accumulation of mRNA from the ethylene responsive gene <italic>ChitB</italic> and the auxin-responsive gene <italic>SlSAUR1-like</italic>, and reduced expression of the auxin early responsive gene <italic>LeIAA9</italic>, which is known to be inhibited by ethylene and to be associated with parthenocarpy. Cuttings from the <italic>SlTPR1</italic>-overexpressors produced fewer adventitious roots and were less responsive to indole butyric acid. It is suggested that SlTPR1 overexpression enhances a subset of ethylene and auxin responses by interacting with specific ethylene receptors. SlTPR1 shares features with human TTC1, which interacts with heterotrimeric G-proteins and Ras, and competes with Raf-1 for Ras binding. Models for SlTPR1 action are proposed involving modulation of ethylene signalling or receptor levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Development</kwd><kwd>ethylene signalling</kwd><kwd>SlTPR1</kwd><kwd>tetratricopeptide repeat protein</kwd><kwd>tomato</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth and development including ripening, senescence, abscission, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeles <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). It also has dramatic effects on plant growth habit, such as the classic ethylene triple response of exaggerated apical hook, swollen hypocotyls, and inhibited root growth displayed by etiolated seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guzman and Ecker, 1990</xref>). Ethylene biosynthesis occurs via the Yang pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang and Hoffmann, 1984</xref>) involving two key biosynthetic enzymes, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase and ACC oxidase, encoded by differentially expressed multigene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kende, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zarembinski and Theologis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Mutants that are defective in ethylene biosynthesis or perception also exhibit altered morphology, fertility, and final organ size. For example, the <italic>Arabidopsis ethylene-overproducer1 (eto1</italic>) and <italic>constitutive triple response1 (ctr1</italic>) mutations, which cause ethylene overproduction and constitutive activation of ethylene signalling, respectively, result in reduced stature, small inflorescences and flowers, and low fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guzman and Ecker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kieber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ethylene is perceived by a family of five receptors (ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2, and EIN4) that possess sequence similarity with bacterial two-component His kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bleecker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Shockey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The receptors are divided into two subfamilies. The subfamily I receptors, ETR1 and ERS1 contain three transmembrane domains and a conserved histidine kinase domain, and have been shown to function as homodimers, whereas the subfamily II receptors ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2 have an additional N-terminal hydrophobic region and a degenerate histidine kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The receptors act as redundant negative regulators of ethylene signalling to suppress ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall and Bleecker, 2003</xref>). Multiple loss-of-function receptor mutants show enhanced ethylene responses, grow slowly, have reduced organ size and are infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that null mutations in either of the subfamily I ethylene receptors ETR1 or ERS1 result in increased sensitivity to ethylene and double null mutations show strong constitutive ethylene-response phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Ethylene binding to the receptors results in the inactivation of the receptor signalling to CTR1, a negative regulator with similarity to Raf-like protein kinases, that interacts with the receptors at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kieber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Receptors have also been shown to occur at different subcellular locations and to be regulated by other proteins. For example, RTE1 (REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY 1) is a positive regulator of the ETR1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Resnick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and the two proteins are found to co-localize predominantly at the Golgi apparatus but also at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition, the tobacco ethylene receptor NTHK1 appears to localize at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and it has been suggested that the different subcellular localizations of the ethylene receptors may have functional relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>A family of six putative ethylene receptor genes has been identified in tomato: <italic>LeETR1</italic>, <italic>LeETR2</italic>, <italic>Never ripe</italic> (<italic>NR</italic>), <italic>LeETR4</italic>, <italic>LeETR5</italic>, and <italic>LeETR6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lashbrook <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tieman and Klee, 1999</xref>), and the expression of some of these is differentially regulated during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tieman and Klee 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klee, 2002</xref>). The <italic>NR</italic> gene is regulated at the transcription level by ethylene and during ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Payton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lashbrook <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). The NR mutation confers ethylene insensitivity and fruit fail to ripen. Antisense knockout of the mutated <italic>NR</italic> gene restores fruit ripening, consistent with the receptor inhibition model of ethylene action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hackett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which has a single <italic>CTR1</italic> gene, tomato has a small family of CTRs, which complement the <italic>ctr1</italic> mutant and bind to the receptor NR at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams-Phillips <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>). Although in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> there is evidence for a degree of receptor redundancy, it has also been observed that knocking out a single tomato receptor, for example, <italic>LeETR4</italic> or <italic>LeETR6</italic>, results in constitutive ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tieman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kevany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), indicating that some receptors are functionally more significant than others in specific situations. It has recently been reported that the tomato receptors are rapidly degraded in the presence of ethylene, probably through a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway, and this receptor degradation is thought to be an important aspect of developmental control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kevany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although mutant analysis has been highly successful in identifying components of the ethylene perception and signalling pathway, it is possible that certain types of proteins involved in signalling are difficult to identify using this approach. The functional characterization of SlTPR1, a novel tetratricopeptide repeat protein initially isolated as a NR-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen, is reported here. Further study indicated that SlTPR1 interacts with both NR and LeETR1 ethylene receptors, and SlTPR1 appeared to co-localize with NR at both the plasma and nuclear membranes when transiently co-expressed in onion epidermal cells. Overexpresssion of SlTPR1 <italic>in planta</italic> resulted in small plants with severely reduced fertility, parthenocarpic fruit, altered leaf and fruit shape, epinasty, and enhanced ethylene responses. The results suggest that SlTPR1 plays an important role in ethylene signalling and is involved in cross-talk between ethylene signalling and auxin responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Seeds of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicon</italic> cv.

After 3 weeks, the total number of root initials for each cutting was examined. Without IBA treatment the transgenic cuttings had poor adventitious root formation compared to the wild type; without exogenous IBA the wild-type cuttings typically formed 15 adventitious roots, whereas the transgenic lines 3278A, 3286A, 3272A, and 3273A averaged 8, 2.6, 2.2, and 3.7 adventitious roots, respectively, with a reduced number of cuttings rooted (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern276/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern276/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

SlTPR1 contains three TPR motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), which are frequently found in proteins mediating important regulatory interactions and signalling events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). TPR proteins in plants play important roles in hormone signalling and development, for example, SPY regulates GA/cytokinin signalling cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenboim-Wainberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and ETO1 interacts with ACS5 (an isoform of ACC synthase) to inhibit its enzyme activity, and also serves as a substrate-specific adaptor protein for ACS5 degradation, by interacting with CUL3, a constituent of the ubiquitin ligase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). ETO1 and SPY are much larger than SlTPR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) and they share little similarity outside the TPR motifs. SlTPR1 has no close homologues in tomato EST databases and AtTPR1 also appears as a single sequence in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. SlTPR1 is most closely related to AtTPR1, OsTPR1, and the human TTC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), a protein involved in interactions with heterotrimeric G-proteins and Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In wild-type plants, <italic>SlTPR1</italic> mRNA was found in leaves, flowers, stems, and roots, and accumulated to high levels in fruit, peaking during ripening, a process coupled with ethylene evolution. Ethylene treatment of mature green fruit led to a small increase in <italic>SlTPR1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), but it also accumulated in the <italic>Nr</italic> mutant, which is largely, but in the Ailsa Craig background not completely, insensitive to ethylene. Overexpression of SlTPR1 in tomato plants resulted in a wide range of developmental responses, including reduced stature and epinasty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>); small inflorescences with small, degenerated, and infertile flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), and reduced apical dominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). The severity of the phenotypic effects was directly related to the expression levels of the SlTPR1 transgene mRNA. Higher expression in lines 3272A, 3286A, and 3278A resulted in infertile dwarf plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), while a line (3273A) that had a lower level of SlTPR1 transgene mRNA had normal stature and less severe effects on side shoot growth, leaf morphology, and flower development. Line 3273A produced degenerated pollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6J</xref>), but it was able to produce parthenocarpic fruits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). In addition to these effects, there was a delay in flower bud formation in all the transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In tomato, flowers are normally produced after nine compound leaves have been formed, whereas in the SlTPR1-overexpressers, they only appeared after 12 or 13 leaves had formed, suggesting that SlTPR1 influences flowering time. This is consistent with enhanced ethylene signalling, since it has been recently demonstrated that ethylene delays flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by modulating the activity of DELLA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A few attempts to knock-out <italic>SlTPR1 in planta</italic> by introducing either antisense or RNAi constructs failed to regenerate transgenic plants with altered SlTPR1 expression (data not shown), suggesting that silencing this gene might be deleterious. Taken together, our studies indicated that an appropriate level of SlTPR1 <italic>in planta</italic> is vital for development.</p><p>Some phenotypic aspects of tomato plants overexpressing SlTPR1, such as reduced stature, leaf epinasty, delayed flowering, reduced flower numbers and inflorescences, and sterility are similar to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> multiple loss-of-function ethylene receptor mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>). The finding that the ethylene responsive gene <italic>ChitB</italic> was more highly expressed in transgenic tomato plants is consistent with enhanced ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Altered leaf and fruit morphology, and inhibited development of the fruit abscission zone, however, are more related to auxin than ethylene responses. Auxin is known to be involved in leaf shape, vascular patterning, parthenocarpic fruit formation, and fruit morphology. Down-regulation of the auxin early responsive gene <italic>LeIAA9</italic> and up-regulation of the small auxin up-regulated RNA gene <italic>SlSAUR1-like</italic> in SlTPR1 overexpressers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), together with reduced adventitious root formation of the transgenic lines in responses to auxin, indicates the involvement of SlTPR1 in cross-talk with auxin responses. LeIAA9 functions as a transcriptional repressor in auxin signalling and its expression is known to be negatively regulated by ethylene and ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Tomato plants with a reduced level of <italic>LeIAA9</italic> mRNA show phenotypes similar to our SlTPR1 overexpressing lines, such as altered leaf morphology, reduced apical dominance, and the production of parthenocarpic fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The results of the present experiments are consistent with the suggestion that aspects of the phenotype of SlTPR1 overexpressing plants result from the down-regulation of <italic>LeIAA9</italic>. The degree of reduction was inversely related to the expression level of the <italic>SlTPR1</italic> transgene (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig8">Figs 3, 4, and 8</xref>), and the intermediate SlTPR1 overexpressing line 3273A, which also had an intermediate level of <italic>LeIAA9</italic> mRNA, produced parthenocarpic fruit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The auxin-related gene <italic>SlSAUR1-like</italic> was, however, up-regulated by the overexpression of SlTPR1 in plants, an opposite pattern to <italic>LeIAA9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), indicating that this gene is up-regulated by ethylene. The SAUR family is large, for example, there are 75 <italic>SAU</italic>R genes in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, and their functions are not fully understood.</p><p>The results presented here suggest that SlTPR1 affects some auxin responses through the regulation of genes such as <italic>LeIAA9</italic> and <italic>SlSAUR1-like</italic>. This response was quite specific since there was no effect on the expression of a number of other LeIAA genes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), but further study may reveal ethylene effects on other auxin-related gene expression. Overexpression of SlTPR1 in <italic>planta</italic> appeared to affect ethylene responses related to vegetative growth, reproductive development, and abscission, but not qualitative aspects of ripening, such as colour and texture change. However, the rate of ripening was not analysed in detail, because of the shortage of fruit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The apparent lack of effect on fruit ripening, which is an ethylene-regulated process, might be due to the fact that SlTPR1 binds to LeETR1 and NR, whereas different ethylene receptors (LeETR4 and LeETR6) are the most important ethylene receptors in controlling tomato ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kevany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Some aspects of the SlTPR1 overexpression phenotypes resemble features of the <italic>epinastic</italic> (<italic>epi</italic>) mutant of tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), for example, reduced plant growth, smaller cell size, and twisted epinastic leaves. Seedlings of the <italic>epi</italic> mutant also show features of a constitutive triple response in the dark in the absence of ethylene, but <italic>epi</italic> lacks the global constitutive ethylene responses seen in the <italic>ctr1</italic> mutant. It has been proposed that the <italic>epi</italic> mutation affects a subset of ethylene responses, or acts in an independent pathway required for growth that cross-talks with the ethylene response pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). It has not been possible to test whether seedlings of the overexpressing SlTPR1 show a triple response, since the plants are either sterile or produce parthenocarpic fruit. There are clear differences between <italic>epi</italic> plants and SlTPR1 overexpressers, however, since <italic>epi</italic> leads to ethylene overproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujino <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), whereas SlTPR1 overexpression does not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Due to its solubility in both aqueous and lipid environments, ethylene should be readily perceived by receptors residing at any cell membrane or organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeles <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). Subcellular localization studies of SlTPR1 indicated that the GFP-tagged SlTPR1 protein was localized at the plasmalemma and nuclear membrane, but was excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). Co-expression of SlTPR1-CFP and NR-YFP in onion epidermal cells confirmed that the two proteins co-localized at the plasmalemma and nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). The plasma and nuclear membrane localization of SlTPR1 possibly reflects its subcellular function. It is known that the human homologue of SlTPR1, TTC1, is involved in interactions with selected G-proteins and Ha-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and that G-protein signalling occurs in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamm, 1998</xref>). The tobacco NTHK1 ethylene receptor has also been reported to localize at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The NR-YFP fusion protein was, however, also found at the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>), which was consistent with our previous studies of the ER localization of the NR receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>), whereas SlTPR1-YFP appeared more diffuse, and did not co-localize at the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). It has also been shown that the melon ethylene receptor CmERS1 is anchored at the ER membrane, via its N-terminal transmembrane domains with its C-terminal domains facing the cytoplasm, where it could interact with proteins located in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Initially, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ETR1 receptor was reported to be at the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), but recently it was found predominantly to co-localize with RTE1 at the Golgi apparatus of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The evidence for SlTPR1 interaction with ethylene receptors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) and the membrane localizations suggest it would be possible for SlTPR1 and the receptors to interact <italic>in vivo</italic>, and this interaction might be significant for the ethylene receptor functions, but this remains to be tested experimentally. The variety of locations observed in different experiments suggests that individual ethylene receptors can be found in more than one place, perhaps moving as part of functional interactions; alternatively, different receptors may be located in different places. In view of the structural similarity between the different tomato ethylene receptors, it will be important to test the significance and specificity of the interaction with SlTPR1 <italic>in vivo</italic> as part of the process of testing models of SlTPR1 action. The question of which receptors bind SlTPR1 <italic>in vivo</italic> is also of critical importance, since it is beginning to become clear that some receptors are more significant than others in regulating specific subsets of ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kevany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In addition, the subcellular localization should be investigated further using weak or endogenous promoters to eliminate the possibility of overexpression artefacts.</p><p>The phenotypic effects caused by overexpression of SlTPR1 <italic>in planta</italic> indicate enhanced constitutive expression of at least a subset of ethylene responses, perhaps involving a subset of ethylene receptors. There are also clear effects on auxin-related genes. There are two ways to explain these results, which are not mutually exclusive. (i) A possible mechanism for SlTPR1 in ethylene signalling is suggested from the study of TTC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), which shares 50% overall similarity with SlTPR1. TTC1 interacts with Ras and competes with Raf-1 for Ras-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It is well known that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ethylene receptors interact with the Raf-like protein kinase CTR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and the tomato ethylene receptors LeETR1 and NR also interact with several LeCTR1-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). If SlTPR1 played a similar role to TTC1, this could explain the enhanced ethylene signalling in plants over-expressing SlTPR1. In the present ethylene signal transduction model, in the absence of ethylene, CTR1 is maintained in an active state by the receptors. This inhibits downstream components and thus ethylene response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Etheridge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11A</xref>). If SlTPR1 acts in the same fashion as the TTC1 protein to compete with LeCTRs for binding to the ethylene receptors, this would lead to CTRs remaining in a non-activated state, resulting in constitutive ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11B</xref>, left). (ii) Alternatively, it is also possible that association of SlTPR1 with the receptors might result in receptor inactivation or degradation, leading to enhanced ethylene sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11B</xref>, right). It is known that reduced receptor levels can cause enhanced ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hua and Meyerowizt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and it has also been reported that the receptors are degraded in the presence of ethylene, probably through a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kevany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Other TPR proteins, including ETO1 and CHIP (CARBOXY TERMINUS OF HSC70 INTERACTING PROTEIN)), are involved in the degradation of their interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDonough and Patterson, 2003</xref>). The yeast two-hybrid screen showed that, in addition to SlTPR1, NR also interacts with several other proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), including INT clones 129, a zinc metalloproteinase, and 119, a ubiquitin fusion degradation protein, which could be involved in protein degradation. In this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>), the enhanced ethylene responses resulting from overexpression of SlTPR1 lead to altered auxin responses through an effect of <italic>LeIAA9</italic> and <italic>SlSAUR1-like</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11B</xref>). It is unclear whether or not SlTPR1 is directly involved in auxin signalling. Further work will be required to test these hypotheses and establish the mechanism of action of SlTPR1.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Fig. 11.</label><caption><p>Model of SlTPR1 action in ethylene signalling.
