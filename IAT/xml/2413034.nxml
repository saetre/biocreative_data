In this study, we investigated the differentiation and characteristics of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by intracellular staining.

IL-21 has been demonstrated to be expressed in Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), follicular B helper T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), and NK T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) and to exhibit pleiotropic effects on the proliferation, differentiation, and effector function of T, B, NK, and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In vivo, it has been shown that IL-21 is involved in several autoimmune disease models. For example, lymphopenia and compensatory IL-21&#x02013;mediated homeostatic expansion of lymphocytes has been reported to be involved in the development of autoimmunity in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). The excessive production of IL-21 has been shown to be associated with the development of high titers of autoantibodies and a lupus-like pathology in <italic>Sanroque</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Furthermore, a blockade of IL-21 signaling has been demonstrated to ameliorate mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). However, the characteristic of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, especially in their relation to Th17 cells, is still unknown because a single-cell analysis of IL-21&#x02013;producing cells has not been achieved yet.</p><p>In this study, by establishing the intracellular staining of IL-21, we found that although IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells developed preferentially under Th17-polarizing conditions, a considerable number of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were negative for intracellular IL-17A and -17F.

We also found that IL-21 was produced by activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells under Th17-polarizing conditions (in the presence of IL-6, TGF-&#x003b2;, anti&#x02013;IL-4 mAb, and anti&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b3; mAb) much greater than under Th2-polarizing conditions or under Th1-polarizing conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, it was still unclear whether IL-21 is actually produced by Th17 cells and what is the developmental and phenotypic characteristic of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells because IL-21 production has not been determined at single-cell levels as yet. To address these issues, we established the intracellular cytokine staining of IL-21. We first generated several IL-21&#x02013;producing Ba/F3 cell clones using a bicistronic retrovirus system and measured the levels of IL-21 in the culture supernatants by ELISA. Among these clones, Ba/F3-IL-21-GFP &#x00023;6 cells produced a significant amount of IL-21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, left), and we used this clone as a positive control for intracellular staining of IL-21. To detect intracellular IL-21, we used mouse IL-21R/human Fc-chimera (IL-21R-Fc) to capture IL-21 and anti&#x02013;human Fc PE to visualize IL-21&#x02013;IL-21R-Fc complexes. When cells were stained by this method, positive signals were detected in Ba/F3-IL-21-GFP &#x00023;6 cells, but not in control Ba/F3-empty-GFP cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, right). In the absence of IL-21R-Fc, no positive signal was detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, right), confirming the correct detection of IL-21 by the intracellular staining.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Establishment of a single-cell analysis of IL-21&#x02013;producing cells.</bold> (A) IL-21 and -17A are produced by activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells under Th17-polarizing conditions.

In contrast, because IL-21 induces Th17 cell development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), and because a considerable number of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells under Th17-polarizing conditions are negative for IL-17A and -17F (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), it is suggested that IL-21 functions on Th17 cells not only as an autocrine growth factor but also as a paracrine growth factor.</p><p>Our results indicate that the developmental characteristic of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is different from that of Th17 cells, although both T cells require IL-6 and/or IL-21 for their development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). We demonstrate that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits IL-6&#x02013; and IL-21&#x02013;induced development of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In contrast, both IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; are required for the development of Th17 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). On the other hand, it has been shown that TGF-&#x003b2; induces, but IL-6 inhibits, the development of Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). In addition, IL-2 signaling inhibits the development of Th17 cells, but not of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These findings suggest that the development of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, Th17 cells, and T reg cells is reciprocally regulated by the balance among IL-6 plus IL-21, TGF-&#x003b2;, and IL-2 in an environment.</p><p>Molecular mechanisms underlying the development of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells remain to be elucidated. We show that IL-6 and -21, both of which use STAT3 as a signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), induce the development of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). It has also been reported that under Th17-polarizing conditions, IL-21 production is induced by a STAT3-dependent mechanism, but not a ROR&#x003b3;t-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), suggesting that STAT3 is critical for the development of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Because IL-6 up-regulates NFAT transcriptional activity by increasing the levels of NFATc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), and because NFATc2 activates IL-21 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), it is also plausible that IL-6&#x02013;mediated activation of NFATc2 is involved in the induction of IL-21 gene expression. Because Foxp3, which is induced by TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), interacts with NFAT and down-regulates NFAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), TGF-&#x003b2; may suppress the development of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) by producing Foxp3&#x02013;NFATc2 complexes.</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that IL-22 is expressed in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells under Th17-polarizing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) and that it mediates IL-23&#x02013;induced dermal inflammation and hyperplasia of the epidermis in psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Interestingly, similar to IL-21, IL-22 is induced by IL-6 but is inhibited by TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). In contrast, IL-17A and -17F are expressed in the presence of IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). However, at present, it is still unknown whether IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells do produce IL-22 together. The detailed analysis of autoimmune disease models in IL-21&#x02013;deficient mice, IL-17A/IL-17F double-deficient mice, and IL-17A/IL-17F/IL-21 triple-deficient mice may provide evidence for a nonredundant role of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and IL-17A/IL-17F&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Regarding the phenotypic stability of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, we found that IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could produce IL-21 for at least 20 d of culture (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> and not depicted). We also found that IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells did not lose their ability to produce IL-21 even when they were restimulated under Th1- or Th2-polarizing conditions (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). Interestingly, IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells still had a potential to produce IL-4 when IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were restimulated under Th2-polarizing conditions, whereas IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells did not produce IFN-&#x003b3; even when IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were restimulated under Th1-polarizing conditions (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). These results indicate that IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells exhibit a stable phenotype of IL-21 production and the silencing of IFN-&#x003b3; production. This is consistent with our previous finding that IL-21 inhibits IFN-&#x003b3; production in developing Th1 cells through the repression of Eomesodermin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). In contrast, when IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were restimulated under Th17-polarizing conditions, their ability to produce IL-21 was decreased and IL-17A&#x02013;producing cells were increased (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). Therefore, IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells still have a potential for IL-4 and -17A production.</p><p>It has recently been shown that a subset of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, termed follicular B helper T cells (TFH cells), produce a large amount of IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). TFH cells are distinguishable from other CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell populations by several criteria, including its location in B cell follicles and the expression of chemokine receptor CXCR5, and provide a helper function to B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In preliminary experiments, we found that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells cultured in the presence of IL-6 were negative for CXCR5 expression (unpublished data). Therefore, although further studies are required, it is suggested that IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells described in the present study seem to be different from TFH cells. The comparative analysis of their helper function to B cells, as well as the regulatory mechanism of IL-21 production, is required to further address the relationship between these populations.</p><p>We found that TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated suppression of IL-21 production was reduced in Smad3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells compared with that in WT CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). We also found that TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated induction of Th17 cells was reduced in Smad3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These results indicate that TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;Smad3 signaling is involved not only in the induction of Th17 cell development but also in the suppression of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Interestingly, however, the inhibitory effects of TGF-&#x003b2; were still observed in Smad3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This is consistent with a previous study showing that TGF-&#x003b2; exhibits partial effects on Smad3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Because the molecular functions of Smad3 are somewhat overlapping to Smad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), it is suggested that TGF-&#x003b2; exhibits partial effects on Smad3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by using Smad2 as a partner of Smad4.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that IL-6 and -21 preferentially induce the differentiation of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and that the differentiation of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and Th17 cells is differently regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-2. Although further studies are required to address the physiological importance of IL-21&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in vivo, our results should add a new insight into the regulatory mechanism of helper T cell differentiation and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.
