The complex is localized in a microdomain along cardiomyocyte T-tubules resolved by 3D confocal microscopy as distinct from the classic dyad formed by DHPR and RyR. This microdomain was first described by Moore and colleagues, who also distinguished the T-tubule NCX1 from dyad proteins RyR and DHPR and from voltage-gated sodium channels by light microscopy using image deconvolution and wide-field epifluorescence microscopy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030423-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. T-tubule-associated ankyrin-B is a specialized adaptation of cardiomyocytes and is not evident in smooth muscle, which does not express significant ankyrin-B levels, or in skeletal muscle, where ankyrin-B is expressed at 10-fold lower levels than in heart. The T-tubule domain containing ankyrin-B-coupled NKA, NCX1, and InsP<sub>3</sub>R thus is a specialized adaptation of cardiac cells that is not present in other types of muscle cells.</p><p>We propose a scale model for the ankyrin-B-based complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030423-g008">Figure 8</xref>) based on previous structural reports and on evidence from this study that ankyrin-B can promote association between purified NKA, NCX1 and InsP<sub>3</sub>R (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030423-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In this scheme, the extended ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain adapts the NKA and NCX1 to the InsP<sub>3</sub>R in a configuration that would allow for regulation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a spatially privileged domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030423-g008">Figure 8</xref>). It is likely that all participants in such an assembly have mutually interacting surfaces. In this case, the role of ankyrin-B could be to stabilize the assembly and/or possibly direct its cellular localization. The resulting macromolecular complex capable of coupled transport would accomplish the intended purpose of &#x0201c;restricted space&#x0201d; previously invoked to explain the action of cardiac glycosides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030423-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the dimensions of a complex would be on the order of 10&#x02013;20 nm, while an anatomical space or &#x0201c;synapse&#x0201d; between the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane is 500&#x02013;1,000 nm in size and would not provide a effective barrier to diffusion of small ions with radii less than 1 nm. A test of the idea of coupled transport by ankyrin-B-complexed proteins would be to selectively interfere with participation of individual members of the complex by knocking in mutants lacking ankyrin-B-binding activity.</p><p>While binding and localization data are consistent with simultaneous interaction of a single ankyrin-B molecule with NCX1, NKA, and InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor, it also is possible that only one or two ankyrin-B-associated proteins are bound at a given time. It will be important in future experiments to isolate ankyrin-B-based macromolecular assemblies and directly determine stoichiometries of component proteins. A current challenge is that ankyrins also associate with spectrin and spectrin/actin complexes (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030423-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;), as well as proteins such as obscurin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030423-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030423-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A role for InsP<sub>3</sub>R in heart is unknown.

Potential explanations for this preferential loss may include reduced T-tubule ankyrin-B protein stability (half-life), increased T-tubule/SR membrane turnover, or differences in the association of each ankyrin-B population with the underlying cytoskeleton. Alternatively, reduced expression of the T-tubule/SR population of ankyrin-B in ankyrin-B<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> cardiomyocytes may result from differences in the molecular identities of ankyrin-B polypeptides at each domain.

Then 50&#x00025; of the neutravidin Dynabeads were pre-incubated with the control biotin for 2 h at 4 &#x000b0;C, washed, and resuspended in BSA binding buffer (control neutravidin Dynabeads). Neutravidin Dynabeads were incubated with the dialyzed biotin-InsP<sub>3</sub>R while control neutravidin Dynabeads were incubated with the same concentration of unlabeled InsP<sub>3</sub>R for 2 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. Dynabeads were then washed 3&#x000d7; in BSA binding buffer and used for binding experiments. Coated Dynabeads (InsP<sub>3</sub>R at 20 nM) were incubated with <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX1 (20 nM final concentration; specific activity 274,000 cpm/pmol) and/or <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA (20 nM final concentration; specific activity ~504,000 cpm/pmol) in the presence or absence of a pre-incubation with ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain (20 nM final concentration) in a final volume of 50 &#x003bc;l of BSA binding buffer (20 mM Hepes &#x0005b;pH 7.3&#x0005d;; 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na EDTA, 0.2&#x00025; Triton X-100, 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, and 5 mg/ml BSA). Following 4 h, the beads were washed in binding buffer minus BSA, and both pellet and supernatant samples were assayed for <sup>125</sup>I in a gamma counter (<italic>n =</italic> 3). The samples were then examined by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (<italic>n =</italic> 3). Values for picomoles bound of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX1 or <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA in experiments where only one labeled ligand was used were calculated from counts of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled protein bound and specific activity. Values for picomoles bound of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX1 and <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA when two labeled proteins were incubated together (<sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX1 + <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA) were calculated by first determining a ratio of counts of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled protein bound/band intensity for unique bands of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX or <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA in single protein binding experiments (i.e., <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX + ankyrin-B + InsP<sub>3</sub>R beads). The intensity of these same bands was measured in the gel lanes where the two proteins (i.e., <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX + <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA + ankyrin-B + InsP<sub>3</sub>R beads) were combined to determine the number of picomoles bound of each protein. We observed approximately equal picomoles of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX1 and <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA bound to InsP<sub>3</sub>R beads when ankyrin-B was included in the binding reaction. However, because of the lower specific activity of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX1, the band intensity on the gel was approximately 50&#x00025; of that of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA. Saturation binding was performed essentially as described in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030423-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; but using glutathione beads. Briefly, ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain was purified as described in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030423-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Increasing concentrations of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled InsP<sub>3</sub>R, <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NCX1, or <sup>125</sup>I-labeled NKA were incubated for 2 h at 25 &#x000b0;C with glutathione Sepharose-immobilized GST-ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain or GST. The beads were washed and counted in a gamma counter. The data were corrected for nonspecific binding at each concentration by subtracting values obtained with GST-coated beads.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Full-length human NCX1 was cloned from a human heart library (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States) into pBacPak9 (Clontech) using standard molecular techniques. For purification of NCX1, a His-tag was engineered to the C-terminus. NCX1 was expressed in SF21 insect cells using a generated recombinant baculovirus. Cells were infected in monolayer cultures with a MOI of ten for 72 h at 27 &#x000b0;C. Cells were harvested and washed in PBS, and cell pellets were snap frozen and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 &#x000b0;C in the presence of protease inhibitors (100 &#x003bc;g/ml AEBSF, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml benzamidine, 30 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin). Cells were syringed and sonicated in cell homogenization buffer (PBS, 1 mM Na EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM sodium azide) to break the cell membranes, then centrifuged at 100,000<italic>g</italic> for 30 min to collect membranes. Cell membranes were pre-extracted with 20 mM CHAPS (pH 12) for 30 min followed by 20 mM PB (pH 7.3), 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M urea, 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100, and 0.5 mM beta mercaptoethanol. The cell residue was resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mM PB (pH 8.0), 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.2&#x00025; Triton X-100, 1 mM beta mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium azide, and 2&#x00025; Sarkosyl) for 20 min. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000<italic>g</italic> for 1 h, and the supernatant collected and diluted 10-fold in buffer lacking Sarkosyl. The diluted extract was applied to a column of Ni-NTA Sepharose, washed with 10&#x02013;20 column volumes of dilution buffer, and eluted with buffer plus 0.3 M imidazole. Peak fractions were pooled, adjusted to 10&#x00025; glycerol, snap frozen, and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. Sheep kidney NKA was isolated in membrane-bound form from outer medulla as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030423-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;.

All procedures were carried out at 4 &#x000b0;C in the presence of protease inhibitors (100 &#x003bc;g/ml AEBSF, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml benzamidine, 30 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin). Cerebellum was homogenized using a polytron in five volumes (weight/volume) of homogenization buffer (10 mM Hepes &#x0005b;pH 7.3&#x0005d;, 0.32 M sucrose, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mM sodium azide), and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. Membranes were then collected at 30,000<italic>g</italic> for 1 h. Membranes were prewashed in wash buffer (50 mM Tris HCl &#x0005b;pH 8.0&#x0005d;, 1 mM Na EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM Na azide), then resuspended to the homogenization volume with the wash buffer. InsP<sub>3</sub>R was extracted from the membranes by the addition of 2&#x00025; final Triton X-100 for 30 min, and supernatants collected after centrifugation at 30,000<italic>g</italic> for 1 h. The extract was adjusted to 0.25 M NaCl and applied to a 50-ml heparin Sepharose column equilibrated in 0.25 M NaCl and 0.2&#x00025; Triton X-100 extraction buffer. The heparin Sepharose was washed with ten column volumes of equilibration buffer, and then eluted with 0.5 M NaCl buffer. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against ten volumes of column buffer lacking NaCl and 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0). A precipitate formed after dialysis and was collected by centrifugation at 100,000<italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in column buffer with the addition of 1.0 M NaCl and was re-centrifuged as above. The InsP<sub>3</sub>R released into the supernatant was then adjusted to 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.2 mM MnCl<sub>2,</sub> and applied to a 4-ml ConA Sepharose column. The column was washed in 20 column volumes of buffer, the elution started with the addition of 1 M mannose, the elution stopped, and the column allowed to sit in elution buffer overnight. The elution was continued the following day and fractions collected, aliquoted, snap frozen, and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Ankyrin-B-Based Complex Is a Specialized Feature of Cardiac Myocytes</title><p>Ankyrin-B is expressed in ventricular cardiomyocytes but not in smooth muscle lining large arteries.
