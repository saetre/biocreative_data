Although a few KS patients have been reported to also develop ulcerative colitis (UC), a causal link to the FERMT1 gene mutation is unknown. The FERMT1 gene product belongs to a family of focal adhesion proteins (Kindlin-1, -2, -3) that bind several &#x003b2; integrin cytoplasmic domains. Here, we show that deleting Kindlin-1 in mice gives rise to skin atrophy and an intestinal epithelial dysfunction with similarities to human UC. This intestinal dysfunction results in perinatal lethality and is triggered by defective intestinal epithelial cell integrin activation, leading to detachment of this barrier followed by a destructive inflammatory response.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Mutations in FERMT1, coding for the Kindlin-1 protein, cause Kindler Syndrome in humans, characterized by skin blistering, atrophy, and cancer. Recent reports showed that some Kindler Syndrome patients additionally suffer from ulcerative colitis. However, it is unknown whether this is caused by loss of Kindlin-1 or by unrelated abnormalities such as infections or additional mutations. We ablated the Fermt1 gene in mice to directly analyze the pathological consequences and the molecular mode of action of Kindlin-1. Kindlin-1&#x02013;deficient mice develop a severe epidermal atrophy, but lack blisters. All mutant mice die shortly after birth from a dramatic, shear force-induced detachment of intestinal epithelial cells followed by a profound inflammation and organ destruction. The intestinal phenotype is very similar to, although more severe than, the one observed in Kindler Syndrome patients. In vitro studies revealed that impaired integrin activation, and thus impaired adhesion, to the extracellular matrix of the intestinal wall causes intestinal epithelial cell detachment. Therefore, we demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells require adhesive function of integrins to resist the shear force applied by the stool. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the colitis associated with Kindler Syndrome is caused by a dysfunction of Kindlin-1 rather than by a Kindlin-1&#x02013;independent event.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kindler Syndrome (KS; OMIM:173650) is a rare, recessive genodermatosis caused by mutations in the FERMT1 gene (C20ORF42/KIND1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Siegel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Jobard1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Skin blisters develop and disappear after birth, followed by skin atrophy, pigmentation defects and finally skin cancer. The severity of the individual symptoms varies extensively among individual patients. FERMT1 mutations are distributed along the entire gene and can give rise to different truncated Kindlin-1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kern1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the different courses of the KS cannot be linked to mutations within specific regions of the FERMT1 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-LaiCheong1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that additional environmental and/or genetic factors contribute to the disease course.</p><p>Kindlin-1 belongs to a novel family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins consisting of three members (Kindlin-1-3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Ussar1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Kindlins are composed of a central FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain, which is disrupted by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. They localize to cell-matrix adhesion sites (also called focal adhesions, FAs) where they regulate integrin function. In line with the role of Kindlins in integrin function, keratinocytes from KS patients and Kindlin-1-depleted keratinocytes display impaired cell adhesion and delayed cell spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kloeker1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Herz1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism how Kindlin-1 regulates integrin function is not understood and controversial. Kindlin-2 (Fermt2) and Kindlin-3 (Fermt3) were shown to bind to the membrane distal NxxY motif of &#x003b2;1 (Itgb1) and &#x003b2;3 (Itgb3) integrin cytoplasmic domains. This binding, in concert with Talin (Tln1) recruitment to the membrane proximal NPxY motif, leads to the activation (inside-out signaling) of &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 class integrins enabling them to bind to their ligands. Following ligand binding, Kindlin-2 and Kindlin-3 stay in matrix adhesion sites where they link the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton by recruiting ILK and Migfilin (Fblim1) to FAs (outside-in signaling). Consistent with this adaptor function of Kindlins, keratinocytes from KS patients and keratinocytes depleted of Kindlin-1 display impaired cell adhesion and delayed cell spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kloeker1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Herz1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, however, Kindlin-1 was reported to have different properties than Kindlin-2 and -3, since it was shown to bind like Talin to the proximal NPxY motif of &#x003b2;1 integrin tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kloeker1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The Kindlins have a specific expression pattern. Kindlin-1 is expressed in epithelial cells, while Kindlin-2 is expressed almost ubiquitously. They are both found at integrin adhesion sites and/or cadherin-based cell-cell junctions. Kindlin-3 is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it controls a variety of functions ranging from integrin signaling in platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Moser1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> to stabilizing the membrane cytoskeleton in mature erythrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kruger1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although the FERMT1 gene is expressed in epithelial cells of almost all tissues and organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Ussar1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, only abnormalities of the skin and the oral mucosa are associated with KS.

UC is restricted to the colon and is characterized by superficial ulcerations of the mucosa.

Since only a few KS patients were reported to develop intestinal symptoms, it is currently debated whether UC development in these patients is directly linked to FERMT1 gene mutations or secondarily caused by a microbial infection or an abnormal inflammatory response.</p><p>In this study we directly investigated the role of Kindlin-1 in vivo by generating mice carrying a constitutive null mutation in the Kindlin-1 gene.

This was further confirmed with direct binding assays, which showed that the recombinant His-tagged C-terminal FERM domain of Kindlin-1 (aa 471&#x02013;677) containing the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) motif bound GST-tagged &#x003b2;1 but not the Y800A mutated &#x003b2;1 integrin cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that Talin can induce activation of integrins, and for a long time it was believed that it is sufficient for the execution of this task.

The synergism between Talin and Kindlin-1 depends on a Kindlin-1 and &#x003b2; integrin tail interaction, as a PTB mutant of Kindlin-1 (QW611/612AA) failed to bind &#x003b2; integrin tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8G</xref>) and the synergistic effect with Talin was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8F</xref>).

We demonstrate that the primary defect is a loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier that secondarily leads to inflammatory cell infiltrates and the development of a severe colitis. Furthermore, we show that loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier is caused by a severe adhesion defect of intestinal epithelial cells to the underlying BM, which in turn is caused by the inability of integrins to become activated and to bind BM components. It is possible that in addition to defective integrin activation and epithelial detachment, Kindlin-1 exerts other yet unidentified functions that could contribute to the phenotype in Kindlin-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>Kindler syndrome (KS) is thought to be primarily a skin disease with a disease course that is characterized by epidermal atrophy and followed by epidermal blistering, pigmentation defects and skin cancer. The complex disease syndrome is difficult to diagnose at the disease onset due to similarities with other forms of skin blistering diseases (also called epidermolysis bullosa; EB) that are caused by mutations in keratin and BM genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Aumailley1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent case reports showed that KS may involve more organs than only the skin, as several KS patients also suffer from intestinal symptoms. One patient with a severe form of KS developed a severe postnatal UC. Interestingly, this patient was diagnosed with a null mutation in the FERMT1 gene after developing trauma-induced skin blistering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Sadler1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In line with this severe UC case of KS, we found that the null mutation of the Fermt1 gene in mice also leads to a dramatic and lethal intestinal epithelial dysfunction very shortly after birth. Lethality is usually not seen in KS patients, which is most likely due to the immaturity of the murine intestine at birth, making it more vulnerable to injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Hauck1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The intestinal epithelial dysfunction of Kindlin-1-deficient mice is characterized by flat and superficial ulcerations in the colon, as the epithelium detaches from an intact BM. The defects begin in the rectum and extend along the entire colon finally leading to a severe pancolitis. The ulcerations and epithelial cell detachments are restricted to the colon, although the ileum shows signs of a secondary inflammation at later stages of the disease. In vitro studies with primary IECs from Kindlin-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and Kindlin-1-depleted HT-29 cells showed that the cell detachment is caused by impaired activation of integrins leading to weak adhesion of IECs to the underlying BM. Mechanistically Kindlin-1 requires direct binding to the &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 integrin cytoplasmic domains to promote the activation of the two integrin subfamilies. These biochemical and functional properties are conserved among the three members of the Kindlin family. Kindlin-2-mediated binding and activation of &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 integrins critically support the attachment of endoderm and epiblast cells to the underlying BM in peri-implantation embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Montanez1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, while Kindlin-3 plays a central role for the activation of platelet integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Moser1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The findings of this report also demonstrate that Talin function crucially depends on the activity of Kindlin-1. Depletion of Kindlin-2 (the only Kindlin expressed in CHO cells) completely prevents overexpressed Talin from activating integrins. Re-expression of either Kindlin in Kindlin-2-depleted CHO cells, however, recovers the ability of Talin to trigger the activation of integrins. It will be important to next investigate how Kindlins become activated and why Kindlin-2 is unable to take over the function of Kindlin-1 in Kindler Syndrome and Kindlin-1-deficient mice.</p><p>The conclusion that the observed phenotype is triggered by IEC detachment rather than by a primary inflammatory defect in Kindlin-1 deficient mice is based on the observation that epithelial cell detachment always occurred prior to immune cell infiltration. We would therefore, argue that the detachment of IECs resembles an intestinal wound, which secondarily triggers a strong wound healing response leading to immune cell infiltrates and release of a cytokine storm. In line with this hypothesis, epithelial cell detachment and induction of inflammatory reactions can be completely prevented when Kindlin-1 pups are delivered by Caesarian section and subsequently incubated in a humidified and temperature controlled chamber. Mechanical stress applied by the colostrum is likely inducing the detachment of the weakly adhering epithelial cells in the colon. The vast majority of mouse models reported to develop colitis so far have an abnormal immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Xavier1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Severe adhesion defects of IECs leading to a massive wound response may represent an alternative etiology for UC development.</p><p>Although adhesion is severely compromised in the colon of Kindlin-1-deficient mice, they are born without skin blisters. This is in line with KS patients, who are also born without skin blisters even when they are delivered by the vaginal route but develop blisters postnatally at trauma prone sites. Interestingly, Kindlin-1 deficient mice did not show defective adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the BM even after application of mechanical stress. The different severity of the adhesion defect in skin and colon could be reflected by the functional properties of the distinct set of integrins expressed in the two organs and the absence of classical hemidesmosomes in intestinal epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Fontao1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another pronounced skin defect in Kindlin-1-deficient mice as well as KS patients is skin atrophy, which seems to be due to reduced proliferation of interfollicular keratinocytes. This finding raises several questions; first, regarding the mechanism underlying the molecular control of cell proliferation by Kindlin-1. The mechanism is unknown and could result from a diminished cross talk between integrin and growth factor signaling. Second, it is also unclear how a molecular player that supports proliferation is giving rise to cancer at a later stage. It is possible that the localization of Kindlins in different cellular compartments, i.e. cell-matrix adhesion sites, cell-cell adhesion sites and in certain instances in the nucleus, equips them with different functions that become evident at different time points in life.</p><p>Kindlin-1 and -2 are co-expressed in epidermal cells as well as epithelial cells of the colon. Interestingly, we found that Kindlin-2 cannot compensate Kindlin-1 function in vivo, neither in the colon nor in skin. Since Kindlin-2 normally localizes to cell-cell adhesions in both cell types and does not translocate to integrin adhesion sites in mutant intestinal and epidermal epithelial cells, it is unable to compensate for the loss of Kindlin-1, although both Kindlins are capable of performing the same tasks at the integrin tails <italic>ex vivo</italic> and in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Fontao1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, a therapeutic strategy to reroute some of the Kindlin-2 from cell-cell to the integrin adhesion sites may represent a promising approach to prevent ulceration in KS patients with severe UC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse Strains</title><p>The Kindlin-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were obtained by replacing the ATG-containing exon 2 with a neomycin resistance cassette (detailed information on the cloning of the targeting construct can be obtained from <email>Faessler@biochem.mpg.de</email>).
