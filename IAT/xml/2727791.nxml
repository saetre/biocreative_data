The apical dendrite extends radially and arborizes in single glomerulus where it receives primary input from olfactory sensory neurons that express the same odor receptor. The lateral dendrites extend horizontally in the external plexiform layer and make reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with granule cells, which moderate mitral/tufted cell activity. The molecular mechanisms regulating dendritic development of mitral/tufted cells is one of the unsolved important problems in the olfactory system. Here, we focused on TrkB receptors to test the hypothesis that neurotrophin-mediate mechanisms contributed to dendritic differentiation of OB mitral/tufted cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>With immunohistochemical analysis, we found that the TrkB neurotrophin receptor is expressed by both apical and lateral dendrites of mitral/tufted cells and that expression is evident during the early postnatal days when these dendrites exhibit their most robust growth and differentiation. To examine the effect of TrkB activation on mitral/tufted cell dendritic development, we cultured OB neurons. When BDNF or NT4 were introduced into the cultures, there was a significant increase in the number of primary neurites and branching points among the mitral/tufted cells. Moreover, BDNF facilitated filopodial extension along the neurites of mitral/tufted cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>In this report, we show for the first time that TrkB activation stimulates the dendritic branching of mitral/tufted cells in developing OB.

To perform these functions efficiently, they have two types of dendrites that are morphologically and functionally distinct; the apical and lateral dendrites. In adult OB, mitral/tufted cells extend radially a single apical dendrite that arborizes in a complex tuft within one glomerulus, where it receives OSN synaptic input. In contrast, each mitral/tufted cell extends several lateral dendrites that are widely distributed within a horizontal plane in the external plexiform layer (EPL), and make reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with granule cells.</p><p>During development, mitral cells possess multiple widely spread dendrites that cannot be readily classified as apical or lateral on the day of birth; only a few cells show arborized terminal dendritic tufts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Blanchart1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Malun1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Within a few days, evidence of differentiation can be detected as one apical dendrite appears thicker. However, as late as postnatal day 5 (P5) many mitral cells continue to have multiple apical dendrites, some of which project into different glomeruli. By P10, the supernumerary apical dendrites have retracted from glomeruli, and most mitral/tufted cells have adult-like morphology with only a single apical dendrite. While in the mature rodent the lateral dendrites of mitral and tufted cells segregate in the deep and superficial substrata of the EPL, respectively, little is known about the time course or mechanisms underlying their development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Mori1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Orona1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>What regulates the dynamic, but organized, developmental changes of mitral/tufted cell dendritic morphology? Signaling via TrkB neurotrophin receptor is a good candidate since activation of TrkB via its ligands, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin-4 (NT4), can stimulate formation of apical dendrites and branching in cortical pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Xu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-McAllister1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the function of TrkB appears to differ among different types of neurons. In the retina, specific TrkB deletion in the ganglion cells retards the laminar refinement of dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Liu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, TrkB deletion in cerebellar Purkinje cells did not affect the gross dendritic morphology, but synapse formation and elimination were affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Rico1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Johnson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, although TrkB expression in dendrites of mature mitral cells in the OB has been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Fryer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, an understanding of its role and the implications for dendritic development have been lacking. Here, we report on the localization of TrkB in dendrites of mitral/tufted cells at the peak of dendritogenesis, during the early perinatal period. Our data further show that the addition of BDNF or NT4 to mitral/tufted cells <italic>in vitro</italic> results in a proliferation of primary neurites, neurite branching, and filopodia-like elaboration. Our results strongly support the notion that the selective effects of TrkB activation contribute to the development and differentiation of OB mitral/tufted cell dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Development of dendrites of mitral cells during early postnatal days</title><p>To investigate the dendritic development of mitral cells, we used intracellular injections of Lucifer yellow dye in formaldehyde-fixed slices of the OB from mice at P3, 5, 7, 10 and 28. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>, we show the reconstructed dendritic tufts of typical dye-injected mitral cells from mice at P3 and P28, respectively. At P3, the apical dendrite of the mitral cell has begun to elaborate an arborized tuft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). At this age, the apical dendritic specializations still appeared relatively simple. The processes often had many short branches, perhaps indicative of ongoing development and branching. At P28, the dendritic processes of glomerular tufts of mitral cells were tightly intermingled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). They were indistinguishable from dendritic tufts seen in adult rat OB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Kosaka1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Price1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

At younger ages, mitral cells often had two or more apical dendrites, each of which exhibited an immature tuft in different glomeruli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006729.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In those cases, each tuft was treated as an independent event. Although the filopodia- or spine-like structures noted above are likely important in the maturation of the apical glomerular dendritic tufts, branches shorter than 6 &#x000b5;m were omitted from our measurement since previous report suggested that processes less than 6 &#x000b5;m are less stable, even in adult mitral cell dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Mizrahi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The total length of dendritic processes in a glomerulus from single mitral cells increased significantly from P3 to P10, while the change from P10 to P28 was not significant (P3&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;384.1&#x000b1;70.2 &#x000b5;m; P5&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;480.5&#x000b1;134.6 &#x000b5;m; P7&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;745.8&#x000b1;104.8 &#x000b5;m; P10&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1526.8&#x000b1;121.6 &#x000b5;m; and P28&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1787.1&#x000b1;154.3 &#x000b5;m; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Similarly, the number of branching points increased significantly from P3 to P10, but was thereafter relatively stable (P3&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;18&#x000b1;3; P5&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;22&#x000b1;7; P7&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;36&#x000b1;5; P10&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;63&#x000b1;5; and P28&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;64&#x000b1;4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results suggest that early postnatal days, such as P3-10, may be a critical period for the development of mitral cell apical dendritic tufts, and that after P10 a relatively stable equilibrium is achieved.</p><p>The lateral dendrites of mitral cells extend up to 1/3 the circumference of the OB, often extending 1,000 &#x000b5;m in length in the rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Orona1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and 2,000 &#x000b5;m in the rabbit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Mori1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of the length of the lateral dendrites, and because their planes of orientation within the EPL are complicated, it was not feasible to reconstruct them from our slice preparations as we did for the apical dendrites. However, as an alternative measure of maturation, we found that the lateral dendrites exhibited growth cone-like structures at their tips at P3, 5, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g001">Figs. 1D, D', and D&#x02033;</xref>). This growth cone-like structure was never seen beyond P10. In addition, prior to P10 the lateral dendrites also had a high incidence of filopodia-like extensions which we rarely found in adult OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>; arrowheads). These data suggest that, like the apical processes, the lateral dendrites are experiencing their most robust growth and development up through P10, with perhaps only incremental changes after that age.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>TrkB expression at dendrites of mitral/tufted cells</title><p>Previously, it was reported that at P0, <italic>trkB</italic> mRNA is expressed by cells in the mitral cell layer (MCL) as well as in the glomerular layer (GL) and granule cell layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Masana1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Nef1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the majority of cells within the MCL are not mitral cells; granule cells are densely packed within the MCL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Imamura1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, while localization of the mRNA is important, the expression pattern of TrkB protein was not known for those stages of early development when dendritogenesis is most robust. To address this question, we examined TrkB expression using anti-TrkB antibody: anti-TrkBex. Its target sequences are located at extracellular regions of TrkB. There are, at least, three TrkB isoforms that are produced by alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Middlemas1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Klein1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The full-length isoform (TrkB.FL) has a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain in its intracellular region. In contrast, the two truncated isoforms (TrkB.T1 and T2) have the same extracellular domains as TrkB.FL, but lack the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains which are substituted with isoform-specific shorter C-terminal sequences. Therefore, anti-TrkBex can detect all TrkB isoforms. To check the expression of TrkB isoforms in neonatal OB, western blots were performed with P5 OB homogenate using anti-TrkBex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Bands around 95 kDa and 145 kDa correspond to the molecular weights of truncated and full-length isoforms, respectively. This antibody also detected a band around 180 kDa, which is supposed to be highly phosphorylated form of TrkB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Bhattacharyya1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The result shows that both full-length and truncated TrkBs are expressed in the neonatal OB.</p><fig id="pone-0006729-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006729.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Expression patterns of TrkB and p75NTR in developing OB.</title><p>A: Western blot analysis with P5 OB homogenate using anti-TrkBex antibody.

To activate TrkB on the cells, we applied neurotrophins, BDNF, NT3, or NT4, in the culture medium from 0 to 4 DIV. At 4 DIV, cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-GFP antibody to enhance the YFP signals for analysis. First, we measured the number/density of DAPI-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) and YFP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) under our culture conditions. In order to exclude the dying cells, YFP-positive cells that did not have a neurite longer than 10 &#x000b5;m were not counted in this analysis. The percentages of YFP-positive cells among the DAPI-positive cells in different conditions are normalized to control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g004">Figure 4E</xref>. We found that application of BDNF or NT4 increased the percentages of YFP-positive cells in culture about 1.5-fold, while NT3 had no significant effect on cell density.

Here, we analyzed the morphology of YFP-positive cells using the images taken with 10&#x000d7;objective. Since the minimum resolution of this lens is 1.3 &#x000b5;m, thin processes, such as filopodia whose diameter are usually 0.2&#x02013;0.6 &#x000b5;m, were not taken into account in the total neurite length or number of branching points shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g005">Figures 5F and 5E</xref>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006729.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g005">Figures 5D and E</xref>, both the numbers of primary neurites and branches were significantly increased with BDNF or NT4 application. As above, the addition of TrkBFc diminished the effects of BDNF and NT4. These effects also seem most likely to be mediated via TrkB activation since NT3 did not result in any measurable changes in these parameters. Total neurite length was also increased by BDNF or NT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). This was largely due to increase of primary neurites and branches since the maximum neurite length was not markedly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g005">Fig. 5G</xref>). Therefore, TrkB activation appears important for initiating new primary neurites or branches in YFP-positive cells, but may not contribute to the elongation of the pre-existing neurites.</p><p>At higher magnifications, taken with 60&#x000d7;objective, it was apparent that the YFP-positive cells had short filopodia distributed along their neurites at 4 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006729.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).

Density and length were both increased. We measured the densities of filopodia at each condition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006729-g006">Figure 6D</xref>.

We also found that <italic>in vitro</italic> TrkB activation with BDNF or NT4 stimulated the formation of new neurite branches in YFP-positive cells, mitral/tufted cells, with less effect on the elongation of neurites.

The TGF-beta superfamily proteins are suggested to promote dendritic elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Tran1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. TrkB on apical dendrites may be activated only after they begin to innervate a glomerulus. As we discuss later, local interactions, perhaps with OSN axons, are necessary for TrkB activation, which leads to new branch formation in apical dendrites of mitral/tufted cells. Although little is known about the development of lateral dendrites of mitral/tufted cells in the EPL, we did find filopodia along growing lateral dendrites. Moreover, we report here that TrkB activation increased filopodia density along YFP-positive cells. Since filopodia are known as precursors for new branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006729-Niell1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, it is plausible that TrkB is also involved in branching of lateral dendrites in the EPL.</p><p>The expression of BDNF in the mouse olfactory system remains controversial.

Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that neuronal activity may be a prerequisite for activation of TrkBs on the dendrites of mitral/tufted cells, which in turn would stimulate new branch formation.

Neurons were washed with PBS, incubated for 60 minutes with secondary antibodies and DAPI at room temperature, washed with PBS, and mounted with Gel/Mount.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Intracellular dye injection</title><p>For intracellular dye injection, wild-type mice at P3, 5, 7, 10 and 28 were transcardially perfused with either of two fixatives (4&#x00025; PFA or 4&#x00025; PFA/0.125&#x00025; glutaraldehyde), followed by postfixation with 4&#x00025; PFA for 5&#x02013;7 hours. The OBs were coronally cut on a vibratome (Ted Pella, Inc; Redding, CA) into 300 &#x000b5;m slices, and stored in 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4) at 4&#x000b0;C until use.</p><p>At the time of injection, 6&#x00025; Lucifer yellow (Invitrogen) diluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was filled into a glass micropipette (impedance 100&#x02013;200 M&#x003a9;). The slices were mounted onto a membrane filter (Millipore) and transferred into an injection chamber containing 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4). Under the fluorescent microscope, the micropipette was placed in the MCL, and Lucifer yellow was injected with a negative current (1&#x02013;10 nA) for 10&#x02013;20 minutes until the glomerular tufts of the mitral cell appeared brightly fluorescent. Lucifer yellow-injected slices were then post-fixed with 4&#x00025; PFA for at least 48 hours at 4&#x000b0;C and cut on a vibratome into 50 &#x000b5;m sections. Sections were sequentially incubated with blocking buffer (2&#x00025; BSA in PBS-T), rabbit anti-Lucifer yellow antibody (Invitrogen; 1&#x02236;200), and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody with DAPI and DRAQ5.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Image acquisition and statistics</title><p>To analyze YFP-positive cells in primary culture, images were acquired using an epifluorescent microscope (BX51, Olympus Corporation; Tokyo, Japan) with 10&#x000d7;or 60&#x000d7;objectives. Levels were adjusted in Photoshop software (Adobe; San Jose, CA), but the images were otherwise unaltered. Neurite analysis (numbers of branching points and primary neurites, total neurite length, and maximum neurite length) of YFP-positive cells and counting of DAPI and YFP-positive cells were performed with images taken with 10&#x000d7;objective, whose minimum resolution is 1.3 &#x000b5;m (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006729.s002">Fig. S2A2</xref>).

At least 76 YFP-positive cells having neurites longer than 10 &#x000b5;m were analyzed for every condition and three independent repetitions were done. Measurement of filopodia was performed using Imaris software (Bitplane AG; Zurich, Switzerland).
