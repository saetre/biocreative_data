For example, cultured hippocampal neurons extend arbitrarily oriented neurites and then one of these, usually the one nearest the centrosome, begins to grow more quickly than the others. This neurite becomes the axon as it accumulates molecular components of the apical junctional complex. All the other neurites become dendrites. It is unclear, however, whether neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, which differentiate within a polarized epithelium, break symmetry by using similar intrinsic mechanisms. To investigate this, we use four-dimensional microscopy of developing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in live zebrafish embryos. We find that the situation is indeed very different <italic>in vivo</italic>, where axons emerge directly from uniformly polarized cells in the absence of other neurites. <italic>In vivo</italic>, moreover, components of the apical complex do not localize to the emerging axon, nor does the centrosome predict the site of axon emergence. Mosaic analysis in four dimensions, using mutants in which neuroepithelial polarity is disrupted, indicates that extrinsic factors such as access to the basal lamina are critical for normal axon emergence from RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>A key step in neuronal morphogenesis is the emergence of correctly oriented axons and dendrites. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that determine how one neurite is selected to become the axon while the others become dendrites have been studied extensively in conditions where this problem is most approachable experimentally, namely <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. If hippocampal cells are cultured soon after their final mitotic divisions, multiple neurites emerge simultaneously at seemingly random orientations. From these young multipolar neurons, one neurite then begins to elongate preferentially, marking the beginning of polarization. It becomes the axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and as it grows it inhibits the other neurites from becoming axons. They become dendrites instead. The inhibitory signal relies on the activities of the small GTPases Rac/Cdc42 and Rho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and on the localized inactivation of GSK-3&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Proteins normally associated with the apical junctional complexes of epithelial cells, such as Par-3, Par-6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) have a role in polarization <italic>in vitro</italic>. Aided by adenomatous polyposis coli and KIF3A (a kinesin superfamily protein), proteins that travel along microtubules, these apical components accumulate at the tips of growing axons. Interference with the activity of any of these proteins compromises polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The centrosome, acting as a microtubule organizing center, also has a role in axon formation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and recent evidence suggests that its position determines of the site of axon emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In dissociated cell cultures, neurons develop in the presence of very scarce external cues, and so must perforce break symmetry intrinsically. <italic>In vivo</italic>, however, neurons are generated within a highly oriented three-dimensional neuroepithelium. In such a situation, differentiating neurons may depend on external cues for polarization. In support of this idea, Rolls and Doe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] demonstrated that, in <italic>Drosophila </italic>mutants lacking the apical junction components Par-3, Par-6 or aPKC, neurons in the central nervous system <italic>in vivo </italic>are nevertheless appropriately oriented. This study raises two important questions. First, are the dissimilarities in these results due to differences between vertebrates and invertebrates or are they due to differences between the situation <italic>in vitro </italic>and that <italic>in vivo</italic>? Second, if extrinsic cues polarize neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, how is this done in such a way that neurons become appropriately oriented?</p><p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are an excellent model system with which to study the above questions. Restricted to a layer adjacent to the inner basement membrane, RGCs show 'typical' neuronal polarity, with basally oriented axons and apically oriented dendritic trees. More than a century ago, Ram&#x000f3;n y Cajal made observations of the embryonic chick retina and drew differentiating 'RGCs' with bipolar morphologies, including a retracting apical process and an axon extending from the basal side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In line with this, Hinds and Hinds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], in their serial electron microscopic studies of the developing mouse retina, suggested that the axons of RGCs arise from the basal process of neuroepithelial-like precursors. By injecting Lucifer yellow into differentiating RGCs in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos, Holt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] showed that RGC axons almost always emerge from the basal pole of the cell. Halfter and Schurer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] found that disruption of the inner basement membrane of the developing chick retina led to aberrant RGC axon outgrowth. Together, these studies suggest a relationship between axon orientation in differentiating RGCs and the basal surface of the neuroepithelium. However, in all of these studies the images were static and the analysis depended on the cells' having already assumed the beginnings of RGC morphology, including the formation of a primordial axon. To understand what is going on when neurons first polarize, it is essential to be able to follow single cells from their final mitosis to the time when they extend a definitive axon. Only through such studies is it possible to learn, for example, whether differentiating RGCs <italic>in vivo </italic>go through an early multipolar phase in which they put out several exploratory neurites before they stabilize one as the axon.</p><p>In the zebrafish, through the use of transgenes that drive fluorescent proteins under the control of an enhancer-promoter from the <italic>ath5 </italic>gene (<italic>atoh7</italic>) and four-dimensional (4D) microscopy, it is possible to view the differentiation of RGCs <italic>in vivo </italic>from their final mitosis at the apical surface, through to the initiation of their axonal and dendritic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We took advantage of these innovations to show that RGCs send out axons directly from their basal surface in the absence of other neurites emerging from the cell. Tracing the movements of different apical markers, such as junctional complex or centrosomal proteins, in these transgenic retinas revealed that these components remain in the retracting apical process while the axon extends from the opposite (basal) pole of the differentiating cell body of the RGC.</p><p>To look for extrinsic cues in polarizing RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used two mutants in which the polarity of the retinal neuroepithelium is disrupted: <italic>nagie oko </italic>(<italic>nok</italic>) and <italic>heart and soul </italic>(<italic>has</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Detailed 4D analyses of wild-type RGCs in mutant environments show that the polarization and orientation of RGCs is determined by the local orientation of the neuroepithelium, including factors such as the presence of a basal lamina. RGCs without access to either the inner or outer basal lamina during their differentiation go through a multipolar phase that precedes polarization, as they do <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results provide strong evidence for an extrinsic influence in RGC polarization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained and bred at 26.5&#x000b0;C, and embryos were raised at 28.5&#x000b0;C.

The promoter and coding region were subcloned in the IsceI pBSII SK+ vector, kindly provided by Dr Jochen Wittbrodt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For the GFP-zcentrin construct, pCJW263 is a pCS2+-based plasmid in which zebrafish centrin is joined in-frame, 3' to EGFP. It was created in the following steps. The <italic>Sal</italic>I site of pCS2P+ was removed by digestion then infilling with Klenow enzyme and religation. This plasmid was cut with <italic>Bam</italic>HI, the 5' overhangs filled in with Klenow enzyme and then cut again with <italic>Xba</italic>I. This fragment was ligated with the <italic>Afe</italic>I-<italic>Xba</italic>I fragment of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) that contains the EGFP coding region and multiple cloning sites to create the vector pCS2P+EGFPN. Zebrafish centrin was amplified by PCR using IMAGE clone 5899515 as template and these primers: 5'-TTGGATCCTCATGGCGTCCGGCTTCAGGAAAAGC-3' (forward) and 5'-TTCTCGAGGTACAGATTGGTTTTCTTCATAATCCG-3' (reverse). The PCR product was digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Xho</italic>I and ligated with <italic>Bgl</italic>II- and <italic>Sal</italic>I-cut pCS2P+EGFPN. GFP-zcentrin mRNA was transcribed from the Sp6 promoter of pCJW263, linearized with <italic>Not</italic>I, using the mMessage machine <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). RNA was purified with the RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).</p><p>For transient expression of fluorescent proteins, embryos were injected with either plasmid containing the gene of interest, under the control of a general (cytomegalovirus) promoter or the RGC progenitor-specific (<italic>ath5</italic>) promoter, or with mRNA transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic>. DNA injections were made into the cell at the one-cell stage, whereas mRNA injections were done into the yolk at the one-cell to four-cell stage, using a micromanipulator-mounted micropipette and a Picospritzer microinjector. The maximum volumes for injection were 2.5 nl into the cell and 5 nl into the yolk. For the <italic>ath5 </italic>promoter-driven constructs, the plasmids were injected together with meganuclease <italic>I-Sce-I </italic>at a concentration of 10 ng/&#x003bc;l into one-cell-stage embryos, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For stable transgenesis, embryos expressing the fluorescent protein at the correct location were selected and raised to sexual maturity; transgenic carriers were identified by outcrossing to wild-type fish.</p><p>Morpholinos diluted in water were injected into the yolk at the one-cell to eight-cell stage.

The ideal amount to be injected was determined by analyzing a range of concentrations. We found, for the Slit1b morpholino, different responses in different genetic backgrounds, but these were corrected for by adjusting the amount injected, resulting in the same reproducible phenotypes. For the analysis of the data we took into account only embryos that had received the same relative amount of morpholino (namely, 2 to 3 ng for the <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>line and 6 to 8 ng for the <italic>ath5:gap-rfp </italic>line) that did not cause obvious effects in cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Live imaging of whole-mounted embryos</title><p>Embryo processing and 4D imaging were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Usually, stacks about 100 &#x003bc;m thick, composed of sections separated by 1 &#x003bc;m, were taken every 5 to 10 minutes during an average period of 20 to 24 hours. To avoid damaging the embryos, we maintained the power of the lasers at a minimum (typically 12 to 20%). The 4D data thus obtained were processed and analyzed with Volocity (Improvision, Coventry, UK). Unless stated otherwise in the figure legends, the images shown are maximum-intensity projections of all or most of the confocal stack.

Time-lapse analyses of these cells revealed initial stages of polarization that, although much more rapid, are fundamentally similar to those described for rat hippocampal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a,b</xref>). Immediately after explantation, <italic>ath5:gfp</italic>-positive cells are round and show intense surface activity in the form of pseudopodia and short filopodia. In some cases, a rapid circular movement of pseudopodia, known as 'circus movements' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], was seen. This 'stage 1' lasts about 7 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). 'Stage 2' is shorter (lasting about 4 hours) and is characterized by the appearance of several short neurites that alternately elongate and retract, so that cells in stage 2 often have two or more neurites at the same time. Suddenly, and marking the start of 'stage 3', one neurite shows a conspicuous growth cone and begins to grow faster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). By 24 hours, most of the RGCs appear unipolar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). 'Stage 4' is usually visible from the second day of culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>) in RGCs with one long Tau-1-positive axon-like neurite and a few short, Tau-1-negative neurites branching at the opposite pole of the cell body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d,e</xref>).

Proliferating precursor cells typically straddle the width of the retinal neuroepithelium. Shortly after their last cell division (I) the cell bodies of RGC precursors move towards the basal side of the neuroepithelium by translocating their nuclei along a basal process that either remains through cytokinesis or extends immediately afterwards (II). Then the apical process, which remains in contact with the apical surface throughout neuroepithelial proliferation, detaches and begins to retract (III to IV; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>). In every differentiating RGC analyzed (a total of 65 cells from 13 different embryos), the first neurite forms at the basal surface of the neuroepithelium, in the vicinity of the retinal inner limiting membrane or basal lamina, and immediately differentiates as an axon, forming a growth cone (IV to VI). In these <italic>in vivo </italic>studies, we define the axon as a neurite that grows on the vitreal surface of the retina and is directed towards the optic nerve exit. No other transitory neurites were seen to emerge in any of the observed cases. Just before axon emergence, the cells show highly dynamic filopodia at their basal pole (IV) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,c</xref>; see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref> below) often biased towards the site of the optic nerve exit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Thus, unlike the situation <italic>in vitro</italic>, there is no evidence of non-oriented (stage 1) or multipolar (stage 2) phases in the polarization of RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Electron microscopic studies by Hinds and Hinds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] of RGCs differentiating in the mouse retina suggested that the axons of RGCs arise from such basal processes. Without direct time-lapse observations, however, it was not possible for these authors to rule out the possibility that the basal processes of such cells retract before their axons emerge. We therefore took the opportunity offered by 4D imaging to re-examine this question. Until about 40 hpf, growth cones form at the tip of the extended basal process in about half the RGCs examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,d</xref>). In the other half, particularly those adjacent to the inner limiting membrane of the neuroepithelium, the axon emerges without a visible basal process (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,b',d</xref>; see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref> below for another example). After 40 hpf, almost all the RGCs form their axons from a basal process (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). These results confirm the interpretations of Hinds and Hinds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] but show that, at early stages, RGC axons need not emerge from an extended basal process.</p></sec><sec><title>Axon outgrowth usually precedes and is independent of apical retraction</title><p>After observing the dynamics of axonogenesis on RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we wondered whether the formation of the axon in RGCs could be related to the retraction of the apical process. To test this, we monitored differentiating RGCs in which the apical process was clearly visible. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>, in most of the differentiating RGCs (37 out of 44 cells, from 12 different embryos), the axon does indeed begin to grow after the start of the retraction of the apical process, with a median delay of about 1 hour (29 out of 44 cells presented a delay of between 0 and 2 hours). The time between the onset and completion of the apical retraction (as averaged from 23 cells in which we were able to follow total retraction) was 4.0 &#x000b1; 2.3 hours (mean &#x000b1; SD), with a significant variability in the time course of the retraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thus, in most RGCs, the axon emerges after the onset of apical retraction but before its completion. In nearly half the cases, the apical processes stop or even re-extend for a short distance (5 to 10 &#x003bc;m) at different moments during the retraction. There are also often minor (1 to 4 &#x003bc;m) back-and-forth oscillations of the apical process before retraction is complete (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).

Thus it might be that <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the morphology shows an apical process at the time of axon emergence, molecularly the situation is similar to what happens <italic>in vitro</italic>. If so, we should be able to test this idea by following apical proteins in RGCs during this transition period.</p><p>We decided to investigate this issue by using the fusion protein ASIP/PAR-3-EGFP (Par3-GFP) as an <italic>in vivo </italic>apical marker. This protein was previously shown to accumulate at the apical side of the neural tube epithelium in the zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Of the three splice isoforms of zebrafish Par-3 described so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], this one is the most similar to the 150 kDa Pard-3a, which does not cause retinal patterning defects when overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consistent with all these observations, we found that the overexpression of Par3-GFP does not affect retinal lamination or differentiation and that it accumulates at the apical border of the retinal neuroepithelium at early stages. Interestingly, just at the stage at which RGCs start to differentiate, granules containing Par3-GFP move from the apical towards the basal side of the retina (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>). They do not, however, travel all the way to the basal surface but seem instead to accumulate throughout the developing neuroepithelium, particularly around the central region, at the stages examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>). Do these Par3-GFP granules, we wondered, remain in the apical processes of differentiating cells? Indeed, 4D analysis of embryos double-labeled with this construct and <italic>ath5:gap-rfp </italic>reveals that these granules dynamically co-localize with the tips of retracting apical processes of RGCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">Additional file 5</xref>). In our experimental conditions, we failed to see an accumulation of this apical marker at the tip of the growing axons (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">Additional file 5</xref>). Moreover, antibody staining of differentiating RGCs revealed that other apical markers, such as aPKC, &#x003b1;-catenin and F-actin, remain at the tips of RGCs retracting apical processes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c&#x02013;e</xref>). In the Slit1b morphants, apical process retraction is inhibited, and the Par3-GFP signal in RGCs remains at the apical border of the retina even after the formation of the axon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6f</xref>).</p><p>Another structure associated with the apical compartment of many epithelia, including the retinal neuroepithelium, is the centrosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To visualize the localization of the centrosome in differentiating RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a fusion protein containing the full zebrafish sequence of the pericentriolar protein centrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], attached to EGFP ('GFP-zcentrin'), and used it to follow the subcellular localization of the centrosome in <italic>ath5:gap-rfp</italic>-labeled differentiating RGCs.</p><p>We find that GFP-zcentrin labels small dots located at the apical side of the undifferentiated retinal neuroepithelium. Some of these centrosomes are clearly in the apical tips of <italic>ath5:gap-rfp</italic>-positive cells. When these cells enter into the differentiation process that will lead to an RGC, the apical process is retracted as we have described, and the centrosome remains associated with the tip of the retracting process (20 out of 20 cells in five different embryos), even when the cell is extending its axon on the opposite side (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">Additional file 6</xref>). In all the cases studied, the centrosome approaches the nucleus (on its apical side) only just before the completion of apical retraction. By analogy with what we found for Par3-GFP, we failed to see a basal localization of the centrosome in the differentiating RGCs. Two out of the 20 cells that were followed showed a lateral localization of the GFP-zcentrin-positive centrosome, starting at about 1.5 hours after the apical process had completed the retraction; the rest remained clearly apical.</p><p>Taken together, these observations show that, during their differentiation, RGCs undergo a transition phase in which they retain some characteristics of a neuroepithelial cell, such as the apical localization of junctional molecules and the centrosome, while forming the axon. They also show that, at least for RGCs differentiating <italic>in vivo</italic>, the axon emerges basally, whereas apical proteins and the centrosome remain apical.</p></sec><sec><title>The polarity of the neuroepithelium is crucial for RGC orientation</title><p>The above experiments show that RGCs polarize in harmony with the neuroepithelium in which they arise. This suggests that the local environment may influence the site of axon outgrowth in differentiating RGCs. If so, axon emergence in RGCs may be affected if the polarity of the retinal neuroepithelium is disrupted, as it is in the zebrafish mutants <italic>nok </italic>and <italic>has</italic>. The <italic>nok </italic>mutant is defective in Pals-1 (also known as Stardust or MPP5), a MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) protein that associates with the apical junctional complex. The atypical protein kinase C aPKC-&#x003bb;, the protein affected in <italic>has </italic>mutants, is a core component of this complex. To investigate how RGC axons emerge in these disrupted environments, we injected the <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>construct or crossed <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>transgenic fish onto these mutant backgrounds.</p><p>A 4D analysis of RGCs in <italic>nok </italic>mutants shows that when <italic>ath5:gap-gfp</italic>-positive cells are located in the normal basal position, they form an axon at the inner surface of the retina and grow towards the site of the optic nerve exit just as in wild-type retinas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>). Interestingly, however, many RGCs are malpositioned in <italic>nok </italic>mutants and come to lie at the apical side of the neuroepithelium. These misplaced cells, after showing filopodial activity similar to that seen in normal cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>), also extend a single axon (29 out of 29 cells in 11 embryos). However, the first neurites of these ectopic RGCs are always directed towards the outer retinal surface, indicating a reversal of cell orientation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>). Such inversely oriented 'axons' seem to grow more slowly and more erratically than axons from normally positioned RGCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c</xref>). Remarkably, however, they also seem to grow towards the site of the optic nerve exit. A time-lapse study of thick confocal stacks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">Additional file 7</xref>) reveals that many of the apical axons eventually find and merge with the optic nerve.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7g</xref> shows one of these F-actin accumulations in the proximity of the non-axonal process of an ectopic RGC, suggesting that its polarity is completely inverted; that is, its basally directed process is the equivalent of the apical process in a normal RGC. Consistent with this was our observation, by 4D microscopy, of 12 ectopically differentiating RGCs from 8 different <italic>nok </italic>embryos, which clearly retract this 'apical process' while forming the axon on the retinal outer surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Additional file 8</xref>). We also looked at the movements of Par3-GFP granules in <italic>ath5:gap-rfp</italic>-positive cells in these mutant retinas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7i</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7h</xref> shows a Par3-GFP granule at the tip of a basally directed 'apical' process in an ectopic RGC, which is extending an axon on the outer retinal surface. However, we never found any accumulation of Par3-GFP at the axon growth cone.</p><p>In <italic>has </italic>mutants, we also found displaced <italic>ath5:gap-gfp</italic>-positive cells. However, in contrast with <italic>nok </italic>mutants, the formation of axons from these putative RGCs was difficult to observe. Most of the apical <italic>ath5:gap-gfp</italic>-positive cells in <italic>has </italic>mutants show a high degree of cell surface activity, and often form several short neurites. In fact, they behave in a way that is reminiscent of RGCs at stage 2 <italic>in vitro </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">Additional file 9</xref>). In more extended recording sessions, from <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>transgenics crossed into a <italic>has </italic>mutant background, ectopic RGCs with axons could be seen. Unlike those seen in <italic>nok </italic>mutants, in <italic>has </italic>embryos the ectopic axon-like neurites often do not extend for long distances and many of them grow towards the retinal periphery instead of towards the optic nerve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>; see quantification in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> below). The problems that these cells seem to have in their ability to grow axons or direct them properly could in principle be due to a cell-autonomous effect of the mutation, especially because aPKC activity has been shown to be important for axon determination in rat hippocampal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, this is unlikely to be so, because mutant RGCs positioned on the basal side of the retina form axons normally (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">Additional file 9</xref>). In addition, <italic>has </italic>mutant RGCs polarize <italic>in vitro </italic>with the same efficiency as wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c&#x02013;e</xref>). Thus, the differences in polarization between ectopic <italic>has </italic>and <italic>nok </italic>mutant RGCs are more likely to be due to an environmental rather than a cell-autonomous effect.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Polarization of ectopic RGCs is impaired in a non cell-autonomous manner in <italic>has </italic>mutants. <bold>(a) </bold>Four-dimensional (4D) analysis of the retina of a <italic>has</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryo injected with <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">Additional file 9</xref>).

A clue to answering this question, we thought, might come from exploring the differences between <italic>nok </italic>and <italic>has </italic>mutants. The most salient difference between these mutants is the pigmentation of the eye (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a</xref>). This suggested to us that the integrity of the RPE could be an important factor. In wild-type embryos, the pigment covers the outer retinal neuroepithelium, whereas in <italic>nok </italic>mutants, large areas of retinal surface are devoid of pigment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and in these areas the basal lamina of the RPE, Bruch's membrane, is juxtaposed to the epithelium of the neural retina (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9b,c</xref>). In <italic>has </italic>mutants, the gaps in the RPE are rare and small (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9d</xref>), with the RPE only seeming really scarce at the peripheral rim.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>The RPE influences the ability of retinal ganglion cells to polarize in ectopic positions. <bold>(a) </bold>Head region of wild-type, morphant and mutant embryos, showing the distribution of pigment around the retina.

The intensity profile of the green channel (GFP) was plotted and the values were normalized (maximum intensity) and averaged for each embryo; the resulting plots were then normalized to each other (integrated intensity). To compare the profiles in relation to the distribution of the RPE, we positioned the line either in regions where zpr-2 immunoreactivity was detected (RPE) or not (NO RPE). For the <italic>nok </italic>mutants, only measurements of areas without detectable RPE were used.

In <italic>nok </italic>mutants, the ectopic <italic>ath5:gap-gfp</italic>-expressing cells and axons seem to be concentrated in areas of the retina devoid of RPE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9b,f</xref>). In <italic>has </italic>embryos, however, <italic>ath5:gap-gfp</italic>-positive cells seem to be more evenly distributed across the width of the retina (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9f</xref>). To quantify this we measured the profiles of <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>fluorescence intensity on confocal sections of these double-labeled retinas. The results, presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9e</xref>, show that the accumulation of label at the inner side of the retina in the wild-type retina is converted into an accumulation of signal at both retinal surfaces in the <italic>nok </italic>mutant retina. In <italic>nok </italic>morphants (which show a milder <italic>nok</italic>-like phenotype) there is clearly a small peak of apical <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>signal in areas where the RPE is absent. These data are consistent with the RGCs being close to the surface on which they are growing axons. This may be so, because once the axon forms, it is likely to exert enough tension on the cell body to tow it towards the relevant surface. In <italic>has </italic>mutants, although the RPE covers most of the retinal apical surface, there are only few areas devoid of RPE. In these areas we also found a slightly higher apical <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>signal.</p><p>These results suggest that access to a basement membrane, either the inner basal lamina or the neural retina or the outer Bruch's membrane of the RPE, may be sufficient to elicit oriented axon emergence. If this is so, then ectopic apical RGCs that are prevented from gaining access to Bruch's membrane should have trouble polarizing, whereas even wild-type RGCs should show reverse polarization if given access to this basement membrane. To test this hypothesis we performed blastomere transplantation experiments between wild-type and <italic>nok </italic>mutant embryos. As expected from previous results, some transplanted cells from <italic>ath5:gap-gfp</italic>-positive wild-type donors into <italic>nok </italic>hosts seem ectopically localized (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10b</xref>). These wild-type cells are generally reverse-polarized and grow axons on the outer retinal surface, directed towards the optic nerve exit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10c</xref>). When <italic>nok </italic>mutant cells are transplanted into wild-type embryos, small clones of mutant <italic>ath5:gap-gfp</italic>-positive cells behave like normal RGCs (not shown), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, when the transplanted clones are larger, there is a clear local disruption of the host's neuroepithelial polarity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10d</xref>). In most of these cases the neural retinal clones are next to wild-type intact RPE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">Additional file 10</xref>), resulting in ectopic <italic>nok </italic>mutant RGCs with no access to Bruch's membrane. What is particularly telling here is that most of these ectopic RGCs either fail to grow long neurites or grow axons that are misdirected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10f</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Importance of the tissue environment for the differentiation and orientation of ectopic retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). <bold>(a) </bold>Extended-focus confocal image from a wild-type host embryo transplanted with blastomeres from an <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>transgenic wild-type embryo. gcl, ganglion cell layer. <bold>(b,c) </bold>Extended-focus images from <italic>nok</italic><sup>-/- </sup>host retinas transplanted with <italic>ath5:gap-gfp </italic>transgenic cells (wild type).

The data support the hypothesis that the inversion of ectopic RGC orientation in <italic>nok </italic>mutants is dependent on the absence of the RPE. To test this further, we used low doses of a translation-blocking <italic>nok </italic>morpholino (0.17 to 0.20 pmoles per embryo; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a</xref>), which, although able to produce ectopic RGCs, are not efficient at removing the RPE. Thus, ectopic RGCs in these embryos are usually apposed to the RPE rather than Bruch's membrane. According to the hypothesis being tested, these cells should also have difficulty in polarizing. Indeed, these ectopic RGCs do not generally orient in either the normal or reverse direction, and the axons of these cells, when present, tend to grow aberrantly, often towards the retinal periphery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">Additional file 11</xref>). A summary of the observed behaviors of RGCs in the analyzed conditions is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10i</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Intrinsic mechanisms are used predominantly to break symmetry in neurons that develop in a two-dimensional symmetric <italic>in vitro </italic>environment, but <italic>in vivo </italic>the polarized three-dimensional environment provides extrinsic signals that orient differentiating neurons. To approach the mechanisms that drive neuronal polarization <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have used 4D microscopy to examine how RGCs in zebrafish make the morphological transition from post-mitotic neuroepithelial-shaped cells to neurons with basally oriented axons. Comparison of the polarization of mammalian hippocampal neurons, or indeed zebrafish RGCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, shows that there are crucial differences between RGC polarization in culture and in the living tissue. These differences may be explained on the basis of environmental influences. Cultured cells are in an almost completely artificial environment. They are in contact with a flat substrate (often rich in laminin) and rarely come into contact with other cells. <italic>In vivo</italic>, however, differentiating neurons are naturally almost completely surrounded by cells with which they interact extensively. In addition, the native environment provides heterogeneously distributed positional cues that are difficult to emulate <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>These differences are likely to influence the initial stages of differentiation. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the cell is rounded and extends pseudopodia and filopodia all around its free surface, whereas <italic>in vivo </italic>the newborn RGC first extends from the apical to the basal surface of the neuroepithelium assuming a spindle shape, typical of neuroepithelial cells, and then starts retracting its apical process. RGCs <italic>in vivo </italic>show filopodial activity at the basal side for 1 or 2 hours before axonogenesis, whereas RGCs differentiating in culture extend short neurites at several points of their cell bodies, before one of them starts to elongate in an axon-like manner. This seems very comparable to stage 2 of rat hippocampal neurons differentiating <italic>in vitro</italic>, although we found that RGCs, in our culture conditions, do not usually present a multipolar morphology, but just an alternative growth and retraction of neurites at different points. Another difference from rat hippocampal cells is that zebrafish RGCs seem to form their dendrites <italic>de novo </italic>in the transition between stages 3 and 4. The second stage, which can last up to several hours in cultured RGCs, is not seen in normal differentiating RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, because these cells seem to pass directly from a neuroepithelial-like spindle-shaped cell to one in which the RGC has only a single fast-extending neurite, which invariably becomes the axon. This neurite is always formed at the basal pole of the cell, opposite to a retracting apical process. Signals distributed heterogeneously in the retinal neuroepithelium could be responsible for restricting axon formation to the basal side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A similarly restricted cellular behavior has very recently been described for HSN motorneurons differentiating in living <italic>C. elegans </italic>larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The seminal work of Hinds and Hinds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in the developing mouse retina, following the much earlier observations of Ram&#x000f3;n y Cajal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggested that in RGCs the axon and the basal process were the same thing, or that the axon was formed from the basal process. Recent time-lapse observations of bipolar cells <italic>in vivo </italic>showed that the neurites extending into the outer plexiform layer and the inner plexiform layer develop respectively from the unretracted apical and basal processes of the migrating precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the present study, 4D imaging allowed us to observe the dynamics of axonogenesis in RGCs <italic>in vivo </italic>and to see that in many cases, especially at early stages, the axon emerges directly from the cell body after it reaches the basal surface of the neuroepithelium and is in apposition to it. It is interesting that the filopodial activity at the basal side of such differentiating RGCs starts before the extension of the axon, similar to what was previously described for differentiating rat RGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. At later stages, however, most RGC axons do seem to grow from a basal process. The reason why basal process-free differentiating RGCs are only seen at relatively early stages of retinal differentiation may reflect the fact that the first RGCs are able to translocate their somas all the way to the basalmost position, whereas later-differentiating somas are blocked from reaching the basal surface by a layer of tightly packed RGCs and must form axons from a distance (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><p>We wondered whether the retraction of the apical process or components that are normally localized to this process provide intrinsic information that tells the differentiating RGC when and where to form the axon. In the retina, post-mitotic RGC precursors transiently acquire a spindle-like, neuroepithelial morphology. They begin to lose this neuroepithelial morphology with the retraction of the apical process, and the axon is usually formed after this retraction has started but has not yet completed. However, our observations also show that axons can emerge from RGCs before retraction of the apical process begins. In Slit1b morphants, most RGCs form axons before apical process retraction begins. Our results with Slit1b are consistent with previous work showing a role for Slit proteins in neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and it will be very interesting to investigate how Slit1b is involved in apical retraction, although that would have to be the subject of another study. All these observations indicate that axon extension occurs independently of the timing of apical retraction.</p><p>It has been confirmed by different groups that the Par-3-Par-6-aPKC complex accumulates at the tip of the growing axon of cultured hippocampal neurons, where it has a fundamental role in the determination of axon identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We did not find detectable accumulation of Par3-GFP in the RGC axons forming <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rather, this protein, although present in differentiating RGCs, remains apical. This finding supports the apparent absence of a role for apical complex components in mushroom body neurons during axonogenesis (or dendritogenesis) in living <italic>Drosophila </italic>larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We also show that aPKC-&#x003bb;-deficient (<italic>has</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) RGCs are able to polarize efficiently and extend axons <italic>in vivo </italic>when these cells are in contact with the inner surface of the retina and that they can also polarize <italic>in vitro</italic>. In this case it may be that because the <italic>has </italic>mutation affects aPKC-&#x003bb; and not aPKC-&#x003b6;, the latter compensates for the absence of the former and that double mutants may be needed to reveal whether aPKCs are necessary for oriented RGC axon outgrowth <italic>in vivo </italic>and intrinsic polarization <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>It was reported recently that the localization of the centrosome is involved in establishing the site of axon emergence from cultured rat hippocampal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The authors of that study suggested that during telophase of a neurogenic apicobasal cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], the centrosome of the basal post-mitotic daughter cell, being located opposite to the apical surface, would determine the emergence of the axon from the basal side. However, this could not work in our case because there are no apicobasal cell divisions in the differentiating zebrafish retina, and RGCs originate from planar oriented divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The absence of apicobasal divisions in the zebrafish retina is also consistent with our observation that RGC precursors inherit components such as Par3-GFP, aPKC, &#x003b1;-catenin and F-actin of the apical adhesion complexes in the tips of their retracting apical processes. Surprisingly, through the dynamic analysis of RGC differentiation by 4D microscopy, we also found that the centrosome does not move from its apical position during the whole process of axonogenesis. This observation does not exclude the possibility of an essential role of this organelle in axon determination or axon growth but shows that its localization close to the site of axon formation is not necessary for the normal polarization of zebrafish RGCs <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, our data support previous data obtained from the ultrastructural analysis of the differentiating mouse retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and other systems, including hippocampal pyramidal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Many studies have shown that the centrosome, which is essential for nuclear translocation, is located on the leading edge side of the nucleus in migrating neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In our system, the centrosome localizes to the trailing edge as the nucleus translocates towards the basal surface. This difference could be because RGCs do not actually migrate but just elongate and translocate their nuclei.</p><p>We have used two mutations, <italic>nok </italic>and <italic>has</italic>, to analyze the role of neuroepithelial polarity in the orientation of RGC polarity <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found in <italic>nok </italic>mutants that ectopic RGCs are able to polarize properly (that is, to form only one axon) but that their orientation is often inverted (that is, the axon is directed towards the outer retina). In accordance with previous findings that apical markers, including F-actin and Par-3, are accumulated in random positions inside the retina in these mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we found that basally directed processes of these ectopic differentiating RGCs express Par3-GFP in the proximity of F-actin staining. In the <italic>nok </italic>mutant retinas there are large gaps where the RPE is not present and where Bruch's membrane, the basal lamina of the RPE, becomes apposed to the surface of the retinal neuroepithelium. In these regions the neuroepithelial polarity seems completely inverted (that is, the apical complex is basally located with respect to a basal lamina present at the apical surface of the neuroepithelium).</p><p>We also unexpectedly found that there were fewer ectopic RGCs concentrated on the apical side of the retina, as well as many fewer ectopic axons in <italic>has </italic>mutants than in <italic>nok </italic>mutants. The RPE is more intact in <italic>has </italic>mutants. This observation suggests that the RPE may normally inhibit reverse polarization, either by generating an inhibitory signal or by blocking access to permissive signals on Bruch's membrane. It has previously been shown in chick and quail that a small proportion of axons naturally escape from the optic nerve layer and grow between the cells of the RPE and Bruch's membrane, and that the Bruch's basal lamina is a good substrate <italic>in vitro </italic>for RGC axon growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This favors the plausibility of the second hypothesis. In addition, inversion of RGCs has been observed in organ-cultured retinas in which the vitreal surface was exposed to chondroitin sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In this case, too, ectopic RGCs extend axons on the outer surface of the retina. Many previous studies have proposed that the RPE has an essential role in retinal lamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and it is tempting to speculate that our observations could also help explain their results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The polarity of the neuroepithelium seems to be a major determinant in the site of axon outgrowth from RGCs. Our work suggests that there is an intrinsic tendency for RGCs to polarize (to form only one axon) but that RGCs differentiating <italic>in vivo </italic>use signals, like those normally found at the inner limiting membrane of the retina, to define the orientation of this polarization and the position of axon emergence.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>4D = four-dimensional; aPKC = atypical protein kinase C; CCD = charge-coupled device; EGFP = enhanced green fluorescent protein; <italic>has </italic>= <italic>heart and soul</italic>; hpf = hours after fertilization; mAb = monoclonal antibody; mRFP = monomeric red fluorescent protein; <italic>nok </italic>= <italic>nagie oko</italic>; pAb = polyclonal antibody; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; RGC = retinal ganglion cell; RPE = retinal pigment epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FRZ designed, performed and analyzed most of the studies described.
