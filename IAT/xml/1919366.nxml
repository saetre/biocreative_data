When DNA damage primarily involves formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), H2AX is preferentially phosphorylated by ATM rather than by the other PIKKs. We have recently reported that brief exposure of human pulmonary adenocarcinoma A549 cells or normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to cigarette smoke (CS) induced phosphorylation of H2AX.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report here that H2AX phosphorylation in A549 cells induced by CS was accompanied by activation of ATM, as revealed by ATM phosphorylation on <italic>Ser</italic>1981 (ATM-S1981<sup>P</sup>) detected immunocytochemically and by Western blotting. No cell cycle-phase specific differences in kinetics of ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation were observed. When cells were exposed to CS from cigarettes with different tobacco and filter combinations, the expression levels of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>correlated well with the increase in expression of phosphorylated H2AX (&#x003b3;H2AX) (R = 0.89). In addition, we note that while CS-induced &#x003b3;H2AX expression was localized within discrete foci, the activated ATM was distributed throughout the nucleoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data implicate ATM as the PIKK that phosphorylates H2AX in response to DNA damage caused by CS. Based on current understanding of ATM activation, expression and localization, these data would suggest that, in addition to inducing potentially carcinogenic DSB lesions, CS may also trigger other types of DNA lesions and cause chromatin alterations. As checkpoint kinase (Chk) 1, Chk2 and the p53 tumor suppressor gene are known to be phosphorylated by ATM, the present data indicate that exposure to CS may lead to their phosphorylation, with the downstream consequences related to the halt in cell cycle progression and increased propensity to undergo apoptosis. Defining the nature and temporal sequence of molecular events that are disrupted by CS through activation and eventual dysregulation of normal defense mechanisms such as ATM and its downstream effectors may allow a more precise understanding of how CS promotes cancer development.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ATM protein kinase is a key component of the signal transduction pathway that is activated in response to DNA damage, particularly if the damage involves formation of DNA DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. ATM activation takes place through an autophosphorylation site on <italic>Ser</italic>1981, which leads to dissociation of the inactive ATM dimer (or higher-order multimer) into single protein molecules with kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While <italic>Ser</italic>1981 phosphorylation is responsible for dimer dissociation, the catalytic domain of ATM, which becomes accessible to substrates only when ATM is a monomer, is located outside of the <italic>Ser</italic>1981 locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. ATM activation is mediated through mobilization of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, which recognizes DNA damage, recruits ATM and also functions in targeting ATM to initiate phosphorylation of the respective substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The initial activation of ATM occurs at some distance from the site of DSB and is initiated by the changes in higher order chromatin structure resulting from relaxation of the topological stress of the DNA double helix following induction of the DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It should be noted, however, that the mechanism of ATM activation is more complex than just via autophosphorylation. Recent evidence suggests activation requires prior ATM acetylation, which is mediated by the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and is associated with protein phosphatase 5 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], as well as interactions with other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Several downstream target substrates phosphorylated by ATM, such as p53 (TP53), Chk2, Chk1, Brca1 and H2AX, are recognized as having tumor suppressor functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], since their phosphorylation is essential for successful DNA repair, suppression of cell progression through the cell cycle and/or induction of apoptosis. Disruption in one or more of these mechanisms can promote expansion of DNA damage to cell progeny and instigate genomic instability. Development of the phospho-specific antibody towards <italic>Ser</italic>1981 phosphorylated ATM (ATM-S1981<sup>P</sup>) provided a convenient tool to detect ATM activation immunocytochemically in tissue sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and to measure expression of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>in individual cells by cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is noted that when activation of ATM is induced by DSBs, the activated ATM is localized in individual discrete foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However when other DNA lesions or chromatin alterations trigger ATM activation, the activated ATM is diffusely scattered throughout the nucleoplasm and does not form distinct foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>One substrate phosphorylated by ATM is a variant of histone H2A, histone H2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Its phosphorylation on <italic>Ser</italic>139 occurs in response to induction of DSBs. Expression of phosphorylated H2AX [termed &#x003b3;H2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]] is, therefore, considered to be a marker of induction of DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As with ATM-S1981<sup>P</sup>, the development of a phospho-specific &#x003b3;H2AX antibody made it possible to study H2AX phosphorylation in individual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and to quantify by cytometry &#x003b3;H2AX expression in response to DNA damage by different agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>H2AX can be phosphorylated not only by ATM but also by other phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR), or DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. For example, H2AX phosphorylation in response to replication stress induced by hydroxyurea, excess thymidine or aphidicolin was shown to be mediated by ATR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] rather than by ATM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In contrast, DNA-PKcs was shown to mediate H2AX phosphorylation in hypertonically-stressed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], as well as in response to DNA fragmentation during apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells was also seen to be accompanied by activation of ATM, which would suggest that ATM may mediate H2AX phosphorylation during apoptosis as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In addition, there is also evidence that in response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, all three PIKKs (i.e., ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs) may function redundantly to phosphorylate H2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Presumably, each PIKK responds to a hierarchy of specific types of DNA damage or cell contexts in which it may alternately play a primary or supporting role, or no role at all, in the phosphorylation of H2AX. To date, most published data implicate ATM as the dominant physiologically mediator of H2AX phosphorylation in response to DSB formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>We have recently reported that brief exposure of human normal bronchial epithelial cells and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma A549 cells to CS or to cigarette smoke condensates induced H2AX phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In a subsequent study we observed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was, to a large extent, able to protect the cells from induction of H2AX phosphorylation by CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The data suggested that CS-induced DNA damage in these cells involves formation of DSBs, and that these lesions were mediated, in part, by ROS. The present study was aimed to reveal whether ATM is activated by exposure of cells to CS. If ATM activation preceded or was concurrent with H2AX phosphorylation, and if it correlated in intensity with H2AX phosphorylation, it would strongly suggest that ATM is the PIKK that phosphorylates H2AX in response to cell exposure to CS. It would also provide clues as to which potential downstream cell cycle checkpoints, whose activation is mediated by ATM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], may be impacted by CS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exposure of A549 cells to CS led to a marked rise in expression of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>and &#x003b3;H2AX (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The bivariate analysis of cellular DNA content and intensity of immunofluorescence made it possible to correlate expression of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>or &#x003b3;H2AX with cell position in the cell cycle. Expression of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>and &#x003b3;H2AX was markedly increased in cells exposed to CS compared to the mock treated cells. In fact, nearly all cells from the CS-treated cultures expressed ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>or &#x003b3;H2AX IF above the level representing the upper threshold of expression of these phospho-antibodies for 97% of the cells from the mock-treated cultures. It is also apparent from the raw data shown in the scattergrams (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), that exposure to CS led to induction of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>or &#x003b3;H2AX expression at a comparable level in all phases of the cell cycle.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Induction of ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation in A549 cells following their exposure to IM16 CS</bold>.

As is evident, the time-dependent increases in ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>and &#x003b3;H2AX IF were essentially the same for all cells, regardless of the cell cycle phase. While the maximal (plateau) rise in ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>expression was achieved after 10 min exposure to CS, induction of &#x003b3;H2AX continued to increase during the 20 min exposure. The mid-slope increase in induction of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>and &#x003b3;H2AX was at 8 and 13 min of exposure to CS, respectively. Caspase-3 activation was monitored on parallel slides to rule out any possible effects of apoptosis on induction of either &#x003b3;H2AX or ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>IF. No apoptosis was observed under the experimental conditions used in this study (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>IM16 CS-dose (time of treatment) dependence in induction of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>and &#x003b3;H2AX for A549 cells at different phases of the cell cycle</bold>.

The mid-slope points are projected on the CS dose (time of exposure) coordinate. It should be noted that similar curves of &#x003b3;H2AX IF, determined under identical conditions, were previously published [35].

The cells were immunocytochemically labeled with phospho-specific &#x003b3;H2AX antibody, with the secondary antibody fluorescing green (A, C); their DNA was counterstained with DAPI (B, D). Note the low level of constitutive H2AX phosphorylation in the mock-treated cells with discrete punctuate pattern reflecting the presence of IF foci, consisted with the data presented before [70,77]. The CS treated cells show intense &#x003b3;H2AX IF due to very large numbers of IF foci located close to each other. Photomicrographs of the CS treated cells were obtained using automatic camera exposure. To demonstrate the much lower &#x003b3;H2AX IF of mock treated cells, the camera aperture was opened and closed manually for an equivalent length of time.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-8-26-8"/></fig><p>The presence of &#x003b3;H2AX in the mock treated cells appears in the form of distinct foci that are randomly distributed through the nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). The number of such foci and their proximity are greatly increased in the cells exposed to CS, which leads to much stronger overall intensity of &#x003b3;H2AX IF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>CS is a complex chemical mixture of gases and suspended particulate matter that contains a wide range of carcinogens, mutagens, and free radicals that can induce an array of DNA lesions (e.g., adducts, deletions, insertions, point mutations, structural chromosomal aberrations, aberrant sister chromatid exchanges, micronuclei, and single strand DNA breaks) that have been strongly implicated in the development and progression of human cancers by epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Our previous studies showed that CS and cigarette smoke condensate (i.e., 'tar') can also directly induce DSBs in both normal and malignant lung cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. DSBs are a major type of DNA damage that can lead to translocations and chromosomal instability, two important mechanisms in the generation of malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Consequently, detection of DSBs and the various proteins that sense and orchestrate repair of these lesions may ultimately provide a more precise measurement of the potential cancer risk in individuals exposed to CS.</p><p>In the current study, we show that exposure of A549 cells to CS led to concurrent activation of ATM and phosphorylation of H2AX. Moreover, there was a close relationship between ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation both in timing (dose) and in the degree of response to CS. Thus, both events were triggered after 10 min exposure to CS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and the degree of response, when cells were treated with CS from cigarettes with different tobacco and filter combinations, was strongly correlated (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In addition, both ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation were partially suppressed by caffeine but not by NU7026, implying that CS-induced H2AX phosphorylation was predominantly mediated by ATM. DNA damage that primarily results in formation of DSBs is believed to trigger H2AX phosphorylation mediated by ATM rather than by ATR or DNA-PKcs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This observation is in contrast to other genotoxic agents such as hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, and UVR that induce H2AX phosphorylation as a function of replication stress, but which is mediated by ATR and not by ATM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, despite the apparent causal relationship between ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation in CS-treated A549 cells, a definitive study in which ATM expression is suppressed by interfering RNAs (RNAi) is currently being conducted in order to prove conclusively that ATM is the primary responsive kinase.</p><p>How might CS induce DSBs? The most common mechanism by which DSBs are thought to be generated is as a result of stalled DNA replication forks at the sites of single strand DNA lesions such as single-strand breaks (SSBs) during DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Unrepaired DSBs generated by such mechanisms may result in chromosome breakage and mironucleation leading to genetic instability and malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. However, although it is clear that CS can cause numerous SSBs that may induce replication fork stalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], some data suggest that even large amounts of SSBs are incapable of provoking ATM activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Whether this is a general phenomenon or restricted to a specific cell type or cell context remains to be determined, but it may suggest that the induction of DSBs by CS occurs via a mechanism other than SSB formation. An important observation in this regard is that if stalled replication forks at SSB lesions were the dominant mechanism of DSB formation, it would be expected to reflect a characteristic pattern of H2AX phosphorylation that is distinctly maximal in S-phase cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. While we observed somewhat higher levels of H2AX phosphorylation in S-phase cells compared to G<sub>1 </sub>cells upon exposure to CS [see Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]], the difference was rather small. These data imply that the contribution of this mechanism to the overall level of DSB damage, as reflected by the increased expression of &#x003b3;H2AX, was not predominant. One conjecture to mechanistically explain this observation is the possible activation of SMC1, a critical downstream event in the ATM-NBS1-BRCA1 pathway that engages the S-phase checkpoint and prevents movement of the replication forks and thus their collisions with ssDNA lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. However, whether SMC1 is activated in CS-exposed cells remains to be determined.</p><p>CS also contains a range of carcinogens known to result in covalently linked DNA adducts either directly or indirectly after metabolic activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Upon cell proliferation, these type of adducts can induce DNA replication errors that may result in carcinogenic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Moreover, as these DNA-carcinogen adducts are removed by base excision repair mechanisms, defects in one or more of the genes involved in these processes can directly result in DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Another potentially unique capability of CS may be that it can induce DSBs directly due to its large concentration of highly reactive organic and inorganic substances that either are free radicals or can generate free radicals within the cell that can subsequently attack DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. It has been speculated that multiple hydroxyl radicals produced in close proximity could directly cause DSBs and lead to ATM activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It is well documented that increased oxidative stress is a major mechanism by which CS causes airway damage that can lead to a host of pathogenic conditions including lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], possible as a result of the induction of oxidatively derived DNA damage such as altered or mismatched bases, deletions and insertions, intra and inter-strand cross-links, or possibly DSBs. Additional research will be required to determine the primary mechanism(s) by which DSBs are formed in cells exposed to CS. Regardless of the mechanism by which CS induces DSBs, repair of this defect occurs through two major pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). In vertebrate cells, NHEJ is the dominant DSB repair mechanism, particularly in G<sub>1</sub>-phase cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. However, reliance on NHEJ for accurate repair of CS-induced DSBs may be problematic for the damaged cell since this process is error-prone, often resulting in deletion of base pairs that can lead to the accumulation of defective DNA with each cell cycle following exposure to CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].</p><p>Assessing the sites of ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation by UV fluorescence microscopy revealed different patterns of localization in CS-exposed cells. The sites of &#x003b3;H2AX localization had a distinct punctate pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). This was evident despite the close proximity of individual foci with each other and the frequent overlap of their images. The presence of distinct foci of &#x003b3;H2AX IF is considered to be a reliable marker of DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast to &#x003b3;H2AX, no distinct ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>IF foci were observed, and activated ATM was spread rather uniformly over the whole nucleoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). ATM activation in response to DSB formation, similar as H2AX phosphorylation, is purported to present as distinct ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>IF foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is likely, therefore, that the observed pattern of ATM-S1981<sup>P </sup>IF in A549 cells reflects, not only ATM activation in response to formation of DSBs, but also to other types of CS-induced DNA lesions that may have more global effects such as altering chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Such diverse spatial patterns of response in terms of nuclear ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation are consistent with a variety of different DNA lesions generated by CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It has been proposed by Kitagawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] that ATM phosphorylation may be triggered by "structural" changes in chromatin as a result of formation of DSBs or other types of DNA damage that leads to altered topological stress on the DNA double helix in the proximity of the damage. In support of this mechanism are the observations that chromatin condensation during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] or premature chromosomes condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] is accompanied by ATM activation. The altered topological stress on DNA in mitosis is reflected by DNA's increased propensity to undergo denaturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] and its sensitivity to single-strand specific endonucleases such as S1 or mung bean nuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. The observed CS-induced H2AX phosphorylation may also be mediated by the mechanism associated with NER and linked with the excision of DNA adducts generated by CS. This mechanism would be consistent with the recent findings of Marti et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] who reported H2AX phosphorylation in G<sub>1 </sub>cells upon exposure to UV-C light, which was abrogated in the NER mutant cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ATM is a key element in the signal transduction pathways that detect DNA damage and orchestrate a multi-layered cellular response that includes recruiting DNA repair machinery, engaging cell cycle checkpoints, and increasing susceptibility to pro-apoptotic signals should DNA repair prove unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Its activation by CS provides evidence of extensive changes in the signal transmission pathways that are essential for cell survival and for protecting cells from neoplastic transformation. It would be expected, therefore, that genetic changes in terms of mutations in any of the individual components of ATM-associated pathways may constitute a significant risk factor in current or former smokers in terms of cancer development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and smoke treatment</title><p>A549 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC no. CCL-185, Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Ham's F12K medium with 2 mM L-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC). All incubations were at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in air. Cigarette smoke (CS) treatment was performed as follows: Dual-chambered slides (Nunc Lab-Tek II, VWR International, West Chester, PA) were seeded with 1 ml of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/ml cell suspension per chamber 48 hours before exposure and were typically at 70% confluency at the time of exposure to CS. The cell culture medium was replaced with 37&#x000b0;C Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) containing calcium and magnesium (BioSource, Rockville, MD) for the smoke exposure. Slide chamber covers were removed and the slides were placed in a smoke exposure chamber (20.6 cm &#x000d7; 6.7 cm &#x000d7; 6.3 cm -LxWxH). CS was generated under Federal Trade Commission (FTC)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] smoking conditions (35 &#x000b1; 0.3 cc puff, one puff every 60 seconds, 2-second puff duration with none of the ventilation holes blocked) using a KC 5 Port Smoker (KC Automation, Richmond, VA), from IM16 reference research cigarette (FTC values of 15.7 mg "tar" and 1.01 mg nicotine; Industry Monitor #16, Philip-Morris, Richmond VA,), 2R4F reference research cigarette (FTC values of 9.7 mg "tar" and 0.85 mg nicotine; University of Kentucky, Louisville, KY), or a leading commercially available U.S. cigarette brand with FTC values of 15 mg "tar" and 1.1 mg nicotine (Brand A). Cigarettes were smoked to within 3 mm of the filter tip. All cigarettes had been equilibrated at 23.9&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 1.1&#x000b0;C and 60% &#x000b1; 2% relative humidity for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 14 days. The smoke exposure chamber was designed to deliver smoke uniformly diluted with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in air and passed through the cell exposure chamber at a constant flow rate of 500 cc/min. Briefly, each 35 cc puff was first drawn into a 250 cc round chamber containing 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in air and mixed via a stir bar. The standard smoke dilution used in most of our experiments was 35 cc delivered over 1 min in a 500 cc volume, and the intensity of exposure was varied by varying the length of time the cells spent in the exposure chamber. The time and distance that the smoke traveled from the end of the cigarette to the exposure chamber was minimized by using the shortest lengths of tubing possible between the parts of the apparatus.</p><p>Mock-exposed cells were treated under identical conditions as the exposed cells except for the absence of a cigarette in the smoking port. Following treatment or mock treatment, the D-PBS covering the cells was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml per chamber of fresh culture medium at 37&#x000b0;C. The cells were placed in the 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator and incubated for 1 hour. For immunocytochemical measurements the medium was aspirated and the cells fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde by gently rocking the slides at room temperature for 15 minutes.

Cells were scrapped into an eppendorf tube, vigorously pipetted, and left on ice for 25 minutes to allow complete lysis. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 &#x000d7; g for 25 minutes and the supernatant transferred to clean eppendorf tubes. All manipulations were done at 4&#x000b0;C.
