An important adjunct to this technology has been the development of a method for pharmacologic control of Cre-mediated recombination by fusing Cre with a mutant estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain that recognizes 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) rather than estrogen &#x0005b;CreER(T); referred to hereafter as CreER; 2,3&#x0005d;. The CreER protein is sequestered in the cytosol until 4HT exposure releases it for nuclear migration.</p><p>For typical applications of the CreER technology - for example, experiments involving timed inactivation of conditional alleles - highly efficient recombination is considered desirable. By contrast, relatively inefficient recombination is essential for experiments in which the goal is to monitor the behavior, morphology, or function of individual genetically modified cells in an environment populated by unmodified neighbors. In extreme cases - for example, experiments using genetically encoded reporters to study the morphologies of very large CNS neurons - the efficiency of recombination must be lowered to fewer than 20 cells per mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Rotolo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, we observed that the <italic>Z/AP</italic> line, which expresses human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) upon excision of a loxP-flanked beta-geo/transcriptional stop cassette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Lobe1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, recombines with an efficiency &#x0223c;1,000 lower than similarly designed conditional AP knock-in alleles of the <italic>Brn3a</italic> and <italic>Brn3b</italic> genes (<italic>Brn3a<sup>CKOAP</sup></italic> and <italic>Brn3b<sup>CKOAP</sup></italic>), when each target gene is tested with a ubiquitously expressed <italic>CreER</italic> knock-in at the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (<italic>R26CreER</italic>; 7,9,10). In the absence of 4HT, <italic>R26CreER;Z/AP</italic> mice typically exhibit no AP&#x0002b; cells per retina, whereas <italic>R26CreER;Brn3a<sup>CKOAP/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>R26CreER;Brn3b<sup>CKOAP/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice exhibit several hundred AP&#x0002b; RGCs per retina.

The <italic>R26rtTACreER</italic> line uses the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) and doxycycline to control the expression of CreER, with the result that 4HT-induced Cre recombinase activity can be set at a level that is substantially lower than that typically obtained with constitutively expressed CreER lines. Thus the <italic>R26rtTACreER</italic> line permits precisely timed sparse recombination of target loci with a high efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination. Because the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus is widely expressed, the <italic>R26rtTACreER</italic> line can be used to generate sparse genetic mosaics to test the behavior of individual mutant cells in a wide variety of tissues and/or in situations in which the conventional null allele is lethal. The <italic>R26IAP</italic> line complements the popular but inefficiently recombining <italic>Z/AP</italic> line by providing an AP reporter that exhibits high efficiency Cre-mediated recombination in virtually any cell. The <italic>R26IAP</italic> line should prove especially useful when paired with CreER loci that exhibit low levels of 4HT-induced Cre activity. We demonstrate the utility of the latter line by using it to: (a) assess the efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination following either direct uptake of Cre protein or infection by an adenovirus vector expressing Cre, (b) generate brain atlases of sparsely labeled cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurons, and (c) characterize the morphologies of type 1 dopaminergic retinal amacrine cells, which have axon-like arbors that are among the largest of any cells in the mammalian retina.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>R26rtTACreER</italic>: Dual Control of Cre Action by Doxycycline and 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4HT)</title><p>To construct a ubiquitously expressed <italic>CreER(T)</italic> allele (hereafter referred to as &#x02018;<italic>CreER</italic>&#x02019;; 2) with a large dynamic range of <italic>CreER</italic> expression, we generated the <italic>Rosa26</italic> knock-in allele <italic>R26rtTACreER</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007859-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

In most studies, cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurons have been visualized by immunostaining for the biosynthetic enzymes choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), respectively, a method the reveals the cell bodies and processes of all neurons of the particular neurotransmitter type. Due to the high density and wide coverage of immunoreactive processes, this approach generally reveals only minimal information about the morphologies of individual neurons. In the present study, we have developed a complementary method for visualizing systems of neurons defined by neurotransmitter type.

Based on our observations with the <italic>R26rtTACreER</italic> locus, we would predict that this two-stage pharmacologic strategy will also confer tighter control of Cre activity relative to the standard <italic>CreER</italic> cassette at other sites in the genome.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Factors Affecting the Efficiency of Cre-Mediated Recombination</title><p>The roughly one thousand-fold difference between <italic>Z/AP</italic> and <italic>R26IAP</italic> recombination frequencies emphasizes the large effect of chromosomal location and/or target gene sequence on the efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination. This effect is substantially larger than the variation typically observed among target loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Vooijs1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. A second variable that affects the efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination is developmental age. With multiple target loci for which the efficiency of Cre-medated recombination can be easily quantified with AP histochemistry - including <italic>Brn3a</italic>, <italic>Brn3b</italic>, <italic>Z/AP</italic>, and <italic>Fz5</italic> - we have consistently observed a decline in efficiency with increasing postnatal age when tested with a variety of <italic>CreER</italic> lines, including <italic>R26CreER</italic>, <italic>NFL-IRES-CreER</italic>, and <italic>ChAT-IRES-CreER</italic> (our unpublished observations). As the expression of the <italic>Rosa26</italic>, <italic>NFL</italic>, and <italic>ChAT</italic> genes persists in adulthood, the observed decline in recombination efficiency with age is unlikely to arise from the loss of CreER expression. With the <italic>R26rtTACreER</italic> system we observe an age dependent silencing that can be inhibited by initiating doxycycline exposure &#x02013; and presumably rtTA activated transcription &#x02013; in early embryonic development.</p><p>These age-dependent phenomena likely represent progressive epigenetic changes in gene structure. A recent comparison of recombination efficiencies among the <italic>Z/AP</italic>, <italic>Z/EG</italic>, and <italic>R26R-EYFP</italic> loci in hematopoietic cells found a similar decline in recombination efficiency with age, as well as a strong correlation between lower recombination efficiency in adulthood and increased cytosine methylation, suggesting that age-dependent changes in chromatin structure can render loxP targets less accessible to Cre recombinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Long1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with our experience with the <italic>R26rtTACreER</italic> locus, studies of rtTA activation of target genes reveals a progressive silencing in neurons that can be overcome either by maintaining a basal level of target gene expression throughout development or by providing very high levels of rtTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Zhu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In studies in which highly efficient Cre-mediated recombination is desirable, the use of a constitutively active Cre-recombinase - even in combination with an inefficient loxP target such as <italic>Z/AP</italic> - usually suffices to produce complete or nearly complete recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Lobe1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. When temporal control of recombination is also required and the CreER system is used, obtaining highly efficient recombination is more difficult and can require near-toxic doses of 4HT administered over multiple days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>By contrast, for sparse cell labeling experiments, the challenge is reversed: the problem is now to reduce the efficiency of 4HT-dependent Cre-mediated recombination and eliminate any background of 4HT-independent recombination. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007859-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>, when using <italic>CreER</italic> alleles with relatively high levels of expression (e.g. <italic>R26CreER</italic>) in combination with relatively efficient loxP targets (e.g. <italic>R26IAP</italic>), background recombination is substantial even in the absence of 4HT. Using a less efficient loxP target, such as <italic>Z/AP</italic>, reduces the recombination level so that there are few or no labeled cells in the absence of 4HT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Badea3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in our experience, the <italic>Z/AP</italic> locus is unusual in this respect, and most loxP target loci more closely resemble <italic>R26IAP</italic> in recombination efficiency. Long and Rossi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Long1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> have suggested that the unusually inefficient recombination efficiencies of the <italic>Z/AP</italic> and <italic>Z/EG</italic> loci reflect the high CpG content of the <italic>E. coli lacZ</italic> coding region, which is present as part of the beta-geo coding region in both loci and may promote somatic cytosine methylation and epigenetic silencing.</p><p>A second strategy for reducing recombination efficiency focuses on reducing CreER expression, either by using an <italic>IRES-CreER</italic> knock-in allele, which likely decreases translation inefficiency, or, as in the R26rtTACreER locus, by overlaying a second level of transcriptional regulation. Both of these approaches for reducing CreER can eliminate background recombination in the absence of 4HT. Finally, combining both an inefficient loxP target (<italic>Z/AP</italic>) and low CreER expression reduces recombination to extremely low levels, such that fewer than one hundred neurons can be reproducibly labeled per brain depending on the <italic>IRES-CreER</italic> knock-in and the time and dose of 4HT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Rotolo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Sparse Labeling of Defined Neuronal Types as a Tool to Survey Changes in CNS Structure</title><p>A method for visualizing the morphologies of a large and representative sampling of neurons of a genetically defined type has the potential to fill a hitherto vacant niche in neuro-anatomic analyses of brain structure. Historically, the analysis of neuronal morphology has been performed either by sparse labeling methods that are not cell type specific (e.g. the Golgi stain) or by filling individual neurons with a tracer using a whole cell patch electrode, a method that is extremely laborious and not easily adaptable as a survey tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-MacNeil1">&#x0005b;e.g. ref. 48&#x0005d;</xref>. These classic methods also suffer from the problem of incomplete filling of large and/or complex neuronal processes. At the other end of the spectrum with respect to the number of labeled cells, immunostaining for markers such as ChAT or TH reveals all of the cells of a given type, but the high density of labeled cells and their interdigitating processes generally preclude an assessment of individual morphologies. Moreover, the immunostaining approach is limited to those antigens that are relatively abundant, cytosolic, and cell-type specific. Thus, many molecular markers that distinguish neuronal types, such as transcription factors, or various low abundance or transiently expressed proteins cannot be used directly to reveal the morphologies of the cells in which they are &#x0005b;or were&#x0005d; expressed. While this last challenge is being partially addressed by the creation of BAC transgenic lines that express GFP or Cre in defined subsets of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Gong1">&#x0005b;e.g. refs 49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Gong2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, the challenge of visualizing individual neuronal morphologies can only be met by a method that generates a relatively sparse collection of labeled neurons.</p><p>The strategy of generating a sparsely labeled sampling of a single neuronal type &#x02013; what we refer to here as an atlas of morphologies - is illustrated here for cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurons. The method takes advantage of the flexibility afforded by 4HT dosing to noninvasively generate a collection of several dozen to several hundred labeled neurons throughout the entire CNS. Current evidence suggests that the 1&#x02013;2 month delay between Cre-mediated recombination and histologic analysis provides sufficient time for AP to uniformly populate the plasma membrane of all dendritic and axonal processes even among the largest neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Rotolo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The cell morphologies determined here indicate that the typical type 1 DA cell in the mouse retina has axon-like processes that extend both radially and circumferentially, forming a sparse arbor that generally encompasses a substantial fraction of the retinal area and has a total length of &#x0223c;6.5 cm in a retina with a flat mounted diameter of &#x0223c;5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007859-g007">Figure 7</xref>; values corrected for tissue shrinkage in BBA).

On the assumption that signals received by the dendrites of type 1 DA cells are transmitted along the full length of their axon-like arbors, then it would appear that activation of even a small number of these cells would produce a signal with a relatively uniformly spatial output across the retina, a property consistent with the known neuromodulatory functions of retinal dopamine.</p><p>In relation to the cell biological mechanisms that control the development of neuronal morphology, the large and irregularly shaped axonal arbors of the type 1 DA cells would appear to rule out any constraints on axonal trajectories based on homotypic signaling, as observed for axonal and dendritic arbors in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Matthews1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Millard1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and as postulated for a variety of cell types in the mammalian retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007859-Poch1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.
