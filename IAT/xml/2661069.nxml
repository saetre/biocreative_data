Growth cone chemotropic responses to many guidance cues require local axonal translation and induce global translation activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, axons are estimated to contain approximately 100&#x02013;200 mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and guidance cues do not induce the translation of all of them. Indeed, guidance cues that have different effects on growth cones induce translation of different proteins, such as &#x003b2;-actin or CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) for some attractive cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] versus RhoA or cofilin for some repulsive cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. RNA-binding proteins regulating axonal mRNAs are starting to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] but, overall, the mechanisms underlying mRNA-specific regulation of local axonal translation remain unclear.</p><p>Control of poly(A) tail length is an attractive candidate mechanism for mRNA-specific regulation of axonal translation. With a few exceptions (for example, core histones), the efficiency of translation of an mRNA depends on the length of its poly(A) tail. Poly(A) binding protein (PABP), together with the cap binding factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), helps recruit eIF4G, which indirectly binds the 40S ribosomal subunit to the 5' end of the mRNA, thereby stimulating initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Specific sequence elements in some mRNAs recruit RNA-binding proteins that control poly(A) tail length, allowing mRNA-specific translational regulation by cytoplasmic polyadenylation.</p><p>The most well-understood mechanism for controlling cytoplasmic polyadenylation is regulation of mRNAs containing the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE; consensus UUUUUAU) by CPE-binding protein (CPEB)1. According to current models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], CPEB1 binds to CPE-containing mRNA and associates with a large complex of proteins, including the scaffolding protein Symplekin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. CPEB1 also binds to a poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) and the atypical poly(A) polymerase Gld2 (Germ-line development factor 2), which are responsible for deadenylating and polyadenylating CPEB1 target mRNAs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. PARN is the more active enzyme, so when both PARN and Gld2 are present, the poly(A) tail remains short and the mRNA is silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Phosphorylation of CPEB1 by the kinase Eg2/Aurora A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] induces the dissociation of PARN from the CPEB1-containing complex, allowing Gld2 to elongate the poly(A) tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], leading to polyadenylation-induced translational activation. Other RNA-binding proteins, such as Musashi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Nanos and Pumilio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], have also been implicated in regulating cytoplasmic polyadenylation, but their mechanisms of action remain unknown.</p><p>Although CPEB1 was first discovered in the maturation of <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], it has since been implicated in diverse functions ranging from cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] to cell senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, CPEB1 regulates local translation in dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a system that, like axonal translation, allows distal outposts of the neuron to respond quasi-autonomously to local stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. CPEB1 regulates dendritic localization, polyadenylation, and translation of CPE-containing mRNAs such as CaMKII&#x003b1; (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II &#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling induces both phosphorylation of CPEB1 via Aurora A kinase and polyadenylation of CaMKII mRNA at synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and induces translation of CPE-containing mRNAs in a polyadenylation-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. CPEB1 knockout mice have subtle defects in learning and memory, showing reduced fear extinction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and in certain forms of long-term potentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Overexpression of dominant-negative CPEB1 can cause defects in cerebellar long-term depression and motor learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or dendritic arborization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>The function of cytoplasmic polyadenylation in diverse systems from <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation to synaptic plasticity suggested that this might be a conserved mechanism for translational regulation in neurons and, therefore, a good candidate for regulating translation in axonal growth cones. Therefore, we asked whether cytoplasmic polyadenylation and CPEB1 might play a role in regulating translation for growth cone chemotropic responses. We found that translation-dependent, but not translation-independent, growth cone chemotropic responses require cytoplasmic polyadenylation. CPEB1 protein, however, is not detected in the retina and CPEB1 loss-of-function does not cause retinal axon guidance defects. UV cross-linking experiments show that other CPE-binding proteins are present in the retina and, indeed, dominant-negative inhibition of CPE-binding causes defects in axon outgrowth. Together, these results suggest that both cytoplasmic polyadenylation and CPE-mediated translational regulation are important for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth and guidance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of polyadenylation blocks Semaphorin3A-induced growth cone collapse</title><p>Bath application of Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) causes <italic>Xenopus </italic>RGC growth cones to collapse, that is, to lose their filopodia and lamellipodia and assume a thin, non-motile form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse occurs maximally at 10 minutes and requires local protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To address whether Sema3A-induced collapse requires cytoplasmic polyadenylation, we used the polyadenylation inhibitor 3'deoxyadenosine (cordycepin). When converted to cordycepin 5'triphosphate (3'dATP), it inhibits polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] by acting as a chain terminator due to the lack of a 3' hydroxyl group. Cordycepin, which does not affect protein kinase activity, inhibits cytoplasmic polyadenylation and meiotic maturation in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and CPE-mediated translational activation in hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We incubated cultures with 200 &#x003bc;M cordycepin for 30 minutes to allow the cordycepin to enter the growth cone and be converted to cordycepin triphosphate to be added to poly(A) tails as a chain terminator, and then treated the cultures with Sema3A for 10 minutes.</p><p>We found that cordycepin, but not adenosine, completely abolished Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). In contrast, cordycepin had no effect on growth cone collapse in response to lysophosphatidic acid, another repulsive cue that does not require protein synthesis for its effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This result indicates that cordycepin does not have non-specific toxic effects on growth cone responsiveness or collapsing capability.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is required for growth cone collapse</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Typical examples of collapsed and non-collapsed growth cones. <bold>(B) </bold>Cordycepin (200 &#x003bc;M; 3'deoxyadenosine; Cordy), but not adenosine (Adeno), blocks Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. <bold>(C) </bold>Cordycepin does not affect lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced growth cone collapse. <bold>(D, E) </bold>Similar results are obtained as in (B, C) if axons are severed from their cell bodies. <bold>(F, G) </bold>Anti-puromycin western blots on stage 35/36 retinal cultures incubated for 15 minutes with 2 &#x003bc;M puromycin and 50 &#x003bc;M LnLL (F) or 0.5 &#x003bc;M puromycin (G), &#x000b1; 2 &#x003bc;g/ml Sema3A-Fc, &#x000b1; 40 &#x003bc;M anisomycin (aniso), &#x000b1; 200 &#x003bc;M cordycepin or adenosine.

Again, cordycepin blocked Sema3A-induced collapse but not lysophosphatidic acid-induced collapse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>). This result implies that cytoplasmic, not nuclear, polyadenylation is required for collapse.</p><p>We used two methods to exclude the possibility that cordycepin abolishes translation of all mRNAs. First, we labeled newly synthesized proteins in Sema3A-stimulated and control retinal cultures with puromycin, a chain-terminating tRNA analogue that tags the carboxyl terminus of nascent proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. At the concentrations used in this study (0.5&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;M), puromycin can label all nascent proteins, both full-length and incomplete, which produces an indistinct 'smear' of puromycin labeling when labeled proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by anti-puromycin western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Puromycin labeling is abolished by the peptidyl transferase inhibitor anisomycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Note that the distinct bands (as opposed to the 'smear') in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, G</xref> are from non-specific binding by the anti-puromycin antibody, because the same bands also appear on samples incubated with the peptidyl transferase inhibitor anisomycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>) and on samples not incubated with puromycin (data not shown). Sema3A stimulation causes an increase in puromycin incorporation; this increase is slightly reduced, but not abolished, by cordycepin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, G</xref>). Because puromycin labels the mixture of full-length and incomplete proteins, this slight reduction in puromycin incorporation could represent either a reduction in overall protein synthesis or the blockade of synthesis of specific proteins.</p><p>Second, we tested the effect of cordycepin on basal translation rates in A6 cells, a <italic>Xenopus </italic>kidney cell line. We incubated A6 cells with <sup>3</sup>H-leucine for 5 minutes and measured the incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-leucine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material by scintillation counting. Cordycepin pre-treatment had no effect on incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-leucine, while the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide almost completely abolished it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Together with the puromycin experiment, these results suggest that cordycepin is not a general translation inhibitor under these conditions and, thus, most likely exerts its effects through blocking polyadenylation.</p></sec><sec><title>CPEB1 mRNA is expressed at low levels in the embryonic retina</title><p>Given that cytoplasmic polyadenylation is required for growth cone collapse, we considered the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic polyadenylation could be regulated in growth cones. CPEB1 was a good candidate for playing a central role in this process for several reasons. First, CPEB1 regulates translation via cytoplasmic polyadenylation in several systems, from <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes to both mammalian and invertebrate neurons. Second, CPEB1 is by far the most well-characterized regulator of cytoplasmic polyadenylation and has been especially well-studied in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Finally, according to large-scale <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization studies, the mouse and zebrafish homologs of CPEB1 (known as <italic>zorba </italic>in zebrafish) are expressed in the embryonic retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Given the conserved role of CPEB1 in regulating translation via cytoplasmic polyadenylation in systems ranging from <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes to mammalian and invertebrate neurons, we asked whether CPEB1 is expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>RGCs. We found by RT-PCR and wholemount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization that CPEB1 mRNA is expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>stage 35/36 and stage 41 eyes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). CPEB1 is also expressed in the nasal placodes and in a segmented pattern in the dorsal spinal cord and weakly in the brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>; data not shown). The first pioneer RGC axons grow through the optic tract at stage 35/36, arriving in the tectum at stage 37/38 and arborizing at stage 39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], but because RGCs are born from stage 25 through stage 33/34&#x02013;35/36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], many later-born RGC axons are still navigating through the optic tract at stage 41. Thus, CPEB1 is expressed at the right time and place to play a role in axon guidance. It should be noted, however, that the CPEB1 signal detected by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in the eye and brain is weak when compared to the robust signal in other areas such as the nasal placodes and spinal cord (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>). To address whether CPEB1 is present in RGCs, <italic>in situ </italic>stained wholemount embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>) were sectioned but the <italic>in situ </italic>signal was too faint to be clearly seen in the thin tissue, although the RGC layer did not exhibit an obvious lack of signal relative to the other layers (data not shown). Therefore, to confirm that CPEB1 is expressed specifically in RGCs, we used laser capture microdissection to extract RNA specifically from the RGC layer of stage 41 eyes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), using this stage because the retina is not fully laminated at stage 35/36. This technique excludes other retinal layers, although we cannot completely exclude the presence of mRNAs from non-RGC neuroepithelial or glial cells whose endfeet reside in the RGC layer. RT-PCR showed that CPEB1 mRNA is present in stage 41 RGCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>CPEB1 mRNA is expressed in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryonic retina</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>RT-PCR shows that CPEB1 is expressed in stage 35/36 and stage 41 eyes and that the level of expression is higher at stage 41. <bold>(B, C) </bold>Wholemount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization on stage 35/36 (B) and stage 41 (C) embryos shows that CPEB1 is weakly expressed in the eyes, as well as the nasal placode and brain, and in a segmented pattern in the dorsal spinal cord.

A carboxyfluorescein-tagged antisense morpholino (MO) directed against the ATG start site of CPEB1 mRNA successfully blocked translation of CPEB1-RBM-GFP mRNA (CPEB1-RNA binding mutant -green fluorescent protein; see below) when 20 ng MO and 2 ng mRNA per embryo were co-injected into blastomeres at the two-cell stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

Because the short length of the CPE sequence makes it impractical to block CPE-binding using CPE antisense oligonucleotides, we competitively interfered with the function of CPE-binding proteins using CPEB1 mutants. One mutant, CPEB1-AA, has two serine residues (S174 and S180) mutated to alanines, so that it cannot undergo the phosphorylation critical for activating the translation of its target mRNAs in other systems like <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. CPEB1-AA would compete with the endogenous CPE-binding proteins for CPE motifs, and mRNAs with CPEs would be mis-regulated by being bound by CPEB1 rather than their natural CPE-binding proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>); thus, CPEB1-AA acts as a dominant negative in inhibiting CPE-mediated mRNA regulation.

To test whether AA-transfected RGCs form axons that are too short to exit the explant, we performed dissociated retinal cell culture using eyes with AA or CPEB1-RBM-GFP (hereafter RBM).

However, in cryosections, such RFP- and GFP-positive axons never extended into the optic tract and only rarely reached the optic chiasm in AA-transfected embryos, whereas they almost always reached the optic tectum in RBM-transfected embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H&#x02013;L</xref>). In wholemount preparations, RBM-transfected, but not AA-transfected, embryos had bright RFP-positive axons in the contralateral brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6M, N</xref>). Extremely faint RFP-positive axons could be detected in AA-transfected embryos using a high-sensitivity camera (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2B</xref>), but these never contained CPEB1-GFP and were much dimmer than the RFP-positive axons in the contralateral brain of RBM-transfected embryos (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>).

Because electroporation introduces random amounts of plasmid into transfected cells, this contrast suggests that of the population of AA-transfected RGCs, only those receiving extremely small amounts of plasmid are able to extend axons into the brain, as they do not express enough CPEB1-AA to have any effect but express just enough GAP-RFP to be visible. Similar defects in axon outgrowth of strongly expressing AA/RFP-transfected neurons were seen after electroporation of the brain by injection into the ventricle (data not shown).

Of cells in the RGC layer, approximately 50% of AA-transfected cells expressed Isl-1, compared to 80% of RBM-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). This suggests that CPEB1-AA can affect RGC differentiation, but only for some cells, perhaps depending on the stage in the cell's lifetime when CPEB1 overexpression began. Electroporated constructs are visibly expressed around 6 hours after electroporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]; as these embryos were electroporated at stage 28, transgene expression should begin at stage 31.

Variability could also stem from the amount of CPEB1 overexpression, but no obvious correlation between GFP expression and Isl-1 expression level was observed. In any case, the finding that 50% of AA-transfected RGCs still express Isl-1 indicates that at least some RGCs differentiate and should be able to send out axons, but their axons rarely reach the optic chiasm and never enter the optic tract, suggesting that at least some of CPEB1-AA's effects are specific to axon outgrowth. Together, these results indicate that CPE-mediated mRNA regulation is required for retinal axon outgrowth.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has shown that cytoplasmic polyadenylation is required for growth cone collapse in response to Sema3A, suggesting that cytoplasmic polyadenylation may regulate guidance-cue-induced local translation. The mRNA of a well-known regulator of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, CPEB1, is present at low levels in RGCs, but CPEB1 protein is not detected in the retina, and knockdown of CPEB1 function does not obviously affect retinal axon guidance. However, UV cross-linking revealed the presence of other CPE-binding proteins in the retina, and dominant-negative inhibition of CPE-binding in RGCs causes axon outgrowth defects. These results indicate that cytoplasmic polyadenylation and CPE-mediated regulation of mRNAs are important for RGC axon development.</p><p>Cordycepin is a specific inhibitor for mRNA polyadenylation. Although it inhibits RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse is known to be transcription-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cordycepin can also inhibit deadenylation; an unidentified 3'-5' deadenylase in HeLa cell extracts cannot act on mRNAs capped at the 3' end by a cordycepin residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. However, this is not an entirely off-target effect, as it still addresses cytoplasmic control of poly(A) tail length, and cordycepin could only affect this deadenylase if it is added to the poly(A) tail by polyadenylation. The adenosine control argues against action by cordycepin on adenosine receptors and rules out the possible inhibition of adenylate cyclase by cordycepin, because adenosine and cordycepin inhibit adenylate cyclase activity equally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Finally, our finding that cordycepin slightly reduces but does not abolish the Sema3A-induced increase in translation suggests that cordycepin leaves Sema3A signal transduction pathways relatively intact. Consistent with this, cordycepin does not inhibit <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation induced by injection of c-Mos, the synthesis of which occurs early in maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], implying that cordycepin does not affect kinases downstream of c-Mos in oocyte maturation, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p90Rsk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>We have attempted to detect Sema3A-induced polyadenylation of candidate axonal mRNAs, such as RhoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which contains a CPE in the 3'UTR in <italic>Xenopus </italic>and is polyadenylated in maturing <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes (data not shown), but have been hampered by the extremely low amounts of RNA obtainable from isolated <italic>Xenopus </italic>retinal axons, which are not adequate to obtain reliable results with existing PCR-based poly(A) tail assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].

Nevertheless, our cordycepin results imply that axonal mRNAs are polyadenylated in response to Sema3A; future studies using more sensitive, unbiased assays may identify these mRNAs.</p><p>The contrast between clear, though weak, detection of CPEB1 mRNA in RGCs and the inability to detect CPEB1 protein in the retina suggests that CPEB1 protein might be present at very low levels. Indeed, in one study, the CPEB1 remaining in oocytes after maturation-associated degradation was undetectable under normal loading and exposure conditions, even though CPEB1 levels in mature oocytes have been variously reported as 25% or 3&#x02013;5% of CPEB1 levels in immature oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Given that CPEB1 was detected in oocytes in this study, we infer from the amount of CPEB1 in oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and the amounts of protein loaded in our western blots (see Materials and methods) that the inability to detect CPEB1 in retinas suggests that the relative abundance of CPEB1 protein is about 500 times lower in the retina than in oocytes. This is not implausible, as CPEB1 mRNA levels are also much higher in oocytes than in the embryonic retina (data not shown), and in cDNA libraries collected from <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>, <italic>CPEB1 </italic>is an abundant clone in eggs (0.045% of all clones, compared to 0.023% for ATP synthase, &#x003b3;-subunit) whereas it is not detected in cDNA libraries between gastrulation and stage 45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the inability to detect CPEB1 protein leaves open the possibility that RGCs contain a small amount of CPEB1 protein. However, radiolabeled CPE-containing RNA was bound by proteins that could not be detected by anti-CPEB1 western blot or immunoprecipitation, suggesting that even if a small amount of CPEB1 is present, its function in regulating CPE-containing mRNAs may be taken over by other proteins whose identities are unknown. The other members of the CPEB family, CPEB2&#x02013;4, are expressed in embryonic eyes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), and although they are not fully cloned in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, human CPEB2 has a predicted molecular weight of 62 kDa, suggesting that the approximately 60 kDa CPE-binding band could be CPEB2. CPEB2&#x02013;4 have been reported not to bind to one copy of CPE sequence (UUUUAAU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], but this may not be true for all mRNAs if the CPE is located in a loop structure.

In addition, KSRP (K-homology splicing regulatory protein; known as VgRBP71 in <italic>Xenopus </italic>and FUBP2, MARTA1, or ZBP2 in other species) binds CPE sequences in mice (Y-SH and JDR, unpublished observations) and regulates the localization of &#x003b2;-actin mRNA in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Although VgRBP71 is 71 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], its rat homolog MARTA1 (molecular weight 74 kDa) was originally identified as a 90 kDa protein binding to the 3'UTR of microtubule-associated protein 2 mRNA in UV cross-linking assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], suggesting that the approximately 95 kDa CPE-binding band in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> could be VgRBP71. Future studies may identify the CPE-binding proteins in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>retina.</p><p>The effect of CPEB1-AA suggests that these non-CPEB1 CPE-binding proteins, or at least regulation of CPE-containing mRNAs, are important for RGC axon development. This regulation may occur via mRNA localization, translational repression, translational activation, or all three, as occurs with CPEB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. CPEB1-AA would displace native CPE-binding proteins, thereby causing mis-regulation of CPE-containing mRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>). Indeed, expression of dominant-negative CPEB1 in Purkinje cells causes defects in cerebellar long-term depression and motor learning, while elimination of endogenous CPEB1 does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], suggesting that non-CPEB1 CPE-binding proteins are also involved in synaptic plasticity.</p><p>Our finding that CPE-mediated mRNA regulation is important for axon outgrowth is consistent with other studies demonstrating roles for post-transcriptional regulation in axon formation and extension. For example, regulation of neurofilament-M mRNA by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K is required for axon outgrowth in <italic>Xenopus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], although hnRNP K is unlikely to be a CPE-binding protein, as it binds to poly(C) sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. In addition, translational regulation of the neuronal polarity regulator SAD kinase (also known as BR serine/threonine kinase 2 or brain-selective kinase 2) by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway controls axon formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. It is likely that coordinated regulation of many mRNAs by multiple RNA-binding proteins is required for the complex program of axon extension.</p><p>Given that axon extension and growth cone collapse are in some ways opposite phenomena, the effect of dominant-negative CPEB1 on axon extension seems opposed to the requirement for cytoplasmic polyadenylation in growth cone collapse. These can be reconciled by noting that the CPE-binding proteins displaced by CPEB1-AA may not necessarily regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation, or may regulate the polyadenylation of only a subset of mRNAs that are polyadenylated upon Sema3A stimulation. It would be interesting to directly test the connection between cytoplasmic polyadenylation and the retinal CPE-binding proteins by asking whether cordycepin inhibits axon outgrowth as CPEB1-AA does, or if CPEB1-AA inhibits growth cone collapse as cordycepin does. However, the former experiment would be difficult to interpret given the inhibition of transcription by cordycepin over the timescales required to study neurite outgrowth, while the latter experiment is precluded by the lack of CPEB1-AA-positive axons growing out of transfected retinal explants.</p><p>Even if CPE-binding proteins do indeed regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation, the apparent contradiction described above can be resolved by noting that axon extension and Sema3A-induced collapse occur at different time points of RGC axon development; the effect of CPEB1-AA on axon outgrowth is observed early and most likely includes an effect on neurite initiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), whereas Sema3A is more effective at collapsing old growth cones (cultured after stage 35/36) than young growth cones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, CPE-mediated mRNA regulation and cytoplasmic polyadenylation may have different roles at different developmental stages. Alternatively, just as protein synthesis is required for both attractive and repulsive responses, CPE-mediated mRNA regulation and cytoplasmic polyadenylation may be involved in both attractive and repulsive responses; future work may examine this possibility.</p><p>The conclusion that non-CPEB1 CPE-binding proteins, which may or may not regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation, are involved in RGC axon outgrowth leaves open the question of how cytoplasmic polyadenylation is regulated. It is not necessarily surprising that different mechanisms would regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation in oocytes and embryos. For example, even though maternal mRNAs are silenced in immature oocytes from stage I to stage VI, PARN is not expressed until stage III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], suggesting that other mechanisms not involving PARN must deadenylate and silence maternal mRNAs in early immature oocytes. In addition, in early <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos, regulated translation of germ plasm mRNAs is correlated with their poly(A) tail length, but seems to be independent of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>CPEB homolog ORB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. Similarly, in <italic>Xenopus </italic>early embryogenesis, cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNAs such as activin receptor is mediated by U-rich sequences (U12&#x02013;27) similar to, but distinct from, the CPE bound by CPEB1 (U4-6A1-2U) during oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. These U-rich sequences are bound by ElrA (elav-like ribonucleoprotein A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>], suggesting that ElrA mediates cytoplasmic polyadenylation, although this has not been directly demonstrated. In addition, although ElrA is unlikely to be one of the CPE-binding proteins in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, as its molecular weight is 36 kDa and it does not bind the cyclin B1 3'UTR, it can bind to the CPE bound by CPEB1 (U4-6A1-2U) in some mRNAs such as cyclin E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. ElrA is expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>throughout development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>], making it a potential regulator of some CPE-containing mRNAs and cytoplasmic polyadenylation in the retina.</p><p>In addition to ElrA, a role in regulation of the poly(A) tail length of target mRNAs has been described for other proteins, Musashi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Pumilio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], as well as the micro-RNA let-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. Although Musashi (also known as nervous system-specific RNP protein, or Nrp-1) is not expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>differentiated RGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>], we have detected Pumilio and miRNAs in RGCs (F van Horck and M-L Baudet, unpublished observations). Pumilio and let-7 repress target mRNAs by stimulating deadenylation, as CPEB1 does in immature oocytes. If these or other factors repress and deadenylate mRNAs in unstimulated growth cones, Sema3A stimulation might cause them to release their target mRNAs, allowing them to be polyadenylated by default, which would explain why cordycepin prevents Sema3A-induced collapse. Future studies may determine whether these RNA-binding proteins, micro-RNAs, CPE-binding proteins, or other mechanisms regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation in RGC axons, aided by the identification and 3'UTR sequence analysis of mRNAs that are polyadenylated upon guidance cue stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show for the first time that cytoplasmic polyadenylation is required for growth cone chemotropic responses.
