VZV often persistently infects dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and is sometimes activated from a latent to lytic state, causing zoster in aged and immunosuppressed individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The double-stranded VZV genome contains approximately 125 kbp with at least 71 open reading flames (ORFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although understanding VZV virulence and attenuation mechanisms requires study of the VZV-encoded genes, little has been reported on VZV genes compared with those of herpes simplex virus (HSV).</p><p>The ORF58 of VZV lies at the 3'end of the Unique long (U<sub>L</sub>) region and its function is unknown. Although ORF57, its neighboring gene, is dispensable in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], there has been no report yet on ORF58. Therefore, to investigate the functional roles of this gene in VZV infection, we constructed an ORF58-deletion mutant of VZV, and analyzed its susceptibility in both MRC-5 cells and malignant melanoma cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We produced the deletion mutant of the ORF58 gene by using the BAC system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The deletion mutant of the ORF58 gene (pOka-BAC&#x00394;58) was constructed by recombination in <italic>E. coli </italic>harboring pOka-BAC DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and pGETrec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] with a fragment containing the kanamycin-resistance gene flanked by the 3'-UTR and 5'-UTR of the ORF58 gene. The pGETrec was kindly provided by Dr. Panayiotis A Ioannou. Thus, the ORF58 gene in the pOKa-BAC genome was replaced by the kanamycin-resistance gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Construction of recombinant virus rpOka&#x00394;58</bold>.

An enlarged section shows the analyzed portion of the genome, containing open reading frame (ORF) 56, 57, 58 and 59. ORFs are drawn as pointed rectangles.

The recombination was also confirmed by PCR using primer pairs that annealed to the internal region of the kanamycin-resistance gene and the external region of ORF58 (data not shown).

The cells were cultured for 7 days at 37&#x000b0;C followed by stained with 1% crystal violet/70% ethanol. Plaque sizes were calculated with ImageJ software (NIH, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HY and YM designated research; HY, KS, MM and KN performed research; HY, MT, KY and YM analyzed data; and HY and YM wrote the paper.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Ulrich Koszinowski (Max von Pettenkofer institute, Germany) for providing the plasmid, pHA-2, Dr. Yasushi Kawaguchi (University of Tokyo, Japan) for providing the AxCANCre, and Dr. Panayiotis A Ioannou (Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Royal Children's Hospital, Australia) for providing the pGETrec plasmid.
