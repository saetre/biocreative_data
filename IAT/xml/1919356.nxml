One type of RNA editing involves the modification of individual adenosine bases to inosine in RNA by ADAR enzymes (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Because inosine acts as guanosine during translation, A-to-I conversion in coding sequences leads to amino acid changes and often entails changes in protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A-to-I RNA editing is common in animals and is associated with various neurological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster </italic>and <italic>Mus musculus </italic>mutants lacking ADAR enzymes display predominantly distinct neurological phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to amino acid changes, the editing and subsequent destabilization of the RNA duplex present in the 5' or 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) could alter the stability, transport or translation of the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, RNA editing may influence alternative splicing decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Alternative splicing is a major contributor to transcriptomic and proteomic complexity, disease, and development. Alternative splicing may affect the protein sequence in two ways: (i) by deleting or inserting a sequence and creating long and short isoforms, or (ii) by substituting one segment of the amino acid sequence for another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. An indication for the first pathway is that truncated isoforms often act as dominant-negative regulators of the full-length isoform's activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, the second mode is capable of creating, from mutually exclusive alternative sequences, a multitude of functionally distinct protein isoforms and thus might have a crucial role in the evolution of complex organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As both RNA editing and alternative splicing can lead to the inclusion of alternative amino acid sequences into proteins, functionally distinct isoforms are likely to be generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, editing and alternative splicing provide a powerful posttranscriptional means for fine-tuning of gene expression at the cellular and organismal levels.</p><p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate the fast actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in both vertebrates and invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. An extraordinary feature of the insect nAChR genes is that they can potentially create many different mRNAs by RNA editing and alternative splicing. More than 30,000 alpha6 nAChR isoforms are theoretically possible through RNA editing and alternative splicing, without considering any linkage between these events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The alternatively spliced exons are organized into two clusters. The exon 3 and 8 clusters contain 2 and 3 alternative versions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Seven adenosines could be modified in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>alpha6, four of which are also edited in the alpha6 ortholog in the tobacco budworm <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic>. However, although these RNA A-to-I editing sites are conserved between <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and <italic>H. virescens</italic>, they are not shared with the equivalent nAChR subunit of <italic>Anopheles</italic>, which is considered to be an example of convergent evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is possible that different alpha6 isoforms may interact with distinct sets of receptor guidance cues. RNA editing and alternative splicing of the nAChR alpha6 pre-mRNA may therefore be central to the mechanisms specifying transmitter affinity, channel conductance and ion selectivity.</p><p>The recently sequenced genomes of 12 <italic>Drosophila </italic>species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the mosquito <italic>A. gambiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the silkworm <italic>B. mori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the honeybee <italic>A. mellifera </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and <italic>T. castaneum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] have renewed interest in molecular and functional diversity in the insect nAChR alpha6 gene. Recent analysis reveals bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) are at the base of the radiation of Holometabolous insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Here, we compare the RNA editing and alternative splicing of the nAChR alpha6 gene from these insects spanning ~300 million years of evolution. These sequence comparisons provide insight into the evolution of the nAChR alpha6 gene and indicate that many isoforms have arisen by RNA editing and alternative splicing events. These findings also suggest that expressing a diverse nAChR alpha6 repertoire is more important than the actual sequence of each isoform. In this article, we describe the A-to-I RNA editing and alternative splicing found in insect nAChR alpha6 genes, as well as their evolutionary conservation and divergence, and regulation. In addition, we provide an example of a strong correlation between RNA editing and alternative splicing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparison of the nAChR subunit alpha6 genes from different insect species</title><p>To obtain insight into the functional diversity, the regulation of expression, and the evolution of nAChR alpha6, we have compared the sequence of the nAChR alpha6 genes in <italic>Drosophila </italic>to other species. The organisms analyzed consisted of 13 Dipteran species, including 12 <italic>Drosophila </italic>species (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta</italic>, <italic>D. ananassae</italic>, <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, <italic>D. persimilis</italic>, <italic>D. willistoni</italic>, <italic>D. mojavensis</italic>, <italic>D. virilis </italic>and <italic>D. grimshawi</italic>) and one mosquito (<italic>A. gambiae</italic>), the Lepidopteran <italic>B. mori </italic>(silkworm), the Coleopteran <italic>T. castaneum </italic>(red flour beetle) and the Hymenopteran <italic>A. mellifera </italic>(honeybee). The sequences from these species allowed us to analyze the evolution of the nAChR alpha6 gene over at least 300 million years and across phylogenetic orders. The overall organization of the nAChR alpha6 genes of these insect species is quite similar, but there are a few subtle differences. The nAChR alpha6 genes possess two versions for exon 3 in most species, while no such tandem duplication of coding exon 3 can be found in the <italic>A. mellifera </italic>genome. Although nAChR alpha6 genes have three versions for exon 8 in most species, only two alternatives for the equivalent exon are observed in the <italic>A. gambiae </italic>and <italic>B. mori </italic>genomes.</p><p>We next analyzed the evolutionary relationship of the alternative exons from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>A. gambiae, B. mori, T. castaneum </italic>and <italic>A. mellifera </italic>nAChR alpha6 genes. For these analyses we used <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>as the representative <italic>Drosophila </italic>species. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that <italic>A. mellifera </italic>did not contain an ortholog to the second alternative exon 3 while <italic>B. mori </italic>and <italic>A. gambiae </italic>lacked an ortholog to the first alternative exon 8[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The orthologs to the second alternative exon 8 were very highly conserved, with all amino acid sequences identical (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), although they are not highly conserved at the nucleotide level. The hierarchy of amino acid conservation of the alternative exons 8 of nAChR subunit alpha6 genes was exon 8b &#x0003e; exon 8a &#x0003e; exon 8c. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein products of equivalent duplicated exons showed that members of a duplicated pair were more similar to each other than to the exons from other genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This evidence suggests that exon duplication predated at least the radiation of insect orders spanning ~300 million years of evolution.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis of duplicated exon nucleotide sequences.

We determined a similar hierarchy of nucleotide conservation of the alternative exons 8 of nAChR subunit alpha6 genes within the <italic>Drosophila </italic>species, namely exon 8b &#x0003e; exon 8a &#x0003e; exon 8c.</p></sec><sec><title>Conservation and divergence of alternative splicing</title><p>We were interested in understanding the alternative splicing of the nAChR alpha6 transcripts and in particular whether this is regulated. We first analyzed how the alternative exons 3 were regulated. The vast majority of tandemly duplicated exons (99.4%) are likely to be involved in mutually exclusive alternative splicing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) showed a very clear band in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and <italic>T. castaneum </italic>adult cDNA, as in <italic>A. mellifera </italic>with constitutive exon 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Direct sequencing of these amplification products confirmed that these duplicated exons were alternatively spliced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Sequence analysis of 30 cDNAs also showed that no duplicated exons were spliced together. These results indicated that the vast majority of exons were likely to be involved in mutually exclusive alternative splicing, which was consistent with EST and cDNA data analysis, although a duplicate of exon 3 was even found in cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Species-specific alternative splicing patterns.

Total silkworm RNA harvested from silkworms at various stages of development was used as a template for RT-PCR with primers surrounding the exon 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). At the embryo stage, only one band could be amplified, and direct sequencing indicated a mixed sequence signal of two nucleotides, confirming the existence of alternative splicing of exon 3. The existence of alternative splicing in the embryonic transcripts was further confirmed by independent sequencing of cloned cDNAs of RT-PCR products. This band, which resulted from type I and type II alternative splicing, decreased slightly during development, exhibiting a very low level in the pupal and adult stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, another slightly larger band appeared during development, displaying a very low level in the larvae but increasing rapidly during the stages from pupa to adult (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Sequencing of cloned cDNAs of this product indicated the existence of splice type III alternative splicing, which included both alternative exons, and retained the opening frame of the spliced RNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Editing of <italic>B. mori </italic>nAChR alpha6 splice forms (A) The structure and alternative splicing patterns of the alpha6 gene in the regions surrounding the alternative exons 3.

Consequently, the expression of splice type I and II appeared to be tightly regulated in a similar manner, exhibiting an abundant level in the embryo, and decreasing slightly during the pupal stage to the adult level. In contrast, the expression of splice type III showed a distinct mode during development, exhibiting a very low level in the embryo, and increasing rapidly during the pupal stage to the adult level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The expression analysis using RT-PCR was consistent with the results derived from RT-PCR clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Thus, the alternative splicing patterns of exon 3 in silkworm were different from the other insect species.</p><p>Next, to determine how the alternative exons 8 were regulated developmentally, we first performed RT-PCR on RNA isolated from silkworm embryos, larvae, pupae and adults by use of primers flanking exon 8. The identity of the PCR product was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. Sequence analysis of transcripts, derived from different staged RNA independent amplification experiments, indicated that only cDNAs containing exon 8b were included, but no cDNA containing exon 8c was included. This suggested that only exon 8b was spliced while exon 8c expression was very low in these developmental stages. We next tested whether the selection pattern of exon 8 alternative splicing observed in silkworm was conserved in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>T. castaneum </italic>and <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, where nAChR subunit alpha6 has three versions for exon 8.

Considering the identical trend between selection efficiency and conservation of alternative exons 8, it is proposed that expression of alternative exons 8 might be closely related with its conservation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

As a result, it was revealed that the nucleotide in genomic DNA was adenosine at these positions, confirming that post-transcriptional modifications occur in this case. We have identified a total of ten A-to-I RNA editing sites within silkworm alpha6 transcripts, seven of which are located in exon 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

The alternative splicing patterns of the duplicated exon 3 were conserved in the chosen insect species, except the silkworm. It remained to be determined whether the alternative splicing pattern of mutually exclusive exons was changed because the signal ensuring the splicing of pairs of alternative exons was disturbed in the silkworm. RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the cDNAs derived from adult transcripts showed that two A-to-G substitutions occurred in exon 4 of the silkworm nAChR subunit alpha6 gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). However, these two A-to-G substitutions were undetectable in embryonic transcripts. Interestingly, sequence analysis of 80 cDNA clones derived from embryonic, larvae, pupae and adult transcripts, respectively, revealed two A-to-G substitutions in exon 4 of the silkworm in splice type III, but not in splice types I and II. PCR amplification of silkworm genomic DNA and direct sequencing revealed that adenosine was the nucleotide in the genomic DNA at both positions, confirming that A-to-I editing occurred in this case. These results suggest that specific editing in exon 4 and splice type III of exon 3 might be closely related.</p><p>To determine whether coordinated RNA editing and alternative splicing were conserved in other insects, we subsequently analyzed the nAChR alpha6 genes from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>T. castaneum </italic>and <italic>A. mellifera</italic>. In contrast to the silkworm, sequence analysis indicated that no A-to-G substitutions took place in exon 4 in these species. These results suggest that RNA-editing sites in exon 4 are species-specific in <italic>B. mori</italic>, which correlates with the species-specific alternative splicing pattern of the duplicated exon 3. To discern whether alternative splicing also correlates with RNA editing in other distant exons in the silkworm, we analyzed the A-to-I RNA editing sites in exon 5 of the nAChR subunit alpha6 gene. However, no evidence indicated any relation between alternative splicing patterns of exon 3 and editing in distant exon 5, suggesting that the alternative splicing patterns of exon 3 was not regulated by RNA editing in distant exon 5.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Evolutionary implications</title><p>Our results indicate a high level of editing events in insect species spanning ~300 million years of evolution. Interestingly, RT-PCR analysis showed that RNA editing was absent in <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, indicating a divergence in molecules targeted by RNA editing within the Diptera order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, enzyme assays measuring conversion of adenosine to inosine in salivary gland homogenates of several mosquito species detected adenosine deaminase activity in <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus </italic>and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, but not in <italic>A. gambiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

This suggests that adenosine deaminase functions in the <italic>Anopheles </italic>lineage, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A comparative sequence analysis of these species showed that the exon 5 was highly conserved at both the nucleotide and amino acid level among these species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), but the flanking intronic sequences were highly divergent. The downstream intron 5 was extraordinarily short in length, 97 bp, in <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, while it was &#x0003e; 1 kb in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, &#x0003e; 4 kb in <italic>B. mori</italic>, &#x0003e; 2 kb <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, and &#x0003e; 30 kb in <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Likewise, the upstream intron 4 was also extraordinarily short, 94 bp, in <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, while it was much more than 1 kb in the other insect species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The absence of editing in <italic>Anopheles </italic>correlated with the lack of downstream intronic sequences, which were necessary to direct editing by forming duplex RNA substrates for ADARs within larger, energetically stable RNA secondary structures. Similarly, sequential decrease and loss of editing in <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, through weakening of the ECS-editing site interaction to form poorer duplex RNA substrates for ADARs, could titrate in the edited form of the protein to the least advantageous level, or even an undetectable level.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Phylogeny of RNA editing and duplicated exons of nAChR subunit alpha6 gene from <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>(Dme), <italic>A. gambiae </italic>(Aga), <italic>B. mori </italic>(Bmo), <italic>T. castaneum </italic>(Tca) and <italic>A. mellifera </italic>(Ame).

However, our phylogenetic analysis of RNA editing in orthologous nAChR alpha6 genes from different species revealed a divergent evolution from a common ancestor. Moreover, this implies that divergent evolution from a common ancestor would have been accompanied by editing loss or gain in paralogous genes. We suggest that the data presented here comprise a credible phylogeny of RNA editing for a gene, graphically illustrating descent with modification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). RNA editing in insect nAChR subunit alpha6 genes predates at least the radiation of the Coleopteranand Hymenopteran orders, beginning with sites 5 and 10. New editing sites were probably generated and ancestral editing sites were lost in subsequent evolution through global intronic variation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Our evidence suggests that <italic>Anopheles </italic>lost editing in the nAChR alpha6 gene during the evolution of the Diptera; such a loss might be consistent with the phylogenic evolution of the introns. The nAChR alpha6 genes possess tandem duplication of coding exons in their genomic sequences in insect species, which represents alternative spliced exons. Dating exon duplications through a combination of the available experimental data on alternative splicing in orthologous genes from different species and computational analysis indicated that the exon 3 and 8 duplications predated at least the radiation of insect orders spanning ~300 million years of evolution. Our results disproved the previous hypothesis that a duplication event gave rise to exon 8b and 8c before the divergence of an ancestor of <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Anopheles</italic>, whereas after the divergence a further duplication gave rise to an extra exon (exon 8a) in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, our evidence suggests the possibility that divergent evolution from a common ancestor was accompanied by exon loss and generation of paralogous genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In the nAChR alpha6 gene, our evidence suggests that recent loss of copies of duplicated exons has occurred (e.g. exon 8a in <italic>A. gambiae</italic>). Moreover, divergent evolution from a common ancestor would have been accompanied by change in the alternative splicing pattern of mutually exclusive exons in paralogous genes (e.g. exon 3 in <italic>B. mori</italic>)</p></sec><sec><title>RNA editing and SNP sites</title><p>The nAChR subunits alpha6 are subject to RNA editing in insect species. Interestingly, there were several examples where some A-to-I editing sites were a genomically encoded G in closely- related species. Although we do not know how general this interesting phenomenon is, this led us to consider the possibility that mRNA editing might act to maintain similarity at the protein and functional level despite sequence divergence at the DNA level. In plant mitochondria, mRNA editing might act to maintain similarity at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Some genetic restoration events in plants and animals are proposed to be the result of a template-directed process that makes use of an ancestral RNA-sequence cache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, the edited RNA-sequence might be taken as a template to synthesize DNA, thus causing changes at the DNA level. In addition, the most prevalent changes of substitutional RNA editing in the nucleus of higher eukaryotes are hydrolytic deaminations where a genomically encoded C or A is converted to U and I, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] Interesting, A/G and C/T(U) substitution were much more prevalent than other forms of SNP. Given these relations between RNA editing and SNP, it is pertinent to ask whether RNA editing might be an evolutionary predecessor to genomically fixed SNPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of mutually exclusive alternative splicing</title><p>RNA editing and alternative splicing play an important role in expanding protein diversity and are commonly employed to enlarge the proteome. Since both processes may require conserved exonic and intronic elements, RNA editing may influence alternative splicing decisions or vice versa. There are a few examples of an association between alternative splicing and editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As RNA editing usually occurs close to exon/intron boundaries, this is likely to be a general phenomenon and suggests an important and novel role for RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, the ADAR2 protein regulates its own synthesis by creating an alternative splice site that leads to an out-of-frame product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The auto-editing of ADAR2 intron 4 by the ADAR2 adenosine deaminase is tightly coupled to splicing, as the modification of the dinucleotide AA to AI creates a new 3' splice site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The editing site and the affected splice site are usually in close proximity to one another, and so RNA editing affected alternative splicing by creating or deleting splice sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Only one example indicates that the editing efficiency of a <italic>Drosophila </italic>gene correlates with a distant splice site selection where alternative splicing occurs downstream of editing. In contrast, no correlation is seen when editing occurs downstream of alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, the result remains to be determined without considering the fact that RNA editing and alternative splicing are not regulated by similar developmental patterns.</p><p>In this study, RNA editing could affect the alternative splicing pattern by another mechanism because no new splice sites were generated or deleted. The vast majority of tandemly duplicated exons (99.4%) are likely to be involved in mutually exclusive alternative splicing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], therefore, mechanisms must exist to ensure that the splicing of pairs of alternative exons is strictly mutually exclusive, involved in competing base-pairing interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the steric hindrance of snRNP binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and the dual spliceosome mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. If the signal involved in these mechanisms was disturbed, the alternative splicing pattern of mutually exclusive exons might be changed. Taken together, a model can be proposed to explain how editing and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is coordinated. RNA editing in exon 4 might disrupt a splicing enhancer signal within exon 4, which can prevent the exon 3 cluster from splicing together. The disrupted splice site is now more efficient at splicing out the shorter intron, leading to the longer product. It is not exactly clear how an enhancer within this exon would alter the choice of a distant acceptor site, but there are previous studies showing that longer introns tend to be flanked by stronger splice sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To test whether A-to-I editing disrupts exon splicing enhancer (ESE) elements, we analyzed edited and unedited exon sequences with an ESE-finder program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A-to-I editing in two sites was predicted by the ESE-finder to destroy the SF2/ASF (GGAACGA) and SRp40 (CGTCAAG) ESE motifs, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that ESE disruption is the underlying mechanism of A-to-I editing that results in the change of the alternative splicing pattern. Conversely, if RNA editing does not occur, for example, in the silkworm embryo and in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, mutually exclusive alternative splicing of the duplicated exons has arisen in the majority of transcripts. Alternatively, A-to-I editing might disrupt the other splice signals within exon 4 in the silkworm nAChR subunit alpha6, which controls mutually exclusive splicing of the duplicated exons. One protein has recently been identified that prevents all of the duplicated exon variants from being spliced together, which demonstrates that the duplicated exon variants are in fact capable of being spliced together but protein factors exist that repress this reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A-to-I editing possibly relieves the repression on the upstream alternative duplicated exons, and as a result, the duplicated exon variants might be spliced together.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have documented the existence, evolutionary conservation, and regulation of RNA editing and alternative splicing in nAChR alpha6 from five insects spanning ~300 million years of evolution&#x02013; <italic>D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, B. mori, T. castaneum </italic>and <italic>A. mellifera</italic>.

PCR amplification was carried out using cDNA from 10 ng of total RNA template in each reaction. The gene-specific primers for PCR were designed according to the nAChR alpha6 genomic sequence. Each splice product was amplified separately from bulk cDNA using a single spliceform-specific primer and a shared primer. Primer1, 2, 3, 4, 5 refer to BmDa-5-4, BmDa-5-8, BmDa-5-9, BmDa-5-10, and BmDa-3-1, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Amplification conditions were 35 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55-65&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s, followed by one cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Silkworm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) transcripts were amplified as an external control.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of alternative splicing forms</title><p>Total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II RT and the resulting single-stranded cDNA product was treated with DNase at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The gene specific primers for PCR were designed according to the nAChR alpha6 genomic sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). PCR amplification was carried out using cDNA from 10 ng of total RNA template in each reaction. The products of RT-PCR were purified and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA) and transformed with a JM109 competent cell. Recombinant clones were identified by restriction enzymes and PCR. Sequencing of selected clones was done using automatic DNA sequencer. cDNA sequences were determined by amplifying portions of the gene and directly sequencing the PCR product.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of RNA editing</title><p>Analysis of RNA editing was performed using total RNA as the template for RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed with the primer pairs mentioned above for nAChR alpha6 genes in different species. RT-PCR amplicons were either directly sequenced after gel purification or subcloned and individual cDNA-bearing plasmid clones subjected to sequencing. Primers for the nAChR subunit alpha6 exon 5 were used to amplify genomic DNA from the same tissues used for RNA isolation. The genomic PCR amplification product was subjected to direct sequencing to demonstrate that genomic products give a pure A signal at editing sites, ruling out a polymorphism. For subcloning, RT-PCR splice products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. Relative A-to-G abundance was determined by sequencing individual clones with plasmids containing appropriately sized inserts.</p></sec><sec><title>nAChR subunit alpha6 sequences</title><p>The GenBank accession numbers of the nAChR alpha6 subunit genes are as follows: alpha6 cDNAs of <italic>B. mori </italic>variants are EF127797, EF127798, EF127799; alpha6 cDNAs of <italic>T. castaneum </italic>variants are from EF127806 to EF127810; alpha6 cDNAs of <italic>A. mellifera </italic>variants are from EF127800 to EF127805.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>nAChR &#x02013; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</p><p>ADAR &#x02013; adenosine deaminase acting on RNA</p><p>UTRs &#x02013; untranslated regions</p><p>Ach &#x02013; acetylcholine</p><p>RT-PCR &#x02013; reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction</p><p>EST &#x02013; expressed sequence tag</p><p>SNP &#x02013; single nucleotide polymorphism</p><p>ECS &#x02013; editing site complementary sequence</p><p>ESE &#x02013; exon splicing enhancer</p><p>GAPDH &#x02013; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</p><p>CSE &#x02013; constitutive exons</p><p>AS &#x02013; alternative splicing</p><p>Dme &#x02013; <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></p><p>Bmo &#x02013; <italic>Bombyx mori</italic></p><p>Tca &#x02013; <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic></p><p>Ame &#x02013; <italic>Apis mellifera</italic></p><p>Aga &#x02013; <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Y.J conceived and designed the experiments.
