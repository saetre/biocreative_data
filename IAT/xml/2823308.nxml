The currently practiced forms of medical intervention to promote repair of the injured cartilage, e.g., drilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Pridie 1959</xref>), microfracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">Rodrigo et al. 1994</xref>), or osteochondral graft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">Matsusue et al. 1993</xref>), may not always lead to adequate repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Newman 1998</xref>). Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) was first applied clinically by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Brittberg et al. (1994)</xref>, and received much attention for its potential as a novel treatment of damaged cartilage. In many of the ACI protocols tried after the Brittberg report, the autologous chondrocytes have been prepared in monolayer culture and transplanted into the cartilage defects of the human joints. Several human clinical trials have, however, indicated that the reparative tissue generated in the ACI consists of fibrocartilage with limited amounts of hyaline cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Knutsen et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>Numerous authors have attributed the fibrocartilaginous quality of reparative tissue in the ACI to the dedifferentiation of chondrocytes prepared in monolayer culture. The chondrocytes cultured as monolayers have been found not to synthesize the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Holtzer et al. 1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Abbot and Holtzer 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Mayne et al. 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">von der Mark et al. 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Benya et al. 1978</xref>). A variety of attempts have been made to regenerate the transplantation-ready cartilage without losing chondrocytic phenotype. Chondrocytes three-dimensionally embedded in collagen have been suggested to maintain the chondrocytic phenotype for a relatively long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Kimura et al. 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Uchio et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Chaipinyo et al. 2004</xref>). Transplantation of the 3D-embedded chondrocytes has been undertaken in the hope of repairing damaged cartilage with better tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Ochi et al. 2001</xref>). The clinical validity of this method will be assessed in a near future, but the data accumulating from in vitro studies do not always favor the transplantation of 3D-cultured chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Darling and Athanasiou 2005</xref>).</p><p>Other workers have used growth factors, which have been found to be capable of enhancing cell proliferation and ECM synthesis in vitro and in vivo. In most studies on the regeneration of transplantation-ready cartilage, recombinant growth factors have been tested individually or in combination. For example, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">Martin et al. 1999</xref>), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Sailor et al. 1996</xref>), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Guerne et al. 1994</xref>), and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF&#x02212;&#x003b2;1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">Malemud et al. 1991</xref>) have been used to enhance proliferation and differentiation in primary and subcultured chondrocytes.</p><p>Mechanical stress is another important factor that regulates the numerous aspects of chondrocytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Broom et al. 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Palmoski and Brandt 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">Schneiderman et al. 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Gray et al. 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Sah et al. 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Korver et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">Parkkinen et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Guilak et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Buschmann, et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Lee and Bader 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Ragan et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Elder et al. 2001</xref>).

Since a large number of chondrocytes must be prepared in monolayer culture in order to regenerate the transplantation-ready cartilage, the dedifferentiated chondrocytes must be reactivated. In the present study, we prepared 3D-embedded chondrocytes using cells cultured in monolayers. We investigated the chondrocytic phenotype at different stages of preparation. In order to reactivate the dedifferentiated chondrocytes, we applied dynamic mechanical loading to the 3D-embedded chondrocytes as well as growth factors&#x02014;BMP-2 for its cell-differentiation activity and bFGF for its cell-proliferation activity.</p></sec><sec id="s0002" sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Isolation of chondrocytes</title><p>Articular cartilage slices were taken from hip, knee, and shoulder joints of seven 5-week-old Wistar rats for each single experimental set-up.

A variety of ACI protocols have been explored, but many of them have used chondrocytes propagated as monolayers. For successful tissue engineering of the transplantation-ready cartilage, a large quantity of chondrocytes must be prepared and propagation of cells in monolayer culture may be required. Numerous investigators have studied the phenotypic changes in chondrocytes during passage in monolayer culture. It has often been reported that the synthesis of the cartilage-specific matrix decreases while the synthesis of the non-cartilage specific matrix proteins, e.g. type I collagen, increases. These phenotypic changes in chondrocytes during monolayer culture, including loss of synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM), are likely to reflect dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Holtzer et al. 1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Abbot and Holtzer 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Mayne et al. 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">von der Mark et al. 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Benya et al. 1978</xref>). In spite of a variety of attempts by other workers, dedifferentiated chondrocytes prepared in monolayer have not been made to re-differentiate back into ECM-synthesizing chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Darling et al. 2005</xref>). Thus, an alternative scheme to maintain the chondrocytic phenotype would be of great advantage.</p><p>In this study, we first characterized passage 0 (P0) chondrocytes and non-culture chondrocytes (NCs), since the information gained about the phenotype of these cells would be used during the rest of our study. Then the chondrocytic phenotypes of NCs and P0 cells were compared with those of the cells that underwent subsequent passages (P1 to P4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Our study shows that in monolayer culture, dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes is apparent as early as P0, and that gene expression becomes even more attenuated as the number of passages increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). These data thus reconfirm that chondrocytes propagated in monolayer culture do not retain their phenotype. In turn, it must be remembered that the P0 cells, which were clearly dedifferentiated at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>), became reactivated by mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems have been tested in order to maintain or reactivate the chondrocytic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Benya and Shaffer 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Kimura et al. 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Guo et al. 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">Homminga et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Uchio et al. 2000</xref>). Some investigators have indeed asserted that 3D culture can allow redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes (Benya et al. 1982, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Liu et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">Tallheden et al. 2004</xref>). The assertion that implantation of the 3D-embedded chondrocytes can result in better cartilage regeneration also led to a clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Ochi et al. 2001</xref>). The basic research related to this clinical trial showed that freshly isolated chondrocytes embedded in type I collagen gel could proliferate, synthesize ECM, and maintain their chondrocytic phenotype for up to 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Chaipinyo et al. 2004</xref>). In turn, others using different types of collagen scaffold reported negative effects of 3D-embedded chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">van Susante et al. 1995</xref>). The conflicting data may have resulted from the different collagens used for 3D culture.</p><p>In the present study, we used the same collagen (prepared by the same manufacture) as the one used in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Chaipinyo et al. (2004)</xref>. We also confirmed that 3D-embedded chondrocytes retained their expression of type 2 collagen mRNA until the third week. However, it must also be remembered that 3D-embedded chondrocytes retained their chondrocytic phenotype only partially, and only for a limited time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). In order to regenerate the transplantation-ready cartilage, the cells must be prepared in large numbers with their chondrocytic phenotype retained. Our observation that the 3D-embedded chondrocytes only partially retain their chondrocytic phenotype, and only for a limited time, caused us to seek for another way of reactivating 3D-embedded chondrocytes.</p><p>Mechanical loading has been suggested as an important way of regulating the chondrocytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Broom et al. 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Palmoski and Brandt 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">Schneiderman et al. 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Gray et al. 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Sah et al. 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Korver et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">Parkkinen et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Guilak et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Buschmann, et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Lee and Bader 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Ragan et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Elder et al. 2001</xref>). In the third series of our experiments, we showed that dynamic compressive loading clearly reactivates dedifferentiated chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">B</xref>). Application of dynamic compressive load also caused suppression of type I collagen expression, irrespective of the duration of the loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5C</xref>). Of the different durations of dynamic compressive loading tested, loading of 60 min/day had the best effect on expression of Col2 and AGC mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">B</xref>). The nature of our study only allows us to guess the reason for the inferior results with longer duration of treatment, i.e. 120 min/day. The total response of genetic expression may reflect the cumulative magnitude of strain caused by each loading. Mechanical loading of long duration may result in strain on the cell.</p><p>In a variety of studies, growth factors have been shown to promote proliferation of chondrocytes and ECM synthesis in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Guerne et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Sailor et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">Martin et al. 1999</xref>). In the final series of our experiments, we hypothesized that administration of growth factor, i.e. bFGF or BMP-2, at the same time as mechanical loading would further augment the chondrocytic phenotype of the 3D-embedded chondrocytes. However, in clear contrast to our expectations, under mechanical loading these growth factors did not play any synergistic role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">8</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the well-documented positive effects of IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Gooch et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Bonassar et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">Mauck et al. 2003</xref>) and TGF&#x02212;&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">Mauck et al. 2003</xref>) on 3D-embedded chondrocytes, only a few studies have investigated the effects of bFGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">Martin et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">Shida et al. 1996</xref>) or BMP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Martin et al. 2001</xref>) on 3D-embedded chondrocytes, especially under mechanical loading. However, from the present data we should probably not attribute the negative effects of these factors applied simultaneously with mechanical loading simply to the different conditions of the chondrocyte culture, as attenuated phenotypic expression was confirmed not only against the &#x0201c;factor control&#x0201d; but also against the &#x0201c;stress control&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">8</xref>).</p><p>The simultaneous application of two treatments suppressed the chondrocytic phenotype relative to the &#x0201c;factor control&#x0201d; (mechanical stress but no growth factor), suggesting that the cell proliferation driven by the growth factor cancelled the differentiation promoted by the mechanical stress. In turn, the simultaneous application also suppressed chondrocytic phenotype relative to the &#x0201c;stress control&#x0201d; (growth factor but no mechanical stress), suggesting that the chondrocytic differentiation promoted by the mechanical stress may not coexist with cell proliferation driven by the growth factors. Application of these growth factors at different time points during regeneration of the cartilage may result in better chondrocytic phenotype.</p><p>In summary, the chondrocytes cultured as monolayers rapidly dedifferentiated, and even the 3D-embedded chondrocytes could not maintain the chondrocytic phenotype for a long time. Mechanical loading clearly reactivated expression of the aggrecan and type II collagen genes at loading of 60 min/day compared to the other durations of loading. BMP-2 and bFGF also increased aggrecan and type II collagen mRNA expression when applied independently. Unlike previous reports using monolayer cultures of chondrocytes, however, BMP-2 or bFGF did not augment the chondrocytic phenotype when applied simultaneously with mechanical loading. This result suggests that application of mechanical loading and growth factors administered at different time points may contribute to regeneration of the transplantation-ready cartilage, resulting in better chondrocytic phenotype.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>KA, SI, and MY conceived the experiments.
