The BS gene product, BLM, is a DNA helicase of the RecQ family that forms a complex <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with topoisomerase III&#x003b1;. Here, we show that BLM stimulates the ability of topoisomerase III&#x003b1; to relax negatively supercoiled DNA. Moreover, DNA binding analyses indicate that BLM recruits topoisomerase III&#x003b1; to its DNA substrate. Consistent with this, a mutant form of BLM that retains helicase activity, but is unable to bind topoisomerase III&#x003b1;, fails to stimulate topoisomerase activity.

This predisposition to cancer is thought to arise from the inherent genomic instability that is a feature of BS cells. In particular, BS cells display an elevated level of genetic recombination that is manifested as an increase in the frequency of both sister chromatid exchanges and interchromosomal homologous recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c2">2</xref>).</p><p>The gene mutated in BS, <italic>BLM</italic>, encodes a protein of molecular mass 159 kDa that belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c3">3</xref>). BLM protein has been purified and shown to act as a 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; DNA helicase on a variety of different DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c8">8</xref>). Mutations in two other genes encoding RecQ helicases are also associated with human cancer-prone disorders. <italic>WRN</italic> is defective in Werner&#x02019;s syndrome and <italic>RECQ4</italic> is defective in Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c10">10</xref>). Members of the RecQ helicase family contain a highly conserved catalytic helicase domain that is flanked by domains that vary both in size and sequence between different family members. However, despite this apparent sequence divergence in those regions outside the helicase domain, all known mutants lacking a RecQ helicase display genomic instability (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c13">13</xref>). Moreover, many of these mutants display a hyper-recombinogenic phenotype reminiscent of BS cells, suggesting that RecQ helicases perform a conserved function in controlling the level of homologous recombination in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c19">19</xref>). Although the precise cellular role of any RecQ helicase has yet to be elucidated, several lines of evidence suggest that RecQ helicases act in concert with type IA topoisomerases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c20">20</xref>).</p><p>The type IA subclass of topoisomerases includes <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> topoisomerases I and III and the eukaryotic topoisomerase III enzymes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c21">21</xref>). In vertebrates, there are at least two isoforms of topoisomerase III, termed &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, which display only a weak topoisomerase activity towards negatively supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c25">25</xref>). Yeast cells express a single topoisomerase III enzyme encoded by the <italic>TOP3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c26">26</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; mutants are viable, but grow very slowly and have defects in S phase responses to DNA damage and in both mitotic and meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c28">28</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>top3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is essential for viability, with <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; mutants displaying an inability to accurately segregate daughter chromosomes during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c30">30</xref>). Interestingly, mutation of <italic>SGS1</italic> or <italic>rqh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, the sole RecQ homologues found in budding and fission yeast, respectively, can suppress the deleterious effects caused by the absence of Top3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c30">30</xref>). One interpretation of this conserved genetic interaction is that RecQ helicases act upstream of topoisomerase III in the same biochemical pathway and that RecQ helicases generate a DNA structure that requires resolution by topoisomerase III (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c20">20</xref>). Consistent with this proposal, <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ can convert negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA to a structure &#x0005b;as yet not defined, but presumed to be single-stranded (ss)DNA&#x0005d; that can be acted upon by <italic>E.coli</italic> or <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Top3p to generate catenated DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c31">31</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Sgs1 and Top3 proteins also interact physically, raising the possibility that Sgs1p may recruit Top3p to its site of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c33">33</xref>). We and others have demonstrated that BLM and human topoisomerase III&#x003b1; (hTOPO III&#x003b1;&#x00029; are tightly associated in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c36">36</xref>) and that the two purified proteins interact <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c35">35</xref>), indicating that this association is a direct one.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that BLM can stimulate the topoisomerase activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1;. In contrast, a mutant BLM protein that is catalytically active, but no longer able to interact with hTOPO III&#x003b1;, has lost the ability to stimulate hTOPO III&#x003b1; protein. Moreover, we provide evidence that hTOPO III&#x003b1; associates with a BLM&#x02013;DNA complex. These data are consistent with the notion that hTOPO III&#x003b1; is recruited to its site of action through a direct interaction with the BLM helicase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA substrates</title><p>The &#x003c6;X174 helicase substrate was generated by annealing a 21mer oligonucleotide (GTGCATATACCTGGTCTTTCG) to circular &#x003c6;X174 ssDNA before being extended by 4 nt in the presence of Klenow polymerase, dATP, dTTP and &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP.

When hTOPO III&#x003b1; was incubated with supercoiled &#x003c6;X174 DNA in the absence of BLM, form I DNA disappeared with the concomitant appearance of topoisomers. At longer incubation periods, fully relaxed DNA (form II) was also evident. It is possible that a proportion of form II DNA molecules also represented nicked DNA since Top3&#x003b2; from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been shown to introduce single-stranded nicks into negatively supercoiled DNA (see Discussion). Given the potential heterogeneity of the reaction products generated by hTOPO III&#x003b1;, we quantified the loss of form I DNA as an indication of hTOPO III&#x003b1; activity and found that co-incubation with BLM led to an approximate doubling in the rate of hTOPO III&#x003b1; activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f1">1</xref>A and B). Incubation of BLM alone with the &#x003c6;X174 substrate had no effect on the level of form I DNA, indicating that the BLM preparation did not contain any contaminating topoisomerase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>The stimulatory effect of BLM on the activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1; was found to be dependent on the presence of RPA in the reactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f1">1</xref>C). It was therefore possible that RPA inhibits hTOPO III&#x003b1; by binding to ssDNA regions in the negatively supercoiled substrate, thereby preventing access of hTOPO III&#x003b1; to the DNA. BLM might then act to stimulate hTOPO III&#x003b1; by displacing RPA from the DNA. To eliminate this possibility, we examined the effect of RPA on hTOPO III&#x003b1; activity in the absence of BLM. RPA did not inhibit the plasmid relaxation activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1;, but rather had a mild stimulatory effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f2">2</xref>). This effect appeared to be solely a function of RPA binding to ssDNA, as opposed to a protein&#x02013;protein interaction occurring between RPA and hTOPO III&#x003b1;, since a similar stimulatory effect was also seen when RPA was substituted by <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f2">2</xref>). We therefore analysed whether SSB could substitute for RPA in supporting the stimulatory effects of BLM on the activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1;. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f2">2</xref> shows that in the presence of SSB, BLM still caused a stimulation of hTOPO III&#x003b1; plasmid relaxation activity. Due to the apparent functional equivalence of RPA and SSB in these reactions, coupled with the commercial availability of SSB, the bacterial protein was used in all subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>BLM can recruit hTOPO III&#x003b1; to single-stranded DNA bubbles</title><p>BLM and hTOPO III&#x003b1; have been shown to interact directly with each other and form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c35">35</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that the ability of ectopically expressed BLM to reduce the elevated frequency of SCEs in BS cells correlates with its ability to interact with hTOPO III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c36">36</xref>). The stimulatory effect of BLM on the activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1; that we observed might therefore be mediated by the recruitment of hTOPO III&#x003b1; to its site of action by BLM. In such a scenario, BLM should be able to simultaneously interact with both DNA and hTOPO III&#x003b1;. We have shown previously that BLM can unwind a duplex DNA molecule that contains a single-stranded bubble of the sort that is a characteristic of negatively supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c6">6</xref>). We tested, therefore, the ability of BLM to bind simultaneously to a synthetic bubble-containing duplex DNA substrate and to hTOPO III&#x003b1;. As expected, BLM was found to bind the bubble-containing substrate and generated two retarded complexes designated B1 and B2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f3">3</xref>). A proportion of the substrate was also incorporated into a complex that was retained in the wells. Since this material did not resolve under the gel running conditions employed, it was not possible to anaylse further the nature of these apparent aggregates of DNA and protein. Quantification of the amount of DNA in these complexes revealed that B1 and B2 represented 9 and 6&#x00025;, respectively, of the total substrate in the reaction. In contrast, at the concentrations used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f3">3</xref>, hTOPO III&#x003b1; displayed a negligible binding affinity for the DNA substrate. However, the addition of hTOPO III&#x003b1; to BLM-containing reactions resulted in the conversion of 93&#x00025; of B1 and 54&#x00025; of B2 into a new, slower migrating complex, termed BT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f3">3</xref>). Since concentrations of hTOPO III&#x003b1; were used at which hTOPO III&#x003b1; alone maximally bound &#x0003c;5&#x00025; of the substrate, the conversion of the majority of B1 and B2 into BT indicates that hTOPO III&#x003b1; preferentially binds B1 and B2 over the DNA substrate alone. These data also imply that DNA-bound BLM can still form a complex with hTOPO III&#x003b1; and are consistent with the notion that BLM recruits hTOPO III&#x003b1; to its site of action on DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of a hTOPO III&#x003b1; binding-defective form of BLM that retains helicase activity</title><p>To confirm that the stimulatory effect of BLM on hTOPO III&#x003b1; activity requires BLM to recruit hTOPO III&#x003b1; to its site of action, a mutant BLM protein was generated that was no longer able to interact with hTOPO III&#x003b1;. Mapping studies have revealed that two hTOPO III&#x003b1; interaction domains exist in BLM that are located between residues 1&#x02013;212 and 1267&#x02013;1417 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c35">35</xref>). A hexahistidine-tagged truncated protein, BLM-NC, that consists of residues 213&#x02013;1266 of BLM and does not, therefore, contain either of the hTOPO III&#x003b1; interaction domains, was expressed in yeast and purified to near homogeneity by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. BLM-NC had an apparent molecular mass of &#x0223c;150 kDa on SDS&#x02013;PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f4">4</xref>A) and was recognised on western blots by both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-BLM antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c35">35</xref>), as well as by an anti-hexahistidine tag antibody (data not shown), thereby confirming its identity.</p><p>To establish that BLM-NC no longer bound hTOPO III&#x003b1;, and hence to eliminate the possibility that additional hTOPO III&#x003b1; interaction domains might be present in the BLM protein not detected in our previous studies, far-western analysis using hTOPO III&#x003b1; as a probe was performed with BLM and BLM-NC. After separation of the BLM and BLM-NC proteins by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose filters, the membranes were incubated with hTOPO III&#x003b1; before being washed to remove any unbound material. hTOPO III&#x003b1; was then detected by western analysis using a previously characterized polyclonal antibody (D6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c35">35</xref>). We have shown using this technique that hTOPO III&#x003b1; associates with full-length BLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c35">35</xref>), and this result was confirmed in the current experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f4">4</xref>A). In contrast, hTOPO III&#x003b1; did not bind to BLM-NC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f4">4</xref>A), confirming that all hTOPO III&#x003b1; interaction domains have been removed by truncation of BLM to create BLM-NC.</p><p>Despite the fact that relatively large regions of BLM were deleted to generate BLM-NC, the truncated protein was still catalytically active and was able to unwind a variety of DNA substrates that have been shown to be substrates for the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c7">7</xref>). These included oligonucleotides annealed to a circular ssDNA and highly stable G4 DNA structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f4">4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>A hTOPO III&#x003b1; binding-defective mutant form of BLM cannot stimulate hTOPO III&#x003b1;</title><p>We next compared the ability of BLM and BLM-NC to stimulate the activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1;. Significantly, the stimulatory effect on hTOPO III&#x003b1; activity observed with full-length BLM was not seen when BLM was substituted by BLM-NC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f4">4</xref>C). This failure of BLM-NC to stimulate hTOPO III&#x003b1; was seen over a wide concentration range (81-fold), with higher concentrations even having a mild inhibitory effect on hTOPO III&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf611f4">4</xref>C). We conclude, therefore, that the stimulatory effect of BLM on hTOPO III&#x003b1; requires that the two proteins be capable of forming a complex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper, we report the first demonstration of a functional biochemical interaction between a eukaryotic RecQ family DNA helicase and topoisomerase III. BLM was found to significantly stimulate the ability of hTOPO III&#x003b1; to act upon negatively supercoiled DNA. When hTOPO III&#x003b1; alone was incubated with supercoiled &#x003c6;X174 DNA, two classes of reaction products were observed. These were in the form of topoisomers that appeared after 15 min incubation, and form II DNA that only accumulated after longer periods of incubation, up to 60 min. The latter class of reaction products most likely consisted of fully relaxed DNA, since their appearance occurred only after the formation of topoisomers. However, it is also possible that a proportion of form II molecules contained single strand nicks. Indeed, Wilson-Sali and Hsieh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c37">37</xref>) have reported recently that Top3&#x003b2; from <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> is able to catalyse the nicking of negatively supercoiled DNA. It is presently unknown if hTOPO III&#x003b1; possesses an equivalent endonucleolytic activity. However, we are currently addressing this issue and determining what differential effects BLM might have on the topoisomerase versus putative endonuclease activities of hTOPO III&#x003b1;.</p><p>BLM was found able to bind simultaneously to both hTOPO III&#x003b1; and DNA. Moreover, the stimulation of hTOPO III&#x003b1; by BLM was lost when BLM was modified to eliminate all of the hTOPO III&#x003b1; interaction domains. We therefore propose that one role of BLM is to recruit hTOPO III&#x003b1; to its site of action. This proposal is supported by a number of observations. In normal cells, BLM and hTOPO III&#x003b1; can be detected together in subnuclear structures termed PML bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c41">41</xref>). However, in BS cells, hTOPO III&#x003b1; is expressed normally but is aberrantly localised in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c35">35</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies on Sgs1p, the budding yeast homologue of BLM, which also interacts with Top3p, have shown that expression of mutant forms of Sgs1p that cannot associate withTop3p are unable to complement several aspects of the <italic>sgs1</italic> phenotype, including sensitivity to methylmethane sulphonate and hydroxyurea, which damage DNA and inhibit DNA replication, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c32">32</xref>). However, this requirement for Sgs1p to interact with Top3p can be circumvented by the expression of a fusion protein consisting of Top3p fused to the N-terminus of a Top3p binding-defective form of Sgs1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c32">32</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the evolutionarily conserved interaction between RecQ helicases and topoisomerase III serves to recruit topoisomerase III to its site of action.</p><p>The requirement for the presence of either RPA or SSB in the reactions to observe the stimulatory effect of BLM on the activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1; suggests that the DNA structure BLM recruits hTOPO III&#x003b1; to has single-stranded character. Consistent with this is the ability of BLM to recruit hTOPO III&#x003b1; to single-stranded &#x02018;bubbles&#x02019;. In human cells, the nature of the DNA structure that BLM loads hTOPO III&#x003b1; onto remains to be determined. TOPO III&#x003b1; is required for embryonic development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c42">42</xref>), indicating that TOPO III&#x003b1; performs an essential role that cannot be provided by other topoisomerases. Similarly, in both budding and fission yeast, neither Top1p nor Top2p can functionally substitute for Top3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c30">30</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that eukaryotic topoisomerase III enzymes do not function as typical topoisomerases and, consistent with this, it has been reported previously that Top3p is unlikely to play a significant role in regulating the overall supercoiling status of the budding yeast genome (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c43">43</xref>). Mutants lacking topoisomerase III, as well as those defective in RecQ family helicases, including BLM, generally display hyper-recombination throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c26">26</xref>). This would suggest that the BLM&#x02013;hTOPO III&#x003b1; complex acts to suppress inadvertant recombination or to disrupt inappropriately paired DNA molecules. One possible target for the complex is the Holliday junction recombination intermediate. It is known that RecQ, Sgs1p, WRN and BLM can disrupt Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c46">46</xref>). Moreover, we have shown recently that BLM promotes the ATP-dependent branch migration of these junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c5">5</xref>). Through catalysing this reaction, BLM may act to promote and&#x0002f;or eliminate recombinants, depending upon the circumstances. Although the role of topoisomerase III in this process is unclear, it may be significant that yeast Top3p has been shown to be required for the resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c27">27</xref>). The possibility exists, therefore, that BLM recruits hTOPO III&#x003b1; to Holliday junctions to affect their resolution. Ongoing studies of the effects of hTOPO III&#x003b1; on BLM-catalysed Holliday junction branch migration reactions aim to address this possibility. A second potential role for the BLM&#x02013;hTOPO III&#x003b1; complex is in the elimination of G-quadruplex DNA in order to permit progression of the replication and&#x0002f;or transcription machinery. This ability of BLM to unwind such non-canonical Watson&#x02013;Crick DNA structures is a conserved function of the RecQ family helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c13">13</xref>). G4 DNA has been suggested to be highly recombinogenic due primarily to its potential to lead to replication fork stalling and hence the formation of DNA double-strand breaks.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that BLM stimulates the activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1; and that this stimulation requires that the two proteins be able to form a stable complex. We propose that BLM functions to regulate the levels of genetic recombination through the recruitment of hTOPO III&#x003b1; to recombinogenic DNA structures and&#x0002f;or recombination intermediates. The biochemical functions of BLM and hTOPO III&#x003b1; appear to be intimately connected, consistent with the observation that lack of BLM in BS cell lines causes hTOPO III&#x003b1; to be mislocalised in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf611c35">35</xref>). It is therefore quite possible that the diverse phenotypes observed in BS cells are not due solely to a loss of BLM. Instead, &#x02018;uncoupling&#x02019; of the BLM&#x02013;hTOPO III&#x003b1; heteromeric helicase&#x0002f;topoisomerase complex might be at least partially responsible for this phenotypic diversity.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf611f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> BLM stimulates the activity of hTOPO III&#x003b1;.
