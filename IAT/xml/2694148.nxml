Both were associated first with the acroplaxome and later with the transient manchette. Predicted 3D structures indicated that PFN3 has the actin-binding site conserved, but retains only approximately half of the common poly-L-proline binding site.

Their ubiquity, abundance, and necessity for life in higher organisms underscore their general importance ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). Despite their small size, their functions are amazingly diverse. Through binding to numerous protein ligands, profilins are components of complex protein networks (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Interactions with components of the phosphatidylinositol cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the rac-rho pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] implicate them as a link through which the actin cytoskeleton communicates with the major signalling pathways of the cell. Accordingly, reducing the amount of profilin protein, <italic>e.g</italic>. by gene deletion, often has severe or even fatal consequences on the viability of the afflicted organism.</p><p>Profilins constitute a large and diverse protein family. Multiple isoforms exist in many species, being encoded by separate genes, or in some cases translated from mRNA splice variants. In animals and higher plants, isoforms may be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Moreover, profilins are found at different subcellular locations (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). Enrichment at dynamic plasma membranes was confirmed for various cells types. Also, profilins were observed in association with internal membranes involved in vesicular transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Finally, profilins are constituents of the cell nucleus (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Although the overall structure is conserved, sequence homologies between profilins from different species, and also between different isoforms from the same organism, are low ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). It was, nevertheless, reported that the overall functional properties of different profilins are similar, and that one isoform can be interchanged with another one from quite a distant source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, structural differences, which determine <italic>in vitro </italic>affinities for various ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], preferential protein complex formation in different cell types, and different subcellular locations may be important clues of divergent, possibly non-overlapping <italic>in vivo </italic>functions of different isoforms.</p><p>Despite extensive studies, the significance of the multiple profilins, their tissue-specificity and distinct subcellular locations have remained enigmatic. At least four different profilins were demonstrated to be present in the mammalian testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], a complexity which was not observed in somatic tissues. The mammalian testis may, thus, serve as a model to question whether profilin isoforms may fulfil distinct functions. Profilin-1 (PFN1) is ubiquitous and essential for cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; its expression in all cell types of the testis, including spermatogenic cells, thus seems obvious. In comparison, profilin-2 (PFN2) is predominantly found in the nervous system and has acquired more specialized functions in regulating neuronal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; it may represent a cell type-specific isoform also in the testis. While PFN1 and PFN2 were both demonstrated in the somatic Sertoli cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], a third isoform, profilin-3 (PFN3), is expressed solely in spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Most recently, profilin-4 (PFN4) was characterized as a novel isoform. It shows less than 30% amino acid identity with the other mammalian profilins; still, database searches produced significant alignments with the conserved profilin domain. PFN4 is also highly expressed during spermatogenesis, but is distinct from PFN3 in its temporal expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Based on sequence comparisons, it was speculated that the testis-expressed PFN3 and PFN4 might have altered binding capacities for actin and proline-rich ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, such diverse characteristics remained to be experimentally shown. In the present study, using yeast two-hybrid interaction assays and various biochemical methods, the binding capacities of PFN3 and PFN4 for proline-rich ligands, actin, and phosphoinositides were studied in comparison with PFN1 and PFN2. Subcellular locations in differentiating spermatids were studied by immunofluorescence. Three-dimensional structural models were also built to explain the functional properties of PFN3 and PFN4.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>PFN3 and PFN4 have different <italic>in vitro </italic>affinities for protein ligands</title><p>Actin monomers, poly-L-proline (PLP), and proline-rich proteins have been confirmed as <italic>in vitro </italic>ligands for each profilin isoform tested so far. In addition, <italic>in vivo </italic>interactions of various profilins have been verified with actin (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]), and proline-rich proteins, including the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) and the mammalian homologues of Drosophila diaphanous (mDia), members of the formin gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In analogy with this, several databases of known and predicted protein-protein interactions suggested that the testis-expressed isoforms PFN3 and PFN4 would likewise associate with these ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We asked whether PFN3 and PFN4 indeed shared these affinities.</p><p>Protein lysates containing pET-expressed ("untagged") PFN3 and PFN4 proteins were employed in PLP affinity chromatography. PFN3 bound to the PLP affinity column (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, upper panel); however, compared to PFN1 and PFN2, the association was weaker, since PFN3 was eluted from the PLP column at 2 to 4 M urea (compare PLP affinity chromatography data presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). Under the same experimental conditions, PFN4 failed to interact with PLP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lower panel), suggesting that different from the above predictions proline-rich protein ligands may not be targets for this isoform. Since PLP affinity chromatography is routinely employed to purify native as well as recombinant profilins, the lack of polyproline interaction caused complications in the purification of untagged PFN4.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Poly-proline interaction of PFN3 and PFN4</bold>.

(B) Quantitative &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay for selective pair wise Y2H interaction of PFN2, PFN3, and PFN4 with polyproline-rich VASP and DIAPH3. Diploids containing PFN2 and VASP or PFN2 and Diaph3 showed significant activity, reflecting the ability of PFN2 interact with these proteins.

PFN2a, which is known to bind VASP and p140mDia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], was included as a positive control. Expression of the LacZ reporter was used as a more quantitative indicator for the strength of protein-protein interactions. mDia3, but not VASP, was confirmed as an <italic>in vitro </italic>binding partner of PFN3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The interaction of mDia3 with PFN3 was weaker compared to PFN2a; parallel Y2H assays employing PFN4, in comparison, were negative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), confirming the results of the PLP affinity chromatography. Notably, our previous microarray analyses of human testis tissue ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and own unpublished results) had shown that at least five mDia3-encoding mRNAs variants, including the one employed in the Y2H assays here, were highly expressed in the testis and were most abundant in tissue samples, which contained post-meiotic germ cells. Thus, mDia3 proteins may still represent <italic>in vivo </italic>interaction partners of PFN3.</p><p>Binding of the testis-specific profilin isoforms to &#x003b2;-actin was similarly tested by a pair wise Y2H interaction, confirming PFN3 as an actin-binding isoform (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Parallel assays employing PFN4 were all negative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), suggesting that neither proline-rich proteins nor actin were targets of this unusual isoform. The failure of PFN4 to interact with actin contrasts with all other profilins studied thus far, most of which bind actin monomers with micromolar affinity. The Y2H method, however, is prone to false-negative discovery. By attaching domains from a transcription factor to the bait and prey proteins, true interactions may be missed if fusions place these attachments at important interacting actin and/or profilin interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To confirm the Y2H results by two independent methods, co-immunoprecipitation of &#x003b2;-actin and actin polymerization assays were performed. For co-immunoprecipitation PFN2, PFN3, and PFN4 were translated <italic>in vitro </italic>as N-terminal fusions to a c-myc-tag; a c-myc-antibody was employed to immunoprecipitate the profilins in the presence of HA-tagged &#x003b2;-actin. While PFN2 and PFN3 effectively co-precipitated with &#x003b2;-actin as evidenced by their retention by protein A beads, PFN4 failed to associate with &#x003b2;-actin also under these experimental conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In a control experiment, in the absence of profilins, &#x003b2;-actin was not precipitated with protein A beads (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro </italic>interaction of PFN3 and PFN4 with actin</bold>.

B) Western blot analysis of hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged &#x003b2;-actin co-immunoprecipitated with c-myc-tagged PFN2, PFN3, and PFN4. Analyses employing the c-myc- antibody showed that the three profilin isoforms (~14 kDa) were precipitated (upper panel; highlightened by arrow). Analyses employing the anti-HA- antibody showed that actin-HA (~45 kDa) was co-precipitated with PFN2 and PFN3, but not with PFN4 (bottom panel; highlightened by arrow). The ~28 kDa and ~50 kDa protein bands resulted from the light and heavy chains of the c-myc-antibody.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-10-34-2"/></fig><p>We probed the influence of recombinantly expressed GST-fusions of PFN3 and PFN4 on salt-induced actin polymerization using the pyrenyl fluorescence assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Labelled skeletal muscle G-actin was incubated with or without the purified GST-fused profilins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). GST-PFN1, which served as a control, showed a significant retardation of actin polymerization. Under the same experimental conditions, PFN3 also markedly reduced polymerization kinetics, albeit to a lesser extent. PFN4, on the other hand, did not influence the actin polymerization kinetics at all (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In summary, concerning PFN3 protein interaction partners, our results confirmed and extended the results by Hu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggesting that PFN3 showed major hallmarks of the well characterized profilins. PFN4, on the other hand, did not bind the tested protein ligands <italic>in vitro </italic>and thus may have <italic>in vivo </italic>functions different from regulating actin dynamics. It should be noted that spermatids contain several actin-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Recently, the actin-related protein ArpM1 was identified as an interaction partner of PFN3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The interaction of PFN4 and actin-related proteins expressed in spermatids deserves further evaluation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of GST-tagged profilin isoforms on &#x003b2;-actin polymerization kinetics</bold>. 5 &#x003bc;M actin and 15 &#x003bc;M each of GST-PFN1, GST-PFN3, and GST-PFN4 were pre-incubated prior to induction of actin polymerization by addition of KCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

Individual phospholipids show distinct subcellular distributions and perform distinct biological roles (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]), with steady-state concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>predominating at plasma membranes, PtdIns(3)P on endosomes, and PtdIns(4)P on the Golgi. Thus, through differential binding to these phospholipids <italic>in vivo</italic>, profilin isoforms may be selectively directed to functionally appropriate subcellular sites. Selective interaction with phosphoinositides was indeed the first functional difference reported between different profilin isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover, it was shown that binding to PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>may effectively compete for PLP interaction of profilin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. More recently, neighbouring binding sites for these competing ligands have emerged which may explain the competing interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Phospholipid interactions of GST-fusion proteins of PFN1, PFN3, and PFN4, respectively, were assayed by protein-lipid overlay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Each of the recombinant fusions strongly bound to PtdIns(3)P, and to a lesser extent to its phosphorylated products and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Unlike GST-PFN1 (and also other profilins), GST-PFN3 and GST-PFN4 both showed <italic>in vitro </italic>affinity towards PtdIns(4)P, suggesting that <italic>in vivo</italic>, in addition to endosomes, PFN3 and PFN4 may be associated with the Golgi apparatus. For GST-PFN4, a weak but reproducible binding to phosphatidic acid (PA) was additionally observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). PA is an abundant component (1&#x02013;4%) of most cellular membranes. It is also a signalling lipid, since its regulated formation can constitute an important signal for many downstream responses, including actin polymerization in spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In addition to this role, PA appears to regulate enzymes in phospholipase D pathways directly. The list of PA-binding proteins is rapidly expanding (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]); however, PA-binding of profilins has not been previously reported. The specificity of the observed interaction must be considered critically as the isoelectric point of PFN4 is basic (pI 8.8); still, GST-PFN3 did not bind PA under the same experimental conditions, despite of the highly basic character of PFN3 (pI 9.5).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Protein-lipid overlay assay of profilins</bold>. Phosphoinositide (PIP) overlay assay of Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins showed selective binding of GST-PFN1, GST-PFN2, and GST-PFN4 to nitrocellulose-bound phosphoinositides (100 picomoles per spot).

The acroplaxome is an F-actin/keratin 5-containing cytoskeletal plate, which anchors the acrosome to the spermatid nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Pro-acrosomal vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] are transported by F-actin- and microtubule-based molecular motors and dock and fuse along the acroplaxome (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]). The manchette is a transient structure developed subjacent to the marginal ring of the acroplaxome. It consists of a perinuclear ring with inserted microtubules as well as associated F-actin. The manchette participates in the transport of cargoes to the developing spermatid tail and in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking during spermatid head shaping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Indirect immunofluorescence of spermatids isolated from spermatogenic stage-specific rat seminiferous tubules was used to determine the localization of PFN3 and PFN4 throughout spermiogenesis. Phalloidin-Texas Red was used to monitor the F-actin-containing acroplaxome; tubulin monoclonal antibody was used to determine the position of the manchette with respect to the acroplaxome. PFN3 immunoreactivity was mainly observed in the acroplaxome of round spermatids and may be correlated with the presence of F-actin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6/1</xref>, panels A-L). During the progression of spermiogenesis, PFN3 acroplaxome immunoreactivity gradually disappeared and became apparent in the developing manchette of spermatids step 8 (S8) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6/1</xref>, panels D-F). Coinciding with the initiation of manchette disassembly in S14 spermatids, PFN3 immunoreactivity was seen in the cytoplasm subjacent to the disassembling manchette (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6/1</xref>, panels G-I). At this stage, the phalloidin-stained acroplaxome was devoid of PFN3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6/1</xref>, panels J-L). A similar immunoreactive staining pattern was observed with anti-PFN4 serum in rat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6/2</xref>, panels A-L) and also in human spermatids (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

For example, five conserved aromatic residues (Trp3, Tyr6, Trp31, Tyr133, and Phe139) and also Asn9 are responsible for the PLP interaction of PFN2a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>), and PFN1 is highly similar. The two aromatic residues on the C-terminal helix (Tyr133 and Phe139 in PFN2a) are not present in PFN3, which could lead to an altered specificity and/or lower affinity towards proline-rich sequences, as also evidenced by our binding assay. In PFN4, of the abovementioned aromatic residues, only Tyr122 is conserved (corresponding to His133 of PFN1 and Tyr133 of PFN2a). Thus, in this isoform, the aromatic surface of other profilins necessary for PLP binding is not present at all, which is in line with its observed inability to bind proline-rich sequences. While the overall sequence of PFN4 is more similar to the profilins of lower eukaryotes than to the other human/mammalian profilins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], PFN4 seems to be the only family member so far, in which the entire PLP binding site is lacking, suggesting that it may have other binding partners instead.</p></sec><sec><title>The actin-binding site</title><p>In PFN1, residues centrally involved in actin binding include Phe59, His119, Arg74, Arg88, Lys90, Lys125, and Tyr128 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]); these are fully conserved in PFN2a. In PFN3, this site is conserved, with some rather conservative amino acid sequence differences, such as the replacement of Phe59 and Tyr128 by Leu59 and His125, respectively, compared to PFN2a. These structural differences may have lowered or altered the affinity of PFN3 towards actin to some degree, when compared to PFN1 and PFN2a. In the PFN4 sequences, in contrast, there is no conservation of the known actin-binding residues of other profilins, which is well in line with our experimental data described above.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>PtdIns</italic>(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2 </sub>binding site</title><p>Based on mutagenesis studies and the localisation of sulphate and phosphate ions in crystal structures, the binding site for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>has been approximately mapped in human PFN1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It involves several conserved basic amino acid residues on the profilin surface, generating a large binding surface of positively charged residues. In PFN2a, residues likely to contribute to PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>binding include arginines 74, 88, 104, 107, and 135, and these binding determinants are largely conserved in PFN1. Interestingly, Arg74 and Arg135 are among the few residues, which are conserved throughout the known human profilin isoforms, including PFN4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In PFN3, the putative common PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>binding site is well conserved. In PFN4, many basic residues are present as well, but the putative phospholipid binding site seems to have shifted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). This structural difference may explain the distinct phospholipid binding characteristics of PFN4 (see above).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report functional differences between the testis-expressed profilins PFN3 and PFN4 as revealed by <italic>in vitro </italic>assays. At the same time, structural homology models were built for human PFN3 and PFN4, which explained their different functional characteristics. By various methods, mDia3, but not VASP, was identified as a novel <italic>in vitro </italic>binding partner of PFN3, while PFN4 did not bind PLP or proline-rich proteins. So far, PFN4 seems to be the only profilin family member in which the entire PLP binding site is lacking. Moreover, different from PFN3, PFN4 did not interact with actin in three different <italic>in vitro </italic>assays deviating from all other profilins analysed thus far. Actually, the structure of PFN4 does not retain the actin-binding site of other profilins. A much lower affinity for actin or actin-related proteins is thus conceivable, suggesting that PFN4 may perform <italic>in vivo </italic>functions, which are distinct from regulating actin dynamics. PFN3 and PFN4 were both capable of <italic>in vitro </italic>phosphoinositide interaction, but differed in their selectivity towards specific phospholipids. In PFN3, the putative common PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>binding site of profilins is conserved while it seems to have shifted in PFN4. PFN3 and PFN4 coexist in the acroplaxome and the manchette of spermatids in a sequential developmental manner. They vanish gradually from the acroplaxome when the manchette fully assembles and spermatid head shaping is in progress. Although the presence of PFN3 can be correlated with the presence of F-actin and actin-related proteins in the acroplaxome, and to a lesser extent in the manchette, the visualization of PFN4 in the acroplaxome-manchette complex is intriguing in light of our finding that it does not interact with actin <italic>in vitro</italic>. An F-actin independent role of PFN4 may suggest novel functions related to the process of spermatid head shaping, and may have significant clinical implications in understanding idiopathic causes of male infertility associated with abnormal sperm head shaping.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissues and spermatogenic cells</title><p>Human testis tissue was obtained surgically from patients undergoing a testicular sperm extraction procedure (courtesy of Professor Dr. med.

Recombinant profilins were expressed as glutathion-S transferase (GST) fusion proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>ER2566 (New England Biolabs, Heidelberg, Germany) and purified by glutathione sepharose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). Eluted profilins were dialysed against 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol and stored on ice. To determine their influence on actin polymerization, 5 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-actin (5% pyrene-labelled) in G-buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT) was incubated for 10 min at 20&#x000b0;C with or without 15 &#x003bc;M recombinant GST-fused profilins. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and KCl (final concentration 1 mM and 50 mM, respectively). Fluorescence was monitored for 2 h at 366 nm excitation and 407 nm emission using a LS50B fluorimeter (Perkin Elmer, Langen, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein-lipid overlay assay</title><p>PIP Strips&#x02122; membranes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) were employed following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS-T (10 mM Tris-Cl, ph 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) the lipid-containing membranes were incubated with 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml GST fused profilins for 2.5 h. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T + 3% BSA and the bound proteins detected by anti-GST antibody in conjunction with HRP-labelled secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Spermatogenic cells were collected from mechanically dissociated seminiferous tubular fragments (identified with a dissecting stereomicroscope as corresponding to stages I-XIV of rat spermatogenesis according to their transillumination pattern). Cells were placed in a drop of 3.7% paraformaldehyde (electron microscopy grade) in 0.1 M sucrose in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on microscope slides coated with Vectabond (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). This fixation procedure results in the preservation of the Golgi-acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette-nuclear relationship in spermatids, a condition that facilitates structure identification and access of antigenic probes. After 15-min fixation at room temperatures a coverglass was placed on top of the preparation. The glass coverslip was removed and the microscope slide- containing fixed spermatogenic cells was used for immunocytochemistry (see below). Cells were immunoreacted with affinity purified PFN3 and PFN4 (working dilution: 1:200) and &#x003b1;-tubulin monoclonal antibody (working dilution 1:100; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), followed by anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with rhodamine (working dilution 1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), respectively. Phalloidin-Texas Red-X was used to detect F-actin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Specimens were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined in a Zeiss Universal phase-contrast/fluorescence microscope equipped with episcopic illumination. Images were recorded using a Magnafire digital CCD camera (Optronics, Goleta CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of 3-dimensional models</title><p>Homology models for both PFN3 and PFN4 from mouse and man were generated using the SWISS-MODEL server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], based on the closest sequence homologues found from the PDB for each protein. For <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="PFN3">PFN3</ext-link>, the model is based on bovine profilin 1 (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1PNE">1PNE</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and for PFN4, the template was Acanthamoeba profilin II (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2ACG">2ACG</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].
