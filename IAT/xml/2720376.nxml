We applied expression profiling to identify the response program of PC3 cells expressing the AR (PC3-AR) under different growth conditions (i.e. with or without androgens and at different concentration of androgens) and then applied the newly developed ChIP-seq technology to identify the AR binding regions in the PC3 cancer genome. A surprising finding was that the comparison of MOCK-transfected PC3 cells with AR-transfected cells identified 3,452 differentially expressed genes (two fold cutoff) even without the addition of androgens (i.e. in ethanol control), suggesting that a ligand independent activation or extremely low-level androgen activation of the AR. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed 6,629 AR binding regions in the cancer genome of PC3 cells with an FDR (false discovery rate) cut off of 0.05. About 22.4&#x00025; (638 of 2,849) can be mapped to within 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). Three novel AR binding motifs were identified in the AR binding regions of PC3-AR cells, and two of them share a core consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene">CGAGCTCTTC</named-content>, which together mapped to 27.3&#x00025; of AR binding regions (1,808/6,629).

Alterations in AR sequences and expression levels and perturbations in AR signaling networks have significant roles in the genesis and maintenance of prostate cancers (PCa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Heinlein1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Bevan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Prostate cancers are often treated with hormone deprivation strategies such as orchidectomy, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue, or an antiandrogen. Although they are initially responsive to the treatment strategy, nearly all prostate cancers progress to &#x02018;hormone-refractory&#x02019; or &#x02018;androgen-independent&#x02019; disease. There are data suggesting that the AR signaling is still functional in &#x02018;hormone-refractory&#x02019; prostate cancer (HRPC). The mechanisms include 1) activation of the AR by other growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Culig1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>; 2) mutations in the AR that change AR ligand specificity and allow AR to be activated by non-steroids or anti-androgens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Zhao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>; 3) over-expression of the AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Chen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Visakorpi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Linja1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>; 4) recruitment of new AR-cofactors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that the AR seems to act as a promoter of carcinogenesis in HRPC.</p><p>In contrast, Yuan et al. showed an androgen-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in an androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell line (PC3) transfected with a human androgen receptor complementary DNA. They showed that in PC3 cells expressing the transfected androgen receptor (PC3-AR) under the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter, androgen decreased the proliferation rate and cloning efficiency and induced a more differentiated phenotype. Their data demonstrated that PC3 cells have retained the cellular machinery required to respond to the activated androgen receptor. Similar results were obtained showing that androgens suppress the proliferation of PC3-AR cells using two other promoters: cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Shen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and the EF1a promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Litvinov1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Niu et al. recently found that AR is a tumor suppressor or a proliferator in prostate cancer depending on cellular contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Niu1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Niu2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

They found that restoring the AR in PC3 cells could suppress their <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> invasion capabilities. All these data generated in PC3 cells seem to contradict the traditional belief that the AR functions as a stimulator in prostate tumor growth and metastasis. As PC3 cells expressed the basal marker-CK5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-vanBokhoven1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, PC3 cells might have some basal cell properties, which make them different from other prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP, which expresses CK8/18 and shows luminal cell properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-vanBokhoven1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We hypothesize that PC3 cells possess cellular machinery that turn the AR in PC3-AR cells into growth suppressor. We applied expression profiling to identify the response program of PC3-AR cells to different growth conditions (i.e. with or without androgens and different concentration of androgens) and then applied the newly developed ChIP-seq technology to identify the AR binding regions under androgen deprivation conditions. Out data provide a valuable data set in understanding the molecular basis for the growth prohibitive response program of the AR in advanced prostate cancers. The growth prohibitive properties of the AR or its response program can be exploited for developing novel prostate cancer therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PC3 cells expressing AR initiate ligand independent activation of the AR response program</title><p>In an effort to characterize androgen-induced growth inhibition mechanism and to identify targets that could be used to induce growth inhibition and differentiation in advanced prostate cancer cells, we used PC3 cells transfected with the wild-type AR as a model and performed gene expression profiling analysis. We compared PC3 cells with or without harboring the wild-AR construct in the growth conditions of 1 nM R1881, 10 nM R1881 and ethanol (the solvent for R1881). The MOCK control is PC3 cells transfected with empty vectors.</p><p>To our surprise, the comparison of MOCK-transfected PC3 cells with AR-transfected cells showed 3,452 genes with differential expression (two fold cutoff) even without addition of androgens (i.e. in ethanol control) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s001">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006589-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A carefully repeated biological replicate showed consistent results. This suggests that other factors than androgens could initiate AR-mediate response without the canonical AR binding ligand androgens. Alternatively, as we used charcoal-stripped serum, which still has about 10&#x00025; of androgens remaining in the serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Culig1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, it may suggest that low levels of androgen can still activate a large number of genes through AR in the advanced prostate cancer cell PC3. Among these 3,452 genes, 2235 are down regulated genes and 1217 up regulated genes in AR-PC3 cells compared to MOCK-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s001">Table S1</xref>). Adding 1 nM androgen only adds 232 differentially expressed genes (two fold cutoff, 133 down regulated and 101 up regulated). Adding 10 nM R1881 (androgens) generated an additional 482 differentially expressed genes (324 down regulated and 159 up regulated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006589-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

As Massie et al. used only 1.5 kb promoter, we compare 208 AR binding regions that localized within 1.5 kb of the 5&#x02032; of TSS sites, and we found that only 19 (9.1&#x00025;) also mapped to the 1532 AR promoter regions in LNCaP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s009">Table S9</xref>). A one-sided Fisher's exact test suggested that the overlap is not significant (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.92). Wang <italic>et al.</italic> used ChIP to chip to identify and map 90 <italic>AR</italic> binding sites on chromosomes 21 and 22 in a prostate cancer cell line LNCaP under the treatment of 100 nM of androgen 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 1 hour and 16 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These 90 <italic>AR</italic> binding sites could be mapped to 27 genes; we identified only three of them (TMEM50B, BTG3 and MORC3) overlapping with our ChIP-seq data. The big difference between our ChIP-seq data and other's data is probably due to several factors. First, different technologies (ChIP-seq v.s. ChIP-chip) were used. Using NRSF as an example, Ji et al. showed that 5,517 (78&#x00025;) of 7,114 ChIP-chip peaks did not overlap with the ChIP-seq peak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Ji1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. They showed 933 (58.8&#x00025;) of the 1,587 peaks common to ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip contain the NRSF motif, and 20.9&#x00025; of peaks identified by ChIP-seq but not found by arrays contain the NRSF motif. However, only 68 (1.23&#x00025;) of 5,517 ChIP chip specific peaks contain the NRSF motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Ji1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, AR binding may require co-factors that are different in different cells. The cells used in these studies are different: Massie et al. used LNCaP cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Massie1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> while we used PC3 over-expressing the wild type AR. Finally, both lists may contain come false positives, which could reduce the chance of overlap. We used a transient expression of AR in PC3 cells, which might cause over representation of AR bindings.</p><p>We integrated the ChIP data with the gene expression data of PC3-AR cells in response to androgens. We found that 859 AR binding genes (1114 AR binding regions) (51.5&#x00025;, 1,114/2,163,) are differentially expressed at various concentrations of androgens by at least two fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s003">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006589-g001">Figure 1</xref>, lower panel). Other AR binding genes may also be regulated by androgens by less than two fold, of course. There is also a possibility that AR binding is a pre-condition for androgen response, and other factors may be needed for some promoters to turn AR binding into AR-response (i.e changed expression levels).</p><p>Some of these AR binding regions are adjacent to genes that are up regulated and others are adjacent to genes that are down regulated by androgen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s001">Table S1</xref>). This is consistent with the result by Jariwala et al., who showed that, of 32 genes within 100 kb from the 19 novel AR-occupied regions they identified by ChIP, ten were stimulated by the AR but four were repressed in DHT-treated C4-2B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Jariwala1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. It is also possible that, for some promoters, AR binding only poises the promoters for additional binding of other factors, just like what Jia et al. showed that AR-occupied regions in prostate cancer cells exceed number of DHT-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Jia1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We noticed that AR did bind to the promoter regions of KLK3 (PSA) gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s003">Table S3</xref>) and confirmed its enrichment in the AR-ChIP compared to IgG-IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s010">Figure S1</xref>), but the expression level of KLK3 did not change even in the presence of 1 nM or 10 nM of R1881, suggesting that other co-factors are need to turn binding events into functional consequences of changed gene expressions for some genes like KLK3.</p><p>We identified the top ranking co-occupancy transcription factors for TEF1_Q6 (Transcriptional enhancer factor), GATA_Q6 (GATA transcription factors), OCT_Q6 (octamer transcription factors) and PU1_Q6 (PU.1 transcription factor). Wang et al. identified GATA2 and Oct1 as cooperators of AR in mediating the androgen response in LNCaP cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. TEF1 and PU1 are two putative novel AR cooperators that we identified for PC3-AR cells. TEF1 is also named TEAD1 (TEA domain family member 1, SV40 transcriptional enhancer factor). Recently, Knight et al found that TEAD1 is novel prostate basal cell markers that correlate with poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Knight1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Knockdown TEAD1 expression using siRNA in prostate cell lines led to decreased cell growth in PC3 and disrupted acinar formation in a 3D culture system of RWPE1. However, the interaction of TEAD1 and AR has not been studied and future investigation is warranted. PU1 is also named hematopoietic transcription factor, and it is ETS-domain transcription factor that activates gene expression during myeloid and B-lymphoid cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Ray1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Its role in prostate cancer or its relationship with AR has not been studied.</p><p>We found that 190 sites (about 2.9&#x00025;, 190 out of 6,629 AR binding sites) contain the proliferative AR consensus matrix M00481, M00447 and M00962 (from the Transfac database) with a likelihood (LR) ratio of 500 compared to genomic background. Our data is similar to Wang et al.'s findings that only 10&#x00025; of the binding regions that they identified have a canonical class I NR (<named-content content-type="gene">AGAACAnnnTGTTCT</named-content>) binding motif when allowing up to two positions to vary from the palindromic consensus with 3 nucleotide spacing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Massie et al. observed that 410 of 1,532 AR binding regions (26.8&#x00025;) contain the ARE sequence motif M00481 (consensus: <named-content content-type="gene">GGTACANNRTGTTCT</named-content>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Massie1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. We have identified a lower percentage of AR binding regions contain the AR consensus site, probably due to the stringent criterion we used, or suggesting that the AR binding consensus for the prohibitive response in PC3-AR cells is different from that of the proliferative cells such as LNCaP cells. This maybe not surprising as the consensus sequences for the AR in the Transfac database are derived either from <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data or from a limited numbers of human promoters: the M00481 (consensus: <named-content content-type="gene">GGTACANNRTGTTCT</named-content>) was built from 29 binding sites selected from random oligonucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Roche1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>; M00447 (consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene">AGWACATNWTGTTCT</named-content>) was derived from AR binding sites in mouse <italic>crisp3</italic> (cysteine-rich secretory protein 3)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Haendler1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>; M00962 (consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene">WGAGCANRN</named-content>) is derived from 30 compiled AR regulated genes but only four of them are human genes &#x0005b;p21WAF1, PIGR (polymeric immunoglobulin receptor), AR and KLK3&#x0005d; (from the Transfac database). Non-consensus ARE sequences such as <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GTAAAGTACTCCAAGAA-3&#x02032;</named-content> were previously identified for the androgen-regulated gene probasin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Rennie1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006589-Murtha1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We therefore proceed to see whether we can identify novel AR consensus that explain the AR bindings in PC3-AR cells. We identified three novel AR matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006589-g004">Figure 4</xref>) that can be mapped to 1,448, 1,012, 317 AR binding regions respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s006">Table S6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006589.s007">S7</xref>), which is much higher than the number of mapped AR binding regions using the three known canonical AR motifs from the Transfac database as we showed above. The consensus sequences of the new motif Gib1 and Gib2 are very similar, as both share a common core sequence motif <named-content content-type="gene">CGAGCTCTTC</named-content>. Motif Gib1 extends 3&#x02032; end two nucleotides (CG) and motif Gib2 extends 5&#x02032; end two nucleotides (TN) (N, any nucleotide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006589-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The union of the AR binding regions containing one of these two motifs gives 1,808 AR binding regions, which explains 27.3&#x00025; (1,808/6,629) of the AR binding events in PC3-AR cells. Our result suggests that the AR binding motif in PC3-AR cells might be very different from the canonical AR motif that was defined using androgen responsive prostate cells. Future mutagenesis and functional analysis is necessary to truly define these new AR motifs as functional AR binding motifs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chromatin IP</title><p>PC3 cells (catalogue # CRL-1435) were obtained from ATCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atcc.org/">http://www.atcc.org/</ext-link>).

In this construct (pCMVhAR), the wide-type AR is placed under the CMV promoter. LipofectimineTM 2000 reagent (Promega Inc.) was used for transfection according to the manufacturer's protocol. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), two anti-AR antibodies from BD Pharmagen were tested for their performance (data not shown).

To calculate the distance to a TSS start site, annotations from the UCSC genome browser were used. We also took into the consideration of the direction of the strand when calculating the distance to TSS.
