Viral recognition determinants in intrinsic immunity genes are expected to evolve rapidly as host genes adapt to changing viruses, resulting in a signature of adaptive evolution. <italic>Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP)</italic> from rats was discovered to be an intrinsic immunity gene that can restrict murine leukemia virus, and certain alphaviruses and filoviruses. Here, we used an approach combining molecular evolution and cellular infectivity assays to address whether <italic>ZAP</italic> also acts as a restriction factor in primates, and to pinpoint which protein domains may directly interact with the virus. We find that <italic>ZAP</italic> has evolved under positive selection throughout primate evolution. Recurrent positive selection is only found in the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)&#x02013;like domain present in a longer human <italic>ZAP</italic> isoform. This PARP-like domain was not present in the previously identified and tested rat <italic>ZAP</italic> gene. Using infectivity assays, we found that the longer isoform of ZAP that contains the PARP-like domain is a stronger suppressor of murine leukemia virus expression and Semliki forest virus infection. Our study thus finds that human <italic>ZAP</italic> encodes a potent antiviral activity against alphaviruses. The striking congruence between our evolutionary predictions and cellular infectivity assays strongly validates such a combined approach to study intrinsic immunity genes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Host&#x02013;virus interactions are a classic example of genetic conflict in which both entities try to gain an evolutionary advantage over the other. This &#x0201c;back-and-forth&#x0201d; evolution is predicted to result in rapid changes of both host and viral proteins, which results in an evolutionary signature of positive selection, especially at the direct interaction interface. Recent studies have demonstrated that host proteins can target intracellular stages of the viral life cycle to potently inhibit viruses. Collectively, these host proteins are referred to as &#x0201c;intrinsic immunity&#x0201d; proteins. One such protein, zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), was previously described from rats and shown to inhibit retroviruses and alphaviruses. We queried the primate orthologs of ZAP to ascertain both whether they have evolved under positive selection, and whether they have antiviral activity. We found that the signature of positive selection was restricted to a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase&#x02013;like domain in a longer isoform of primate ZAP. The longer human ZAP isoform has increased antiviral activity against both retroviruses and alphaviruses.

Consistent with this prediction, the primate genes that encode for intrinsic immunity have been found to be evolving under positive selection, wherein they accumulate an excess number of non-synonymous substitutions (protein-altering, dN) compared to synonymous substitutions (no effect on protein, dS). This kind of selective pressure is seen in cases where innovation in protein sequence can result in a selective advantage and rapid fixation, as is the case for a host immunity gene where a single mutation might improve its ability to recognize and destroy a pathogen. In fact, genome-wide scans for positively selected genes in primates reveal that adaptively evolving genes fall primarily into three functional categories: immune defense, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, with the majority of these genes being involved in immunity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Four known groups of intrinsic immunity genes have been preserved over a broad taxonomic range; <italic>APOBEC3G</italic> and other <italic>APOBEC3</italic> genes as well as <italic>TRIM5</italic> are conserved across many mammalian orders &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, while <italic>Fv1</italic> is conserved in many <italic>Mus</italic> species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our evolutionary analysis of <italic>ZAP</italic> revealed strong evidence of positive selection throughout primate evolution. By examining the pattern of evolutionary change in this gene, we found, surprisingly, no evidence for positive selection in <italic>ZAP</italic>'s CCCH RNA-binding domain. This implies that rapid alterations of viral mRNA binding have not driven <italic>ZAP</italic> evolution. Instead, the signature of positive selection in primate <italic>ZAP</italic> is confined to the PARP-like domain, implicating this domain as an uncharacterized and evolutionarily important interface for ZAP&#x02013;virus interactions. Using infectivity assays, we show that human ZAP is capable of restricting expression of the retrovirus, MLV, as well as infection by the alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), in human cells. Moreover, we show that the presence of the PARP-like domain in the longer human ZAP isoform significantly enhances this restrictive capability against both viruses, making this the first demonstration of a PARP-like domain being implicated in an immunity role. Our results demonstrate that a combination of evolutionary and virological analyses can identify and validate specific protein domains involved in host&#x02013;pathogen interactions, thereby uncovering previously unknown antiviral activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Two Predominant <italic>ZAP</italic> Isoforms</title><p>The human <italic>ZAP</italic> gene comprises 13 exons spanning approximately 60 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040021-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

The Refseq entries for both mouse and rat ZAP proteins only refer to a protein equivalent of human <italic>ZAP(S)</italic>. On examining the genomic sequence context for both rat and mouse <italic>ZAP</italic> genes, we found that they both have a downstream set of exons that could encode a putative PARP domain that would be orthologous to that from primate <italic>ZAP(L)</italic>. In order to determine whether these exons are spliced onto the remainder of the <italic>ZAP</italic> gene, we performed RT-PCR using RNA from rat liver and primers designed to the WWE domain (shared between both <italic>ZAP(S)</italic> and <italic>ZAP(L)</italic> isoforms) and the PARP domain. Indeed, we found that the rat <italic>ZAP</italic> gene can encode a <italic>ZAP(L)</italic> isoform that includes a C-terminal PARP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040021-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The reason this isoform appears to have been missed until now is because no ESTs corresponding to this PARP domain have been reported, suggesting that <italic>ZAP(L)</italic> may be more weakly expressed than <italic>ZAP(S)</italic> in rodents, as is the case in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040021-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>In terms of overall architecture and paralogous genes, <italic>ZAP</italic> is most closely related to 3 other PARP-containing genes: <italic>PARP11, PARP12,</italic> and <italic>TiPARP</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; as well as <italic>ZRP2</italic>, which only consists of a CCCH domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040021-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

The phylogeny constructed from the primate <italic>ZAP</italic> sequences was congruent with the generally accepted primate phylogeny confirming that the sequences are orthologous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040021-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

Significantly, our PAML analyses did not reveal any evidence for positive selection acting on the N-terminal CCCH domain. Indeed, we found a high degree of conservation of the CCCH domain throughout mammalian evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040021-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), arguing that rapid alteration of viral RNA-binding has not had a significant impact on ZAP evolution. Sliding window dN/dS analyses based on different pairwise alignments of primate ZAP genes suggests that positive selection may have episodically acted on the central domain containing the TPH and WWE motifs (aa 241&#x02013;700; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040021-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). However, since no codons show a recurrent signature of positive selection, these domains are not highlighted by the PAML analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040021-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Rather, we found a robust signature for positive selection in the PARP-like domain (aa 701&#x02013;902; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040021-t001">Table 1</xref>). We found that a model of episodic positive selection (Free Ratio) was significantly more likely than a model of constant positive selection (Model 0, one fixed dN/dS; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; .01, df &#x0003d; 21), suggesting that ZAP has been engaged in episodic conflicts with exogenous infectious agents. Three codons were identified as having evolved under recurrent positive selection in the PARP domain, using both PAML and REL analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040021-t001">Table 1</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Surprisingly, the three residues for which we obtained high confidence of positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040021-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) are found in close proximity to residues that are thought to mediate the contact residues for NAD&#x0002b; binding (cd01439.2 from the CDD database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; largely modeled from the crystal structure of the chicken PARP-1 catalytic domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;). This is highly unexpected because it would seem that these residues should be highly constrained as part of PARP or PARP-like function, for which NAD&#x0002b; binding is obligatory. It is possible that these residues could be rapidly evolving because of ZAP(L) interactions with viral proteins that may involve the same protein domains that interact with NAD&#x0002b;. Thus, contrary to expectation, the only signature of recurrent positive selection we found in primate <italic>ZAP</italic> evolution is limited to a domain that is missing from the <italic>rZAP</italic> gene, which is the only version that has been previously tested in any antiviral assays. Since protein innovation has been primarily favored exclusively in the PARP domain, this would predict that ZAP(L) is the more evolutionarily relevant antiviral isoform. This prediction can be directly evaluated by testing whether the region under the most intense positive selection, the PARP-like domain, enhances the antiviral activity of ZAP.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Human ZAP(L) Is a More Potent Viral Inhibitor than ZAP(S)</title><p>The original identification of rat NZAP was based on its ability to inhibit MLV infection and MLV long terminal repeat (LTR)&#x02013;based expression.

This suggests a secondary control of ZAP(L) expression, which we have not explored further.

Intriguingly, the expression of human ZAP isoforms in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells did not confer resistance to SFV (unpublished data), suggesting that the rapid evolution of ZAP has likely resulted in species-specific restriction and that ZAP restriction of alphaviruses is at least partially dependent on the context of other host proteins.</p><fig id="pgen-0040021-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Human ZAP Restricts SFV Infection in Human Cells through the PARP Domain</title><p>(A) Western analysis with anti-HA antibody shows expression of HA-tagged human and rat ZAP isoforms in stably expressing HeLa cell lines.

Based on this insight from our evolutionary analysis, we tested the abilities of both human ZAP(L) and ZAP(S) isoforms to inhibit SFV and HIV infection in human cells. Our results clearly demonstrate that human ZAP can inhibit SFV, but not HIV, and that the presence of the PARP domain significantly enhances the ability of ZAP to suppress SFV infection. While previous work also implicated the rat ZAP as an inhibitor of the murine retrovirus, MLV, in rodent cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, we do not observe such an effect against MLV infection (unpublished data) at the level of ZAP expressed in our stable human cell lines, even though we do see an effect on SFV infection in the same cell lines.

Our experiments on MLV and HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040021-g003">Figure 3</xref>) suggest that the RNA-binding specificities of rodent and primate ZAP are not significantly different. Our analyses cannot rule out the possibility that some subtle alteration of RNA-binding may have occurred during the course of mammalian evolution. However, the absence of positive selection in the CCCH domain unambiguously rules out an evolutionary conflict scenario in which the restrictive ability of ZAP was shaped by repeated episodes of selection for dramatic alterations in RNA-binding activity.</p><p>It is not yet clear what role a PARP-like domain could play in ZAP function. PARP function has been primarily characterized in the nucleus where it is believed that the addition of ADP-ribose moieties to chromatin proteins results in their looser association with DNA, thereby allowing greater access to transcription and DNA repair machineries &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. A similar mechanism of protein modification by ZAP's PARP domain could be imagined to disrupt binding by viral RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040021-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). However, the ZAP PARP-like domain lacks what is believed to be an essential catalytic glutamic acid (position 988 in PARP-1) and therefore may not be catalytically active as a canonical PARP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, although its NAD&#x0002b; binding site is conserved.</p><p>While the mechanism by which the PARP-like domain mediates its antiviral effect is unknown, we can still address why the PARP-like domain has been evolving under positive selection. Using the model for antagonistic host&#x02013;pathogen interactions, there are several possible scenarios for the adaptive evolution of the PARP-like domain in ZAP: either the PARP domain evolves towards recognizing the virus, or it evolves away from being recognized by the virus. In the first scenario, the PARP-like domain may increase ZAP's affinity for viral mRNA binding proteins (analogous to APOBEC3G associating with nucleocapsid &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;), in which case the PARP-like domain is under selective pressure to <italic>increase binding</italic> to viral proteins. The alternate possibility is that viruses may encode specific antagonists to bind ZAP's PARP domain and sequester or degrade ZAP (analogous to Vif degradation of APOBEC3G &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040021-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;), in which case the selective pressure on ZAP PARP would be to <italic>decrease binding</italic> with viral antagonists. We favor the latter possibility because the residues that show a recurrent signature of positive selection also fall proximal to the NAD&#x0002b; binding sites, which may be essential for any PARP-like function.
