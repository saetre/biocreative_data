Recent genome-wide association scans have found common genetic variants of <italic>SLC2A9</italic> to be associated with increased serum urate level and gout. The <italic>SLC2A9</italic> gene encodes a facilitative glucose transporter, and it has two splice variants that are highly expressed in the proximal nephron, a key site for urate handling in the kidney. We investigated whether SLC2A9 is a functional urate transporter that contributes to the longstanding association between urate and blood pressure in man.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We expressed both <italic>SLC2A9</italic> splice variants in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Xenopus laevis</named-content> oocytes and found both isoforms mediate rapid urate fluxes at concentration ranges similar to physiological serum levels (200&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;M). Because SLC2A9 is a known facilitative glucose transporter, we also tested whether glucose or fructose influenced urate transport. We found that urate is transported by SLC2A9 at rates 45- to 60-fold faster than glucose, and demonstrated that SLC2A9-mediated urate transport is facilitated by glucose and, to a lesser extent, fructose. In addition, transport is inhibited by the uricosuric benzbromarone in a dose-dependent manner (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> &#x0003d; 27 &#x003bc;M). Furthermore, we found urate uptake was at least 2-fold greater in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing SLC2A9 splice variants than nontransfected kidney cells. To confirm that our findings were due to SLC2A9, and not another urate transporter, we showed that urate transport was diminished by <italic>SLC2A9</italic>-targeted siRNA in a second mammalian cell line. In a cohort of men we showed that genetic variants of <italic>SLC2A9</italic> are associated with reduced urinary urate clearance, which fits with common variation at <italic>SLC2A9</italic> leading to increased serum urate. We found no evidence of association with hypertension (odds ratio 0.98, 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d; 0.9 to 1.05, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.33) by meta-analysis of an <italic>SLC2A9</italic> variant in six case&#x02013;control studies including 11,897 participants. In a separate meta-analysis of four population studies including 11,629 participants we found no association of <italic>SLC2A9</italic> with systolic (effect size &#x02212;0.12 mm Hg, 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;0.68 to 0.43, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.664) or diastolic blood pressure (effect size &#x02212;0.03 mm Hg, 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;0.39 to 0.31, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.82).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides evidence that SLC2A9 splice variants act as high-capacity urate transporters and is one of the first functional characterisations of findings from genome-wide association scans. We did not find an association of the <italic>SLC2A9</italic> gene with blood pressure in this study. Our findings suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms that could offer a new drug target for gout.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><sec id="sb1"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>Blood is continually pumped around the human body to deliver the chemicals needed to keep the body's cells alive and to take cellular waste products to the kidneys where they are filtered out of the blood and excreted in the urine. In healthy people, the levels of nutrients and waste products in serum (the liquid part of blood) fall within &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; ranges but in ill people these levels can be very different. For example, serum uric acid (urate) levels are usually increased in people with gout. In this arthritic condition, uric acid crystallizes in the joints (often those in the big toe) and causes swelling and intense pain. Increased serum urate levels, which are also associated with high blood pressure, diabetes, and several other important conditions, can be caused by eating food that is rich in chemicals called purines (for example, liver, dried beans, and port). The body also converts its own purines into uric acid so genetic variations in the enzymes involved in purine breakdown can alter serum urate levels, as can variations in the rate of urate removal from the body by the kidneys. Urinary urate excretion is controlled by urate transporters, proteins that carry urate into and out of the kidney cells. Uricosuric drugs, which are used to treat gout, reduce serum urate levels by inhibiting a urate transporter that reabsorbs urate from urine.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Several urate transporters have already been identified but recently, using an approach called genome-wide association scanning, scientists found that some genetic variants of a human gene called <italic>SLC2A9</italic> are more common in people with high serum urate levels than in people with normal levels. <italic>SLC2A9</italic> encodes a glucose transporter (a protein that helps to move the sugar glucose through cell membranes) and is highly expressed in the kidney's main urate handling site. Given these facts, could SLC2A9 (the protein made from <italic>SLC2A9</italic>) be a urate transporter as well as a glucose transporter? In this study, the researchers investigate this possibility and also ask whether genetic variations in <italic>SLC2A9</italic> might be responsible for the association between serum urate levels and high blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers first expressed <italic>SLC2A9</italic> in frog eggs, a type of cell that does not have its own urate transporter. They found that urate rapidly moved into eggs expressing <italic>SLC2A9</italic> but not into control eggs, that SLC2A9 transported urate about 50 times faster than glucose, and that glucose stimulated SLC2A9-mediated urate transport. Similarly, overexpression of <italic>SLC2A9</italic> in human embryonic kidney cells more than doubled their urate uptake. Conversely, when the researchers used a technique called RNA interference to reduce the expression of mouse SLC2A9 in mouse cells that normally makes this protein, urate transport was reduced. Next, the researchers looked at two small parts of <italic>SLC2A9</italic> that vary between individuals (so-called single polynucleotide polymorphisms) in nearly 900 men who had had their serum urate levels and urinary urate excretion rates measured. They found that certain genetic variations at these two sites were associated with increased serum urate levels and decreased urinary urate excretion. Finally, the researchers used a statistical technique called meta-analysis to look for an association between one of the <italic>SLC2A9</italic> gene variants and blood pressure. In two separate meta-analyses that together involved more than 20, 000 participants in several studies, there was no association between this gene variant and blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Overall, these findings indicate that SLCA9 is a high capacity urate transporter and suggest that this protein plays an important part in controlling serum urate levels. They provide confirmation that common genetic variants in <italic>SLC2A9</italic> affect serum urate levels to a marked degree, although they do not show exactly which genetic variant is responsible for increasing serum urate levels. They also provide important new insights into how the kidneys normally handle urate and suggest ways in which this essential process may sometimes go wrong. Thus, these findings could eventually lead to new treatments for gout and possibly for other diseases that are associated with increased serum urate levels.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050197">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050197</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service Direct health encyclopedia provides detailed information for patients about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=180">gout</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/gout.html">MedlinePlus</ext-link> provides links to many sources of information about gout (in English and Spanish), including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Gout/gout_ff.pdf">&#x0201c;What is gout?&#x0201d;</ext-link>, an easy-to-read guide from the US National Institutes of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia also has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout">gout</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid">uric acid</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLC2A9">SCL2A9</ext-link> (note: Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arc.org.uk/arthinfo/patpubs/6015/6015.asp">Arthritis Research Campaign</ext-link> also has information on gout</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Mark Caulfield and colleagues show that the<italic>SLC2A9</italic> gene, which encodes a facilitative glucose transporter, is also a high-capacity urate transporter.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Caulfield MJ, Munroe PB, O'Neill D, Witkowska K, Charchar FJ, et al.

Samples of 20 &#x003bc;l of incubation medium were taken every 2 min to measure the appearance of urate in the outside solution. The incubation volume was kept constant by sequential addition of medium after the removal of each sample. The activity remaining in the eggs at the end of the incubation was measured by solubilising the oocytes in 1 ml of 5&#x00025; SDS overnight. Incubation medium consisted of MBM supplemented with 5 mM <sc>d</sc>-glucose, <sc>d</sc>-fructose, uric acid, or <sc>l</sc>-glucose (control).

The analysis assumed standard simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics for a facilitative transporter with no cooperativity. In addition to the regression analysis, an Eadie-Hofstee linear transformation was included, the results of which could imply that a more complex kinetic model is required to fully describe the characteristics of this transporter.

Surprisingly, concentrations of glucose up to 1 mM had no effect on the transport of 10 &#x003bc;M urate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050197-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), and urate concentrations of up to 2 mM had no effect on the uptake of 50 &#x003bc;M <sc>d</sc>-glucose or <sc>d</sc>-fructose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050197-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050197-g002">2</xref>C). Note that the rates of urate transport were significantly greater than those for glucose. Urate fluxes were measured at 5 or 10 &#x003bc;M for only 20 min, whereas glucose rates were determined using 50 &#x003bc;M substrate for 30 min. Thus, converting flux rates to the same time period and equivalent concentrations suggest that urate is transported by SLC2A9 at rates 45- to 60-fold faster. The lack of significant competition between the hexoses and urate suggests that urate binds to a site on SLC2A9 that is different from the binding site for the hexoses. However, it could be argued that the injection of SLC2A9 mRNA was inducing expression of an endogenous protein that could separately mediate urate uptake. Therefore, we attempted to determine whether SLC2A9 could exchange hexoses with urate, providing further support for a single pathway mechanism. Since glucose and fructose are both rapidly phosphorylated upon entry into the oocyte, only urate efflux could be used to give a meaningful estimate of exchange rates. Oocytes were injected with radiolabelled urate and the efflux determined in the presence of 5 mM extracellular <sc>d</sc>-glucose, <sc>d</sc>-fructose, <sc>l</sc>-glucose, or 2 mM urate. Urate efflux could be described by a single exponential curve over a period of up to 20 min, and the presence of extracellular <sc>d</sc>-glucose greatly accelerated urate movement, while fructose did so to a lesser degree (7-fold versus 3-fold, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050197-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050197-g003">3</xref>B).

Thin-layer chromatography was used to analyze the efflux medium, and only urate and no allantoin were detected on the plate for both water-injected eggs and those expressing SCL2A9a. Thus, SLC2A9 exhibits classical exchange <italic>trans</italic>-stimulation between urate and glucose or fructose. The rate of loss of injected radiolabelled <sc>l</sc>-glucose into the efflux medium was negligible, indicating that the injection protocol did not result in a nonspecific leakage of the substrate from the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050197-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).</p><fig id="pmed-0050197-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Interaction between Hexoses and Human SLC2A9a-Mediated Urate Uptake in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Oocytes</title><p>Oocytes were injected with <italic>SLC2A9a</italic> cRNA 4 d prior to uptake experiments.

We now have evidence that urate is a preferred substrate for both human SLC2A9 variants and for the mouse orthologue. The ability of SLC2A9 to exchange urate with glucose in the absence of competition between these two substrates when present on the same side of the membrane indicates that the protein has separate binding sites. This is not a unique phenomenon in exchange proteins, as the glycerol-6-phosphate transporter exchanges glycerol-6-phosphate for inorganic phosphate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050197-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>This ability of SLC2A9 to exchange glucose and, to a lesser degree, fructose for urate may be physiologically important.

Our data showing that SLC2A9a can exchange glucose for urate suggest that this protein might play an important role in the secretion of urate from the blood into the urine. Glucose in the urine could exchange for urate in the proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells across the apical membrane, resulting in the release of urate back into the urine. In addition, glucose in the epithelial cells resulting both from reabsorption and neogenesis could exchange for plasma urate across the basolateral membrane, promoting the accumulation of urate in the cells. Furthermore, such a mechanism could explain the known correlation between the glycosuria seen in diabetes and the reduction in plasma urate levels. The increased glucose in the urine could accelerate the SLC2A9-mediated urate efflux across the apical membrane of the proximal convoluted tubule, but further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Therefore, our findings, in combination with epidemiologic data showing correlation of elevated serum urate with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and hyperinsulinaemia, provide a potential mechanism for these associations that warrants further investigation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050197-b044">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050197-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;.

Furthermore, we did not find any evaluated association of the same <italic>SLC2A9</italic> SNP with hypertension under an additive model in 5,249 hypertensive cases and 6,648 normotensive controls drawn from all the studies. In the context of this large-scale case&#x02013;control and population-based cohorts we conclude that there is no support for an association with blood pressure using the most biologically plausible genetic model.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations of This Study</title><p>We have not defined precisely the causative variant of <italic>SLC2A9</italic> responsible for elevated serum urate and reduced urinary urate clearance. There are several known SNPs within the gene region that might influence function of the SLC2A9 protein. Such studies will be facilitated by detailed re-sequencing of the <italic>SLC2A9</italic> gene to establish a comprehensive inventory of genetic variation across this locus. In addition to dietary and metabolic influences on uric acid levels there will be other, as-yet unidentified genetic influences on serum urate level that may contribute to epidemiologic correlations with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, gout, and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this paper we have translated the genetic association of the <italic>SLC2A9</italic> locus with serum urate derived from genome-wide scanning into a functional confirmation that SLC2A9 splice variants acts as a high-capacity urate transporter that can be facilitated by exchange with hexoses and inhibited by high concentrations of some uricosurics and siRNA technology. These findings offer novel potential pathogenic mechanisms and new drug targets for diseases such as gout.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050197-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Expression of SLC2A9a or 9b in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Oocyte Plasma Membrane after cRNA Injection</title><p>Oocytes were injected with 50 nl (1 ng/nl) SLC2A9a or SLC2A9b cRNA or water and incubated at 18 &#x000b0;C for 4 d.
