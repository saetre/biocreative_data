The opposing activities of Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins are part of a chromatin-based cellular memory system ensuring the correct expression of specific transcriptional programs at defined developmental stages. The default silencing activity of PcG proteins is counteracted by trxG proteins that activate PcG target genes and prevent PcG mediated silencing activities. Therefore, the timely expression and regulation of PcG proteins and counteracting trxG proteins is likely to be of fundamental importance for establishing cell identity. Here, we report that the chromodomain/helicase/DNA&#x02013;binding domain CHD3 proteins PICKLE (PKL) and PICKLE RELATED2 (PKR2) have trxG-like functions in plants and are required for the expression of many genes that are repressed by PcG proteins. The <italic>pkl</italic> mutant could partly suppress the leaf and flower phenotype of the PcG mutant <italic>curly leaf</italic>, supporting the idea that CHD3 proteins and PcG proteins antagonistically determine cell identity in plants. The direct targets of PKL in roots include the PcG genes <italic>SWINGER</italic> and <italic>EMBRYONIC FLOWER2</italic> that encode subunits of Polycomb repressive complexes responsible for trimethylating histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Similar to mutants lacking PcG proteins, lack of PKL and PKR2 caused reduced H3K27me3 levels and, therefore, increased expression of a set of PcG protein target genes in roots. Thus, PKL and PKR2 are directly required for activation of PcG protein target genes and in roots are also indirectly required for repression of PcG protein target genes. Reduced PcG protein activity can lead to cell de-differentiation and callus-like tissue formation in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> mutants. Thus, in contrast to mammals, where PcG proteins are required to maintain pluripotency and to prevent cell differentiation, in plants PcG proteins are required to promote cell differentiation by suppressing embryonic development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In higher eukaryotes only a small proportion of genomic information is required in any specific cell type at a given developmental stage. The intricate decision whether a gene should be active or repressed is made by the counteractive activities of trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins that form part of a chromatin-based cellular memory system. Here we show that the CHD3 proteins PICKLE and PICKLE RELATED2 (PKR2) have trxG-like functions in plants and activate PcG protein target genes. Lack of PKL function can partially suppress PcG mutant leaf and flower phenotypes, supporting the idea that CHD3 proteins and PcG proteins act antagonistically during plant development. We identified PcG genes among the direct PKL/PKR2 targets in roots and demonstrated that lack of <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> results in reduced PcG protein activities, leading to similar root phenotypes in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> and PcG protein mutants. Previous studies have implicated PKL as a transcriptional repressor, but we provide evidence that CHD3 proteins such as PKL and PKR2 act as transcriptional activators in plants and assume trxG-like function to counteract PcG protein&#x02013;mediated gene repression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamic regulation of chromatin structure is the underlying scheme for modulating genome activities in higher eukaryotes. There are two major classes of proteins with enzymatic activities directed at chromatin - histone modifying enzymes and ATP dependent chromatin remodelers.

Among its direct targets we identified the genes for the PcG proteins SWN and EMF2. Lack of PKL as well as its close homolog PKR2 caused reduced expression of genes for PcG proteins in primary roots, concomitantly with reduced H3K27me3 levels.

Triacylglycerols accumulated in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> seedlings only in primary roots, suggesting that PKL-mediated repression of <italic>EMF2</italic>, <italic>CLF</italic> and <italic>SWN</italic> was restricted to primary root tissues.

Because PKL acts as transcriptional activator of PcG protein target genes, PKL can be considered as a plant trxG protein. A trxG function of a CHD protein is not without precedence, as the Drosophila CHD protein Kismet-L counteracts PcG protein-mediated repression by promoting transcription elongation through recruiting ASH1 and TRX histone methyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Srinivasan2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Autoregulation of genes for PcG proteins has been observed before in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Ali1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In Arabidopsis, the <italic>MEDEA</italic> (<italic>MEA</italic>) gene, a homolog of E(Z), is repressed by PcG proteins in post-embyronic tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Jullien1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Katz1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to many other PcG protein target genes, <italic>EMF2</italic> and <italic>SWN</italic> require PKL for efficient expression, because in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> roots expression of both genes is strongly reduced. Expression of <italic>CLF</italic> in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> roots is reduced as well, but this could be an indirect effect because we detected neither H3K27me3 at the <italic>CLF</italic> locus nor PKL binding to <italic>CLF</italic>. Together, reduced expression of <italic>EMF2</italic>, <italic>SWN</italic> and <italic>CLF</italic> explains the reduced H3K27me3 levels in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> roots and the de-repression of a number of PcG target genes. As lack of PKL did not prevent increased expression of <italic>LEC1</italic>, <italic>FUS3</italic>, <italic>ABI3</italic> as well as many other PcG target genes, we propose that PKL is required for the activation of only a subset of PcG target genes.</p><p><italic>PKL</italic> and <italic>PKR2</italic> are expressed mostly in the seedling root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Li1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000605-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and loss of cell identity in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> is restricted to primary root tissues. Thus, PKL and PKR2 function mainly in the seedling root; other proteins might activate PcG protein target genes in aerial organs, possibly other PKL homologs.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>PKL Represses Embryonic Traits Via Maintaining PcG Protein Activity</title><p>PcG proteins in plants and animals are master regulators of genomic programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Khler1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, whereas in mammals PcG proteins are required to maintain pluripotency and to prevent cell differentiation, in plants PcG proteins are required to promote cell differentiation by suppressing embryonic development. The PcG proteins CLF and SWN act redundantly and lack of both, CLF and SWN causes cells to de-differentiate and to form callus-like tissues that give rise to somatic embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Chanvivattana1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mutant studies support the idea that PcG protein function is impaired in <italic>pkl</italic> and <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> roots: First, the <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> and <italic>clf swn</italic> double mutants have similar phenotypes. Both activate the embryonic master regulator <italic>LEC1</italic> (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Makarevich1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>) and both express embryonic traits in seedlings. Second, the <italic>clf swn</italic> mutant phenotype is strongly enhanced in the <italic>pkl clf swn</italic> triple mutant, causing complete transformation of germinating seedlings into callus-like tissues. For several reasons we believe that reduced expression of PcG genes is rather the cause than the consequence of the pkl root phenotype: (i) PcG genes <italic>EMF2</italic> and <italic>SWN</italic> are direct target genes of PKL, (ii) about 35&#x00025; of <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> mutants undergo transformation to pkl roots, whereas expression levels of PcG genes <italic>CLF</italic> and <italic>SWN</italic> are reduced to 20&#x00025; of wild-type expression levels, indicating reduced expression levels of PcG genes in roots that do not adopt a pkl phenotype, (iii) in line with the last argument, expression of PcG genes was indeed reduced in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> roots that did not undergo discernable transformations (data not shown).</p><p><italic>LEC1</italic> is sufficient to induce somatic embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Lotan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000605-Mu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and development of embryogenic characteristics in <italic>pkl pkr2</italic> roots is likely a consequence of <italic>LEC1</italic> de-repression due to reduced PcG protein activity.

Finally, we conclude that PKL restricts embryogenic potential by regulating expression of genes for PcG proteins that are needed to repress activators of embryonic cell fate such as <italic>LEC1</italic>.</p><p>Taken together, our study revealed that the plant CHD3 proteins PKL/PKR2 directly activate PcG protein target genes; thus, PKL/PKR2 have trxG-like functions and counteract PcG protein repressive activities during development.
