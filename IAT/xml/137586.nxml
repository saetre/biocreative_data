Huntingtin is moderately conserved, with 10 HEAT repeats reported in its amino-terminal half. HD orthologues are evident in vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but not in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> or <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> a phylogenetic profile similar to the NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family transcription factors, suggesting a potential functional relationship.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We initially tested the potential for a relationship between huntingtin and dorsal by overexpression experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin complexes via its carboxyl-terminal region with dorsal, and the two enter the nucleus concomitantly, partly in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and Nup88-dependent manner. Similarly, in HeLa cell extracts, human huntingtin co-immunoprecipitates with NF-kB p50 but not with p105. By cross-species comparative analysis, we find that the carboxyl-terminal segment of huntingtin that mediates the association with dorsal possesses numerous HEAT-like sequences related to those in the amino-terminal segment. Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate huntingtins are composed predominantly of 28 to 36 degenerate HEAT-like repeats that span the entire protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Like other HEAT-repeat filled proteins, huntingtin is made up largely of degenerate HEAT-like sequences, suggesting that it may play a scaffolding role in the formation of particular protein-protein complexes. While many proteins have been implicated in complexes with the amino-terminal region of huntingtin, the NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family transcription factors merit further examination as direct or indirect interactors with huntingtin's carboxyl-terminal segment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of the most abundant neuronal population in the striatum, medium-sized spiny projection neurons, as well as more diffuse neuronal loss in the rest of the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The major determinant of HD pathogenesis is an expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin, a large 350 kD protein that is widely expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Similarly expanded polyglutamine tracts in other proteins also cause neurodegenerative disorders, but with different neuronal populations being lost in each case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The evident importance of protein context in determining neuronal susceptibility indicates a role for huntingtin's normal structure or function in the specific pathogenesis of HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Human huntingtin is notable for contributing to the definition of HEAT (<underline>H</underline>untingtin, <underline>E</underline>longation factor 3, protein phosphatsase 2<underline>A</underline>, <underline>T</underline>OR1) repeats, degenerate ~38 amino acid motifs that normally appear in tandem arrays with each unit consisting of two helical domains separated by a non-helical region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The crystal structures of the PP2A PR65/A subunit and &#x003b2;-importin show these proteins to be composed almost entirely of 15 and 19 HEAT repeats, respectively, which form a flexible solenoid-like structure as they cooperate to mediate a number of different protein-protein interactions central to the proteins' functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Despite its large size, the 10 HEAT repeats of human huntingtin located in approximately the amino-terminal one-half of the protein were the only distinct functional motifs recognized, providing limited clues to the protein's function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the amino-terminal segment of huntingtin has been reported to interact with more than two dozen proteins that implicate it in such diverse processes as signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, intracellular trafficking and cytoskeletal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Huntingtin's phylogenetic profile implies that it participates in biological pathways that exist in vertebrates and insects, but not in yeast, nematode or plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This phylogenetic profile is similar to that of the NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family proteins, which regulate a variety of biological processes including neuronal survival and hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], a process also dependent on huntingtin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This similarity led to us to test the potential for a relationship between <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin and dorsal in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell overexpression system, where the carboxyl-terminal region of huntingtin was shown to associate and enter the nucleus jointly with dorsal, partly in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and Nup88-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation of huntingtin and NF-kB from HeLa cell extracts raises the potential for an analogous complex involving the human proteins. The apparent lack of functional motifs in the carboxyl-terminal huntingtin segment that mediates the association with dorsal led us to re-examine the distribution of HEAT-like motifs, aided by cross-species comparison. Our findings indicate that the huntingtin proteins are composed predominantly of degenerate HEAT-like sequences distributed across the entire protein, suggesting that huntingtin may act as a scaffold in facilitating the formation of a variety of functional complexes, analogous to other HEAT repeat proteins. It is likely that such complexes may include NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family members and other direct or indirect huntingtin interactors, but vary in constitution depending on cell type, physiological state and intracellular localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Concomitant nuclear accumulation of dorsal and the carboxyl terminal fragment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin</title><p>Transfection of pPac-FLAG-Dorsal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells produced two patterns of expression, with approximately half of the transfected cells, respectively, showing a predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) or nuclear (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) distribution of FLAG-dorsal expression.

By contrast, transfection of the myc-tagged carboxyl-terminal <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin construct, pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc (defined in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>), always showed a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution of expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Surprisingly, co-transfection of pPac-FLAG-Dorsal and pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc showed that both products accumulated in the nucleus in every double-transfected cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). pIZ-Dhd3126C-myc also showed the same phenomenon, but not pIZ-DhdN605-myc, pIZ-DhdN84-myc, or pIZ-DndN2193-myc (defined in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>, data not shown), suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal conserved region of huntingtin is crucial. Clearly, over-expression of dorsal promoted nuclear accumulation of Dhd2194C-myc, as pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc alone never showed detectable nuclear accumulation even after LPS stimulation (data not shown). Similarly, Dhd2194C-myc enhanced FLAG-Dorsal nuclear accumulation, since all double-transfected cells showed nuclear accumulation of FLAG-Dorsal, in contrast with about half the cells transfected with FLAG-Dorsal alone.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Concomitant nuclear accumulation of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin and dorsal</bold>. <bold><italic>a,b</italic></bold>, When pPac-FLAG-Dorsal encoding FLAG-tagged dorsal was transfected into S2 cells, approximately half of the transfected cells had predominantly cytoplasmic distribution of FLAG-Dorsal <bold>(<italic>a</italic>)</bold> and the remaining half showed predominantly nuclear distribution <bold>(<italic>b</italic>)</bold>.

These sequences are referred to here as HEAT-like, as they were not defined by the same homology considerations originally used to define HEAT repeats and do not always precisely match their reported start and end-points. Vertebrate huntingtin HEAT-like sequences were identified by iterative MAST searches of the nr protein database, beginning with a MEME motif of 38 amino acids trained with the 10 published human huntingtin HEAT repeats (corresponding with the regions of H3-5, H9-12, H18-19, and H21).

Consequently, we performed an iterative analysis of vertebrate huntingtin HEAT repeats as, after each round, we incorporated newly implicated HEAT-like sequences from huntingtin into species-specific and cross-species MEME motifs. This iterative approach culminated in the detection of 36 HEAT-like sequences in the vertebrate huntingtins, extending across the entire protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). The consensus secondary structure prediction for these HEAT-like sequences is a pair of helical domains, separated by a non-helical spacer (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). These findings are consistent with Andrade et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] who recently reported a few additional HEAT repeats in the vertebrate huntingtins, detected by a homology-based iterative gapped alignment procedure (REP). Our data suggest that huntingtin is largely made up of HEAT-like sequences, perhaps explaining the lack of other recognizable functional motifs.</p><p>Neither the MEME motif representing all vertebrate huntingtin HEAT-like sequences nor the REP program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] efficiently detects equivalent sequences in <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin. However, an iterative process using MEME motifs based on <italic>Drosophila</italic> HEAT repeats, sometimes in concert with fish HEAT-like huntingtin sequences, revealed 28 HEAT-like sequences in <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin, again spanning the entire protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Four of these (D1, D13, D16, and D28), located in appropriate order and position within the protein, could be related directly to corresponding vertebrate HEAT-like sequences (H2, H12, H16, and H35) using cross-species MEME motifs representing individual vertebrate HEAT-like sequences. The consensus secondary structure prediction for the 28 <italic>Drosophila</italic> HEAT-like sequences (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>) indicates a conservation of structure despite divergence in primary sequence.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The HEAT-like repeats that we found in the vertebrate huntingtins overlap both the originally identified HEAT repeats and a few additional HEAT repeats, detected by a homology-based iterative gapped alignment procedure (REP), as well as identifying novel, apparently related segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We refer to the repeats detected by the iterative MEME approach as HEAT-like because the search process assumes a fixed length for all sequences and therefore does not produce gapped segments optimized to the original definition of HEATs. Rather, it detects stretches of fixed length related to a motif trained with known HEAT motifs that are not specifically aligned by homology and, therefore, it has the potential to reveal degenerate HEAT-related segments. The HEAT-like motifs are almost evenly distributed in human huntingtin from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus. Their preponderance perhaps explains the lack of any other significant structural motifs detected in this very large protein. Considering the degenerate nature of HEAT repeats, it is likely that additional HEAT-like motifs may still remain unidentified in the huntingtins. This is particularly true of <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin, where, unlike in the vertebrates, the iterative search process could not benefit from comparison of multiple sequences from different species within the same phylum. Thus, despite being slightly longer than the vertebrate proteins, <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin revealed fewer overall HEAT-like sequences. Indeed, the detectable sequence homology between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate huntingtins is only segmental, whereas the vertebrate huntingtins are similar to each other over their entire lengths (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). However, the HEAT-like motifs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin are also distributed evenly, irrespective of the regions of similarity with vertebrate huntingtins, indicating that overall structures of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate huntingtins are likely to be more similar than might expected from the comparison of primary amino acid sequence. This also suggests that <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin's HEAT-like sequences are more similar to each other than to vertebrate HEAT-like sequences, perhaps indicating a degree of co-evolution of individual repeats within the same protein.</p><p>To date, there are no data concerning huntingtin's tertiary structure. The large number of HEAT-like sequences in huntingtin raises the possibility that huntingtin may have a solenoid-like structure that acts as a scaffold for guiding multiple protein-protein interactions, similar to PP2A PR65/A subunit in phosphatase complexes and importin-&#x003b2; and transportin in nucleocytoplasmic transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this scenario, huntingtin might be expected to be present in complexes with different protein compositions in different cell types, physiological states and cellular locations. This view is consistent with numerous studies in mammalian systems in which huntingtin has been found to complex with different proteins, to reside in different subcellular compartments in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and to display different reactive epitopes in different locations within the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>We initially chose to test the possibility that dorsal, the prototypical <italic>Drosophila</italic> NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family member, might be capable of joining huntingtin in a complex because both protein families show the same phylogenetic profile. We demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal, but not amino-terminal fragments of <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin and full-length dorsal associate and translocate into the nucleus in S2 cells. Although the experimental condition involved an artificial over-expression system, their concomitant movement into the nucleus was influenced by LPS stimulation and by the presence of GAL4, which are known to influence native dorsal nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], suggesting that the over-expressed carboxyl-terminal fragments of <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin might reflect some aspects of the physiological behaviors of the native protein. This view is supported by the co-immunoprecipitation of human huntingtin with NF-kB p50. The actual nuclear translocation process of NF-kB is not understood and nucleocytoplasmic transporters for NF-kB have not been identified, though the presence of the typical NLS in the conserved Rel-homology domain has implicated the importins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Dorsal nuclear import processes have been shown to be complicated and varied, with one recent study supporting a potential importin-independent route for dorsal nuclear translocation involving Nup88 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The association of <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin with LPS- and Nup88-dependent dorsal nuclear translocation and its structure of multiple HEAT-like motifs make it a tempting speculative candidate for a nucleocytoplasmic transporter, among other potential functions. Our observation that endogenous <italic>Drosophila</italic> huntingtin showed infrequent nuclear accumulation compared with the carboxyl-terminal fragments, could suggest that, like importins, its presence in the nucleus might be transient, with a rapid return to the cytoplasm after dissociation from the dorsal-containing complex. Although we cannot yet address the behavior and function of native full-length fly huntingtin under physiological conditions, our data suggest that a potential role for huntingtin in NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family signalling should be further explored in both fly and vertebrate systems.</p><p>Finally, considerable effort has been focused in both human and model systems on the generation and potential toxicity of amino-terminal cleavage fragments of huntingtin in HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. This is due to the presence of the polyglutamine segment near the amino-terminus and the large number of interacting proteins that have been defined for this portion of huntingtin. More recently, the destruction by protease cleavage of full-length huntingtin, which has anti-apoptotic properties, has been suggested to play a role in accelerating pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. As NF-kB is involved in neuronal survival and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], our findings suggest that further studies are also needed to determine whether the carboxyl-terminal huntingtin fragments released by cleavage of full-length huntingtin might also play a role in pathogenesis via an effect on NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family signalling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Delineation of the normal structure and functions of huntingtin proteins may disclose features that underlie the specificity of neuronal cell death in HD. Cross-species comparison revealed that fly and vertebrate huntingtins are both large proteins made up predominantly of degenerate HEAT-like motifs similar to those found in solenoid-like scaffolding proteins that organize protein-protein complexes. The NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family transcription factors are candidates for association with huntingtin in such complexes and for co-transport to the nucleus, based on overexpression experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. These findings suggest a potential physiological role for huntingtin in NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family transcription factor signalling pathways, and possibly in nuclear transport that will require detailed examination in both fly and vertebrate systems and in models of HD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>cDNA cloning</title><p>A search of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Expressed Sequence Tag Database (Berkeley <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome Project, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fruitfly.org/"/>) identified an EST clone, LD23533, as encoding a peptide with similarity to an amino-terminal region of human huntingtin (amino acid position 48&#x02013;136).
