Current treatment regimens rely on dietary management and, in severely affected patients, liver or combined liver-kidney transplantation. For undetermined reasons, transplantation does not correct the biochemical phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To study the metabolic disturbances seen in this disorder, we have created a murine model with a null allele at the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase locus and correlated the results observed in the knock-out mice to patient data. To gain insight into the origin and magnitude of methylmalonic acid (MMA) production in humans with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency, we evaluated two methylmalonic acidemia patients who had received different variants of combined liver-kidney transplants, one with a complete liver replacement-kidney transplant and the other with an auxiliary liver graft-kidney transplant, and compared their metabolite production to four untransplanted patients with intact renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Enzymatic, Western and Northern analyses demonstrated that the targeted allele was null and correctable by lentiviral complementation. Metabolite studies defined the magnitude and tempo of plasma MMA concentrations in the mice. Before a fatal metabolic crisis developed in the first 24&#x02013;48 hours, the methylmalonic acid content per gram wet-weight was massively elevated in the skeletal muscle as well as the kidneys, liver and brain. Near the end of life, extreme elevations in tissue MMA were present primarily in the liver. The transplant patients studied when well and on dietary therapy, displayed massive elevations of MMA in the plasma and urine, comparable to the levels seen in the untransplanted patients with similar enzymatic phenotypes and dietary regimens.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combined observations from the murine metabolite studies and patient investigations indicate that during homeostasis, a large portion of circulating MMA has an extra-heptorenal origin and likely derives from the skeletal muscle. Our studies suggest that modulating skeletal muscle metabolism may represent a strategy to increase metabolic capacity in methylmalonic acidemia as well as other organic acidurias. This mouse model will be useful for further investigations exploring disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions in methylmalonic acidemia, a devastating disorder of intermediary metabolism.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Methylmalonic acidemia is the biochemical hallmark of a group of autosomal recessive genetic metabolic disorders that prevent the body from converting L-methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These disorders are caused by mutations in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase apoenzyme or by impaired synthesis of the enzymatic cofactor, 5'deoxyadenosylcobalamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Affected individuals display massive elevations of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in body tissues and fluids, have a well-recognized metabolic phenotype characterized by extreme metabolic fragility, and a poor outcome marked by early mortality and substantial lifelong morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Mutations in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (<italic>MUT</italic>) gene are the cause of <italic>mut </italic>class methylmalonic acidemia. Two enzymatic phenotypes within this class are recognized. In <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o</italic></sup>, there is no detectable or residual enzyme activity. In <italic>mut</italic><sup>-</sup>, enzyme activity is markedly reduced but can sometimes be stimulated <italic>in vitro </italic>with supraphysiological concentrations of vitamin B12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The correlation between <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>vitamin B12 responsiveness in patients classified as <italic>mut</italic><sup>- </sup>is uncertain, since most do not demonstrate a physiological response to parenteral cobalamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Typically, patients with <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>methylmalonic acidemia display more severe biochemical and clinical phenotypes than patients who harbor cofactor responsive lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In a recent clinical study, vitamin B12 unresponsive patients had a median survival of six years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The treatment of isolated methylmalonic acidemia was established in the 1960s and consists of alkali replacement and nutritional management, mainly designed to limit amino acid precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Carnitine supplementation and intermittent antibiotic therapy are newer measures, whose efficacy has not been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The precise etiology of the complications of methylmalonic acidemia is uncertain, and even well-treated patients remain at risk for intermittent decompensation, pancreatitis, metabolic infarction of the basal ganglia, and renal failure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Solid organ transplantation has been used as a therapy for methylmalonic acidemia and a few patients have received liver, kidney, and combined liver-kidney transplants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Liver and liver-kidney transplant recipients do not experience ketoacidotic attacks, but remain at risk for renal disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and metabolic infarction of the basal ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. They also exhibit persistent methylmalonic acidemia/aciduria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and may have extreme elevations of MMA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The origin of MMA production and the magnitude of MMA elevations in transplant patients have not been carefully studied.</p><p>We created a mouse model of <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>methylmalonic acidemia to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease and study the etiology of MMA production in the disorder. In this report, we describe the metabolic phenotype of the <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>animals and compare it to the human condition in the post-transplant state. Our data suggest that the extra-hepatorenal metabolism of propionyl-CoA provides the major pool of metabolites seen in methylmalonic acidemia and highlights the role that skeletal muscle plays in the pathophysiology of this common organic aciduria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of the exon 2 floxed, exon 3 deleted methylmalonyl-CoA mutase allele</title><p>A 129 Sv/Ev BAC clone containing the murine methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene was used to prepare a targeting construct. In brief, a set of contiguous EcoRI restriction fragments containing the 5'end of the gene and first through fourth exons was assembled in pBluescript. The first contained a fragment that harbored the second and third exons of the gene. A loxP linker was introduced into the 5' EcoRI site. The linker carries a unique ApaLI site. The two 5' genomic EcoRI fragments were added sequentially, followed by the addition of a PstI fragment containing a portion of exon 3 to the 3' end. A cassette derived from pHR1 that carried a loxP site, the pMC1 promoter, the neomycin resistance gene, and the Sv40 poly-A signal was placed in between the unique AvrII site and the Bsu36I site in the targeting construct[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A diphtheria toxin-A fragment cassette under the control of the pMC1 promoter was next inserted at the 5' end of the construct in the reverse orientation to generate the targeting construct[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. ES clones were screened using combination of long-range PCR/enzyme digestion and Southern blotting. Primers that flank the 5' loxP site were used to genotype the animals. (See additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for the representative results, PCR conditions, and primer sequences).

Organs were harvested and nucleic acids extracted using the DNeasy Tissue kit and RNeasy Total RNA Isolation from Lipid Tissues kit (Qiagen). The Northern blot was performed with the Northern Max-Gly kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. 20 &#x003bc;g of total RNA, derived from the liver of <italic>Mut </italic>null or wild-type neonatal mice, was used for Northern blotting. The probe for the mouse gene was a portion of the cDNA, located between the start codon at the 5' end and an NcoI site at position 1187, encoding exons 1&#x02013;5. The blot was stripped and probed with an actin cDNA, which was provided by Ambion as a loading control.</p><p>Whole cell extracts from the liver and murine embryonic fibroblast cell lines were analyzed by immunoblotting and were probed with rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against the murine methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] or beta-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The anti-mutase antibody was used at a dilution of 1:750, and beta-actin was used at 1:5,000. Goat anti-rabbit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. Chemiluminescent detection was performed with reagents from Pierce. Recombinant murine methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] was used to verify the specificity of the rabbit anti-mutase antisera and to provide a positive control in Western blot analysis experiments.</p><p>Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity was determined indirectly by measuring [1-<sup>14</sup>C] propionate incorporation into macromolecules as described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. All propionate incorporation assays were performed in triplicate. [1-<sup>14</sup>C] Sodium propionate was purchased (Perkin Elmer, Cambridge, MA) as a custom preparation at a specific activity of 55.0 mCi/mmol (2 mCi/ml).</p><p>Murine embryonic fibroblast cell lines were prepared after harvesting embryos on day E12.5. The cell lines were genotyped and expanded prior to use. A recombinant lentivirus that expressed the murine methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was prepared by cloning a sequence-verified, full-length murine methylmalonyl-CoA mutase cDNA into pLenti6 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The lentiviral construct has the <italic>Mut </italic>gene driven by the CMV promoter and the backbone carries a blasticidin cassette driven by the E7 promoter. A control lentivirus expressing EGFP cloned in an identical fashion was also prepared and used in parallel for correction experiments.</p><p>All viral stocks were prepared according to manufacturers instructions. <italic>Mut </italic>null MEF cell lines were infected with lentiviral stocks expressing either murine methylmalonyl-CoA mutase or eGFP. The transduced MEFs were selected and expanded on DMEM with 5 percent fetal bovine serum containing 2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml blasticidin prior to [1-<sup>14</sup>C] propionate incorporation studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolic Studies</title><p>Plasma was isolated from animals immediately after euthanization by collecting blood in tubes that contained 1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;l of diluted sodium heparin. The samples were immediately centrifuged, the plasma removed, diluted in water, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C in a screw top tube for later analysis. The mice underwent gentle bladder massage to produce 1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;l of urine that was immediately analyzed or diluted and stored in a similar fashion as the plasma. Organ dissections were performed under a dissecting microscope to remove the brain, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidneys. Organs were weighed and snap frozen prior to storage at -80&#x000b0;C and subsequent processing.</p><p>Two methods were used to measure MMA in the mice. Plasma, urine, and organ extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with stable isotopic internal calibration to measure MMA and 2-methylcitrate isomers I and II[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The para-nitroanaline reaction was used for rapid identification of affected animals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Studies</title><p>Patient studies were conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and were approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute Institutional Review Board as part of NIH study 04-HG-0127 "Clinical and Basic Investigations of Methylmalonic Acidemia and Related Disorders" after informed consent was obtained. Metabolic parameters and creatinine clearance were measured during two consecutive 24-hour urine collections and were used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and MMA output.</p><p>Two patients had undergone combined liver-kidney transplantation as a treatment for <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>class methylmalonic acidemia prior to enrollment. Briefly, the patient labeled L(A)KT, a 19-year old Caucasian female, was diagnosed on the second day of life following an episode of hypothermia and lethargy. At age 12, she received a cadaveric renal transplant and subhepatic heterotopic auxiliary liver transplant[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. At the time of these studies, she was receiving 0.8 g/kg/d whole protein. Patient LKT, a 27-year old Mexican-American female, was diagnosed in the neonatal period. At age 22, she received an orthotopic liver transplant followed by a kidney transplant two years later[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. At the time of these studies, she was receiving 0.5 g/kg/d whole protein. The other patients (N = 4) ranged in age from 4 to 21 years and have not received transplants. All patients harbored complementation status-defined <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>class lesions and were selected as a comparator group because they had identical enzymatic phenotypes and importantly, preserved renal function, with measured creatinine clearances greater than 40 percent of predicted. All patients were well at the time of hospitalization and were individually prescribed high energy, low protein diets that provided between 0.3&#x02013;0.9 g/kg/d whole protein. One patient (Pt 4) also received supplemental isoleucine.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical manipulations were carried out using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Differences in the plasma and urinary MMA concentrations between mutant mice over time and patient groups was determined by one-way ANOVA and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey-Kramer method. Tissue metabolites were analyzed using a mixed model ANOVA to account for both random and fixed effects. The model included the effects of time, organ, and organ by time interaction. p-values for the higher-level interaction comparisons were adjusted using bootstrap simulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. p-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Mutant Mice</title><p>Homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells was used to engineer a deletion in the third exon of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (<italic>Mut</italic>) gene and to flank the exon 2 with loxP sites to create a versatile null allele, suitable for Cre-mediated genomic manipulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Although the animals appeared in extremis, a frank acid/base imbalance caused by MMA seems unlikely, given the plasma MMA concentration at this time.</p><p>The pattern of increases in the concentration in the plasma was highly significant within the mutant groups over time: prenatal vs. 4&#x02013;6 hours [F (1,6) = 107; p &#x0003c; 0.0001], 4&#x02013;6 hr vs 8&#x02013;12 hours [F (1,6) = 54; p &#x0003c; 0.0001] and 8&#x02013;12 hours vs 20&#x02013;24 hours [F (1,4) = 152; p &#x0003c; 0.0001].

In the prenatal <italic>Mut </italic>mutant mice, a 19-fold increase in the MMA content of the kidney was observed, with other organs increased only 3&#x02013;4 fold over wild-type animals (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> for a graph of the fold change). At 8 to 12 hours of age, skeletal muscle and kidney MMA levels exceeded the MMA levels of the brain and liver in mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) but were not significantly greater. At the end of life, however, the MMA content and fold change was increased in the mutant liver, as was the MMA content of the skeletal muscles, kidneys, and brain in descending order (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> for a graph of the fold change). Within the affected animal groups, organ specific differences over time were examined for significance using a mixed model ANOVA. First, an effect of time was assessed to examine the hypothesis that MMA concentrations varied over time in an organ specific fashion [F (6,12) = 6.7, p = 0.002]. The effect of time on MMA concentration in each organ type was next determined, with liver [F (2,16) = 43.7, p &#x0003c; 0.0001), skeletal muscle [F(2,16) = 11.8, p = 0.0007) and kidney [F (2,16) = 7.9, p = 0.004) displaying a statistical significant pattern of increasing as time progressed. The changes in brain metabolites [F (2,16) = 2.8, p = 0.09] showed a trend toward increasing over time but did not achieve significance. Next, pair wise contrasts were constructed from the mixed model results in order to compare all tissue types and all sample times. The corresponding p values, adjusted for multiple comparison after bootstrap simulation, were examined for significance using paired t-tests. The most important trend was that the MMA content of the liver at 24 hours was significantly greater than skeletal muscle (p = 0.002 at 8 hours, p = 0.05 at 24 hours), brain (p = 0.002 at 8 hours, p = 0.0016 at 24 hours), or kidney (p = 0.0023 at 8 hours, p = 0.0072 at 24 hours). Furthermore, despite the fact that the skeletal muscle had the highest MMA content at 8 hours, there were no statistically significant differences between organs at 8 hours. Comparison between the mutant versus wild type and heterozygous animals for plasma and tissue metabolites was striking at all points. Because many wild type and heterozygote animals had MMA levels at the lower limit of assay detection, detailed comparisons between these groups were not included in our analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Methylmalonic acid concentration by tissue type over time.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured with two consecutive 24-hour urine collections and found to be greater than 70 ml/min in the transplanted patients, with normal values of other renal parameters, such as fractional excretion of sodium and urinary amino acids. This indicates that renal dysfunction is not a contributing factor to the methylmalonic acidemia and aciduria observed in these transplanted individuals. Minimal biochemical data was available on the transplant patients when they had preserved renal function and precluded a direct comparison to the effect of combined organ transplantation in each patient.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Biochemical parameters in MMA patients.

For example, during gestation (E19) the plasma MMA of <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>mice was in the 170 &#x003bc;M range, much greater than the 30 &#x003bc;M concentration seen in amniotic fluid (urine) samples from mothers known to carry <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>fetuses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. These high plasma MMA levels indicate aberrant prenatal metabolism and suggest that the animals may be born partly intoxicated due to the chronicity and magnitude of their exposure to MMA and related metabolites. Prenatal exposure to an abnormal metabolic milieu may explain the onset of clinical symptoms in some of the neonates with <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>methylmalonic acidemia in the first 24 hours of life and the later presentations seen in patients with less severe blocks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>In utero </italic>metabolic changes and the effects on growth and development have become an increasingly recognized feature in disorders of the electron transport chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and future studies of <italic>in utero </italic>metabolism in the <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>mice will examine whether the massive metabolite elevations observed have physiological consequences on energy metabolism.</p><p>The pattern of organ MMA concentrations observed as the illness progresses in mice reveals several important trends that can be directly correlated to patients. While the mice are alive and feeding, their plasma MMA concentration is 1.2 mM and the skeletal muscle contains the highest average concentration of MMA per milligram of wet-weight tissue. This suggests that the skeletal muscle is generating significant amounts of MMA. The notion of extra-hepatorenal production of MMA is supported by the studies on the human combined liver-kidney transplant patients, who have massive MMA output (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) and enormously elevated plasma MMA levels comparable to those seen in non-transplanted methylmalonic acidemia patients. Furthermore, because both liver-kidney transplant patients had intact renal function and normal-functioning livers that would metabolize gut-derived propionate, the MMA in these patients must originate principally in other organs.</p><p>Direct comparison to the pre-transplant state in solid organ transplant patients was not possible because they had not been studied when renal function was intact nor in the same fashion described in this report. For this reason, the transplant patients were compared to a group of untransplanted patients with the same enzymatic phenotype and preserved renal function who were treated with low protein, high-energy diets. Future efforts to characterize the metabolic parameters in MMA solid organ transplant recipients might benefit from standardized pre- and post- operative regimens to measure metabolic parameters in all patients. Clearly, this will be an important clinical and research problem to address, especially since the number of MMA transplant recipients to date is small but likely to increase as more patients are identified through newborn screening.</p><p>In humans, approximately 40 percent of the body mass is skeletal muscle, which plays a major role in branched-chain amino acid catabolism and fatty acid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Because branched-chain amino acid catabolism and odd-chained fatty acid oxidation produce the bulk of the MMA observed in non-transplanted patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], the simplest hypothesis to unify the observations from the murine and human studies is that MMA is being generated by the skeletal muscles in both species. Indeed, when methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was previously measured in different murine tissues, skeletal muscle possessed significant holo- and apo- enzyme activity. Furthermore, the promoter was more complex than seen in generic "house-keeping" genes and the Mut gene and protein appeared to be subject to significant regulation at the transcriptional and post-translational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. To directly examine the skeletal muscle and other tissues for the relative abundance of enzyme, we used Western blot analysis to examine tissue extracts from a wild type mouse and found that the skeletal muscles contained a large amount of immunoreactive enzyme, grossly comparable to the relative amounts present in the kidney and liver (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> for a Western analysis of murine tissues). Thus several lines of evidence indicate that the enzyme is expressed, active and abundant in the skeletal muscle.</p><p>Skeletal muscle is also an important site of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], a process suspected to contribute approximately 50 percent of the MMA load observed in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex is an enzyme involved in branch-chain aminoacid oxidation, which is inhibited via phosphorylation by the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Methylmalonyl-CoA has previously been shown to inhibit branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In the setting of methylmalonic acidemia, methylmalonyl-CoA accretion may increase the activity of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex by inhibiting the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase in the skeletal muscle beds, setting up a physiological forward feeding circuit for MMA production. Increased MMA production through such a mechanism might also contribute to the significant methylmalonic acidemia seen in the transplant patients. The possibility that the MMA concentrations in the tissues of the knock-out mice may be influenced by the developmental regulation for BCAA catabolism will require further examination, especially since the regulation of BCAA catabolism in mice has not been extensively studied. Additionally, the precursors of MMA may vary over time, with odd-chained fatty acids potentially providing a major contribution to the metabolite load in the mice and humans, especially given the evidence from patient studies demonstrating that odd chained fatty acids are increased in patients with propionate metabolic disorders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>The clinical studies presented here include determination of whole body MMA output in <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>patients, a measurement that has previously been demonstrated to be an effective means to carefully describe whole body MMA metabolism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Previous clinical reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the studies presented here firmly demonstrate that enzymatic correction of the liver and kidney in affected patients by transplantation does not always greatly lower the circulating MMA load. However, liver transplantation patients do realize complete protection from systemic metabolic decompensation. This suggests a tissue-specific response or maladaption to the inherent biochemical lesion in the native liver, and possibly other organs. Our results indicate that modulating metabolism in the skeletal muscle &#x02013; by gene replacement or pharmacological means &#x02013; may represent an effective strategy to lower MMA levels and increase metabolic capacity in affected patients. Other disorders of intermediary metabolism that feature impaired branched chain aminoacid oxidation, such as propionic acidemia, might also benefit from these approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this report describes the construction and characterization of a new murine model of methylmalonic acidemia and its use to examine organ specific contributions to MMA production in the human condition in the post-transplant state. The targeted allele is null, designed for genomic engineering, and correctable by lentiviral transduction. The combined observations from the murine metabolite studies and patient investigations indicate that during homeostasis, a large portion of circulating MMA has an extra-heptorenal origin and likely derives from the skeletal muscle. Our studies suggest that modulating skeletal muscle metabolism may represent a strategy to increase metabolic capacity in methylmalonic acidemia as well as other organic acidurias. This mouse model will be useful for further investigations exploring disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions in methylmalonic acidemia, a devastating disorder of intermediary metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>MMA (methylmalonic acidemia), MUT (human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase), Mut (murine methylmalonyl-CoA mutase), <italic>mut</italic><sup><italic>o </italic></sup>(vitamin B12 non-responsive methylmalonic acidemia), MEF (murine embryonic fibroblasts), CMV (cytomegalovirus), LKT (liver-kidney transplantation), eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein), 2-MC (2-methylcitrate), BCAA (branched chain amino acids)</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RJC produced reagents, executed experiments, interpreted data and drafted the manuscript; JS coordinated patient care, performed clinical studies and analysis and helped draft the manuscript; HF produced recombinant ES cells; MT performed experiments; SS performed metabolite analysis and interpretation; RA performed metabolite analysis and interpretation; KHK produced recombinant ES cells and helped draft the manuscript; HHK aided with data analysis and helped draft the manuscript; CPV conceived the knock-out model, produced reagents, executed experiments, performed clinical studies, interpreted data and drafted the manuscript.
