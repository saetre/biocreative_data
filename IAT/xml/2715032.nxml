We find that after helminth infection, or immunization with helminth antigens, reactive lymphoid organs of 4get IL-4/GFP reporter mice contain populations of IL-4/GFP-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that display the TFH markers CXCR5, PD-1, and ICOS. These TFH cells express the canonical TFH markers BCL6 and IL-21, but also GATA3, the master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation. Consistent with a relationship between Th2 and TFH cells, IL-4 protein production, reported by expression of huCD2 in IL-4 dual reporter (4get/KN2) mice, was a robust marker of TFH cells in LNs responding to helminth antigens. Moreover, the majority of huCD2/IL-4&#x02013;producing Th cells were found within B cell follicles, consistent with their definition as TFH cells. TFH cell development after immunization failed to occur in mice lacking B cells or CD154. The relationship of TFH cells to the Th2 lineage was confirmed when TFH cells were found to develop from CXCR5<sup>&#x02212;</sup> PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after their transfer into naive mice and antigen challenge in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Th1 and Th2 lineages of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have long been considered to play a pivotal role in helping B cells to class-switch Ig isotype synthesis, with the canonical Th1 and Th2 cytokines IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 playing critical roles in promoting the production of IgG2a and IgG1/IgE, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Recently, it has become clear that a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, termed T follicular helper (TFH) cells largely on the basis of their localization in B cell follicles, plays a crucial role in B cell response induction. TFH cells express CXCR5, and thus migrate toward CXCL13, which is made in follicular centers of secondary lymphoid organs, where they help B cells by producing IL-21, which promotes isotype switching and plasma cell differentiation (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>]). However, the lineage relationship of TFH cells to the other Th subsets remains unclear. Transcriptional profiling of TFH cells has revealed a distinct repertoire of expressed genes that demarcates them from Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), and TFH cells have been reported to differentiate normally in vivo where conditions for Th1, Th2, or Th17 cell development are impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that TFH cells constitute a distinct lineage. However, in other cases, TFH cells have been shown to make the Th2 signature cytokine IL-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and it is thus possible that a relationship exists between Th2 and TFH cells.</p><p>Th2 cells and their associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 play a crucial role in promoting host survival during infection with parasitic helminths that have tissue-dwelling phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and they can mediate expulsion of intestinal helminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Importantly, Th2 responses are associated with the development of strong antibody responses, particularly IgG1 and IgE, which in certain helminth infections are implicated in resistance to reinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In contrast to model antigens delivered in adjuvants, we have been studying Th2 response development and regulation in parasitic helminth infections; helminths and antigens derived from them inherently induce Th2-polarized responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Our work here employs <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, the causative agent of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease affecting &#x0003e;200 million people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Our studies in this area have, on the basis of surface marker expression, identified subsets of Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), one of which is notable for its expression of PD-1, a molecule that has been reported to be expressed by TFH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Here, we investigate whether PD-1<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells are, in fact, TFH cells. We find that in mice infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, or in mice immunized with an extract of schistosome eggs, TFH cells comprise a major component of the Th cell response and express genes that would normally be considered markers of Th2 cells. We hypothesized that TFH cells and associated Th effector populations could share certain attributes and might reflect various stages of differentiation within the same lineage. Consistent with this, our data suggest TFH cells can differentiate from within the Th2 lineage, and that this process is germinal center dependent.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Th2 response-inducing stimuli promote the development of PD-1<sup>+</sup> IL-4&#x02013;expressing cells in draining LNs that appear in parallel with germinal center development</title><p>In an analysis of the development of hyporesponsiveness within the Th2 cell population during chronic schistosomiasis, we previously noted the presence of a PD-1<sup>+</sup> subset of Th2 cells that is absent in naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). To examine whether this population is present in other Th2-biased settings, we searched for PD-1<sup>+</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in 4get mice immunized with schistosome eggs (the life stage of this parasite that most strongly induces the Th2 response; reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>]), an extract thereof (serum egg antigen [SEA]), or OVA in alum. In each case, we observed distinct populations of PD-1<sup>+</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, which constituted 30&#x02013;60% of the overall IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population within responding LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>PD-1<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells and germinal center B cells develop in response to helminth infections or immunization with Th2 response inducing antigens/adjuvants.</bold> (A) 4get mice were infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> or immunized s.c. with the antigens indicated.

For these experiments, we focused on SEA-immunized mice. A distinguishable population of SEA-induced IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was evident by 3 d after immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). PD-1<sup>+</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were first apparent at 3 d, but the size of this population, and the levels of PD-1 expression within it, increased thereafter to reach a maximum at 14 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>); at this time, we found &#x0003e;150,000 PD-1<sup>+</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells per draining LN. In contrast, &#x0003c;500 cells with these characteristics were present in popliteal LNs of naive mice.</p><p>Recent work has indicated that PD-1 is a marker for TFH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). A principal function of TFH cells is their interaction with B cells to promote germinal center formation and Ig isotype switching. IgG1 and IgE are produced at high levels during helminth infections and, for <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, have been implicated in protection against reinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We reasoned that if PD-1&#x02013;expressing IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells are TFH cells, germinal center development kinetics should parallel the emergence of the PD-1<sup>+</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population. Indeed, a population of FAS<sup>+</sup> PNA<sup>+</sup> B220<sup>+</sup> germinal center B cells appeared 3&#x02013;5 d after immunization with SEA, and grew thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Consistent with the kinetics of the expansion of the germinal center B cell population, SEA-specific IgG1 titers developed between days 6 and 9 after immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>IL-4 production is a marker for TFH cells that develop in a Th2 setting</title><p>The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> suggested that the IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells that also expressed PD-1 could constitute a population of TFH cells. To explore this possibility, we made use of 4get/KN2 mice in which IL-4&#x02013;competent Th2 cells are marked by GFP and IL-4&#x02013;producing cells additionally express huCD2 on their surface. These animals were immunized with SEA, and 14 d later, draining LN cells were stained for PD-1 and the TFH markers CXCR5 and ICOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). We found PD-1 and CXCR5 to be coexpressed by a distinct population of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations, PD1<sup>+</sup> CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells were ICOS<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Remarkably, this population was also defined by the expression of huCD2, the marker of IL-4 protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Reciprocal gating revealed that huCD2<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed the TFH markers PD-1 and CXCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) and ICOS (not depicted). Thus, in mice mounting a Th2 response to helminth antigens, the great majority of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that are producing IL-4 within reactive LNs express canonical markers of TFH cells. In contrast, we were unable to find IL-4 producing TFH cells in nondraining LNs (unpublished data). To further define the PD-1<sup>+</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we purified them by FACS and used real time RT-PCR to assess expression of the TFH marker genes BCL-6 and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). We found both genes to be highly expressed in PD-1<sup>+</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (TFH cells) compared with PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). In contrast, and consistent with the expression of GFP in both populations, IL-4 transcripts were found in TFH cells and in PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Consistent with the IL-4 data, transcript levels of GATA3, which is considered the master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), were comparable in TFH and PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from SEA-immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Moreover, both TFH and PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed IL-5 and IL-13 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090303/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). In the system studied, TFH cells did not express ROR&#x003b3;t, T-bet, or Foxp3 (Fig. S2).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>IL-4 is a marker for TFH cells that develop in a Th2 setting.</bold> (A) Reactive LN CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells from SEA-immunized 4get/KN2 mice were stained for the TFH markers CXCR5, PD-1, and ICOS, and for huCD2 (as a marker of IL-4 production).

We next examined the phenotype of IL-4&#x02013;producing cells within peripheral sites of antigen deposition by analyzing cells isolated from the granulomatous lesions surrounding schistosome eggs in the livers of infected 4get/KN2 mice. Within this nonlymphoid effector site, huCD2<sup>+</sup> IL-4&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not express the TFH marker PD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) or CXCR5 (not depicted).

To explore whether the huCD2<sup>+</sup> IL-4&#x02013;producing TFH cells in 4get/KN2 mice immunized with SEA are localized to B cell areas, we used immunohistochemistry on sections of LNs to identify huCD2<sup>+</sup> cells in spatial relationship to T cell zones, B cell follicles, and germinal centers. Examining draining LNs 14 d after immunization, we found huCD2-expressing cells, which by definition are largely TFH cells in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), to be localized almost exclusively to B cell follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), with few huCD2<sup>+</sup> cells in T cell zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Moreover, most of these cells within B cell follicles were associated with germinal centers, identified by PNA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). These data strongly concur with those obtained by flow cytometry, in showing a close correlation between huCD2 expression/IL-4 production and TFH cell attributes, such as CXCR5/ICOS/PD-1 expression and the localization to germinal centers within B cell follicles. IL-4&#x02013;competent GFP<sup>+</sup> Th cells in SEA-immunized 4get mice were present in T cell zones and in B cell follicles throughout reactive LNs (unpublished data). With the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, these observations suggest that Th cells that are competent to make IL-4, but not actively producing it, are not resident in B cell follicles.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>In SEA-immunized mice, IL-4&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells localize to the B cell follicles of reactive LNs.</bold> Sections of reactive popliteal LNs from SEA-immunized mice.

To evaluate this possibility, we analyzed B cell&#x02013;deficient &#x000b5;MT and JHD mice, as well as mice that lack CD154, in which B cells are present but germinal centers fail to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In initial experiments, we directly immunized &#x000b5;MT/4get mice, and used flow cytometry to measure TFH cell development in draining LNs 14 d after sensitization.

The absence of TFH cells in the immunized &#x000b5;MT/4get mice was not the result of a failure to prime a Th response, as these animals possessed a robust population of SEA-induced CXCR5<sup>&#x02212;</sup> PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and C</xref>).

We repeated these experiments using JHD mice, again finding that TFH cells failed to emerge after immunization with SEA in the absence of B cells (unpublished data).

In our system, TFH cells possess canonical attributes of Th2 cells. Further, kinetic analysis of TFH cell development showed that the percentages of IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in draining LNs remained relatively constant (&#x0223c;16% of total CD4<sup>+</sup> cells) from day 7&#x02013;14 after SEA immunization, whereas the contribution of PD-1<sup>+</sup> TFH cells to this population doubled from 21&#x02013;42% over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), suggesting that TFH cells develop from within the PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population. To formally address this, we FACS-purified IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that lacked the classical TFH markers CXCR5 and PD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>) from the pooled draining LNs of Thy1.1 4get mice that had been immunized 5 d earlier with SEA. These cells were then adoptively transferred into congenic Thy1.2 recipient BALB/c mice or JHD mice, which were then immediately immunized with SEA. After 7 d, Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> donor cells in the reactive LNs of recipient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>) were phenotyped for the expression of the TFH markers CXCR5 and PD-1. This experimental design allowed us to determine whether TFH cells differentiate from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that have already expressed IL-4, the signature cytokine of Th2 cells because Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> TFH cells implicitly must arise from the donor IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. It also allowed us to ask whether B cells are important for this transition. We found that in WT recipients, &#x0223c;20% of the detectable Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> donor cells had become CXCR5<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup>, although they continued to express GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, F and G</xref>). In contrast, donor cells were IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup>, but remained CXCR5<sup>&#x02212;</sup> PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> after transfer into B cell&#x02013;deficient recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, F and G</xref>). Few transferred cells were found in pooled nondraining LNs, indicating that homing to the reactive LNs and conversion to TFH cells is driven by local exposure to antigen and/or inflammation (not depicted). Together, our results indicate that IL-4 competent Th cells have the capacity to differentiate into TFH cells and are consistent with a crucial role for germinal centers in TFH cell development in the context of a Th2 response.</p><p>A remarkable feature of our findings is that essentially all IL-4&#x02013;producing cells in reactive LNs are localized to B cell follicles and express canonical TFH markers. Similar observations were made in mice infected with the intestinal helminth <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> and are reported by King and Mohrs in a report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) on pp. <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="206" page="1001" id="d32e961" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="19380638" ext-link-type="pubmed">1001</related-article> of this issue. Data from King and Mohrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) show that TFH cells play a key role during helminth infection by producing the IL-4 that is essential for a productive B cell response. However, the observations from both studies raise questions about the IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that are found in reactive LNs outside the B cell follicles and are not producing IL-4 cytokine. The observation that these cells express Gata3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 indicates that they have committed to the Th2 lineage, and we assume that they possess the potential to become either TFH cells within the LN or migrate to peripheral tissues to perform Th2 effector cell functions. Data from a study by Reinhardt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) using different infection models, which was published while this paper was under consideration, essentially support these conclusions. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether individual CXCR5<sup>&#x02212;</sup> PD-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-4/GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have the potential to become either a Th2 effector cell or a TFH cell.</p><p>Despite recent work showing that TFH cells fail to express IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-17 (or IL-4) in mice immunized with antigen in CFA, a protocol that drives Th1 and Th17 response development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), our data support the view that TFH cells do not represent an independent lineage, but rather arise as a specialized subset from within the dominant Th2 lineage. Data published as this paper was under consideration suggest that a similar relationship might exist between other types of Th cells and TFH cells because, in a setting where Th1 cells develop, IFN-&#x003b3; production in reactive LNs was shown to be largely restricted to TFH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>Although our experiments suggest that a Th2 cell can become a TFH cell, they do not address whether this conversion is a final step in a linear pathway. Instead, there may be plasticity between TFH and Th2 cells, wherein different signals might regulate the reversible transition between the two states. Indeed, there is evidence from other systems that Th subset cells that might have previously been considered to be terminally differentiated do, in fact, retain plasticity in terms of which cytokines they are able to produce, and that this plasticity is heavily influenced by local environmental factors produced in response to the sensitizing antigen/infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Our data indicate that B cells and CD154 are necessary for cells within the Th2 lineage to acquire TFH attributes, and thus support the view developed by Haynes et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) that germinal centers are critical for TFH cell development.</p><p>IL-21, which is expressed strongly by TFH cells, is crucial for TFH cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). IL-21 has also been reported to be produced by, and important for the development of, Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Indeed, a recent study showed a role for IL-21R in the full expression of the Th2 cell response in schistosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). However, a distinction was not drawn between Th2 and TFH cells in these reports, and in light of the data presented here, it seems that at least some of the observations made previously could reflect analyses of mixed Th2/TFH populations. We have a similar concern about our previous interpretation of the finding that CD154 is essential for mice to survive infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). We attributed this increased susceptibility to reduced Th2 responses. However, reinterpretation of the data in the context of the observations reported here raises the possibility of an important role for TFH cells in the prevention of the development of severe disease after infection with this parasite. Ongoing studies are addressing this issue.</p><p>The diseases caused by helminths are often chronic and debilitating, and at this time the only recourse available is chemotherapy, which must be delivered repeatedly. Vaccination is arguably the best solution to eradicate helminthiases and other infectious diseases. Studies designed to increase understanding of the origin, development, and function of TFH cells should provide insights into the optimal requirements for antibody production, and as such, hold promise for accelerating developments in this vital area.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Animals, infections, and immunizations.</title><p>4get (C.129-<italic>Il4tm1Lky</italic>/J) and 4get/KN2 mice were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). 4get/&#x000b5;MT mice on a B6 background were bred at Trudeau Institute.
