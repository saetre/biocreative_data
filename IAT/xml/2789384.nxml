The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is required for EC function during angiogenesis. Although <italic>in vitro</italic> studies implicate ERK1 and ERK2 in endothelial cell survival, their precise role in angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> remains poorly defined. <italic>Cre/loxP</italic> technology was used to inactivate <italic>Erk1</italic> and <italic>Erk2</italic> in endothelial cells during murine development, resulting in embryonic lethality due to severely reduced angiogenesis. Deletion of <italic>Erk1</italic> and <italic>Erk2</italic> in primary endothelial cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation and migration, but not in increased apoptosis. Expression of key cell cycle regulators was diminished in the double knockout cells, and decreased DNA synthesis could be observed in endothelial cells during embryogenesis. Interestingly, both Paxillin and Focal Adhesion Kinase were expressed at lower levels in endothelial cells lacking <italic>Erk1</italic> and <italic>Erk2</italic> both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, leading to defects in the organization of the cytoskeleton and in cell motility. The regulation of Paxillin and Focal Adhesion Kinase expression occurred post-transcriptionally.

Surprisingly, cell apoptosis was not affected by ablation of <italic>Erk1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> in EC as predicted by previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. A plausible explanation for this discrepancy might be that in the previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies upstream components of the RAS/ERK pathway were targeted, in particular RAF and MEK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Cheresh1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Alavi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Mavria1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the actual role of ERK1/2 in apoptosis was inferred but not directly tested in these studies. This raises the possibility that targets of RAF and MEK other than ERK1/2 may be involved in the observed affects of the pathway on EC survival.</p><p>EC-specific deletion of <italic>Erk2</italic> in the <italic>Erk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> background resulted in embryonic lethality at E9.5-E10.5 and the viable EC-DKO E9.5 embryos were smaller than the control littermates. We speculate that the smaller size of EC-DKO embryos is due to <italic>Tie2-Cre</italic> mediated deletion of <italic>Erk2</italic> starting at E7.5 in the yolk sac EC, and at E8.5 in the embryonic aorta and common atrial chamber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Kisanuki1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, reduced blood vessel development in the embryo proper likely contributes to the smaller size and in combination with defective heart development results in lethality of the EC-DKO mutant embryos.</p><p>One mechanism underlying ERK1/2 function in EC involves regulation of the expression of FAK and Paxillin. ERK1/2 have been most frequently placed downstream of Src-FAK signaling in several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Schaller1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Schlaepfer1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, but our results demonstrate that ERK1/2 can also act upstream to regulate FAK and Paxillin expression. One hypothesis to account for this result is that ERK activation by tyrosine kinases is required for efficient expression of FAK and Paxillin, which in turn leads to amplification of ERK signaling when integrin/adhesion pathways are engaged. An alternate mechanism by which ERK can function upstream of these signaling proteins is that, as demonstrated in hepatocytes, ERK phosphorylation of Paxillin at Ser83 enhances formation of Paxillin/FAK complexes in focal adhesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Ishibe1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Liu2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the drastic reduction in FAK and Paxillin expression in EC lacking ERK1/2 don't allow the potential role of this mechanism in EC to be tested. The precise mechanism by which ERK regulates FAK and Paxillin remains to be determined, but could involve selective regulation of translation of these proteins, including potentially through the regulation of specific microRNAs, or by affected turnover rates for these proteins.</p><p>FAK signaling has been linked to EC proliferation as well as migration, suggesting that the loss of FAK expression could account for the major phenotypes observed when ERK1/2 are ablated in EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Shen1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Gilmore1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in two separate studies <italic>Tie2-Cre</italic> mediated conditional knockout of <italic>Fak</italic> resulted in a less severe phenotype than reported here, with embryonic lethality occurring at E11.5 or later, and without angiogenic phenotypes at E9.5 when defects are obvious with <italic>Erk1</italic>/2 deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Braren1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008283-Shen2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, EC apoptosis was identified as a major phenotype in both of these previous studies. Thus, other targets of ERK1/2 in addition to FAK and Paxillin likely account for the overall phenotype observed.</p><p>The microarray analysis suggests that the nuclear function of ERK1/2 is also critical for their action in EC. For example, a number of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, in particular Cyclins, CDKs and c-Myc are among ERK targets that can account for cell proliferation defects in the double mutant mice. Similarly, the expression of several extracellular proteases (e.g., MMPs) involved in promoting cell motility and angiogenesis were downregulated while extracellular matrix components that inhibit angiogenesis (e.g., Thrombospondins 1 and 2) were increased by the absence of ERK1/2. Therefore, the ability of ERK1/2 to activate an assortment of transcription factors, either directly by phosphorylation or indirectly through activation of their expression, is key to their function in EC.</p><p>In summary, these <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrate a redundant role for <italic>Erk1</italic> and <italic>Erk2</italic> in EC, and indicate that targets at both the cell membrane and in the nucleus account for the ability of these kinases to regulate EC functions that are necessary for embryonic angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008283.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>EMBRYONIC LETHALITY IN Erk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; Erk2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Tie2Cre DOUBLE MUTANT MICE</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008283.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008283.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>EMBRYONIC LETHALITY IN <italic>Erk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; Erk2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Tie2Cre</italic> DOUBLE MUTANT MICE</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008283.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008283.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>MICROARRAY EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008283.s003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008283.s004"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>LIST OF GENES DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED (4 FOLD OR GREATER) IN DKO EC BY MICROARRAY ANALYSIS</p><p>(0.32 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008283.s004.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008283.s005"><label>Table S5</label><caption><p>LIST OF GENES DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN DKO AORTIC AND LUNG EC BY CONFIRMED BY qPCR ANALYSIS</p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008283.s005.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008283.s006"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>(A) Schematic illustration of the breeding strategies to obtain <italic>Erk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;Erk2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Tie2-Cre</italic> mutant embryos.
