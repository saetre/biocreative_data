Germ cells in the murine ovary enter meiotic prophase during embryogenesis, whereas germ cells in the embryonic testis arrest in G0 of mitotic cell cycle and do not enter meiosis until after birth. In mice, retinoic acid (RA) signaling has been implicated in controlling entry into meiosis in germ cells, as meiosis in male embryonic germ cells is blocked by the activity of a RA-catabolizing enzyme, CYP26B1. However, the mechanisms regulating mitotic arrest in male germ cells are not well understood. <italic>Cyp26b1</italic> expression in the testes begins in somatic cells at embryonic day (E) 11.5, prior to mitotic arrest, and persists throughout fetal development. Here, we show that Sertoli cell-specific loss of CYP26B1 activity between E15.5 and E16.5, several days after germ cell sex determination, causes male germ cells to exit from G0, re-enter the mitotic cell cycle and initiate meiotic prophase. These results suggest that male germ cells retain the developmental potential to differentiate in meiosis until at least at E15.5. CYP26B1 in Sertoli cells acts as a masculinizing factor to arrest male germ cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and prevents them from entering meiosis, and thus is essential for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of male germ cells during embryonic development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinoic acid (RA) is a vitamin A derived signaling molecule that regulates cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. RA-mediated signaling is controlled in embryonic tissues through coordinated regulation of RA synthesis and catabolism. Synthesis is catalyzed by a family of retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3) that irreversibly oxidize retinal to form RA, while catabolism is facilitated by a family of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP26A1, CYP26B1 and CYP26C1), which convert RA to more polar, inactive metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-Niederreither1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-Pennimpede1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the present study, we have specifically knocked out <italic>Cyp26b1</italic> in Sertoli cells from E15.5 onwards. We observed induction of <italic>Stra8</italic> expression and initiation of meiosis in germ cells as early as E16.5, and a loss of germ cells by P0, resulting in abnormal seminiferous tubules devoid of germ cells in adult testes. Furthermore, it was observed that some male germ cells at E16.5 exit from G0 and enter the cell cycle, a process that normally does not occur until a few days after birth. These results suggest that male germ cells retain the ability to commit to male or female development until at least E15.5. CYP26B1 in Sertoli cells during embryonic development keeps male germ cells undifferentiated by arresting them in mitotic quiescence and preventing them from meiotic entry until after birth, when mitosis resumes and meiosis initiates as required for spermatogenesis.</p><p>It has been proposed that all germ cells enter meiosis cell autonomously unless prevented from doing so by an unidentified meiosis-preventing substance (MPS) in the embryonic testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-McLaren1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Germ cells enter meiotic prophase during embryogenesis not only in ovaries, but also in non-gonadal regions where germ cells escape the inhibitory influence of MPS. When male germ cells from E10.5 or E11.5 gonads are cultured with disaggregated embryonic lung cells, they enter meiotic prophase, but germ cells from older male embryos (E12.5 and E13.5) do not enter meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-McLaren1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these observations, it has been proposed that the decision in germ cells to commit to a male or female pathway is made between E12.5 and 13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-McLaren1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Previously, it was shown that in <italic>Cyp26b1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> fetuses, male germs cells enter meiosis at E13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-MacLean1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In the <italic>Cyp26b1<sup>SC&#x02212;/SC&#x02212;</sup></italic> model that we have described, CYP26B1 activity is not lost until between E15.5 and E16.5, when male germ cells arrest in G0 and are normally already committed to develop along a male pathway. However, in <italic>Cyp26b1<sup>SC&#x02212;/SC&#x02212;</sup></italic> fetuses, meiotic germ cells are detected at E16.5, suggesting that male germ cells at E15.5 still retain the potential to initiate meiosis and that the commitment of these cells to the male developmental pathway is reversible. These observations demonstrate that CYP26B1 functions as a MPS to prevent male germ cells from entering meiosis in various stages of development, and without its inhibitory influence, male germ cells enter meiosis even though they are already committed to the male developmental pathway. Altogether, these observations suggest that entry into meiosis is the result of an inductive program subject to RA signaling, rather than a cell-intrinsic event.</p><p>Importantly, we find that <italic>Cyp26b1<sup>SC&#x02212;/SC&#x02212;</sup></italic> male germ cells exit from G0 and re-enter the mitotic cell cycle. In mice, germ cells within the developing gonad undergo sexually dimorphic cell cycles between E12.5 and E15.5. This developmental switch is dependent on the sex of the somatic cells, rather than the sex chromosome constitution of the germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-McLaren1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been proposed that a masculinizing factor(s) produced by somatic cells direct male germ cells to arrest in G0 of the cell cycle instead of entering the meiosis as female germ cells do at the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-McLaren1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that <italic>Cyp26b1<sup>SC&#x02212;/SC&#x02212;</sup></italic> male germ cells exit from G0 and re-enter the mitotic cell cycle is significant, as it shows that CYP26B1 activity in Sertoli cells not only prevents meiosis in germ cells, but is also required for maintaining mitotic arrest in the developing testes, suggesting that CYP26B1 (due to its RA-catabolizing activity) is a candidate masculinizing factor. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that male germ cells at E15.5 and older retain the ability to continue through the mitotic cell cycle and enter meiotic prophase in response to RA signaling. Thus, CYP26B1 activity in Sertoli cells keeps male germ cells undifferentiated during embryonic development. It has been reported that RA promotes the proliferation of both cultured PGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-Koshimizu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and embryonic male germ cells , but has no effects on the somatic cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-Livera1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We have provided <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that male germ cells must remain in an RA-depleted state to enter mitotic arrest. In the mouse testes, germ cells arrest in G0 of the cell cycle between E12.5&#x02013;E15.5, which coincides with the expression of <italic>Cyp26b1</italic> in the male gonad. Germ cells remain in mitotic quiescence until shortly after birth when mitosis is resumed as required for spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-Nagano1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This timing corresponds with testicular expression of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>, as ALDH1A2 is first detected in the developing testis at birth, and levels increase postnatally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007501-McLaren2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, these results suggest that RA signaling may also play a role in maintaining the mitotic activity in both PGCs and undifferentiated spermatogonia in postnatal testis.</p><p>In the embryonic testes, the ALDHs and CYP26B1 act as a source and sink for RA. It has been proposed that RA is synthesized in the mesonephros by ALDH1A enzymes, and diffuses into adjacent cells until reaching Sertoli cells where it is catabolized by CYP26B1. This process is essential for germ cell maturation, as an RA-depleted environment is required for the entry of male germ cells into mitotic arrest and thus prevents germ cells from entry into meiotic prophase. CYP26B1 in Sertoli cells directs male germ cells to develop along a male pathway (mitotic quiescence) and maintains the undifferentiated state of the male germ cells from E11.5 onward. However, the absence of CYP26B1 in Sertoli cells enables endogenous levels of RA to rise in the testes at a time when they should be low or absent. Subsequently, germ cells exit the G0 stage to re-enter the cell cycle and initiate meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007501-g007">Figure 7</xref>). At this point, we hypothesize that a factor is released from Sertoli cells that either directly, or indirectly initiates apoptosis of germ cells. The identity of such a factor(s), and mechanisms underlying initiation of apoptosis are currently under investigation.</p><fig id="pone-0007501-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007501.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the role of CYP26B1 in maintaining male germ cells in an undifferentiated state during embryogenesis.</title><p>In wild-type gonads, germ cells exhibit sex-specific divergence during embryogenesis as male germ cells enter mitotic arrest, while female germ cells enter mitosis followed by meiosis.
