Here, we demonstrate that depletion of the evolutionarily conserved minichromosome maintenance helicase-binding protein ETG1 of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> resulted in a stringent late G2 cell cycle arrest. This arrest correlated with a partial loss of sister chromatid cohesion. The lack-of-cohesion phenotype was intensified in plants without functional CTF18, a replication fork factor needed for cohesion establishment. The synergistic effect of the <italic>etg1</italic> and <italic>ctf18</italic> mutants on sister chromatid cohesion strengthened the impact on plant growth of the replication stress caused by <italic>ETG1</italic> deficiency because of inefficient DNA repair.

It is of utmost importance that the damaged DNA is repaired before cells proceed through mitosis, because the genome holds all the information required for correct development. DNA replication results in two identical sister chromatids. A trick applied by cells to overcome damaged DNA is homologous recombination, using the undamaged copy of the sister chromatid as a template to repair the damaged one. This process is aided by keeping the two sister chromatids in close proximity after the replication process by the deposition of a molecular glue, called cohesin. In the present work, we identified the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ETG1 protein as a novel evolutionarily conserved replication factor that is needed for maintaining the sister chromatids physically aligned. In plants without ETG1, DNA damage builds up due to inefficient DNA repair. As a consequence, cell division is impaired with a huge impact on plant growth, highlighting the importance of cohesin for the correct development of eukaryotic organisms. Cohesion phenotypes observed upon the depletion of the orthologous human ETG1 protein indicate equally prominent roles for this particular factor during mammalian development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For one single cell to generate two cells, numerous events must be coordinated, in particular, faithful DNA replication and partitioning of the sister chromatids to each of the daughter cells. It is of utmost importance to ensure the error-free duplication of the replicated DNA during each cell cycle, preventing the transmission of potentially harmful mutations to the daughter cells, which otherwise might result in developmental defects or even cancer. DNA damage and replication errors might originate from DNA stress provoked by either exogenous (such as &#x003b3;-irradiation and UV-B light) or endogenous (such as metabolic byproducts) sources. The latter include the replication process itself that necessitates the cooperation of many different proteins in a highly complex manner. Errors arisen during replication are preferentially repaired through homologous recombination between the replicated sister chromatids that lay in close proximity thanks to cohesion. This sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by cohesin that consists of four subunits in budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>): two structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins, designated SMC1 and SMC3, and two non-SMC subunits, designated SCC1 (also known as Mcd1/Rad21) and SCC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Guacci1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Peters1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. SMC1 and SMC3 are self-folded by antiparallel coiled-coil interactions, creating a rod-shaped molecule with an ATP-binding &#x0201c;head&#x0201d; at one end and a &#x0201c;hinge&#x0201d; domain at the other. The two SMC subunits associate with each other through their hinge domains, producing a V-shaped dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Melby1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Anderson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Cohesin forms a tripartite ring in which the open-V structure of the SMC heterodimer is closed by the simultaneous binding of the N- and C-terminal regions of SCC1 to the head domains of SMC3 and SMC1, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Haering1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cohesin is deposited on unreplicated chromatin in a reaction requiring ATP hydrolysis by the SMC heads and the cohesin-loading complex SCC2/SCC4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Ciosk1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Weitzer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas cohesion loading occurs well before S phase, the process of cohesion establishment is intimately connected with DNA replication. In budding yeast, cohesion depends on an acetyltransferase, designated Eco1/Ctf7, that acetylates two lysine residues on the ATPase head domain of SMC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-nal1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Zhang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

This model is supported by the observation that cohesion defects are caused by mutations in replisome components, e.g., the DNA polymerase &#x003b1;-binding protein Ctf4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Miles1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Hanna1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the Chl1 helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Petronczki1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and RFC components, such as Ctf18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Mayer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In budding yeast and humans, Ctf18 associates with Rfc2, Rfc3, Rfc4, and Rfc5 to form the RFC<sup>Ctf18</sup> complex, which, in turn, couples with two additional subunits, Dcc1 and Ctf8, creating a heptameric complex with the PCNA that has a loading and unloading activity and plays a role in sister chromatid cohesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Hanna1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Bylund1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>E2F transcription factors control the expression of many genes involved in DNA replication and DNA repair.

To gain more insight into this defective cell cycle, we examined transcript levels of 22,750 genes by using Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip arrays. Triplicate batches of proliferating first leaves of 9-day-old wild-type and two independent <italic>etg1-1</italic> and <italic>etg1-2</italic> mutant plants were harvested for total RNA preparation.

Strikingly, of the 195 upregulated genes, 103 (53&#x00025;) showed an expression peak during mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000817.s006">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000817.s007">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000817.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

This model is supported by co-regulated expression of <italic>ETG1</italic> and other genes involved in cohesion establishment, such as <italic>ECO1</italic>/<italic>CTF7</italic>, <italic>CHL1</italic>, and <italic>CTF18</italic> that are expressed during S phase and, interestingly, are transcriptionally upregulated in <italic>E2Fa-DPa</italic>-overexpressing plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Vandepoele1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. A role in cohesion establishment is also suggested by the synergetic effect between <italic>etg1</italic> and <italic>ctf18</italic> on sister chromatid cohesion. Additionally, the human MCM-BP was found to associate preferentially with chromatin during G1/S and S, corresponding with the timing of cohesion establishment, whereas cohesion loading occurred immediately after formation of the nuclear envelope in telophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Sakwe1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Gerlich1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these results imply that ETG1 functions during S phase for cohesion establishment and that it represents a novel important link between DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion. As ETG1 is part of the MCM complex, it is not unlikely that the MCM subunits contribute to cohesion establishment as well, however, but until now, no such role has been reported for MCMs in yeasts and mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Impaired sister chromatid cohesion enhances pre-mitotic arrest after DNA damage</title><p>Cohesion is essential after replication to allow homologous recombination repair of DNA DSBs that might have arisen by genotoxic impact directly or indirectly by interference of excision repair with replication-mediated gaps. In fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>), the cohesion component SCC1/RAD21 was first identified in genetic screens for mutants that are hypersensitive to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Birkenbihl1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although CTF18 is necessary for sister chromatid cohesion, the corresponding knockout plants are viable and develop normally, without any significant effect on cell cycle progression. These data indicate that mild chromosome cohesion defects (up to 40&#x00025; of sister chromatid separation) are not that critical for cell cycle progression and plant development. However, the more pronounced cohesion deficiency in the <italic>etg1 ctf18</italic> double mutant has a strong impact on plant growth: leaf size is severely reduced and root growth is inhibited as a consequence of restricted cell division. This phenotype correlates with an increased loss of sister chromatid cohesion and a strong increase in the expression of DNA damage response genes. While in the <italic>etg1</italic> single mutants the developmental disturbance caused by endogenous DNA stress is weak, in the <italic>etg1 ctf18</italic> double mutant, the synergetic effect on development indicates that cohesion of the sister chromatids is highly important for correct DNA repair. We assume that the <italic>etg1 ctf18</italic> double mutants are less efficient in correct DNA repair by homologous recombination because of the reduced sister arm cohesion, reminiscent of the <italic>smc5/6</italic> mutants that are hypersensitive to genotoxins and defective in homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000817-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This model is supported by slower DSB repair kinetics in <italic>ETG1</italic>-deficient seedlings than in wild-type plants and by their increased sensitivity to genotoxins. The presumed disturbance of homologous recombination repair in <italic>etg1 ctf18</italic> plants might enforce a more stringent checkpoint than that in the single <italic>etg1</italic> mutants, thus inhibiting growth by strongly reduced cell division. These results underscore the importance of cohesion for the development of DNA damage-suffering plants.
