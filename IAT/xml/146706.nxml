Prp18 is dispensable for splicing of precursor RNAs in which the interval between the branch point and 3'splice site is &#x0003c;12 nt. This resembles the requirement for another second step factor, Slu7. Excess Slu7 protein can bypass the need for Prp18 in vitro , suggesting that Slu7 and Prp18 function in a concerted manner. Physical interaction between Slu7 and Prp18 was demonstrated by using the two-hybrid assay. Deletion mutants of SLU7 were tested for their ability to support growth of a slu7 null strain. Removal of 199 amino acids from the N-terminus of the 382 amino acid Slu7 protein did not affect cell viability at 25 degrees C. A more extensive N-terminal deletion of 221 amino acids was lethal, as was a C-terminal deletion of 47 amino acids. Deleted versions of Slu7 were also tested for interaction with Prp18 in the two-hybrid system. We define a segment of Slu7 from residue 200 to 224 that is necessary for interaction with Prp18.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
