To further characterize the function of imp7 in HIV-1 replication we generated cell lines stably depleted for imp7 and used them in conjunction with infection, cellular fractionation and pull-down assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Imp7 depletion impaired HIV-1 infection but did not significantly affect HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac), or equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). The lentiviral dependence on imp7 closely correlated with binding of the respective integrase proteins to imp7. HIV-1 RTC associated with nuclei of infected cells with remarkable speed and knock down of imp7 reduced HIV-1 DNA nuclear accumulation, delaying infection. Using an HIV-1 mutant deficient for reverse transcription, we found that viral RNA accumulated within nuclei of infected cells, indicating that reverse transcription is not absolutely required for nuclear import. Depletion of imp7 impacted on HIV-1 DNA but not RNA nuclear import and also inhibited DNA transfection efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although imp7 may not be essential for HIV-1 infection, our results suggest that imp7 facilitates nuclear trafficking of DNA and that HIV-1 exploits imp7 to maximize nuclear import of its DNA genome. Lentiviruses other than HIV-1 may have evolved to use alternative nuclear import receptors to the same end.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Akin to other lentiviruses, HIV-1 is able to infect primary non-dividing cells, such as tissue macrophages, microglial cells and CD4+ memory T-cells as well as cells artificially arrested in the cell cycle (reviewed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). These primary cells represent key in vivo targets for virus transmission and AIDS pathogenesis, hence the importance of understanding how HIV-1 can traverse the intact nuclear envelope.</p><p>Biochemical studies have shown that the ability of HIV-1 to infect non-dividing cells depends on the active nuclear import of its intracellular reverse transcription/pre-integration complex (RTC/PIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and both viral and cellular elements have been implicated in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Chimeric viruses, in which HIV-1 Gag has been replaced with Moloney murine leukaemia (MLV) Gag, infect cell cycle-arrested cells with very low efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Within MLV Gag, the CA protein appears to be the dominant negative regulator of nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. MLV can only infect cycling cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and its RTC retains a significant portion of CA protein until after nuclear entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, HIV-1 mutants that do not shed enough p24 CA are defective in nuclear import and integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based on this evidence, it has been proposed that appropriate shedding of CA protein from the RTC/PIC is a key step for nuclear import of HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. HIV-1 capsid exceeds the maximal functional diameter of the nuclear pore complex, hence it is likely that uncoating takes place before RTCs can be imported into nuclei.</p><p>Additional viral elements implicated in HIV-1 nuclear import include p17 MA, Vpr, integrase (IN), and the central polypurine tract (cPPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The cPPT is a second origin of DNA plus strand synthesis located within <italic>pol </italic>that, after completion of reverse transcription, results in a short (approximately 100 nt) stretch of triple stranded DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. When included in HIV-1 vectors, the cPPT increases nuclear accumulation of vector DNA 2- to 10-fold (reviewed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]), although there is controversy on the magnitude of its effect in the context of wild-type virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Recent data suggest that formation of the triple stranded DNA stretch promotes nuclear transport of HIV-1 PICs by inducing timely uncoating of the viral capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Following uncoating, the HIV-1 RTC, containing viral nucleic acids as well as cellular and viral components, must engage one or more cellular pathways for nuclear import. Several cellular factors have been shown to participate in the trafficking RTCs to the nucleus, including fasciculation and elongation protein zeta-1 (FEZ1), Nup98, Nup358, Nup153, importin 7 (imp7), and transportin 3/transportin SR-2 (tnp3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, recent evidence indicated that HIV-1 can recruit a newly discovered cellular pathway for retrograde transport of tRNAs in mammalian cells to promote RTC nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Imp7 is a nucleocytoplasmic transport protein closely related to imp&#x003b2; and its N-terminus binds to RanGTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Imp7 serves as an import factor for some ribosomal proteins, the glucocorticoid receptor, zinc finger protein EZI, ERK MAP kinase, activated Smads, and, as a heterodimer with imp&#x003b2;, histone H1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moreover, nuclear import of the adenoviral DNA-binding protein pVII and of HIV-1 integrase (IN) and Rev is supported by imp7 and other importins, whereas adenovirus type 2 nuclear import depends on the imp7/imp&#x003b2; heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Using in vitro nuclear import assays, Imp7 was shown to promote nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs in a Ran- and energy-dependent manner. Furthermore, transient knock down of imp7 by siRNA inhibited HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], although the latter observation has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Double imp7 knock down in both viral producer cells and target cells was required for maximal inhibition of viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Imp7 was shown to bind to the C-terminal region of HIV-1 IN, and mutant viruses unable to interact with imp7 were defective in both reverse transcription and nuclear entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>To gain a better understanding of HIV-1 nuclear trafficking, we established cells stably knocked down for imp7 and performed infection and biochemical fractionation assays. Our results indicate that HIV-1, but not HIV-2, SIVmac or EIAV, recruits imp7 via interaction with IN to maximise viral DNA nuclear import. Our data argue that the closely related lentiviruses may have evolved different and probably redundant nuclear import mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the function of imp7 in HIV-1 infection, HeLa polyclonal cell lines with a stable imp7 knock down (KD) were generated by shRNA expressed from a lentiviral vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Control cells were similarly generated that harboured a shRNA targeting the <italic>Discosoma corallimorpharian </italic>DsRed mRNA (DxR). The control shRNA effectively knocked down expression of the DxR protein in control experiments, indicating that it was indeed recruited into the RISC complex and was functional (not shown). As an additional control for specificity, polyclonal imp7 KD cells were back complemented with an imp7 cDNA harbouring two silent mutations making it resistant to the imp7 shRNA. Cells were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against imp7 and Ran (as a loading control). Imp7 KD in HeLa cells was robust and specific and back complementation with the mutant cDNA effectively restored imp7 expression. Effective imp7 KD was also achieved in human lymphocytic Jurkat cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of stable imp7 knock down (KD) cells</bold>.

The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> show that imp7 KD resulted in a specific inhibition of HIV-1 vector infection. Similar results were also obtained with a different HIV-1 derived vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], as well as with a full length HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub>&#x00394;env virus that expressed GFP in place of Nef (not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Intriguingly, when challenged with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] imp7 and DxR KD cells were equally infected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). HIV-2 infection was very modestly impaired in imp7 KD cells (not shown). These unexpected results indicated that cell toxicity or other non-specific side effects could not explain the lower levels of HIV-1 infection observed in imp7 KD cells. Several imp7 KD HeLa clones were examined. Imp7 protein levels in these clones ranged from approximately 15% to 6% of those in the parental cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), and a correlation between reduction in HIV-1 infection and levels of imp7 KD was apparent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). The efficiency of HIV-1 vector infection was also lower in imp7 KD compared to control DxR KD Jurkat cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that HIV-1 infection was specifically impaired in imp7 KD cells.</p><p>Inhibition of HIV-1 infection in imp7 KD cells was maximal between MOIs of 0.01 and 0.06 and was partially overcome at an MOI &#x02248; 1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). To examine if imp7 in the producer cells was important, virus was produced in imp7 KD or DxR cells, normalized for RT activity and used to infect imp7 KD or DxR target cells at an MOI of 0.05. In agreement with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], the virus produced in imp7 KD cells had a lower relative infectivity compared to virus produced in DxR cells. However the difference in infectivity between the two viruses did not reach statistical significance in imp7 KD target cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><sec><title>Cell cycle arrest does not influence HIV-1 infection efficiency in imp7 KD cells</title><p>Imp7 may be required to promote RTC/PIC nuclear translocation only when the nuclear envelope is present. Hence in the experiments shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, HIV-1 might have accessed the nucleus in mitotic cells when the nuclear envelope was dissolved, independently from imp7. To test this possibility, cells were treated with aphidicolin to block progression of the S-phase. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that exposure to the drug inhibited accumulation of cells in the S-phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Cell-cycle arrest increased susceptibility of the cells to infection with HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIVmac (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Importantly, the relative difference in HIV-1 infection efficiency between DxR and imp7 KD cells observed in cycling cells was maintained following cell cycle arrest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, infectivity of SIVmac and HIV-2 were not affected in imp7 KD cells in either condition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of imp7 KD on HIV-1 infection is independent of cell-cycle arrest</bold>.

Imp7 was shown to bind HIV-1 IN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and the mutations affecting this interaction resulted in viruses defective for reverse transcription and nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], supporting its functional relevance. Hence several lentiviral INs were examined in pull down assays to test their ability to interact with imp7. GST-imp7 was immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads and the IN proteins from HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVmac, EIAV, and bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) were tested. GST-LEDGF<sup>326&#x02013;530</sup>, containing the IN binding domain (IBD) of LEDGF/p75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], the host factor displaying broad affinity for INs of lentiviral origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and GST were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. In agreement with previously reported results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] GST-Imp7 efficiently pulled down HIV-1 IN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In contrast, although copious amounts of all lentiviral INs were recovered with GST-LEDGF<sup>326&#x02013;530</sup>, the INs from HIV-2, SIVmac, and BIV only weakly interacted with Imp7, and no detectable interaction was observed for EIAV IN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Importantly, none of the IN proteins were recovered with GST- loaded resin, confirming specificity of the observed interactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Essentially identical results were obtained in a reverse pull down experiment using hexahistidine-tagged INs immobilized on Ni-NTA agarose beads and untagged Imp7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The interaction between nuclear import receptors and their cargo are generally mediated by charge-charge interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Concordantly, the imp7-IN interaction was sensitive to the ionic strength of the pull down buffer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). However, while in the presence of 400 mM NaCl the interaction of imp7 with HIV-1 IN was still detectable, pull down of HIV-2 IN was abolished (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Overall, the infection phenotype of different lentiviruses in imp7 KD cells correlated well with the affinity of their respective INs for imp7 as detected in the pull down experiments (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). These results strongly support the functional relevance of HIV-1 IN interaction with imp7 and explain why lentiviruses other than HIV-1 are not impaired in imp7 KD cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Lentiviral IN affinity for imp7 correlates with infection phenotype in imp7 KD cells</bold>.

Cell cycle arrest clearly reduced the efficiency of DNA transfection in all cell types but the reduction was significantly more pronounced in imp7 KD cells compared to DxR cells.

Furthermore, our data suggest that lentiviruses may have evolved different mechanisms for nuclear trafficking of their RTCs.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support our conclusions. HIV-1 infection was impaired in stable imp7 KD cells only at earlier time points and the effect was specific because back complementation of imp7 rescued the phenotype. Moreover, the lower level of HIV-1 infection in imp7 KD cells could not be simply explained by cell toxicity or other off-site effects because SIVmac and HIV-2 were not affected. The different behaviour of HIV-1 and HIV-2 or SIVmac in imp7 KD cells was surprising and raised the possibility that these viruses may use distinct pathways for nuclear trafficking.</p><p>Imp7 has been shown to bind to HIV-1 IN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and mutations that abolish this interaction were shown to inhibit both reverse transcription and nuclear entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, because of the pleiotropic effects that IN mutations have on virus replication, it was not possible to firmly conclude that the imp7-IN interaction was responsible for the observed phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We found that HIV-2 and SIVmac infection was not significantly impaired in imp7 KD cells and this prompted us to test if their INs were able to bind to imp7. Our pull down interaction assays confirmed that imp7 does indeed specifically bind HIV-1 IN. Side-by-side comparisons showed that the interaction is significantly weaker with HIV-2 and SIVmac INs, while EIAV IN did not show detectable binding. Remarkably, the apparent binding affinity closely correlated with the infectivity of the lentiviruses on imp7 KD cells, strongly suggesting that the imp7-IN interaction is critical for imp7 function. Overall the available evidence points to the existence of varied and possibly redundant pathways for nuclear import of lentiviruses.</p><p>To test if imp7 KD inhibited RTC nuclear transport, we performed fractionation assays to separate nuclei from cytoplasm following MLV and HIV-1 vector co-infection and analysed viral DNA distribution by Taqman PCR. These studies demonstrated that HIV-1 DNA associates with the nuclei of infected cells with remarkable speed and efficiency in both cycling and cell cycle-arrested cells. Indeed, at 24 h post infection 90&#x02013;95% of HIV-1 DNA was found in the nuclear fraction. In contrast, nuclear accumulation of MLV DNA was slower in cycling cells and was further inhibited in cell cycle-arrested cells. Importantly, imp7 KD appeared to inhibit nuclear accumulation of HIV-1 DNA.</p><p>These results were confirmed in a subsequent set of experiments in which HIV-1 infection and nuclear import (by means of 2LTR detection) were followed over time. HIV-1 infection was reduced in imp7 KD cells compared to DxR cells at 24 h post-infection and the difference was statistically significant. However the reduction was more modest at later time points and was not statistically significant. Viral DNA copy number gradually dropped in time in both cell types, presumably due to dilution and degradation of un-integrated DNA forms. However, 2LTRs circular viral DNA copy number was lower in imp7 KD cells compared to DxR cells. Inhibition of infection was maximal at 24 h post-infection in imp7 KD cells but the difference in 2LTRs viral DNA levels between imp7 KD and control cells was maximal at 48 h. It is possible that accumulation of 2LTRs viral DNA takes longer than integration and viral gene expression, which would explain the time lag. It is also possible that accumulation of 2LTR DNA forms requires a threshold of viral DNA in the nucleus. Together the results of these two sets of experiments strongly suggest that imp7 KD perturbs the kinetics of HIV-1 DNA trafficking to the nucleus. These results reconcile apparently discordant observations on the effect of imp7 KD in HIV-1 infection. In one study where no difference was found between imp7 KD and control cells, FACS analyses were performed 96 h after HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], too late a time point.</p><p>Our experimental approach, based on stable imp7 KD cells, has certain limitations. Imp7 is one of the most abundant nuclear import proteins, reaching a concentration of approximately 3 &#x003bc;M in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Hence even an effective and stable KD would presumably leave enough imp7 to support essential cell functions. Residual imp7 in the KD cells may at least in part explain the relatively modest inhibition of HIV-1 infection. It should be noted that a similarly modest inhibition of HIV-1 infection was also observed in HeLaP4 cells with a stable KD of LEGDF/p75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], by now an established co-factor for virus integration (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]). However, imp7 may not be essential for HIV-1 infection and additional host factors most likely participate in RTC nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that imp7 could mediate nuclear import of DNA by facilitating passage of the charged and hydrophilic molecule through the central channel of the nuclear pore complex, which appears to act as hydrophobic and size-selective phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. A corollary to this hypothesis is that reverse transcription of the viral genome may be necessary for nuclear import. This was tested using an HIV-1 mutant unable to reverse transcribe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This mutant virus buds normally and can effectively saturate TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>rh</sub>-mediated restriction, indicating that it has no major post-entry defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. A cell fractionation procedure was devised to reduce contamination of nuclei to minimal levels and to eliminate material associated with the external layer of the nuclear envelope. We were also careful to isolate intact nuclei by sedimentation in a sucrose cushion before extracting nucleic acids. A significant amount of viral RNA was found in the nuclei shortly after infection. Although we cannot exclude that some viral RNA was still bound to the external nuclear membrane, the fairly large quantity of viral RNA and the undetectable levels of cyclophilin A mRNA in the nuclear fraction suggested that the signal represented bona fide nuclear import.</p><p>Our results are consistent with previous studies that detected rapid nuclear accumulation of Visna virus, HIV-1 and avian sarcoma and leucosis viruses RNA genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Presently it is unclear if nuclear import of HIV-1 RNA has any physiological significance. Rapid trafficking of viral RNA into the nucleus also suggests that HIV-1 uncoating may take place before completion of reverse transcription.</p><p>Importantly, imp7 KD reduced nuclear accumulation of viral DNA but not viral RNA. Consistent with the possibility that imp7 primarily facilitates translocation of DNA across the nuclear pore complex, plasmid DNA transfection efficiency was also reduced in imp7 KD cells. The defect was specific because it was reversed upon imp7 back-complementation and was sequence independent. Cell cycle-arrest clearly inhibited DNA transfection but imp7 KD had an additive effect. Taken together these experiments suggested that HIV-1 might exploit imp7 to maximise the nuclear import rate of its DNA genome.</p><p>Based on our results, we propose a model whereby nuclear import factors need to be specifically recruited onto the viral DNA within the HIV-1 RTC. Thus HIV-1 has evolved the ability to recruit imp7 via IN. This promotes trafficking of the viral DNA across the nuclear pore complex by modifying the overall charge of the nucleoprotein complex. Lentiviruses other than HIV-1 must have evolved the ability to recruit alternative import factors that have properties similar to imp7 and can also promote DNA and/or RNA nuclear import. It will be interesting to know which factor(s) substitute for imp7 in the other lentiviruses.</p><p>Why has HIV-1 evolved a very efficient and rapid nuclear import mechanism and what could be the physiological outcome of delaying this process? Our data showed that imp7 KD reduced HIV-1 infection equally in cycling or cell cycle-arrested cells. This suggests that normally HIV-1 does not enter the nucleus via two independent pathways, one for cells in interphase and another for mitotic cells, in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Thus, HIV-1 may use the same mechanism to enter the nucleus of non-dividing as well as dividing cells, such as activated CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Delayed nuclear import may be almost inconsequential in long-lived cells, like terminally differentiated macrophages, where the RTC would have sufficient time to reach the nucleus before the infected cell dies. In contrast, rapid import may be critical in short-lived cells, such as activated CD4+ T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], where a 24-h delay may make the difference between productive and aborted infection. Because activated CD4+ T cells are the main target for HIV-1 infection in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], we propose that, even if not essential for infection, host cell factors contributing to maximise the rate of HIV-1 infection may play a role in AIDS pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and virus production</title><p>HeLa and 293 T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco Labs, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) (Helena Bioscience, Newcastle, UK) and 2 mM glutamine at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) transformed with pGEX6P-imp7 were grown in shake flasks in Lennox LB medium at 30&#x000b0;C to an A<sub>600 </sub>of 0.9&#x02013;1.0 before addition of 1% glycerol, 2.5% ethanol, and 0.25 mM IPTG. Following 5-h induction at 15&#x000b0;C, the cells were harvested and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. To isolate GST-imp7, thawed bacterial paste was lysed by sonication in core buffer (250 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), supplemented with 10 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM PMSF. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and GST-imp7 was captured on glutathione sepharose (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted in core buffer supplemented with 50 mM reduced glutathione or incubated with human rhinovirus 14 3C protease to release untagged imp7. The proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a preparative Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) operated in 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, concentrated using a Centriprep-YM3 device (Millipore), supplemented with 10 mM DTT and 10% glycerol and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. C-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged and non-tagged IN proteins were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>].</p><p>Pull down assays were done according to published procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] with slight modifications. For GST pull-downs, 10 micrograms BSA and 10 micrograms untagged IN protein were added to ice-cold suspension of 15 &#x003bc;l glutathione sepharose (settled resin volume) carrying immobilized GST or a GST fusion protein (2 mg/ml) in 800 &#x003bc;l pull down buffer 1 (PDB1: 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 50 mM Bis-Tris propane-HCl, pH 7.45).

The proteins eluted by boiling in Laemmli SDS sample buffer were resolved in tris-glycine 11% SDS PAGE gels. Concentration of NaCl in PDB1 was adjusted as explained in the results section. For His6-tag pull down assays, 10 ug of each BSA, Imp-7, and a C-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged IN protein were incubated with 20 ul Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) suspended in 800 ul of pull down buffer 2 (PDB2: 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 35 mM imidazole, 0.1% NP-40, 50 mM Bis-Tris propane-HCl, pH 7.45) for 5 h at 4&#x000b0;C with gentle rocking.
