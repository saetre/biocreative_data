Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome (OHS) are allelic disorders of copper transport caused by defects in a X-linked gene (ATP7A) that encodes a P-type ATPase that transports copper across cellular membranes, including the <italic>trans-Golgi </italic>network. Genetic studies in yeast recently revealed a new family of cytoplasmic proteins called copper chaperones which bind copper ions and deliver them to specific cellular pathways. Biochemical studies of the human homolog of one copper chaperone, ATOX1, indicate direct interaction with the Menkes/OHS protein. Although no disease-associated mutations have been reported in ATOX1, mice with disruption of the ATOX1 locus demonstrate perinatal mortality similar to that observed in the <italic>brindled </italic>mice (<italic>Mo</italic><sup>br</sup>), a mouse model of Menkes disease.

We screened for ATOX1 mutations in two patients with classical Menkes disease phenotypes and one individual with occipital horn syndrome who had no alterations detected in ATP7A, as well as an adult female with chronic anemia, low serum copper and evidence of mild dopamine-beta-hydroxylase deficiency and no alterations in the ATOX1 coding or splice junction sequences were found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we characterized the genomic structure of the human copper chaperone ATOX1 to facilitate screening of this gene from genomic DNA in patients whose clinical or biochemical phenotypes suggest impaired copper transport.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Copper is an essential trace element that plays a role in cellular respiration, antioxidant defense, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, connective tissue biosynthesis and pigment formation and is critical for the survival of all living organisms. A family of eukaryotic cytoplasmic proteins termed copper chaperones that bind copper ions and deliver them to specific cellular pathways was discovered recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The first copper chaperone, ATX1, is a cytosolic protein involved in an tio xidant defense and iron uptake, in addition to copper trafficking in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The human homolog of ATX1 was isolated by screening a liver cDNA library, and named HAH1 (for human ATX homolog 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This gene maps to chromosome 5q32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and is referred to synonymously as ATOX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Biochemical studies of ATOX1/HAH1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] indicate copper-dependent interaction between this protein and two human copper-transporting ATPases. These latter molecules, encoded by the genes ATP7A and ATP7B, function to convey copper through the secretory pathway of cells including the<italic>trans-Golgi </italic>network. Mutations in ATP7A and ATP7B produce characteristic clinical phenotypes: Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome, allelic X-linked recessive traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive trait, respectively.</p><p>Interestingly, disruption of the murine homolog (Atox1) results in perinatal mortality and biochemical abnormalities similar to that observed in the <italic>brindled </italic>mice (<italic>Mo</italic><sup>br</sup>), a mouse model for classical Menkes disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These cumulative findings suggest that the ATOX1 and ATP7A gene products are each integral to mammalian copper transport, and that mutations in either could produce similar clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Because of our interest in the molecular basis of such phenotypes, we determined the intron-exon boundaries of ATOX1 to enable mutation screening from genomic DNA, and analyzed splice junctions and coding sequences in several relevant patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Genomic structure of ATOX1 and mutation analysis</title><p>We identified 4 exons and 3 introns in ATOX1 that span a genomic distance of approximately 16 kb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The apparent translation start codon is located in exon 1, and the termination codon in exon 3. We used 5' and 3' random amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to obtain the 5' and 3' ends of the ATOX1 cDNA sequence. We identified 3 splice donor and 3 splice acceptor sequences and did not characterize the 5' intron/exon boundary of exon 1 and the 3' exon/intron boundary of exon 4 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The 5' exon 1 sequence (untranslated) we obtained by 5' RACE is 60 bp shorter than the cDNA sequence initially described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The three introns in ATOX1 were 6764 bp (intron 1), 5255 bp (intron 2), and 3320 bp (intron 3). Exons 2 and 3 were 76 bp and 171 bp in length, respectively.

Genomic DNA was isolated from white blood cells or fibroblasts using the Wizard<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The studies were approved by the NICHD and NINDS Institutional Review Boards.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR amplification</title><p>Oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification were designed from the published cDNA sequence of the human homologue of ATOX1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Each PCR reaction contained a final concentration of 1X optimized PCR buffer J (Invitrogen), 500 nM each PCR primer, 200 &#x003bc;M dNTP and 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies Inc.). 200 ng of genomic DNA was added to the total volume of 50 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction. These PCR reactions were then denatured for 5 minutes at 94&#x000b0;C in a Perkin-Elmer 9700 thermocycler; followed by 35 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 55&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds and 72&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes; then with a final extension of 72&#x000b0;C for 7 minutes. Oligonucleotide primer sequences used to amplify ATOX 1 coding sequences and splice junctions are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>5' and 3' RACE</title><p>The rapid amplification of 5' and 3' ends of cDNA (RACE) was performed with Marathon-Ready&#x02122; cDNA kit (Clontech), which is essentially an uncloned library of adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA. Both 5'-and 3'-RACE reactions were primed with an internal gene-specific primer (GSP) and the Marathon adaptor primer (AP). The adaptor-ligated cDNA does not contain a binding site for the AP. During the first round of thermal cycling, the GSP is extended to the end of the adaptor, creating an AP binding site at the 5' (or 3') terminus of the cDNA. In subsequent cycles, both the AP and the GSP can bind, allowing exponential amplification of the cDNA of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Long PCR</title><p>To amplify the intronic regions of ATOX1, long PCR amplifications were performed in volume of 50 &#x003bc;l reactions by using the Expand Long Template PCR system kit (Roche). Each reaction contained 2.5 U Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases, 1X supplied buffer with 2.25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 500 &#x003bc;M dNTP, 300 nM each forward and reverse primers and up to 500 ng genomic DNA. The reaction were optimized as follows: an initial denaturation for 2 minutes at 93&#x000b0;C, followed by 10 cycles of 93&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, 65&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds and alternated with 68&#x000b0;C for 4 minutes. For the next 20 cycles, the temperature profile was modified by the addition of increments of 20 seconds to each extension step at 68&#x000b0;C. A 7 minutes final extension period at 68&#x000b0;C was incorporated after the last cycle of long PCR reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA Sequencing</title><p>Sequence analysis was performed on an ABI 377 automated DNA sequencer at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health, DNA Sequencing Facility.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have read and approved the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank C.
