In contrast to APOBEC3G (A3G), APOBEC3A (A3A) has no effect on lentiviruses but dramatically inhibits replication of the parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV). To study the contribution of deaminase activity to the antiviral activity of A3A, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of A3A. By mutation of non-conserved residues, we found that regions outside of the catalytic active site contribute to both deaminase and antiviral activities. Using A3A point mutants and A3A/A3G chimeras, we show that deaminase activity is not required for inhibition of recombinant AAV production. We also found that deaminase-deficient A3A mutants block replication of both wild-type AAV and the autonomous parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM). In addition, we identify specific residues of A3A that confer activity against AAV when substituted into A3G. In summary, our results demonstrate that deaminase activity is not necessary for the antiviral activity of A3A against parvoviruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The APOBEC3 proteins constitute a family of seven cytidine deaminases. Cytidine deaminases are editing enzymes able to remove the amine group from cytidine in single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and RNA, converting it to uracil. APOBEC3 proteins have potent antiviral activity against retroviruses, retrotransposons, and DNA viruses. APOBEC3 generated high interest because of the ability of APOBEC3G (A3G) to inhibit HIV. APOBEC3A (A3A) is a member of the family that inhibits the human parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV) and the retrotransposon LINE-1. Parvoviruses are simple ssDNA viruses that do not require a retrotranscription step for their replication. In contrast to A3G, which is predominantly cytoplasmic, A3A is located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In addition, A3A consists of a single cytidine deaminase catalytic domain, whereas A3G has two. The dependence of the antiviral function on deaminase activity is controversial. In this study, we identify numerous A3A residues required for deaminase and antiviral activities. We show that A3A not only inhibits AAV but also the minute virus of mice (MVM). Importantly, we demonstrate that A3A does not require its deaminase activity to block the replication of both parvoviruses. Thus, exploiting the simplicity of parvoviruses together with the single-domain cytidine deaminase A3A, we are able to demonstrate that cytidine deaminase activity is not required for APOBEC3 mediated viral inhibition.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotes have evolved numerous innate immune defenses against invading pathogens.

The parvovirus genome consists of a linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule approximately 4.5 kb in length, with hairpin structures at both ends that function as origins for viral DNA replication. The genome contains two major ORFs that encode the nonstructural replication proteins (NS or Rep) and the structural capsid proteins (Cap). The family is divided into autonomous parvoviruses and dependoviruses, which require a helper virus for efficient replication and progeny production. The minute virus of mice (MVM) is an autonomous parvovirus while adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a dependovirus that uses adenovirus as a helper virus. In our previous studies we found that despite the absence of detectable AAV editing, mutations in conserved active site residues of A3A abrogated the antiviral activity against AAV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000439-Chen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A3A inhibition of parvovirus provides an attractive system in which to decipher the relative contribution of deamination and deaminase-independent mechanisms to antiviral activity.

Chimeric A3A/A3G proteins generated by exchanging divergent sequences demonstrate loss-of-function for A3A and gain-of-function for A3G. Our mutants also reveal residues in the linker and pseudoactive site domains that are important for deamination, target specificity and antiviral activities of A3A.

These results showed that the IVT generated protein was catalytically active and also suggested that A3A does not require a mammalian cellular co-factor for its catalytic activity. Analysis of the active site mutants in the IVT system showed that, consistent with previous studies, mutants in conserved active site amino acids (H70R, E72Q, C106S, and SPC) had lost deaminase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000439-Chen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000439-Bogerd1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

Immunoblotting confirmed that proteins of the expected size were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000439-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

Surprisingly, F75L also inhibited rAAV despite its lack of deaminase activity in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. The F75L protein is therefore a separation-of-function mutant of A3A that facilitates analysis of the relative contribution of the deaminase-dependent and -independent mechanisms to AAV inhibition. The double mutant FF7595LL did not inhibit rAAV production but was poorly expressed and showed altered cellular distribution.
