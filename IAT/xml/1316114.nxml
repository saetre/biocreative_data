In this report, we show that the ARS forms a complex <italic>in vitro</italic> with PABP, and two additional polypeptides of 63 and 105 kDa. The 63 and 105 kDa polypeptides were identified, as IMP1, an ortholog of chicken zip-code binding polypeptide, and UNR, a PABP binding polypeptide, respectively, by mass spectrometry of the ARS RNA affinity purified samples. Using a modified ribonucleoprotein (RNP) immunoprecipitation procedure we further show that indeed, both IMP1 and UNR bind to the ARS containing reporter RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although both IMP1 and UNR could bind independently to the ARS RNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, their RNA-binding ability was stimulated by PABP. Mutational analyses of the ARS show that the presence of four of the six oligo(A) regions of the ARS was sufficient to repress translation and the length of the conserved pyrimidine spacers between the oligo(A) sequences was important for ARS function. The ability of mutant ARS RNAs to form the PABP, IMP1 and UNR containing RNP complex correlates well with the translational repressor activity of the ARS. There is also a direct relationship between the length of the poly(A) RNAs and their ability to form a trimeric complex with PABP, and to repress mRNA translation. UV crosslinking studies suggest that the ARS is less efficient than a poly(A) RNA of similar length, to bind to PABP. We show here that the ARS cannot efficiently form a trimeric complex with PABP; therefore, additional interactions with IMP1 and UNR to form a heteromeric RNP complex may be required for maximal repression of PABP mRNA translation under physiological conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is a highly conserved, abundant and ubiquitous RNA-binding protein which preferentially associates with the 3&#x02032;-poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNA. PABP also interacts with other cytosolic proteins such as Rna15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), eIF4B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), eRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), Paip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), Paip2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), TcUBP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), UNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and poly(C)-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Almost all known functions of PABP are attributed to its ability to interact with the 3&#x02032;-poly(A) tract and to act as a scaffold for protein&#x02013;protein interactions. PABP contains four highly conserved RNA-binding domains (RBDs I&#x02013;IV) arranged in tandem at the N-terminus, followed by a less conserved proline-rich auxiliary domain of variable length at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The first two RBDs towards the N-terminus (RBD-I/II) exhibit preferential affinity for poly(A) RNA, whereas the RBDs towards the C-terminus (RBD-III/IV) show tropism for poly(U) RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The C-terminal region, which contains a highly conserved 74 amino acid-long PABC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), does not bind RNA but interacts with other polypeptides as well as promotes oligomerization of PABP on poly(A) RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>PABP has been implicated in global gene regulation both by stimulating translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and by enhancing mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). A popular hypothesis addressing the mechanism of translation stimulation focuses on the connection between the 3&#x02032;-poly(A) tail bound PABP and the 5&#x02032;-cap bound eIF4F holoenzyme. eIF4F is a ternary complex consisting of RNA-helicase eIF4A and 5&#x02032;-cap binding protein eIF4E, connected together by a central scaffold protein eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). According to this model, interaction between PABP and eIF4G results in mRNA circularization, thereby promoting recycling of terminating ribosomes from the 3&#x02032; end to the 5&#x02032; end for another round of translation initiation. The interaction between PABP and eIF4G has been reconstituted using purified components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), and has been demonstrated in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and wheat germ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) cell-free extracts. However, direct evidence that this interaction stimulates translation is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The essential role of PABP in mRNA translation has been confirmed recently by using a PABP depleted cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>Considering the significance of PABP in gene expression, controlling its cellular level may be critical. Available evidence suggests that the cellular level of PABP is regulated in a developmental or growth-dependent manner at the translational level. PABP mRNA is a member of the terminal oligopyrimidine track (TOP) containing mRNA family, which includes mRNAs that encode components of the protein synthesizing machinery. The long 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of PABP mRNA consists of at least two <italic>cis</italic>-acting translation control elements. The first control element TOP at the 5&#x02032;-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) is followed by a highly conserved A-rich autoregulatory sequence (ARS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The role of these <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in regulation of PABP expression is well established but not fully understood. Several mRNAs containing a 5&#x02032;-TOP sequence exhibit growth dependent translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Thus, the 5&#x02032;-TOP probably confers regulation of PABP mRNA translation in a growth-dependent manner to coordinate expression of components of the protein synthesizing machinery, whereas the ARS may be involved in constitutive control of the PABP level under all circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>Results of both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies suggest that the ARS of PABP mRNA is able to confer autoregulation of PABP expression by a negative feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Previous studies have shown that PABP interacts with the ARS region and addition of purified PABP to a cell-free system repressed translation of mRNAs containing the A-rich sequence in their 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Deletion of the ARS region from PABP mRNA abolishes its autoregulation, whereas addition of this region at the 5&#x02032;-UTR of a reporter gene represses its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). According to the current understanding, idling PABP represses translation of its own mRNA by binding to the ARS region, thereby stalling the movement of the 40S pre-initiation complex within the 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the C-terminal region of PABP, which is involved in protein&#x02013;protein interaction, is necessary for autoregulation of PABP mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). This implies that interaction between ARS bound PABP and other polypeptides may be an important aspect of translational control.</p><p>In the present study we have investigated whether other polypeptides besides PABP bind to the ARS region. The results presented here suggest that the ARS region specifically interacts with at least three core polypeptides, IMP1, PABP and UNR, to form a multi subunit autoregulatory ribonucleoprotein complex (ARC). IMP1 and UNR can bind independently to the ARS but their RNA-binding activity was stimulated by PABP. Therefore, the formation of a heteromeric complex may be responsible for the previously observed stalling of the 40S pre-initiation complex at a site near the ARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The 5&#x02032;-UTR region (nt 71&#x02013;131) of the human PABP cDNA (GeneBank ID <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Y00345">Y00345</ext-link>) corresponding to the ARS was cloned into appropriate plasmid vectors by using synthetic oligonucleotides.

The quality and quantity of the RNA was determined by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry, respectively. The level of a specific mRNA in the sample was determined by comparative real time RT&#x02013;PCR using Rotor-gene 3000 (Corbett Research, NSW, Australia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). An aliquot of total RNA (1 &#x000b5;g) was reverse transcribed at 50&#x000b0;C for 1 h in a total reaction volume of 25 &#x000b5;l by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and 150 ng random primers according to manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen).

HeLa cells (&#x02248;3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells) were treated with 1% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to crosslink the RNA and proteins of RNP complexes. Following the crosslinking, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 &#x000b5;g/ml leupeptin, 2 &#x000b5;g/ml aprotinin, 100 U RNasin (Promega) and 100 &#x000b5;g of <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA (pH 7.5)].

The sample was extracted once with phenol and once with chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol.

We have, therefore, examined whether PABP can act as a protein scaffold to form a multisubunit complex with the ARS region of its mRNA. The results of crosslinking of the ARS RNA and cellular proteins from HeLa cells by UV light show that at least four polypeptides of Mr 105, 72, 63 and 46 kDa bind to the ARS RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 5). Binding of these polypeptides was not seen in samples without the UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 1). To test the specificity of this interaction unlabeled competitor RNAs were used during the UV crosslinking. The results show that a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 7) or poly(A)<sub>50</sub> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 8) competed efficiently with the [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled ARS RNA for binding to these polypeptides. Whereas a 100-fold molar excess of an unrelated RNA of size similar to the ARS RNA derived from the transcription of an empty pGEM-T plasmid vector (Promega) was unable to compete with the [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled ARS RNA for binding to all four polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 6). To further examine whether the ARS binding polypeptides are also present in different cell types, UV crosslinking experiments were performed using mouse NIH3T3 and C2 cells, and human HEK293 cells. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4) show that similar polypeptides could be seen in all four crosslinking experiments.</p><p>To further examine the ARS RNP complex, we used RNA gel shift analyses. The results show that one major (ARC) and one minor RNP complex are formed with all four cell extracts tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5). The electrophoretic mobility shift of the [<sup>32</sup>P]ARS RNA was inhibited by unlabeled ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 7) or poly(A)<sub>50</sub> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 8) while the unrelated pGEM-T empty vector derived RNA failed to compete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 6). The ARC migrated considerably slower in the gel compared with the RNP complex formed by incubating ARS-RNA with purified PABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 11), which suggests that the ARC is a heteromeric complex. Further analyses using HeLa cell extracts show that formation of the ARC can be inhibited by depleting PABP from the extract with PABP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 9) but not by a GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 10). These results suggest that PABP plays an essential role in the formation of the heteromeric ARS-RNA&#x02013;protein complex.</p><p>As more than one polypeptide may be present in the RNP complex formed between the cellular proteins and the ARS RNA, we analyzed the polypeptide complements of this complex. The UV irradiated RNP complexes were resolved and extracted from an agarose gel and the presence of polypeptides bound to the ARS RNA was analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The results show that three polypeptides of Mr 105, 72 and 63 kDa were present in the slower migrating major complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 2). The faster migrating minor complex consisted of two of these three polypeptides which included the 72 and 63 kDa polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 3). These results suggest that a multimeric complex consisting of three different polypeptides can be formed with the ARS. It is not certain whether the minor complex was the dissociation product of the larger complex or represents an intermediate complex. Therefore, we investigated this possibility by analyzing the formation of these complexes at different incubation times. The results (not shown here) did not show any changes in the relative ratios between the two complexes. Therefore, the minor complex is likely a dissociation product of the ARC, which implies that the 105 kDa polypeptide was less tightly bound to the ARS RNA than the 72 and the 63 kDa polypeptides.</p><p>The ability of ARS to form homo-oligimeric complexes with purified PABP was further investigated by gel shift assays. The results show that in the presence of a limiting amount of PABP, ARS formed a monomeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5) whereas the poly(A)<sub>50</sub> RNA, which has approximately the same number of adenines as the ARS, under similar conditions formed predominantly a monomeric complex, but also formed significant levels of both dimeric and trimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;9). Also, as judged by the amount of radioactivity present in the RNP complex, PABP bound to poly(A)<sub>50</sub>, almost two times more efficiently than what was observed with the ARS RNA at all protein concentrations tested. RNAs with shorter stretches of adenine residues including poly(A)<sub>20</sub> and poly(A)<sub>13</sub> did not bind to PABP efficiently and could not form detectable levels of dimeric and trimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 10&#x02013;13 and lanes 14&#x02013;17, respectively). In a previous study formation of both dimeric and trimeric complexes with the ARS was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). However, in these studies PABP was present in several fold molar excess to that of the ARS RNA; under these conditions the formation of oligomeric RNP complex through PABP&#x02013;PABP interaction may be facilitated. Nevertheless, this group also reported formation of a predominantly monomeric ARS RNA&#x02013;PABP complex [Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes with 3.8 ng PABP] at a lower PABP concentration. Results of our studies, therefore, suggest that the slower migrating RNP complex of the ARS seen with the total HeLa cell extract consists of more than one polypeptide. This complex may more efficiently repress mRNA translation than PABP alone which predominantly forms a monomeric complex with the ARS RNA.</p><p>In addition to the gel shift assays, we compared the ability of the ARS and poly(A)<sub>50</sub> RNA to bind to PABP by UV crosslinking studies. The results show that under similar conditions poly(A)<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) binds to PABP almost two times more efficiently than the ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This was also evident in competition studies, as &#x0223c;2-fold more unlabeled ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;8 and triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) was required than that of the unlabeled poly(A)<sub>50</sub> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;14 and legend crosses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) to attain a similar level of inhibition of the binding of radioactively labeled ARS RNA to PABP. Similar competition studies of binding of radioactively labeled poly(A)<sub>50</sub> to PABP also show that the poly(A)<sub>50</sub> binds more tightly to PABP than the ARS, as more unlabeled poly(A)<sub>50</sub> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, legend circles or squares, respectively) was required for this competition, than what was necessary to obtain a similar level of competition with the radio labeled ARS RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, legend crosses or triangles, respectively). Also, in these binding studies using the labeled poly(A)<sub>50</sub>, the unlabeled ARS competed less efficiently than the unlabeled poly(A)<sub>50</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of polypeptides of the ARC</title><p>To identify the polypeptides of the ARC, we purified the ARS binding polypeptides by RNA-affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The results show that several polypeptides bind tightly to the ARS RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 2). Control experiments using the pGEM-T vector derived RNA ligand in affinity chromatography show that several of these polypeptides are probably non-specific RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 1). The polypeptides that are unique to the ARS RNA affinity chromatography are marked by arrows. A total of 14 ARS RNA specific polypeptides including the 105, 72, 63 and 46 kDa polypeptides that were seen in the gel purified ARC or UV crosslinking studies can be seen in the affinity purified material. As 10 of these polypeptides were not present in the gel purified complexes, it is likely that they were not authentic partners of the ARS-RNA. However, it is possible that these polypeptides bind to the ARS RNA through protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Since visualization of the polypeptides in the gel purified ARC or in the UV crosslinking samples depends on the presence of small fragments of covalently linked [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled RNA, this method may exclude polypeptides that are present in the RNP complex through their direct interaction with RNA-binding proteins. The affinity purified 72 kDa polypeptide was less abundant in the 2 M NaCl eluted fraction than other polypeptides. This was primarily due to the tight binding of the 72 kDa (PABP) to the ARS RNA. This polypeptide was present in relatively large quantities in the SDS eluted fraction (result not shown).</p><p>Among the 14 polypeptides binding specifically to the ARS RNA containing matrix we analyzed the 105, 72, 63 and 46 kDa polypeptides by mass spectrometry of tryptic digests since these were the only polypeptides that showed binding to the ARS RNA in UV crosslinking studies. The results of LC/MS/MS analyses are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>. As expected, the 72 kDa polypeptide was identified as PABP. The 63 kDa polypeptide is a known RNA-binding protein IMP1 and the 105 kDa polypeptide was identified as UNR, a known PABP interacting protein. The 46 kDa polypeptide was identified as &#x003b2;-actin. As &#x003b2;-actin and 11 other polypeptides were not present in the gel purified RNP complex, we considered them not to be the parts of a stable core complex and did not pursue investigating these polypeptides further.</p><p>To determine whether PABP, IMP and UNR polypeptides are present in the ARS-RNA protein complex, we tested the ability of PABP, IMP1 and UNR antibodies to bind to the ARC. The results of REMSA super-shift analyses show that both IMP1 and UNR antibodies were able to super-shift the ARC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). Both antibodies behaved similarly to that of the PABP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 5). The non-immunized serum was ineffective in the super-shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 3).</p><p>We further tested the ability of IMP1 and UNR to directly interact with the ARS RNA in <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays. The 6&#x000d7; His-tagged PABP, IMP1 and UNR were labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S] during expression in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The ability of purified radiolabeled proteins to bind ARS-RNA conjugated agarose beads was tested as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The results show that PABP binds to the ARS-agarose beads efficiently and this binding was resistant to 0.5 M NaCl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, lane 2). IMP1 alone was also able to bind to ARS-agarose beads almost as efficiently as PABP at physiological salt concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 5), but this binding was sensitive to 0.5 M NaCl, as very little binding of IMP1 to ARS-agarose beads at this salt concentration was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 3). UNR alone on the other hand showed a considerable lower binding ability to the ARS-agarose beads than that of either PABP or IMP1 at physiological salt concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 5). As controls, we used [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled total cell extract from non-transformed <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, lane 1), <italic>in vitro</italic> translated [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine labeled luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and B</xref>, lane 9) and purified [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled 6&#x000d7; His-tagged &#x003b2;-galactosidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, lane 10). No detectable binding of these polypeptides to the ARS-agarose beads was observed, which suggests that non-specific binding of polypeptides to the RNA was minimal under our experimental conditions. Therefore, the results of these binding assays suggest that both IMP1 and UNR could bind independently to the ARS RNA, albeit, with lower affinity than PABP. Similar pull-down studies with poly(A)<sub>50</sub>&#x02013;agarose beads did not show detectable binding to IMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 11) and UNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 11). Thus, a stretch of 50 adenine residues alone is not sufficient for binding IMP1 and UNR, the pyrimidine bases that separate the A-rich regions of the ARS must be present to form the correct binding site.</p><p>There is an apparent contradiction between the inability of IMP1 and UNR to bind to the poly(A)<sub>50</sub>&#x02013;agarose beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, lane 11) and the results of UV crosslinking studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) which showed that poly(A)<sub>50</sub> RNA competed with the binding of both 63 (IMP1) and 105 (UNR) kDa polypeptides to the labeled ARS RNA. A possible interpretation of this difference is that both IMP1 and UNR can make contact with the poly(A)<sub>50</sub> in presence of PABP in the total cell extract, and therefore, can compete with the ARS when present in several fold molar excess. However, this interaction is weak in absence of PABP; therefore, both proteins were removed from the poly(A)<sub>50</sub>&#x02013;agarose beads during the washing procedure. The inability of UNR to bind poly(A) RNA has also been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>We also tested whether PABP facilitates the binding of IMP1 and UNR to the ARS RNA. The results show that the presence of unlabeled PABP during the binding reaction stimulated binding of both IMP1 and UNR to the ARS-agarose beads in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;8). Maximum stimulation of binding to ARS-agarose was observed when &#x0223c;4-fold molar excess of PABP was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, lane 7). In the presence of PABP the binding ability of IMP1 and UNR to ARS RNA was similar since PABP had a greater stimulatory effect on the binding of UNR to the ARS RNA than that of the IMP1. PABP also stimulated binding of IMP1 and UNR to the ARS RNA at 0.5 M NaCl concentration (data not shown). Results of both gel supershift assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA&#x02013;protein binding studies, therefore, suggest that IMP1 and UNR are legitimate partners of the ARC, and PABP stabilizes their interaction with the ARS.</p></sec><sec><title>Formation of ARC and translational repression</title><p>To obtain insights into the role of ARC formation in repressing PABP mRNA translation, the effect of various mutations in the ARS region on the RNP complex formation and its ability to repress mRNA translation was examined. Altogether five mutant RNAs were used in our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The authentic ARS region of human PABP mRNA contains six oligo(A) rich regions which are separated by 3&#x02013;6 pyrimidine bases. The first mutant RNA tested for RNP formation by REMSA had four internal oligo(A) rich regions, one oligo(A) containing region from both the 5&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032; ends were deleted. This shorter ARS RNA (&#x00394;ARS-4) formed the same RNP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 3) as the wild-type ARS region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 2). Two additional mutant RNAs which had only the two oligo(A) regions at either the 5&#x02032; end (&#x00394;ARS-2L) or the 3&#x02032; end (&#x00394;ARS-2R) were unable to form the RNP complex similar to the wild-type RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). For both mutant RNAs, a low level of a slower migrating complex than the ARC was observed. This complex most likely contained different polypeptides than those found in the ARC since its formation was not competed by unlabeled wild-type ARS RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 10 and 11, respectively). Deletion of all six oligo(A)s from the ARS RNA and replacing them with mostly pyrimidine bases (&#x00394;ARS-0) also prevented ARC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: lane 6). The &#x00394;ARS-0 RNA formed two faster migrating complexes than the ARC. As formation of these two complexes was also not inhibited by unlabeled ARS RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 12), it is unlikely that they shared any polypeptides with the ARC. We also tested another mutant ARS RNA which had all six oligo(A) regions but the spacings between them were uniformly increased to 13 nt. This mutant ARS RNA (LS-ARS) also failed to form the ARC, instead it formed a significant level of a much faster migrating complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: lane 7). Again formation of this faster migrating complex was not inhibited by unlabeled ARS RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: lane 13), therefore, suggesting that this complex did not share any polypeptides with the ARC. The results of RNP formation by different mutant RNAs suggest that binding of IMP1, PABP and UNR to the ARS to form the ARC requires the presence of at least four stretches of oligo(A)s and also an appropriate length of spacer sequences between them, which is probably between 3 and 6 nt in length. The spacer length of 13 nt used in our studies was not suitable for ARC formation.</p><p>We also used these mutant ARS RNAs in UV crosslinking assays to detect the nature of bound polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The &#x00394;ARS-4 showed binding to 105, 72, 63 and 46 kDa polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>: lane 1) as seen previously with the wild-type ARS RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, mutant ARS RNAs with fewer oligo(A) stretches and increased spacer lengths between the oligo(A)s did not bind to these polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5). As the ability of mutated ARS RNA to bind 63 (IMP1), 72 (PABP) and 105 (UNR) kDa polypeptides were affected simultaneously it is likely that all three polypeptides bind to the ARS as a multimeric protein complex. These results also suggest that the IMP1 and UNR binding site are present within the 47 nt-long region of the &#x00394;ARS-4 RNA. Since poly(A)<sub>50</sub> can not bind IMP1 and UNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, lane 11), the conserved pyrimidine stretches between the oliog(A)s of the &#x00394;ARS-4 RNA are necessary to form the IMP1 and UNR binding site.</p><p>The physiological significance of RNP formation was examined by using expression of the normal or the mutant ARS containing GFP reporter gene. In all cases the mutant or the normal ARS sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) were placed at the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the GFP reporter gene derived from the pEGFP-N3 expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Analyses of the GFP polypeptide levels in transiently transfected HeLa cells by western blotting show that the ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 1) or the &#x00394;ARS-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 2) containing constructs did not express high levels of GFP. In contrast, replacing the wild-type ARS by one of the mutant ARS represented either by &#x00394;ARS-2L, &#x00394;ARS-2R, &#x00394;ARS-0 or LS-ARS in our constructs restored high levels of GFP expression. The GFP expression level in &#x00394;ARS-2L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 3) and &#x00394;ARS-2R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lane 4) containing transcripts were similar to what was observed in cells transfected with the parent GFP-N3 construct lacking the ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>: lane 7). The GFP level in cells transfected with &#x00394;ARS-0 and LS-ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6, respectively) was a little higher than that of the control cells (GFP-N3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 7). This increase was probably due to insertion of pyrimidine nucleotides in the ARS. As transfection efficiency controls we co-transfected cells with a GFP construct that lacked the ARS and produced a slightly longer protein owing to translation of the sequences within the multiple cloning site (pEGFP-C1, Clontech). Almost equal levels of this longer GFP-C1 were produced in cells transfected with the different reporter constructs. The GFP-N3 levels in all experiments were corrected for differences in loading and transfection efficiencies using &#x003b2;-actin and GFP-C1 levels, respectively.</p><p>Additional transfection studies using constructs expressing the reporter GFP mRNA with either a poly(A)<sub>13</sub>, poly(A)<sub>20</sub> or a poly(A)<sub>50</sub> containing region at its 5&#x02032;-UTR were performed to correlate the translational repression by the ARS and poly(A) tracts of different length. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) show that the GFP level in cells expressing poly(A)<sub>13</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 3) and poly(A)<sub>20</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 4) containing mRNA was almost 50% less than the control GFP-N3 mRNA expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 2). Almost 90% reduction of GFP level was observed in cells expressing poly(A)<sub>50</sub> containing reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 5). The presence of full-length ARS at the 5&#x02032;-UTR was, however, significantly more effective than the poly(A)<sub>50</sub> in preventing GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 6).</p><p>We then determined whether the reporter mRNA levels in cells transfected with different ARS containing constructs were similar. In earlier studies, we showed that presence of the ARS in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of a reporter &#x003b2;-gal mRNA repressed its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In these studies we observed that the same level of the reporter mRNA can be detected by real-time RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As internal controls to monitor the transfection efficiencies the cells were co-transfected with a pCMV-SPORT-&#x003b2;-gal plasmid (Invitrogen). The GFP mRNA levels were normalized by the level of the &#x003b2;-gal mRNA. Since earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) using the sucrose density gradient profile of the ARS containing reporter mRNA had established that the translation of the reporter mRNA is repressed by the ARS, we did not perform similar sucrose gradient analyses of the mutant ARS containing transcripts. The results of analysis of the mRNA levels show that similar levels of GFP mRNA were present in cells transfected with different constructs.</p><p>Taken together the results of GFP protein level and mRNA level measurements strongly suggest that while the ARS or &#x00394;ARS-4 containing mRNAs were translationally repressed, the mRNAs containing the mutated &#x00394;ARS-0, LS-ARS, &#x00394;ARS-2L and &#x00394;ARS-2R were not repressed. Thus, there is good correlation between the inability of the mutant ARS to form the ARC and repress mRNA translation. Also the result of GFP polypeptide and mRNA levels in cells expressing poly(A)<sub>13</sub>, poly(A)<sub>20</sub> and poly(A)<sub>50</sub> containing mRNAs suggest a direct relationship of the length of the poly(A) tract with the formation of multimeric complexes, and ability to repress translation when placed at the 5&#x02032;-UTR of a reporter mRNA.</p><p>Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) were performed to determine if IMP1 and UNR bind to the ARS region of the reporter GFP mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. HeLa cells were transfected with either the wild-type or the ARS containing pEGFP-N3 reporter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and 24 h after transfection, the RNA&#x02013;protein interaction was stabilized <italic>in situ</italic> by formaldehyde treatment. The RNP complex was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies and the presence of GFP reporter mRNA in the sample was analyzed using RT&#x02013;PCR. The results of RIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) show that the ARS containing GFP reporter mRNA was specifically precipitated by the IMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 2) and UNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 3) antibodies, whereas the same antibodies failed to precipitate the wild-type GFP reporter mRNA that did not contain ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lanes 8 and 9, respectively). The PCR analyses of samples without reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lanes 5 and 6) or RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of samples treated with RNase (results not shown) revealed no amplification of the target RNA sequence. Also, the presence of GFP reporter mRNA was not detected in samples immunoprecipitated using rabbit pre-serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, Lanes 4, 7 and 10). Thus, the results show that IMP1 and UNR can bind specifically to the ARS and not to any other region in the GFP mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>PABP mRNA translation is autoregulated by an A-rich <italic>cis</italic> element at its 5&#x02032;-UTR. We have shown earlier that the ARS binds to PABP and can repress translation of a reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Although presence of a short, 10&#x02013;60 nt long poly(A) sequence at the 5&#x02032;-UTR of a reporter mRNA can also inhibit translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), the precise mechanism how ARS and poly(A) sequence inhibits translation could differ. Result of our studies suggests that, indeed, this is the case. We showed that the ARS is almost three times more effective than the poly(A)<sub>50</sub> in repressing mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This difference is probably due to the greater ability of the ARS to form a trimeric RNP complex with IMP1, PABP and UNR than what was observed for the poly(A)<sub>50</sub>. We have shown that the poly(A)<sub>50</sub> can not bind to IMP1 and UNR, and forms largely a monomeric and a small amount of dimeric and trimeric complexes with PABP at a limiting concentration of this polypeptide. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) has shown that a stretch of as few as 10 adenines at the 5&#x02032;-UTR of an mRNA can repress translation as efficiently as the ARS in H293 cells. The reasons for this difference in results between the two studies are not known. However, the use of different cell-lines and promoters for reporter mRNA expression in these two studies could be a contributing factor. Furthermore, an earlier report suggested that H293 cells are refractory to the ARS mediated repression of PABP mRNA translation and a region near the initiation codon of PABP mRNA have the ability to override ARS mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). In this context it is noteworthy, that in UV crosslinking studies significantly more ARS bound 63 kDa polypeptide (IMP1) was observed with HeLa cell extract than what were seen with H293, 3T3 and C2 cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, the greater availability of IMP1 to bind to the ARS in HeLa cells could enhance the ability of ARS to repress translation in these cells.</p><p>We have shown earlier that the ARS prevents mRNA translation by stalling the 40S ribosomal subunit at a site adjacent to the ARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). It is likely that the critical factor in determining the ability of ARS to repress translation is the formation of a multisubunit RNP complex, sufficiently large, to prevent the scanning 40S ribosomal subunits from reaching the initiation codon. It is possible that at a sufficiently high cellular PABP level a homotrimeric complex between PABP and the ARS could form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). However, this process would allow more PABP synthesis before the repression mechanism is triggered, than, if a multimeric complex with additional proteins is formed.</p><p>Survey of the 5&#x02032;-UTR region of PABP mRNA from different species revealed that not only the presence of the A-rich region is highly conserved but also the sequence of the pyrimidine rich spacers between the oligo(A) regions is conserved between several species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising that the conserved pyrimidine rich regions of the ARS are also required for binding to additional polypeptides to repress PABP mRNA translation. In these studies we have shown that two additional polypeptides of 63 and 105 kDa can be crosslinked to the ARS RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> by UV. These two polypeptides were purified by affinity chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry as IMP1 and UNR, respectively. We have further shown that both IMP1 and UNR are present in the ARS RNA&#x02013;protein complex by gel-supershift assays and we have coined the term ARC for this RNA&#x02013;protein complex. Both IMP1 and UNR can directly bind to the ARS RNA but PABP has a stimulatory effect on their binding to the ARS. This explains why depletion of PABP from the HeLa cell extract almost abolished binding of these two polypeptides to the ARS. The precise RNA sequence within the ARS recognized by IMP1 and UNR is not known. However, our results suggest that both polypeptides make contact with adenine nucleotides since both polypeptides were detected by UV crosslinking using [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP labeled RNA. We had also used [<sup>32</sup>P]CTP or [<sup>32</sup>P]UTP to label the ARS RNA and used it for UV crosslinking studies. Both labeled RNAs showed crosslinking to 72, 63 and 105 kDa polypeptides (results not shown). Therefore, it is likely that these polypeptides make contact with a large region of the ARS. A 47 nt-long domain of the ARS has been identified as the IMP1, PABP and UNR binding region. Presence of the pyrimidine stretches within this region is necessary for binding to IMP1 and UNR. Stimulation of the interactions of ARS with IMP1 and UNR by PABP also suggest a co-operative nature of binding of these polypeptides to the ARS and formation of a multicomponent RNP complex. To validate the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we showed here that the ARS containing reporter GFP mRNA, but not the wild-type GFP mRNA without the ARS, can be immunoprecipitated with both the IMP1 and UNR antibodies.</p><p>Although presence of a long (50 or more) stretch of adenines at the 5&#x02032;-UTR of a reporter mRNA can repress translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), this is not biologically relevant as a similar poly(A) sequence has not been found in any PABP mRNA. The translational control element present in human and other mammalian PABP mRNA consists of several stretches of oligo(A)<sub>6&#x02013;8</sub> separated by conserved pyrimidine bases. Therefore, it is important to determine how the naturally occurring translational control element of PABP mRNA functions. The evidences presented in this manuscript suggest that the ARS forms a hetromeric complex to repress translation. The need for the formation of a multimeric RNP complex at the ARS for suppressing PABP mRNA translation is further supported by two observations, (i) that the ARS RNA is weaker than a similar size poly(A) RNA, in its interaction with PABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and (ii) the peptide binding C-terminal PABC domain is required for the ARS mediated translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Often, control of mRNA translation is not an all or none phenomenon. The degree to which the translation of a specific mRNA is regulated depends on several factors including the availability of translational repressors and enhancers, the mRNA and the precise nature of its <italic>cis</italic> element.</p><p>IMP1 belongs to the VICKZ family of zipcode binding proteins and is similar to chicken ZBPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) and Xenopus, VgIRBP/vera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). These groups of proteins are composed of two RNA recognition motifs and four hn-RNP homology domains. IMP1 is known to bind to the 5&#x02032;-UTR of IGF-II mRNA to repress its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Like its ortholog chicken ZBPI which is involved in the localization of &#x003b2;-actin mRNA to the leading edge of fibroblast cells, IMP1 is also implicated in the subcytoplasmic localization of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). As a modular protein IMP1 binds to various RNA sequences generally rich in A, U and C residues. Chicken ZBPI can be crosslinked to RNA containing ACACCC sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) but its Xenopus ortholog, vera, binds to UUCAC and UUUCUA sequences of vg1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The human IMP1 appears to recognize the UUCACGUUCAC sequence in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of IGF-II mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Thus, the IMP1 binding domain of the ARS is different from any previously characterized IMP1 binding sequence.</p><p>The third member of the ARC described in our studies is a known PABP interacting protein UNR, which is also a RNA-binding protein with five cold-shock domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). The main cellular function of UNR includes internal initiation of uncapped mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) and translation dependent destabilization of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Recent studies have shown that UNR is involved in the decay of <italic>c-fos</italic> mRNA through the major protein-coding determinant of instability (mCRD). UNR binds to both mCRD and PABP to form a platform for the formation of a deadenylation/decay mRNA protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). We showed that UNR also binds to the same 47 nt-long region of the ARS as IMP1 and PABP does. The known UNR binding sequence of mCRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) and internal ribosome entry site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) are longer and more complex than the UNR binding region of the ARS and bear no homology with this region. Previously we showed that the ARS containing repressed and ARS minus reporter mRNAs have similar half lives in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that UNR is involved in destabilizing the ARS containing repressed mRNA. Whether UNR is involved in any internal initiation of PABP mRNA, which may impair proper initiation, could be the subject for further investigation. As a PABP interacting protein UNR could form a larger RNP complex with the ARS than what could be achieved by PABP alone. This larger RNP complex should be better able to prevent movement of the scanning 40S subunits.</p><p>Analysis of various mutations of the ARS have shown that binding of all three polypeptides, IMP1, PABP and UNR, are similarly affected by these mutations. The presence of a four oligo(A) rich stretches was shown to be sufficient for both ARC formation and repression of mRNA translation. In addition, the length of the spacer sequences between the oligo(A)s is important for the function of ARS. In these studies we have not tested whether the presence of T and Cs in the spacer is also important. In this report we have mostly focused on demonstrating the importance of ARC formation for repression of mRNA translation. The three polypeptides present in the ARC are RNA-binding polypeptides, which can also interact with other polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Whether a larger RNP is formed with the ARS through protein&#x02013;protein interactions with the core RNP complex needs to be further investigated. The presence of several additional ARS specific polypeptides in the affinity purified sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) supports the formation of a large multimeric complex with the ARS through both RNA&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Human PABP and UNR antibody was generously provided by Drs G.
