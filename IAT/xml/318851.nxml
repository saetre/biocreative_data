One allele has a previously undescribed IVS-2 sequence. Most of the allelic differences can be explained as resulting from a gene conversion event involving G gamma as a donor. A novel feature of this event is that three G gamma-like regions occur interspersed among unconverted areas of the A gamma gene. We propose that an alternating purine-pyrimidine run which is located between two of the converted sites is the initiation site of the conversion event. Consistent with models of gene conversion, this poly (purine-pyrimidine) tract has single-stranded characteristics in supercoiled plasmids as assayed by S1-nuclease.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0057-a" xlink:role="4475"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4469"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4470"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4471"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4472"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4473"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4474"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4475"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4476"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4477"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4478"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4479"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
