Five such GTFs, TATA-binding protein (TBP), TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH, enable RNAPII to recognize gene promoters and participate in the assembly of preinitiation complexes (PICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c4">4</xref>). According to a stepwise model of PIC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c5">5</xref>), TBP binds to DNA first, followed by the binding of TFIIB, then RNAPII&#x02013;TFIIF and finally TFIIE and TFIIH. TFIIB interacts with both TBP and RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c6">6</xref>) and is believed to provide a physical link between DNA&#x02013;TBP and RNAPII&#x02013;TFIIF complexes. A holoenzyme model proposes that TFIIB may be part of a pre-assembled complex called RNAPII holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c7">7</xref>), which contains several GTFs in addition to RNAPII. Both genetic and biochemical studies have provided strong evidence that TFIIB also participates in the process of transcription start site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c12">12</xref>). In addition, TFIIB interacts with many activators and, therefore, has been proposed to be a target recruited by activators during transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of TFIIB primary sequences from different eukaryotes has revealed several structural motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c9">9</xref>), including a zinc ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c16">16</xref>) in the N-terminal region and two imperfect repeats in the C-terminal region. The N-terminal region of TFIIB is highly accessible to protease digestion and is critical for the interaction with RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c19">19</xref>). The C-terminal region is protease resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c19">19</xref>) and hence referred to as the core domain of TFIIB (cTFIIB). According to a solution structure of cTFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c20">20</xref>) and a crystal structure of a TATA&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;cTFIIB ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c21">21</xref>), human cTFIIB contains two similarly folded domains, each of which consists of five &#x003b1;-helices. Biochemical studies have suggested an intramolecular interaction between N- and C-domains of human TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c22">22</xref>), an interaction that could be affected by activators. In addition, recent NMR studies have demonstrated that human cTFIIB itself may adopt multiple conformations, which can be altered by interacting with either the N-terminal domain or the activator VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c23">23</xref>). However, there is a relative shortage of evidence that demonstrates the biological importance of the conformational properties of TFIIB (see Discussion).</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, TFIIB is a monomeric protein of 345 amino acid residues encoded by the essential <italic>SUA7</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c9">9</xref>). Although yeast TFIIB is structurally similar to human TFIIB, it cannot be functionally replaced by human TFIIB <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>). Mutational studies of yeast TFIIB revealed a species-specific surface within a solvent-exposed region in the first repeat of cTFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>). Four positions within this region were identified as critical to TFIIB function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>). A TFIIB mutant, called YR1m4, with amino acid residues changed at these four critical positions to corresponding human TFIIB residues, impaired the expression of genes activated by different activators <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>). Thus, the biochemical characterization of this mutant TFIIB will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of transcription regulation.</p><p>In our efforts to further determine the biochemical properties of YR1m4, we demonstrate that this mutant TFIIB can interact with several activators. We also demonstrate that YR1m4 and other related TFIIB mutants can interact with several individual GTFs, including TBP, TFIIF and RNAPII. We further report that YR1m4 is compromised in supporting activator-independent transcription in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Finally, we demonstrate that an intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the tested TFIIB mutants is affected, and our experiments reveal a strong correlation between this intramolecular interaction property and activator-independent transcriptional activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results suggest that the intramolecular interaction of yeast TFIIB plays an important role in transcription regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>The yeast strains used in the analysis of the expression of endogenous <italic>CTS1</italic> gene are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd310tb1">1</xref>.

This phenotype resembles that of cells lacking the <italic>CTS1</italic> gene, which encodes an endochitinase that hydrolyzes chitin in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c30">30</xref>). To determine whether the expression of the endogenous <italic>CTS1</italic> gene is affected in YR1m4 cells, we carried out an S1 nuclease protection assay using mRNA isolated from different isogenic yeast strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f1">1</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the endogenous <italic>CTS1</italic> gene was expressed at a lower level in YR1m4 cells when compared to that in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f1">1</xref>A, lane 1 versus 2). Northern analysis indicates that <italic>ACE2</italic> mRNA level in YR1m4 cells was unaffected (data not shown). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c30">30</xref>), our S1 assay results also demonstrate that the <italic>CTS1</italic> expression is activated by ACE2 and independent of the homologous activator SWI5. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f1">1</xref>B is a summary of our S1 assay results with <italic>CTS1</italic> expression levels normalized to an internal control.</p><p>We also analyzed the activity of a <italic>CYC1-lacZ</italic> reporter gene under the control of the <italic>CTS1</italic> upstream activation sequence (<italic>UAS</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c31">31</xref>). Our &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f2">2</xref>A (columns 1 and 2) demonstrate that ACE2 increased the transcription activity by 64.3-fold in wild-type cells but only 2.7-fold in YR1m4 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f2">2</xref>A, columns 3 and 4). In a similar reporter gene assay, transcription activation by an activator containing the transcription activation domain (TAD) of VP16 was also shown to be decreased. LexA-VP16 fusion protein activated transcription by 21.8-fold in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f2">2</xref>B, columns 1 and 2) but only 2.3-fold in YR1m4 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f2">2</xref>B, columns 3 and 4). In addition, our previous studies have demonstrated that several other artificial reporter genes under the control of different <italic>UAS</italic>s were also affected to various extents in YR1m4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>). Together, these results show that YR1m4 has a defect in supporting activated transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction between YR1m4 and activators</title><p>TFIIB has been proposed to be a direct target for many transcriptional activators, primarily by virtue of protein&#x02013;protein interaction assays conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c14">14</xref>). To determine whether the interaction between TFIIB and the activators ACE2 and VP16 is affected by YR1m4 mutations, we carried out GST pull-down assays. In these assays, bacterially expressed and immobilized GST fusion proteins, containing either wild-type TFIIB or YR1m4, were used to precipitate activator proteins generated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription&#x0002f;translation system. Our results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f3">3</xref> demonstrate that ACE2 and GAL4-VP16 can interact with both wild-type TFIIB and YR1m4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f3">3</xref>A and B), suggesting that the residues mutated in YR1m4 do not directly interfere with the interaction between TFIIB and these activators. Another activator, native GAL4 with its own TADs, whose activation was only slightly affected in a reporter gene assay <italic>in vivo</italic> (&#x0003c;1.5-fold decrease) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>), can also interact with both wild-type TFIIB and YR1m4 in a similar assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f3">3</xref>C). Among the tested activators that showed a decreased activity in YR1m4 cells, only TAD1 of ADR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c32">32</xref>), which activates the expression of the <italic>ADH2</italic> gene, exhibited a defect in interacting with YR1m4 (C.Denis, personal communication). Together, these experiments suggest that the inability of YR1m4 to interact with activators cannot be the only molecular defect accounting for its inability to support transcription efficiently.</p></sec><sec><title>YR1m4 is defective in supporting activator-independent transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To search for molecular defects associated with YR1m4, we carried out transcription assays <italic>in vitro</italic>. A TFIIB-depleted yeast whole cell extract was prepared from the strain FP133 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c12">12</xref>) and supplemented with recombinant TFIIB, either wild-type or YR1m4. The extract itself does not support transcription due to the lack of sufficient amount of TFIIB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f4">4</xref>, lane 2). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c12">12</xref>), wild-type TFIIB can restore transcription efficiently (lane 3), which can be further increased by addition of GAL4-VP16 (lane 4); our assay was carried out using high template DNA concentrations, which, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c28">28</xref>), reduce the effect of activation. When YR1m4 was used in the same assay, it exhibited a severe defect in supporting both non-activated (lane 5) and activated transcription (lane 6).</p><p>We also used an artificial recruitment assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c26">26</xref>) to further characterize the behavior of YR1m4 in supporting activator-independent transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this experiment, a fusion protein, Max-RFX, was expressed in yeast cells. This protein contains the leucine zipper of Max fused to a DNA-binding protein RFX, which can recognize a RFX binding site (X) placed upstream of a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene. The leucine zipper of c-Myc was attached to TFIIB at the C-terminus. When expressed in yeast cells, TFIIB&#x02013;Myc fusion protein is recruited by Max-RFX through the hetero-dimerization interaction between Myc and Max, leading to the expression of the nearby reporter gene <italic>lacZ</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f5">5</xref>A). Since no conventional DNA-binding activator is involved in this artificial recruitment assay, it measures the activator-independent function of TFIIB, reflecting its intrinsic properties (M.Strubin, personal communication). In this experiment, a non-functional TFIIB mutant, C48S, was used as a negative control, which showed only background activity in this assay as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c26">26</xref>). Our results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f5">5</xref>B demonstrate that YR1m4 has only 19&#x00025; activity compared with that of wild-type TFIIB. It is interesting to note that, in the absence of both activators SWI5 and ACE2, the expression of the endogenous <italic>CTS1</italic> gene in YR1m4 cells is decreased compared with that in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f1">1</xref>A, lanes 7 and 8). Together, our experiments suggest that YR1m4 is defective in activator-independent transcription both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, the defect of YR1m4 in supporting activator-independent transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> is more severe on endogenous (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f1">1</xref>A, compare lanes 7 and 8) or integrated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f5">5</xref>) reporter genes than on reporter genes carried on replication plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f2">2</xref>A and B, compare columns 1 and 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>), possibly reflecting differences in promoter accessibility.</p><p>We further tested in the artificial recruitment assay several other TFIIB mutants that have amino acid alterations in the same region mutated in YR1m4 but exhibit varying ability to support cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>). Our experiments revealed a good correlation between their activity in this artificial recruitment assay and their ability to support cell growth. These findings further support the idea that the physiological phenotype associated with our TFIIB mutants results from their defects in supporting transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction between TFIIB and other GTFs</title><p>Since TFIIB is able to interact with several other GTFs, including TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c5">5</xref>) and RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c33">33</xref>), it is possible that YR1m4 and other related yeast TFIIB mutants fail to support activator-independent transcription because they are defective in interacting with these factors. To test this idea directly, the interaction between TFIIB and both TBP and RNAPII was analyzed in GST pull-down experiments. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f6">6</xref>A, all the tested TFIIB mutants can interact with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled TBP. These mutants can also interact with RNAPII normally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f6">6</xref>B and C).</p><p>We also performed a gel shift experiment to detect the formation of a DNA&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;TFIIB (DB) complex. This analysis allows the detection of TFIIB&#x02013;TBP interaction on DNA. The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f7">7</xref> demonstrate that the ability of YR1m4 to form the DB complex is not impaired. In fact, such complex formation is enhanced slightly (2&#x02013;3-fold) for YR1m4; we currently do not fully understand the molecular basis for this observation, but it might be related to either the conformation properties of YR1m4 (see below) or subtle effects on the interaction with TBP&#x02013;DNA complex although the mutated amino acids do not face TBP or DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c21">21</xref>).</p><p>In addition to TBP and RNAPII, we also tested the interaction between TFIIB and several other GTFs, including TFIIF, and two subunits of TFIIH, Tfb2 and Tfb3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c34">34</xref>). The Tfb2 subunit of TFIIH cannot interact with either wild-type or mutant TFIIB. TFIIF and Tfb3 are able to interact with TFIIB, but no difference was observed between wild-type TFIIB and YR1m4 (data not shown). The fact that the interaction between TFIIB and the tested GTFs is not affected by these mutations suggests that this region of yeast TFIIB is not directly involved in interacting with these factors individually. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that YR1m4 fails to directly interact with other GTFs not included in our tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased intramolecular interaction in yeast TFIIB mutants</title><p>An intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal domain and core domain has been observed in human TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c22">22</xref>). Such an interaction has also been observed in yeast TFIIB as reported by Wu and Hampsey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c15">15</xref>) and Bangur <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c35">35</xref>). To determine whether the mutations in YR1m4 alter the intramolecular interaction, TFIIB core domain (amino acids 128&#x02013;345) was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as a GST fusion protein and used to precipitate <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized <sup>35</sup>S-labeled N-terminal domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;135). Our results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f8">8</xref>A) show that, unlike wild-type TFIIB (lane 3), YR1m4 exhibits a weakened intramolecular interaction (lane 4). A titration experiment further confirmed that the intramolecular interaction is weakened in YR1m4 compared with wild-type TFIIB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f8">8</xref>B and C).</p><p>To determine whether the intramolecular interaction defect associated with YR1m4 is biologically relevant, we further analyzed the intramolecular interaction properties of several other related TFIIB mutants with varying phenotypic severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>). Our experiments showed that all the related TFIIB mutants that were tested exhibited a weakened intramolecular interaction compared with wild-type TFIIB. More importantly, the intramolecular interaction properties of these mutants correlate well with their <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription activity detected in the artificial recruitment assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f8">8</xref>D) as well as their ability to support cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>). These results further illustrate the biological importance of intramolecular interaction of TFIIB.</p><p>We performed a partial proteolysis assay to determine whether protease sensitivity is altered in YR1m4. Either the recombinant TFIIB protein with HA attached to the C-terminus or the <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized TFIIB protein was subjected to <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> V8 protease digestion. Under our experimental conditions, no significant difference was observed between wild-type TFIIB and YR1m4 (data not shown). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c35">35</xref>), the major V8 protease cleavage site is located in a hinge region between the N-terminal zinc ribbon domain and the core domain. It is possible that, in the absence of all the other factors that interact with TFIIB in the PIC, the altered intramolecular interaction of YR1m4 affects its conformation without generating a new protease sensitivity profile.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The experiments described in this report were designed to further analyze the molecular properties of a mutant yeast TFIIB, YR1m4, which is defective in supporting activated transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref> and this report). Our biochemical studies show that YR1m4 is not defective in interacting directly with several affected activators. Furthermore, despite its ability to interact with several GTFs tested individually, this mutant TFIIB is severely compromised in supporting activator-independent transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, we show that in an artificial recruitment assay, YR1m4 is defective in supporting activator-independent transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. The intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal domain and core domain of this mutant is reduced in comparison with wild-type TFIIB. Our experiments reveal a strong correlation between the intramolecular interaction property and the activator-independent transcriptional activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd310f8">8</xref>D) as well as the ability to support cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>). Our results suggest that this intramolecular interaction of TFIIB plays an important role in proper transcription control in cells.</p><p>Most of the yeast TFIIB mutants reported so far by our and other laboratories cause slow cell growth phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c36">36</xref>). Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c25">25</xref>), as well as the current analysis, suggest that the slow growth phenotype of YR1m4 cells is due to a decreased expression of specific genes. While some TFIIB mutants were shown to have activation-specific defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c15">15</xref>), others were reported to be defective in supporting basal transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c36">36</xref>). It has been shown that several mutant TFIIB molecules that are defective in interacting with certain activators fail to support activated transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c14">14</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that the direct recruitment of TFIIB by these activators can lead to an increased level of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c14">14</xref>). For YR1m4, we observed that most activators, except TAD1 of ADR1 (C.Denis, personal communication), could directly interact with the mutant TFIIB protein. These results suggest that the transcription defect associated with YR1m4 may result from a generally defective TFIIB and, in fewer cases, an impaired direct interaction between activators and YR1m4. Our finding that YR1m4 exhibits a weakened intramolecular interaction and is compromised in supporting activator-independent transcription further illustrates a general defect of this mutant protein.</p><p>Biochemical and structural studies of human TFIIB suggest that conformational changes of TFIIB may contribute to transcription regulation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c23">23</xref>). It was reported that the activation domain of VP16 could disrupt the intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal domain and the core domain of human TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c22">22</xref>). Recent NMR studies of human cTFIIB suggest that VP16 and the N-terminal domain of TFIIB may compete with each other by interacting with the same or an overlapping surface on cTFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c23">23</xref>). Although the structure of full-length TFIIB protein is currently unavailable, NMR studies suggest that human TFIIB may adopt multiple conformations, resulting from both intramolecular interaction and the interaction with other factors, including GTFs and activators, as well as RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c19">19</xref>). These studies suggest that TFIIB may undergo conformational changes in transcription.</p><p>Recent studies have described two yeast TFIIB mutants that affect the conformation properties of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c35">35</xref>). While both of those mutants contain amino acid alterations at the N-terminus (S53P and R64E), YR1m4 contains mutations in the core domain. In addition, YR1m4 exhibits biochemical and physiological properties that are different from those of the two reported mutants. In particular, while the S53P mutant protein described by Wu and Hampsey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c15">15</xref>) shows a major conformational defect only in the presence of the activator protein PHO4, YR1m4 has an intramolecular interaction defect affecting both activated and activator-independent transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. While intramolecular interaction in the R64E mutant protein described by Bangur <italic>et al.</italic> is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c35">35</xref>), this interaction is weakened in YR1m4. Interestingly, despite their opposite effects on intramolecular interaction, both R64E and YR1m4 are defective in supporting transcription, although transcription defect for R64E was detected only <italic>in vitro</italic> but not <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c12">12</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that efficient transcription and activation require a well-balanced intramolecular interaction of TFIIB, an interaction that may facilitate dynamic conformational changes of the protein.</p><p>We propose that, during PIC formation, yeast TFIIB is in a conformation that is stabilized by its intramolecular interaction. Upon PIC assembly, interactions with other proteins including activators may compete with and eventually break the intramolecular interaction of TFIIB, thus facilitating a subsequent step(s) of transcription initiation. According to this model, the weakened intramolecular interaction of YR1m4 is disfavored for PIC formation, even though it can interact with other GTFs individually. Our model is supported by a recent observation that one of the currently analyzed TFIIB mutants with a mutation in the species-specific region, C149R (YmC), has a defect in PIC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd310c37">37</xref>). Regardless of the exact events taking place during transcription initiation and activation, our study underscores the importance of intramolecular interaction of TFIIB in controlling transcription in cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd310f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The expression of endogenous <italic>CTS1</italic> gene is decreased in YR1m4 cells.
