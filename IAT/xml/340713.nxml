The three H2b genes all code for different proteins, each differing in two amino acids from the others. The H2b specific elements present 5' to H2b genes from other species are present in all three mouse H2b genes. All three H2b genes are expressed in the same relative amounts in three different mouse cell lines and fetal mice. The H2b gene with the H2b specific sequence closest to the TATAA sequence is expressed in the highest amount. One of the H2a genes lacks the first 9 amino acids, the promoter region, the last 3 amino acids and contains an altered 3' end sequence. Despite these multiple defects, there is only one nucleotide change between the two H2a genes from codon 9 to 126. This indicates that a recent gene conversion has occurred between these two genes. The similarity of the nucleotide sequences in the coding regions of mouse histone genes is probably due to gene conversion events targeted precisely at the coding region.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0256-a" xlink:role="3036"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0243.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3023"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0244.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3024"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0245.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3025"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0246.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3026"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0247.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3027"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0248.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3028"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0249.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3029"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0250.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3030"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0251.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3031"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0252.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3032"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0253.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3033"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0254.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3034"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0255.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3035"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0256.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3036"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0257.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3037"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3038"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0259.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3039"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
