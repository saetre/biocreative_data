At P14, when NMJs of <italic>dilute</italic> muscles were already more than 20&#x00025; smaller than the healthy ones, fibre diameters of TA muscles of healthy and <italic>dilute</italic> mice were identical with 23.0 &#x000b5;m&#x000b1;0.5 &#x000b5;m (mean&#x000b1;s.e.m., n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;45 fields, 521 fibres measured) and 23.0 &#x000b5;m&#x000b1;0.3 &#x000b5;m (mean&#x000b1;s.e.m., n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;46 fields, 502 fibres measured), respectively. Conversely, at P20 <italic>dilute</italic> TA muscles exhibited a significantly smaller mean fibre diameter (21.4 &#x000b5;m&#x000b1;2.4 &#x000b5;m, mean&#x000b1;s.e.m., n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6 fields, 138 fibres measured) than their healthy counterparts (26.1 &#x000b5;m&#x000b1;2.4 &#x000b5;m, mean&#x000b1;s.e.m., n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12 fields, 195 fibres measured). These results clearly show that the shrinkage of NMJ areas in the absence of functional myosin Va occurs before and independently of the decrease in fibre diameter. Next, we tested whether shrinkage and fragmentation observed at the postsynaptic side were due to a lack of innervation. Therefore, we studied the innervation status by immunolabelling the presynaptic proteins, synaptophysin and neurofilament M, in muscles from <italic>dilute</italic> and healthy littermates at P20. The synaptophysin signals nicely matched the AChR signals in healthy mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g001">Fig. 1H&#x02013;H&#x02033;</xref>) as well as <italic>dilute</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g001">Fig. 1I&#x02013;I&#x02033;</xref>). Importantly, each postsynaptic AChR cluster clearly was at close range to presynaptic synaptophysin, and each endplate was contacted by a single nerve ending as evidenced by neurofilament M staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g001">Fig. 1J&#x02013;K&#x02033;</xref>). It should be noted, that the morphological alterations of the postsynapses in <italic>dilute</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g001">Fig. 1I and K</xref>) were mirrored onto the presynapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g001">Fig. 1I&#x02032; and K&#x02032;</xref>), leading to a clearly different morphology of the nerve branches when compared to healthy synapses. In particular, the neurofilament staining in <italic>dilute</italic> muscles did in most cases not embrace the synaptic contacts as nicely as in healthy mice, but rather continued linearly into the elongated postsynaptic area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g001">Fig. 1K&#x02013;K&#x02033;</xref>). To verify whether the presynaptic markers were present in comparable amounts in healthy and <italic>dilute</italic> muscles, we undertook a statistical analysis of the BGT-stained areas covered by either synaptophysin or neurofilament M staining (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003871-t002">Table 2</xref>). This revealed that both marker proteins covered about 60&#x00025; of the postsynaptic area in wildtype as well as in <italic>dilute</italic> muscles. To make sure that these synapses were still capable of nerve transmission, we elicited hind limb muscle contraction through sciatic nerve electrodes in live anaesthetised mice at P14. Under these conditions the stimulated muscles of all healthy and <italic>dilute</italic> animals clearly contracted (not shown). Altogether, these data indicate that <italic>dilute</italic> muscles are innervated and that synapses are still able to induce muscle contraction, suggesting that the altered postsynaptic morphology in these mice was not due to missing innervation.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0003871-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003871.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Coverage of BGT-positive area by presynaptic markers in healthy and dilute muscles.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0003871-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0003871.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0003871-t002-2"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">marker</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">healthy</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>dilute</italic></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">synaptophysin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.3&#x000b1;5.1 (4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.4&#x000b1;1.6 (3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">neurofilament M</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.0&#x000b1;3.5 (8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.7&#x000b1;4.4 (8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt102"><label/><p>Peronaeus muscles of healthy and <italic>dilute</italic> mice were explanted at P19.

C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with the NMJ marker protein, rapsyn-GFP, and FLAG or FLAG-MCLT. FLAG-MCLT is a FLAG-tagged form of MCLT (myosin Va C-terminal long tail) and was previously shown to act as dominant negative fragment of myosin Va in different cellular models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Wu2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Rudolf2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Transfected cells were differentiated into myotubes for seven days, fixed, immunostained for the cis-Golgi marker, GM130, and then visualised using confocal microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g002">Fig. 2B&#x02013;D</xref>, rapsyn-GFP was localised in punctate structures distributed evenly all over the myotubes in the absence of FLAG-MCLT. Conversely, in FLAG-MCLT transfected myotubes, rapsyn-GFP positive punctate structures were highly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g002">Fig. 2E&#x02013;H</xref>) and mostly concentrated in perinuclear clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g002">Fig. 2E&#x02013;G</xref>, the relative orientation between GM130 and nuclei is depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). It is unlikely that the effects on amount and localisation of rapsyn-GFP positive structures observed in FLAG-MCLT co-transfected myotubes were due to general morphological alterations, since both FLAG and FLAG-MCLT co-transfected myotubes showed the typical pearl chain arrays of ring-like Golgi apparatuses (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g002">Fig. 2B&#x02013;C and E&#x02013;F</xref>).

Therefore, we first performed affinity co-precipitation assays, in which we aimed to pull down different AChR populations. In one approach, we used intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of BGT-biotin into live mice. Since BGT is cell-impermeant, we expected to label by this means only surface-exposed and internalised (endocytosed and recycling) AChRs. In another experimental set, we added BGT-biotin to whole muscle lysates of untreated mice to label the total population of AChRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Smith1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequently, using NeutrAvidin resin, BGT-biotin-labeled AChRs in all these samples were harvested by affinity precipitation (AP) and co-precipitating proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. AChR alpha-subunit precipitated only in the presence but not the absence of BGT-biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g003">Fig. 3A, compare rows 1&#x02013;2 and 3</xref>), showing that AChRs did not bind unspecifically to the resin. Furthermore, two proteins known to not be associated with AChRs, namely beta1-adrenergic receptor and calreticulin, could not be found in the precipitates even in the presence of BGT-biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g003">Fig. 3A, rows 4&#x02013;5</xref>), indicating again the specificity of the pull-down assay. Using myosin Va antibody, we found strong signals in brain lysates and precipitates from muscle samples where BGT-biotin was i.p. injected, but no or barely visible signals were present in muscle lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g003">Fig. 3A, row 6</xref>).

Therefore, TA muscles of adult wildtype mice were either transfected with rapsyn-GFP (control) or co-transfected with rapsyn-GFP and silMyoVa (silMyoVa). During transfection, BGT-AF647 was injected locally. Ten days later, transfected muscles were injected with BGT-AF555. Then, BGT-AF647 and BGT-AF555 fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6A, green and red in overlay images</xref>, respectively) were monitored by <italic>in vivo</italic> confocal microscopy. Given the extreme stability of the AChR-BGT complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Lee1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and the small quantities of BGT (25 pmol) injected at each occasion, we reasoned that the largest proportion of BGT should have been available in the circulatory system only for a limited amount of time and therefore AChRs marked by BGT should have been surface-exposed at the time point of injection, i.e. ten days or about one hour before inspection for BGT-AF647 or BGT-AF555, respectively. Indeed, spectrophotometric measurements suggest that most BGT is available for binding only during the first few hours upon injection (not shown). In control muscles, the two BGT fluorescence signals showed a very nice overlap and clearly depicted the typical arborised structure of adult NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6A, left panels</xref>). There was, however, a gradient of intensities: while BGT-AF647 (referred to as &#x02018;old receptors&#x02019;) was preferably localised in the NMJ centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6A, green in overlay images</xref>), BGT-AF555 (referred to as &#x02018;new receptors&#x02019;) showed a higher concentration at the rims of NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6A, red in overlay images</xref>). Upon co-transfection with silMyoVa, the overall architecture of NMJs was significantly altered and appeared fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6A, right panels</xref>). Furthermore, although intensity and extension of &#x02018;new receptors&#x02019; were still comparable to control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6A, compare central panels</xref>), &#x02018;old receptors&#x02019; were almost completely gone in silMyoVa transfected muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6A, compare upper panels</xref>).

It is evident that the signals of &#x02018;old receptors&#x02019; exceeded those of &#x02018;new receptors&#x02019; in most NMJs in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, &#x02018;old receptors&#x02019;&#x0226b;&#x02018;new receptors&#x02019;). Conversely, upon transfection with silMyoVa, most NMJs showed a smaller volume of &#x02018;old receptor&#x02019; than of &#x02018;new receptor&#x02019; signals. When concentrating on the areas occupied by &#x02018;old receptors&#x02019; and &#x02018;new receptors&#x02019;, transfection of silMyoVa apparently led in first instance to a strong reduction in the &#x02018;old receptor&#x02019; signals, while &#x02018;new receptor&#x02019; signals remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). In summary, these data indicate that interference with myosin Va function primarily decreases the persistence of receptors at the NMJ whereas the delivery of &#x02018;new receptors&#x02019; is less affected.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Rapsyn-GFP is mislocalised and enriched in BGT-positive punctate structures close to the NMJ in live muscle transfected with FLAG-MCLT or silMyoVa</title><p>The experiments so far have delivered evidence that myosin Va is localised close to the NMJ, that the interference with the motor protein's function induces shrinkage of the NMJ and that this shrinkage is likely due to a reduced persistence of AChRs at the NMJ. To better understand the fate of these receptor molecules, we looked for the enrichment of putative endocytic structures upon blockage of myosin Va. Therefore, we expressed rapsyn-GFP, which should be present in both exocytic as well as endocytic vesicles, together with FLAG or FLAG-MCLT. Ten days after transfection muscles were locally injected with BGT-AF647. Then, they were exposed for <italic>in vivo</italic> microscopy and rapsyn-GFP and BGT-AF647 fluorescence signals were monitored simultaneously. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, rapsyn-GFP overlapped with the BGT-stained AChRs in FLAG-transfected muscles (upper panels), but was largely excluded from the NMJs of most fibres upon expression of FLAG-MCLT (lower panels). In the latter, rapsyn-GFP was highly enriched in punctate structures in close proximity to the NMJ and the amount of rapsyn-GFP positive structures discontinuous with the NMJ was highly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g007">Fig. 7B and C</xref>). To get a hint on the nature of these puncta, we visualised the BGT-AF647 fluorescence signals in more detail. Given that BGT-AF647 as a cell-impermeant marker can bind AChRs only upon their exposure to the cell surface, intracellular BGT-positive structures should represent endocytic or internalised objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Axelrod1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, already one to two hours after BGT injection such intracellular BGT-positive structures were highly enriched in FLAG-MCLT co-transfected muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>, note filled and open arrowheads), similar to the situation for rapsyn-GFP. Furthermore, the extent of co-localisation of rapsyn-GFP with BGT-AF647 positive structures increased from 45.9&#x00025;&#x000b1;3.0&#x00025; to 79.9&#x00025;&#x000b1;3.7&#x00025; (both mean&#x000b1;s.e.m., n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 animals) in FLAG and FLAG-MCLT co-transfected muscles, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>).

Subsequently, BGT-AF647 (&#x02018;old receptors&#x02019;), BGT-AF555 (&#x02018;new receptors&#x02019;) and rapsyn-GFP signals were monitored with <italic>in vivo</italic> confocal microscopy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g007">Fig. 7E</xref> depicts 3D projections of 33 and 53 optical slices of control and silMyoVa transfected muscle fibres, respectively, taken at 1 &#x000b5;m interslice distance (for rotating 3D views, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s008">Movies S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s009">S6</xref>). In control muscles rapsyn-GFP, &#x02018;old receptors&#x02019; and &#x02018;new receptors&#x02019; appeared co-localised in the NMJ. The co-localisation was, however, abolished in silMyoVa transfected fibres and, in particular, the &#x02018;old receptors&#x02019; and &#x02018;new receptors&#x02019; occupied distinct regions in the postsynapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g007">Fig. 7E and F</xref>). Furthermore, while in the silMyoVa transfected condition BGT-AF647 puncta were virtually absent, much more BGT-AF555 positive puncta were visible than in the control. Interestingly, most of these BGT-AF555 signals co-localised with rapsyn-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g007">Fig. 7E&#x02013;F, lower panels</xref>). These results confirmed the findings of the previous experiments. Further, since BGT-AF555 was injected into the muscle shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g007">Fig. 7E&#x02013;F</xref> only 90 minutes prior to image acquisition these data suggested that newly arrived AChRs and rapsyn-GFP were internalised at a high rate. Assuming similar internalisation rates of control and myosin Va inhibited muscles, this could indicate an inefficient recruitment of endocytosed AChRs in the presence of FLAG-MCLT or silMyoVa back to the postsynaptic membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Depending on strain and physiological status of a muscle, neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) may undergo significant changes in size and shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Santos1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-BaliceGordon2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-BaliceGordon3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

We set out to identify the molecular machineries driving these dynamic processes. Here, we provide <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence for a crucial role of the molecular motor protein, myosin Va, in the postsynaptic plasticity of the mammalian nerve-muscle synapse.</p><p>First, we show that NMJs in <italic>dilute lethal</italic> mice (referred to as &#x02018;<italic>dilute</italic> mice&#x02019; in the following) lacking functional myosin Va exhibit a postnatal, time-dependent morphological deterioration that correlates with the dramatic aetiopathology leading to lethal seizures at around P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s001">Fig S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s004">Movies S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s005">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s006">S3</xref>). Initial mild locomotor symptoms at around P13 coincided with the reduction of NMJ areas in <italic>dilute</italic> homozygotes. Seven days later, when homozygotes showed most severe convulsions, NMJs were in addition often fragmented. These postsynaptic modifications were apparently not due to a lack of innervation, since the <italic>dilute</italic> just as the control muscles exhibited clear presynaptic terminals and responded to nerve stimulation with contraction. Given that in wildtype animals the NMJ size was found to positively correlate with muscle fibre diameter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-BaliceGordon3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, we also investigated whether fibre and NMJ sizes correlated with each other. These measurements revealed that NMJ size reduction preceded diminution of fibre diameters, indicating that, at least in <italic>dilute</italic> mice, fibre size reduction is a secondary effect. This might either be caused by an altered NMJ activity or by other, unrelated processes. At present, it is unclear, whether our observation of fragmented and small NMJs in <italic>dilute</italic> mice could partially explain their severe locomotor defects, in particular because previously also a correlation between aetiopathology and functional defects in the cerebellum of myosin Va deficient mice and rats was described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Takagishi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Takagishi2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Miyata1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Petralia1">&#x0005b;but see for conflicting results 47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Lichtman1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Altogether, our data on <italic>dilute</italic> mice suggest a role of myosin Va in postnatal NMJ maintenance and/or plasticity.</p><p>Our experiments using differentiating C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s002">S2</xref>) co-transfected with the NMJ marker protein rapsyn-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Ramarao1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and a dominant-negative C-terminal fragment of myosin Va (FLAG-MCLT) showed an accumulation of the NMJ marker in perinuclear clusters. At present, it is unclear which process resulted in the increased rapsyn-GFP signal. One might speculate that the presence of the myosin Va tail fragment either led to an augmented biosynthesis or to a diminished turnover of the synapse marker. As to the formation of rapsyn-GFP clusters, these were reminiscent of vesicle clusters observed in skin melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Wu2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and neuroendocrine PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Rudolf1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> upon similar treatments, suggesting a related basic mechanism behind such cluster formation. Wu et al. proposed a model in which myosin Va acts through a capture mechanism whereby it retains vesicles travelling along microtubules in the F-actin-rich cell cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Wu2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the composition of the postsynaptic apparatus of the NMJ exhibits much more complexity than the C2C12 myotube system it is also characterised by the presence of nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Sanes2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> in few micrometers distance from the membrane as well as submembranous F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Slater1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, which is structured by components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex and the dystrophin-related protein, utrophin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Slater1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the particularly well developed F-actin cytoskeleton underneath the NMJ and the presence of myosin Va on vesicles positive for AChR and rapsyn-GFP, myosin Va might play a role in capturing NMJ-related vesicles to facilitate their incorporation into the postsynaptic membrane, and thereby act in a similar manner as in skin and neuroendocrine cells.</p><p>If myosin Va was important for the trafficking of NMJ components, it should be present in their vicinity. To address this issue, we performed biochemical pull-down, <italic>in situ</italic> immunofluorescence and <italic>in vivo</italic> microscopy assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g003">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g004">4</xref>). A combination of different biochemical approaches, where either surface-exposed and internalised (pool 1) or the total AChR populations (pool 2) were precipitated, showed an enrichment in tibialis anterior and triceps muscles of myosin Va only in pool 1 but not in pool 2 of AChRs. This result argues for a direct or indirect association of myosin Va with surface-exposed and/or internalised AChRs. The presence of endogenous myosin Va at the NMJ was further substantiated by <italic>in situ</italic> immunofluorescence labelling of the motor protein, since this showed up in numerous punctate structures and aggregates in the close vicinity of the AChR labelling. Furthermore, we found that also a fluorescently marked full length myosin Va and a cargo binding tail fragment of myosin Va exhibited very similar distributions as endogenous myosin Va in live mouse muscle. Finally, <italic>in vivo</italic> co-localisation studies with co-expressed rapsyn-GFP and endocytosed BGT-AF647 staining showed a partial overlap of these signals. Together, these results demonstrate the enrichment in punctate and cluster-like structures carrying myosin Va in close vicinity to the NMJ. Further, they strongly suggest that myosin Va interacts with AChRs, and in fact mainly with those receptors which are either on the cell surface or internalised, thus according to literature using endocytic or recycling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Bruneau1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Bruneau2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>For a number of <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments we made use of a muscle-specific transfection protocol that allows the expression of heterologous proteins and siRNAs in hind limb muscles of adult wildtype mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Dona1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Mammucari1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have now substantiated this notion by performing immunohistochemical stainings of neurofilament M and force measurements in muscles transfected with FLAG-MCLT or silMyoVa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003871.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). First, these experiments showed that each postsynapse exhibited a corresponding presynaptic terminal. Second, we found that the maximal force produced by silMyoVa transfected hindlimb muscles was very similar to untransfected control muscles both, when stimulated via the sciatic nerve as well as through an electrode applied directly on the muscle. Interestingly, muscle force was slightly (but not significantly) weaker in silMyoVa transfected muscles. Together, these results demonstrate on the one hand that our muscle transfection protocol <italic>per se</italic> did not lead to any detectable interference with the functional integrity of NMJs and muscle; on the other hand, the morphological changes on NMJs as induced by the functional impairment of myosin Va may have led to small effects on synaptic transmission resulting in slightly weaker contractile responses. Another interesting phenomenon observed during these force measurements was that fatigue upon muscle electrode stimulation was reached much faster in control than in silMyoVa transfected animals. This effect might be explained by a compensatory mechanism of the muscle fibres to counterbalance the muscle weakness in the absence of functional myosin Va. Alternatively, there may exist additional roles of myosin Va within the muscle fibre which led to an increased fatigue resistance upon impairment of the motor protein. Such role needs to be analysed in more detail in future investigations. Using the <italic>in vivo</italic> transfection approach we show evidence that blockage of myosin Va function in adult wildtype mice leads to changes in the morphology of NMJs in a way that they resemble NMJs in <italic>dilute</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003871-t003">Table 3</xref>). Correlative <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements of fibre diameters allowed ruling out an indirect effect of the fibre diameter on the NMJ area.</p><p>Further information is also provided on the distribution and size of differentially labeled pools of AChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). First, we confirm earlier findings from ectopic rat NMJs regarding the distribution of newly and previously added AChRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Weinberg1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>; i.e. we found that, albeit in control muscles new and old receptors largely overlapped, BGT stainings of newly arriving or old receptors showed their highest densities at the rim or the centre of NMJs, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Yampolsky1">&#x0005b;see also 53&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that AChRs exhibit considerable lateral mobility within the NMJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Axelrod1">&#x0005b;see also 42&#x0005d;</xref> and that the sites of initial addition and subsequent dwelling of AChRs might differ. Second, in the case of silMyoVa transfection, fluorescence signals of new and old receptors were located in largely separate regions. This could either indicate a distinct mobility of AChRs within the NMJ in the absence of functional myosin Va or that under this condition at least a part of the clustered old AChR staining was not within the postsynaptic membrane but only in close proximity to it.</p><p>Our biochemical and fluorescence localisation data suggest, that myosin Va predominantly interacted with endocytosed or recycling AChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g003">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g004">4</xref>). If that was the case, one would expect that impairment of myosin Va function should alter or, most likely, inhibit such mechanism. Along that line, we reasoned that inhibition of endocytosis should yield rather larger than smaller NMJs, thus contradicting our findings. If, however, myosin Va facilitated recycling of endocytosed AChRs towards the NMJ, blockage of the motor protein would be expected to diminish NMJ size; furthermore, if there were multiple rounds of AChR recycling one would anticipate that the loss of AChRs should aggravate over time. This expectation was precisely matched in a double-labelling experiment, in which AChRs were subsequently labeled with two distinctly coloured BGT species at different time points in the presence or absence of silMyoVa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003871-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This corroborates earlier findings of Bruneau and colleagues who suggested an important role of AChR recycling in the course of NMJ plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Bruneau1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Bruneau2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>AChR expression in muscle changes during development: While embryonic gamma-subunit-containing AChRs are required for the correct positioning of synaptic contacts during ontogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Koenen1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, they are replaced postnatally by adult epsilon-subunit-containing AChRs.

Given that junctional AChRs in adult muscle undergo periodical recycling as recently described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Bruneau1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, it is tempting to speculate in the light of our data that myosin Va mediated AChR recycling is manifested only after the supply of extrajunctional AChRs (predominantly gamma-subunit-containing AChRs) has been depleted. This could explain why impaired recycling of junctional receptors leads to movement disorders in <italic>dilute</italic> mice at a relatively late state, i.e. in the second postnatal week. A scenario in which adult AChRs get recycled would be similar to the situation for a number of other cell surface receptors, including the AMPA receptor in the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Ehlers1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003871-Kennedy1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data are consistent with a model where myosin Va is present on vesicles containing previously surface-exposed proteinaceous components of the NMJ, such as AChR, and where inhibition of the myosin motor leads to a decrease in NMJ size due to a block of recycling of these components. The correlation we observed between postnatal aetiopathology and the fragmentation and size reduction of NMJs in <italic>dilute</italic> mice lacking functional myosin Va allows to speculate whether the block of recycling NMJ components is partially causative for the severe, lethal seizures in these animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Expression plasmids and chemicals</title><p>Experiments used the following constructs: rapsyn-GFP expression vector was from Dr. Cohen (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).

Scale bar, 50 &#x000b5;m. <bold>B&#x02013;F:</bold> Isometric force recordings of EDL muscles were performed stimulating either the sciatic nerve or the EDL muscle directly with nerve or muscle electrodes, respectively (indicated). For the recordings, the anaesthetised animals were mounted on a custom-made solid support equipped with micromanipulators to carry electrodes and force transducer. Custom silver (nerve electrode) and platinum electrodes (muscle electrode) were used with a Master-8-cp stimulator (A.M.P.I.). The nerve electrode was inserted next to the sciatic nerve, the muscle electrode was placed on top of the muscle and both spots were supplied with physiological solution. Force recordings were made using an MLT050/A isometric force transducer connected to a PowerLab 8/30 recorder (both ADInstruments) with a recording frequency of 2 kHz. Stimulation was performed using 5 ms pulses in trains of 500 ms duration with a frequency of 100 Hz every 4 seconds until half maximal force was reached (fatigue). Then, recovery from fatigue was verified by single 500 ms trains every minute (recovery). <bold>B and C:</bold> Representative force traces of control muscles (B) or muscles transfected with silMyoVa (C). The pause between nerve and muscle stimulation recordings was in each case 10 minutes long. <bold>D:</bold> Quantification of the average maximum isometric force produced by muscles upon nerve or muscle stimulation (indicated). Data, mean&#x000b1;s.e.m. (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6 mice). Note, that maximum forces are similar in all conditions. Force production upon nerve stimulation in silMyoVa transfected muscles is slightly, but not significantly, reduced. <bold>E:</bold> Quantification of the number of tetani needed to reach 50&#x00025; of fatigue upon nerve or muscle stimulation (indicated). Data, mean&#x000b1;s.e.m. (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6 mice). <bold>F:</bold> Relative duration to reach 50&#x00025; of fatigue upon stimulation of muscle or nerve. Shown are the averaged quotients of muscle divided by nerve stimulation values for each tested muscle. Data, mean&#x000b1;s.e.m. (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6 mice). Note, that in general fatigue is reached upon muscle stimulation much slower than upon nerve stimulation. Interestingly, this difference is much more pronounced in silMyoVa as compared to control animals, suggesting that these muscles have undergone some adaptive processes to maintain a certain level of functionality as effect of the NMJ deteriorating action of silMyoVa transfection.</p><p>(1.22 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003871.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003871.s004"><label>Movie S1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Movement of DLS/LeJ mice is normal at P9.</italic></bold> Video of two healthy (black) and one <italic>dilute</italic> (grey) littermates at P9.
