However, the function of ARHGEF10 in mammalian cells is totally unknown at a molecular level. ARHGEF10 contains no distinctive functional domains except for tandem Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology and putative transmembrane domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we show that RhoA is a substrate for ARHGEF10. In both G1/S and M phases, ARHGEF10 was localized in the centrosome in adenocarcinoma HeLa cells. Furthermore, RNA interference-based knockdown of ARHGEF10 resulted in multipolar spindle formation in M phase. Each spindle pole seems to contain a centrosome consisting of two centrioles and the pericentriolar material. Downregulation of RhoA elicited similar phenotypes, and aberrant mitotic spindle formation following ARHGEF10 knockdown was rescued by ectopic expression of constitutively activated RhoA. Multinucleated cells were not increased upon ARHGEF10 knockdown in contrast to treatment with Y-27632, a specific pharmacological inhibitor for the RhoA effector kinase ROCK, which induced not only multipolar spindle formation, but also multinucleation. Therefore, unregulated centrosome duplication rather than aberration in cytokinesis may be responsible for ARHGEF10 knockdown-dependent multipolar spindle formation. We further isolated the kinesin-like motor protein KIF3B as a binding partner of ARHGEF10. Knockdown of KIF3B again caused multipolar spindle phenotypes. The supernumerary centrosome phenotype was also observed in S phase-arrested osteosarcoma U2OS cells when the expression of ARHGEF10, RhoA or KIF3B was abrogated by RNA interference.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Collectively, our results suggest that a novel RhoA-dependent signaling pathway under the control of ARHGEF10 has a pivotal role in the regulation of the cell division cycle. This pathway is not involved in the regulation of cytokinesis, but instead may regulate centrosome duplication. The kinesin-like motor protein KIF3B may modulate the ARHGEF10-RhoA pathway through the binding to ARHGEF10.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Centrosomes coordinate the cytoplasmic microtubule network serving as the major microtubule-organizing centers in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A single centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by the amorphous pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles are cylindrical structures built of nine sets of triplet microtubules, and lie at right angles to each other and in close proximity at one end. The PCM harbors a number of protein complexes, including the &#x003b3;-tubulin ring complex, which acts as a template for microtubule nucleation. During M phase of the cell cycle, two centrosomes orchestrate the assembly of bipolar mitotic spindles, which is prerequisite for accurate chromosome segregation. Aberrations in centrosome numbers, which frequently occur in aggressive human tumors, almost certainly represent one crucial cause of missegregation of chromosomes, leading to a phenotype termed genetic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore, the rigorous control of the duplication cycle of the centrosome is vital for the cell. However, our understanding of the regulation of the centrosome cycle remains incomplete.</p><p>The signal transducing GTPase RhoA has been implicated in a variety of cellular responses in mammalian cells, being regulated by Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in a cell type- and signal-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Dbl Family GEFs contain Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains in tandem, which are responsible for enhancement of guanine nucleotide exchange on the target GTPase. The DH domain is a catalytic domain whereas the PH domain is thought to be required for the modulation of protein conformation and subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A well characterized function of RhoA is the regulation of cell division, particularly cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Upon onset of anaphase, the GEF ECT2 activates RhoA, leading to the accumulation of activated RhoA at the cleavage furrow. Activated RhoA in turn directs assembly and contraction of the contractile ring through the activation of various downstream effectors, including formin family proteins, the Rho-dependent kinase ROCK and citron kinase. Formin family proteins regulate actin polymerization, allowing the formation of the contractile ring. ROCK and citron kinase are involved in the control of contractile ring ingression and completion of cytokinesis, respectively, through phosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chains.</p><p>Increasing evidence has emerged that RhoA plays a pivotal role not only in cytokinesis, but also in mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For instance, ROCK regulates mother centriole movement in late telophase and exit from mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. During prophase/prometaphase, RhoA and its GEF Lfc are required for the assembly of the mitotic spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Separation and positioning of duplicated centrosomes after nuclear envelope breakdown, which are important for correct spindle alignment, may also be regulated by RhoA and ROCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The Dbl family GEF ARHGEF10 was originally identified as the product of the gene associated with slowed nerve-conduction velocities of peripheral nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, underlying molecular mechanisms are totally unknown. Also, the function of ARHGEF10 in mammalian cell cycle progression remains to be clarified. ARHGEF10 was initially reported to possess a DH domain in its N-terminal portion, but lack the PH domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, however, a less conserved PH domain in tandem with the DH domain was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). C-terminally located two transmembrane domains have also been predicted from amino acid sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Based on the similarity between human and mouse sequences, we identified an additional putative transmembrane domain, which lies immediately adjacent and C-terminal to the original ones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Except for the pair of DH and PH domains and putative transmembrane domains, no functional domain structures have been noted for ARHGEF10. Herein, we investigate the role of ARHGEF10 in cell division control and demonstrate that ARHGEF10 regulates the centrosome number through the action on its target RhoA.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Substrate specificity and subcellular localization of ARHGEF10</bold>.

In this assay, the activated form of the GTPase accumulated within the cell was precipitated by a probe that selectively recognizes the active form, and visualized by immunoblotting. When co-expressed with a fragment of ARHGEF10 that contains catalytic DH and regulatory PH domains, the activated form of ectopically expressed wild-type RhoA was increased, indicating that ARHGEF10 actually showed GEF activity toward RhoA. GEF activity of ARHGEF10 was comparable to that of Dbl, a previously characterized GEF for RhoA. In contrast, GTP loading to Rac1 and Cdc42 was not enhanced by ARHGEF10 as previously described [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and data not shown]. Although a previous study demonstrated GEF activity of ARHGEF10 toward RhoB, we were unable to detect significant GEF activity toward RhoB [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and data not shown]. When ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, a subset of RhoA was indeed co-localized with ARHGEF10 in centrosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) (see below).</p><p>Subcellular localization of ARHGEF10 was then determined by immunofluorescent staining (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;1F</xref>). Of note, ARHGEF10 was localized, at least in part, in centrosomes visualized by counter staining of &#x003b3;-tubulin in unsynchronized HeLa cells in various phases of the cell cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Such centrosomal localization of ARHGEF10 was also evident at least in G1/S and M phases as demonstrated by using synchronized cell culture (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Virtually all centrosomes that we detected by &#x003b3;-tubulin staining were also positive for ARHGEF10. Synchronization of these cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Therefore, ARHGEF10 may be involved in the control of the cell division cycle.</p><p>To gain further insights into the function of ARHGEF10 during cell cycle progression, expression of endogenous ARHGEF10 in HeLa cells was downregulated by two different sets of siRNAs. Decrease in the mRNA level was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), and the effect on protein expression was assessed by the use of an epitope-tagged ectopically expressed ARHGEF10 because we were unable to detect endogenous ARHGEF10 by immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Following synchronization in M phase by nocodazole treatment, aberrant multipolar spindle formation was observed in 30~40% of ARHGEF10-knockdown cells whereas more than 95% of control siRNA-transfected cells showed normal bipolar spindles under the same culture conditions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C&#x02013;2H</xref>). This aberrant spindle formation was not merely due to nocodazole treatment because G2/M arrest of control siRNA-transfected cells by nocodazole did not induce multipolar spindles (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>), and we actually detected multiple centrosomes in mitotic ARHGEF10-knockdown cells without nocodazole treatment (data not shown). ARHGEF10-specific siRNA indeed reduced the amount of centrosome-localized ARHGEF10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Interestingly, we reproducibly observed that two centrosomes contain markedly reduced amounts of ARHGEF10 whereas the expression level of ARHGEF10 in the other centrosome was decreased only partly. All mitotic spindle poles in ARHGEF10-knockdown cells appeared to consist of two centrioles as shown by immunostaining for the centriole marker centrin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Each centrosome was indeed positive for PCM markers &#x003b3;-tubulin, pericentrin and Aurora-A (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;2G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Multipolar spindle formation in ARHGEF10-knockdown HeLa cells</bold>.

Overall, these results suggest that occurrence of multiple centrosomes in ARHGEF10-knockdown cells may not be due to abnormalities incytokinesis. Instead, ARHGEF10 may have a crucial role in the regulation of centrosome duplication considering that ARHGEF10 is localized in centrosomes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;F</xref>).

One possible mechanism for the formation of such supernumerary centrosomes is aborted cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Aneuploid cells generated through aberrant mitotic exit contain more than two centrosomes, which may form multipolar spindles in next M phase. Initially, we thought that aberrant division of cells lacking ARHGEF10 may frequently occur because RhoA is known to be involved in many facets of mitotic and cytokinetic control. However, the occurrence of multinucleated cells was not affected by ARHGEF10 knockdown in contrast to treatment with a ROCK inhibitor, which significantly enhanced the formation of multinucleated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Furthermore, normal ingression of the cleavage furrow was, in fact, detected in ARHGEF10-knockdown cells as well (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Therefore, it is not feasible that ARHGEF10 is responsible for RhoA activation in mitosis and cytokinesis. Instead, ARHGEF10 may regulate RhoA during interphase.</p><p>Deregulated centrosome duplication also leads to the formation of multiple centrosomes and multipolar spindles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, the multi-centrosome phenotype observed in ARHGEF10-knockdown cells may be ascribed to disorder in centrosome duplication. Localization of ARHGEF10 in centrosomes strongly supports this notion. Centriole duplication is initiated by the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 around the G1/S transition, concurrent with DNA replication, and short daughter centrioles elongate during S and G2 phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Following completion of centriole elongation at the G2/M transition, centrosome maturation and separation occur, with a pair of centrioles in each centrosome. Centrosome duplication must occur precisely once every cell cycle, being inextricably coupled with other cell cycle-dependent events. To ensure this, cells are afforded mechanisms (1) to limit centriole duplication to once in every cell division cycle and (2) to limit the number of progenitor centrioles to one per pre-existingcentriole.</p><p>Plenty of molecules that positively regulate centrosome duplication, including Polo-like kinase-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], cyclin-dependent kinase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and SPD-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], have been reported. The phenotype termed centriole overduplication (production of multiple daughter centrioles arranged around each parental centriole) was observed when a positive regulator of centriole duplication, for instance Polo-like kinase-4, is overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] due to a disordered mechanism to limit the number of progenitor centrioles. The supernumerary centrosome formation described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> is distinct from this phenotype, and therefore, the ARHGEF10-RhoA pathway may not be responsible for the copy number control of procentrioles duplicated from a single parental centriole.</p><p>One major mechanism to limit centriole duplication to once in every cell division cycle involves a protein-digesting enzyme termed separase, which is also responsible for sister chromatid separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the normal cell division cycle, centrioles are prevented from duplicating again during late S and G2 phases, being tightly connected or engaged. At the end of mitosis, the engaged centriole pair becomes dissociated, losing their strict orthogonal orientation. This process, called disengagement, is triggered by the action of separase, and is prerequisite for a new round of centriole duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, intrinsic block to centriole reduplication throughout the cell cycle and timely activation of separase represent a mechanism to ensure that a new round of duplication can occur only after passage through M phase. Although speculative, disruption of the ARHGEF10-RhoA-dependent signaling pathway by knocking down its component may permit an excess cycle of centriole duplication if sustained engagement of centrioles or suppression of separase activity during late S and G2 phases requires this pathway. The observation that only two among three centrosomes in ARHGEF10-knockdown cells exhibit diminished ARHGEF10 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) may be consistent with the idea that only a centrosome that lacks ARHGEF10 undergoes an excess duplication cycle before mitosis.</p><p>Multiple mitotic spindles were also observed in cells deficient in the Polo-like kinase-1 target Kizuna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Unlike Kizuna-depleted multipolar cells, however, we did not detect fragmentation of the PCM in ARHGEF10-knockdown cells, suggesting that the ARHGEF10-RhoA pathway is not implicated in stabilization of the PCM in early mitotic phase.</p><p>In this paper, we further identified the motor protein KIF3B as a binding partner of ARHGEF10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). KIF3B has been implicated in a variety of physiological responses, including determination of left-right asymmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], axonal transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], assembly and maintenance of the excitation-contraction-coupling membranes in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and glucose transport in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We observed multiple mitotic spindle poles in KIF3B-knockdown cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), resembling phenotypes observed following expression of a dominant-negative mutant of KIF3B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Considering that ARHGEF10 associates with KIF3B in the centrosome, KIF3B may regulate spindle pole formation through the ARHGEF10-RhoA pathway. KIF3B knockdown may also cause supernumerary centrosomes through cytokinesis defects independently of ARHGEF10 because a dominant-negative mutant of KIF3B caused chromosomal aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The mechanisms may be more complicated because it is reported that silencing of another motor protein KIFC5A causes centrosome amplification primarily through reduplication and partly as a result of defects incytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ARHGEF10 is a RhoA GEF, which is localized in the centrosome in both G1/S and M phases. ARHGEF10 regulates mitotic spindle formation through the action of RhoA. ARHGEF10-regulaed RhoA may be implicated in the control of centrosome duplication rather than cytokinesis.
