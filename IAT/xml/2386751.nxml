EDS patients appear to have a higher risk of several complications during pregnancy, such as pelvic instability, premature rupture of membranes, and postpartum hemorrhage. Here, we present a study of genitourinary and obstetric complications in TNX-deficient women of reproductive age. We have found complications, such as uterus prolapses, that are in agreement with previous findings in other EDS types. In TNX knockout (KO) mice, we have observed mild pregnancy-related abnormalities. Morphological and immunohistological analysis of uterine tissues has not revealed obvious quantitative or spatial differences between TNX KO and wildtype mice with respect to collagen types I, III, V, and XII or elastic fibers. We conclude that TNX-deficient women are at risk of obstetric complications, but that TNX KO mice show only a mild phenotype. Furthermore, we show that TNX is involved in the stability of elastic fibers rather than in their initial deposition.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</kwd><kwd>Tenascin-X</kwd><kwd>Collagen</kwd><kwd>Elastin</kwd><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse (TNX knockout; C57BL/6)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tenascin-X (TNX) is a large, multi-domain, extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein composed of epidermal growth factor (EGF) like-repeats, fibronectin type III repeats, and a C-terminal fibrinogen domain (Bristow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1993</xref>; Lethias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>; Elefteriou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>; Ikuta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1998</xref>; Tucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). Complete deficiency of TNX in humans leads to a rare recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), and TNX haploinsufficiency is a cause of hypermobility type EDS. Patients of both EDS types exhibit mild to severe joint hypermobility. The skin of TNX-deficient patients is markedly lax with poor recoil properties and shows easy bruising. The collagen density appears reduced in the dermis of these patients, and the elastic fibers are abnormal (Burch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1997</xref>; Schalkwijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>; Zweers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2003</xref>; Peeters et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>; Lindor and Bristow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>). Most of the literature concerning pregnancy in EDS uses the old classification of nine subgroups. In our study, we use the revised classification of six subtypes of EDS (Beighton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1998</xref>). Tissue fragility is a hallmark of EDS and is present in all the different subtypes. EDS patients appear to have a higher risk of several complications during pregnancy, such as pelvic instability, premature rupture of membranes, and postpartum hemorrhage. Pregnancy in classical and hypermobility type EDS has a relative favorable maternal and neonatal outcome. Pregnancy in vascular type EDS patients is associated with severe complications including maternal mortality (Pepin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2000</xref>; Carley and Schaffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Roop and Brost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>; Wegrowski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>; Ramos-e-Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>; Lind and Wallenburg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>; Kuczkowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>; Parry and Strauss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1998</xref>). The effect of TNX deficiency on pregnancy has not been studied so far, and only one case report of pregnancy in a TNX-deficient woman has been reported in the literature (Lindor and Bristow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>). Here, we present a study of all known pregnancies and genito-urinary (GU) abnormalities in TNX-deficient woman of reproductive age identified in our clinic (Schalkwijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>) and in the literature (Lindor and Bristow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>; Schalkwijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>). Furthermore, we have extended our studies to a TNX knockout (KO) mouse model in which we have investigated uterine development during pregnancy. We have previously established that TNX is essential for the development of tissue strength in the skin and is able to bind to elastin, a major component of elastic fibers, and to collagens type I, III, V, and XII (Egging et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">b</xref>; Veit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). We have investigated the expression of these molecules at the protein level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TNX-deficient patients</title><p>We investigated pregnancies and GU abnormalities in all currently identified female tenascin-X deficient patients of reproductive age identified in our clinic and in the literature.

All mice investigated for pregnancy abnormalities and morphological changes in uterus tissue were between 2 and 6&#x000a0;months of age, reflecting a normal age distribution of a breeding mice population. Skin samples were taken from 2-month-old and 9-month-old mice, and aortic tissue was obtained from 9-month-old mice.

The sequence of the TNX domains was verified by dideoxy sequencing with a 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwekerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands). TNX FNIII27-32 protein was expressed and purified according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Brunschwig Chemie). Purified TNX FNIII27-32 protein was used for immunization of a rabbit. Aliquots of 500 &#x003bc;g TNX FNIII27-32 in 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with an equal volume of Freund&#x02019;s complete adjuvant for the first injection and Freund&#x02019;s incomplete adjuvant for boosters. Three injections were administered subcutaneously at 3-week intervals.

General reproduction characteristics and GU abnormalities of female TNX-deficient patients are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Maternal and neonatal outcome was generally normal; one out of 13 pregnancies resulted in an intrauterine death of the fetus. Tissue laxity of TNX-deficient patients was demonstrated by the occurrence of vaginal, uterine, and rectal prolapses, even at a relative young age. One case of postpartum hemorrhage was observed in 12 childbirths. None of our patients had urinary incontinence symptoms. TNX-deficient EDS is an autosomal recessive disorder; therefore, all offspring of a TNX-deficient patient and an unaffected individual are obligatory heterozygotes. We have previously found that approximately 60% of adult females that are haploinsufficient for TNX suffer from hypermobility type EDS or benign joint hypermobility syndrome (Zweers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2003</xref>). We found no obvious abnormalities (e.g. floppy infant syndrome, premature birth) in the neonates (obligatory heterozygotes) of our TNX-deficient population; however, some TNX-deficient patients themselves were born prematurely (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Lindor and Bristow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>). Four out of six of the TNX-deficient women had postpartum complications (one of the patients had no pregnancies). This was in agreement with the findings in the literature of an increase in maternal GU complications in EDS-deficient women compared with the control population (Ainsworth and Aulicino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1993</xref>; Carley and Schaffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Kuczkowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>; Lind and Wallenburg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>; Ramos-e-Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>). <table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Pregnancy in TNX-deficient woman (<italic>VUE</italic> vaginal uterine extirpation, <italic>IUD</italic> intra-uterine death, <italic>CAH</italic> congenital adrenal hyperplasia).

GU abnormalities of the TNX KO and WT mice are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Overall, we noted relatively few pregnancy-related abnormalities. Obstruction of the uterine or vaginal canals during partus resulting in a failure to deliver pups was noted more often in WT mice compared with TNX KO mice, but the difference was not significant (Chi-square test). The length of term did not differ significantly for the TNX KO mice (mean: 19.3&#x000a0;days) compared with WT mice (mean: 19.6&#x000a0;days, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). A striking difference, however, between TNX KO and WT was found for the location of the vaginal plug that was present after mating. Generally, the vaginal plug in TNX KO mice was located much deeper in the vaginal canal than in WT mice. This made identification of vaginal plugs in TNX KO mice markedly more difficult, resulting in a significant increase in pregnancies with unknown length of pregnancy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Chi-square test). No uterine or rectal prolapses were observed in this particular study (67&#x000a0;pregnancies of KO and WT mice).

The collagens are present in the perimetrium, the endometrium, and the layers of the connective tissue ensheathing the muscle bundles of the myometrium.

Elastic fibers in the uterus are mostly located in the myometrium and perimetrium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a,b). The endometrium contains few elastic fibers as shown for WT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) and TNX KO (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b) mice. In the myometrium and perimetrium, positive staining for elastin is seen predominantly in the layers of connective tissue ensheathing the transverse muscle bundles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c,d). Despite the relative low abundance of mature elastic fibers in the endometrium, the presence of elastin can be detected by immunohistochemistry, possibly a consequence of the sensitivity of the detection methods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c-d). Elastin localization is similar for WT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c) and TNX KO (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d) mice. We have previously demonstrated binding of TNX with elastin and the colocalization of these two proteins in skin (Egging et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">b</xref>). Consistent with these findings, elastin also (partially) colocalizes with TNX in the uterus, as shown in the myometrium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e). Colocalization of TNX with elastin is not complete, since TNX also colocalizes with fibrillar collagens; however, all elastin-reactive material colocalizes with TNX. In previous work, we have showed an increase in elastin-positive material in the skin of aging TNX KO mice (Egging et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">b</xref>). Although, by light microscopy, the elastic fibers in the TNX KO mouse skin do not appear to be abnormally shaped, an increase in staining might have resulted from an increase in less mature or less organized elastin fibers, an increase in soluble tropoelastin within the matrix, and/or the consequence of more immunoreactive epitopes being available because of an increased susceptibility for degradation. These results are consistent with our past observations of elastic fibers in the skin of TNX-deficient patients in whom irregular and immature elastic fibers and fibers devoid of microfibrils can be seen at the ultrastructural level (Egging et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006b</xref>; Zweers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). Thus, to expand these findings further in skin and to investigate the elastic fibers in the uterus, we have performed an ultrastructural analysis of the elastic fibers in several tissues. Elastic fibers in WT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a) and TNX KO mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b) uteri do not appear to differ in shape or size (shown for uterus 3&#x000a0;weeks postpartum). Similarly, in aorta, the elastic laminae of WT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c) and TNX KO mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d) are similar in shape and number (aorta of 9-month-old mice). In skin of older TNX KO mice (as shown for 9-month-old mice), however, a difference in elastic fiber ultrastructure is apparent compared with WT skin. In addition to normal-appearing elastic fibers, irregular elastin aggregates, as seen in the skin of TNX-deficient patients (Zweers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>), can be observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e,f). These elastin aggregates are not found in the skin of 2-month-old TNX KO mice or in 9-month-old WT mice. Interestingly, elastic fibers in the skin of 9-month-old TNX KO mice often appear larger than those of WT mice of the same age (compare Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>g,h). <fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Elastin and elastic fibers in the uterus (<italic>L</italic> lumen). Elastic fibers (<italic>purple</italic>, modified Hart&#x02019;s staining) are mostly located in the myometrium (<italic>M</italic>, <italic>M*</italic>) and perimetrium (<italic>P</italic>), whereas the endometrium (<italic>E</italic>) appears to contain fewer elastic fibers in WT (<bold>a</bold>) and TNX KO (<bold>b</bold>) mice.

The layers of connective tissue ensheathing the muscle bundles of the myometrium (<italic>M</italic>) and perimetrium (<italic>P</italic>) are stained positively for elastin (<italic>red</italic>).

In classical and hypermobility types of EDS, which are the most common, the outcome of pregnancy is generally favorable. Maternal complications however, such as postpartum hemorrhage and pelvic instability, are more common than in the general population (Ramos-e-Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>; Kuczkowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>; Parry and Strauss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1998</xref>). Furthermore, EDS patients appear to have an elevated risk of uterine prolapse (Carley and Schaffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Lind and Wallenburg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>). Pregnancy in patients with vascular type EDS may even lead to maternal death through uterus or vessel rupture (Pepin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2000</xref>). We have investigated pregnancies and GU abnormalities in TNX-deficient woman of reproductive age. Generally, pregnancy is without major complications in TNX-deficient patients, apart from one noted incident of postpartum hemorrhage. However, uterine and vaginal prolapse regularly occur in TNX-deficient women, even at a young age, suggesting laxity of GU tissues. Premature rupture of fetal membranes is a risk in pregnancy with EDS affected fetuses (Lind and Wallenburg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>; Parry and Strauss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1998</xref>). No premature births have been observed in the offspring of the TNX-deficient patients; however, some TNX-deficient patients had been born prematurely. Obviously, some caution must be taken in making conclusions and extrapolating data from such a small group of TNX-deficient woman.</p><p>Complete TNX deficiency in humans is a rare condition, and so far, only a few patients have been identified. We have therefore investigated pregnancy and uterine tissue structure in our TNX KO mouse model. No gross significant differences have been found with regard to abnormalities during pregnancy or reproduction between the TNX KO and WT mice. A trend toward a reduction in the length of pregnancy in TNX KO mice. The only significant difference has been observed in the location of the vaginal plugs, which suggests laxity in the vaginal wall.</p><p>In a previous study, we have not found any differences in cutaneous collagen deposition between TNX KO and WT mice (Egging et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006b</xref>), as has been observed in the skin of TNX-deficient patients (Schalkwijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>; Zweers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). Alterations in collagen deposition in the skin of TNX KO mice is, however, a matter of debate (Egging et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006b</xref>; Mao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>; Minamitani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>). In the present study, we have found elastin aggregates and enlarged elastic fibers in 9-month-old skin of TNX KO mice at the ultrastructural level; this is in accordance with our previously published data concerning increased elastin staining in aging TNX KO mouse skin (Egging et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006b</xref>). We have detected no differences in elastic fibers in the uterus or elastic laminae of the abdominal aorta between TNX KO and WT mice suggesting a specific role for TNX in the maturation or maintenance of elastic fibers in skin. However, abnormal elastic fibers might not be present in the uterus, since the ECM is constantly being remodeled during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.</p><p>Although the TNX KO mice appear to have a much milder phenotype compared with TNX-deficient humans, the skin of TNX KO mice is significantly weaker and more lax compared with WT mice (Bristow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Burch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1997</xref>; Egging et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006b</xref>; Lindor and Bristow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>; Mao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>; Matsumoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>; Minamitani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>; Schalkwijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>; Zweers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). Our data suggest a more lax vaginal canal in TNX-deficient patients and to a certain degree in TNX KO mice. An attractive speculation, considering the observations from our studies in mice, is that TNX is essential for tissue integrity, independent of the quantity of collagen deposition or elastic fiber structure. In conclusion, we would advise obstetricians and gynecologists to monitor TNX-deficient patients closely, as they are likely to have weaker GU connective tissue and could therefore be at risk of GU complications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Ilona van den Brink, Geert Poelen, Debby Smits, and Brenda van Vliet of the Central Animal laboratory of the Radboud University Nijmegen for their technical assistance.
