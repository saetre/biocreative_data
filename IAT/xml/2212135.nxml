Derived brown preadipocyte cell lines were established to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in PRL signaling on BAT function. Here, we report that newborn mice lacking PRLR have hypotrophic BAT depots that express low levels of adipocyte nuclear receptor PPAR&#x003b3;2, its coactivator PGC-1&#x003b1;, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and the &#x003b2;3 adrenoceptor, reducing mouse viability during cold challenge. Immortalized PRLR KO preadipocytes fail to undergo differentiation into mature adipocytes, a defect reversed by reintroduction of PRLR. That the effects of the lactogens in BAT are at least partly mediated by Insulin-like Growth Factor-2 (IGF-2) is supported by: i) a striking reduction in BAT IGF-2 expression in PRLR KO mice and in PRLR-deficient preadipocytes; ii) induction of cellular IGF-2 expression by PRL through JAK2/STAT5 pathway activation; and iii) reversal of defective differentiation in PRLR KO cells by exogenous IGF-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that the lactogens act in concert with IGF-2 to control brown adipocyte differentiation and growth.

Virtually, no cytoplasmic compartment is visible. In contrast, mitochondria in PRLR KO brown adipocytes are smaller, less packed and presented with elongated and fusiform features.

Electron microscopic analysis of BAT demonstrated striking differences in mitochondrial morphology of PRLR KO mice compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001535-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Smaller, sparse and often elongated mitochondria were present in the cytoplasm of PRLR KO brown adipocytes. This was associated with reduced fat droplets, in accordance with morphological and functional BAT abnormalities. Of note, the number of mitochondrial DNA copies in brown adipocytes of PRLR KO mice did not differ from those in WT mice (supplemental data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001535.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>).

Controls without reverse transcriptase and without template were included to verify that fluorescence was not overestimated by residual genomic DNA amplification or from primer dimer formation. Moreover RT-PCR products were analyzed in a post-amplification fusion curve to ensure that a single amplicon was obtained. Quantification was performed by the standard curve method. Standard curves were generated by serial dilutions of a linearized plasmid containing the specific amplicon, spanning six orders of magnitude, yielding a correlation coefficient of at least 0.98 in all experiments. For all experiments, PCR efficiency was close to 1, indicating a doubling of DNA at each PCR cycle, as expected. Ribosomal 18S RNA was used to normalize for RNA quality, quantity and RT-efficiency. Relative expression within a given sample was calculated as the ratio (attomol of specific gene/fmol of 18S). Results are expressed as mean&#x000b1;SE and represent the relative expression compared to that obtained with control animals or cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Kaplan-Meier</title><p>All experiments and animal care were performed in accordance with the animal facility of the Faculty of Medicine Necker<bold>.</bold> Cold tolerance was accessed by housing newborn mice at 4&#x000b0;C.
