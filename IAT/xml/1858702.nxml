First, through microarray analyses of the AU-rich transcriptome in pituitary &#x003b1;T3-1 cells, we identified 34 ARE-containing transcripts upregulated in cells expressing a constitutively active form of AKT1. In parallel, by an affinity chromatography-based technique followed by microarray analyses, 12 mRNAs target of KSRP, additional to &#x003b2;-catenin, were identified.

Adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AREs), present in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of many inherently labile mRNAs, are the most widespread and best characterized destabilizing sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Impairment of the ARE-mediated mRNA decay results in abnormal cell proliferation and angiogenesis, leading to cancer insurgence and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], as well as in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn-like inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The interaction of regulatory proteins, ARE-binding proteins (ARE-BPs), with their target labile mRNAs determines the half-life (t1/2) of these transcripts. Some ARE-BPs are decay-promoting factors (TTP, BRF1, KSRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Others, such as HuR, are stabilizing factors, whereas AUF1 mainly promotes decay although certain isoforms might be stabilizers of ARE-containing mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. According to the recently proposed recruitment model, destabilizing ARE-BPs, recruit the enzymatic degradation machinery to their target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>We and others have recently reported that KSRP promotes rapid decay of several ARE-containing mRNAs both in vitro and in vivo and that extracellular stimuli regulate its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We have shown that activation of either Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or MAPK p38 signaling in C2C12 myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] selectively regulates the stability of specific sets of labile mRNAs targeting KSRP. More recently, we demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (PI3K-AKT) signaling activation induces stabilization and enhances the steady-state levels of &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA in pituitary &#x003b1;T3-1 cell line through phosphorylation and functional inactivation of KSRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PI3K-AKT signaling exerts a central role in metabolism, cell survival, motility, transcription and cell-cycle progression [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and literature cited therein].</p><p>It has been recently suggested that control of mRNA decay is utilized by the cell to coordinate the expression of genes involved in specific processes leading to the notion of 'post-transcriptional operons' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This would allow multiple genes to be co-regulated by a similar array of RNA-binding proteins in response to certain stimuli. On this basis, we hypothesized that PI3K-AKT activation could regulate the expression of transcripts additional to &#x003b2;-catenin by targeting KSRP. According to this hypothesis, a subset of KSRP target transcripts should be stabilized in response to PI3K-AKT signaling.</p><p>To verify this hypothesis, we systematically searched, among the AU-rich transcriptome, for KSRP target transcripts whose expression was upregulated by PI3K-AKT signaling. We identified a set of labile mRNAs, stabilized upon either KSRP knock-down or PI3K-AKT activation, encoding signaling factors, RNA binding proteins, and a replication-independent histone. These proteins could play a role in the cascade of cellular events initiated by PI3K-AKT activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of KSRP target transcripts upregulated in cells expressing constitutively active myrAKT1</title><p>We recently found by microarray analyses of the AU-rich transcriptome that &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA is stabilized and upregulated by PI3K-AKT signaling in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells in a KSRP-regulated manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To systematically search for inherently labile transcripts whose expression is induced by PI3K-AKT activation, we compared RNA expression profiles of mock-transfected &#x003b1;T3-1 cells (mock-&#x003b1;T3-1) to those of &#x003b1;T3-1 cells expressing a constitutively active AKT1 (&#x003b1;T3-1-myrAKT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]) using the AU-rich element-based cDNA microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This array system contains approximately 2500 cDNA probes for ARE-containing mRNAs and over 1000 cDNA probes for non-ARE mRNAs and control housekeeping genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). For each cell line we obtained expression profiles from two independent RNA samples. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, we identified 35 transcripts at least twofold overrepresented in &#x003b1;T3-1-myrAKT1 when compared to mock-&#x003b1;T3-1 cells. Among these, &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA has been previously reported and characterized (see above, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). All the identified transcripts display AREs in their 3'UTR and encode proteins belonging to distinct functional categories (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>In parallel, in order to identify mRNA targets of KSRP in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells, we adopted the SNAAP technique (isolation of <underline>s</underline>pecific <underline>n</underline>ucleic <underline>a</underline>cids <underline>a</underline>ssociated with <underline>p</underline>roteins) developed by Kiledjian and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] using GST-fused KSRP as the affinity chromatography matrix. This technique allows to isolate only those mRNAs for which the fusion protein of interest has a high affinity at the physiological salt concentrations in the context of a ribonucleoprotein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The identification of KSRP-bound mRNAs was performed by screening the AU-rich element-based cDNA microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Sequence analysis performed on 314 KSRP-interacting mRNAs identified by SNAAP (transcripts upregulated by at least 1.8-fold in KSRP-bound samples), demonstrated over-representation of ARE motifs when compared to 314 non-KSRP target transcripts (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Eighty genes whose mRNAs interacted with KSRP (log<sub>2 </sub>ratio &#x0003e; 1.5, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) were identified. Thirteen of these mRNAs (including previously characterized &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]) displayed a more than 3 fold enrichment (our arbitrary cutoff) over the control GST matrix and were considered for further analysis (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In order to select KSRP target transcripts whose expression is induced by PI3K-AKT activation, we performed a comparative analysis of the results of the two screenings. We sorted out seven unanticipated mRNAs that were both enriched upon SNAAP isolation and over-represented in &#x003b1;T3-1-myrAKT1 cells (typed in bold in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These transcripts encode three distinct RNA binding proteins, hnRNPA1, hnRNPF, and hnRNPA/B, three proteins implicated in cell signaling, the alpha stimulating subunit of guanine nucleotide binding protein (Gs&#x003b1;, encoded by the GNAS locus, GNAS), the alpha isoform of the catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2ACA), and the SH domain containing protein sorbin (SORBIN), as well as the replication-independent histone H3.3A (H3.3A).</p><p>The ARE-containing regions of the novel KSRP target transcripts (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) displayed a potent destabilizing function both in vitro (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and in intact cells (see below, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Purified recombinant KSRP was able to bind, in a dose-response manner, to the AREs of the novel KSRP targets in vitro (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To validate the interaction of the endogenous KSRP with its target transcripts, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments of ribonucleoprotein complexes in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, the seven transcripts were immunoprecipitated by anti-KSRP antibody as well as by anti-hnRNPA1 antibody. No KSRP target mRNA was detected in anti-AUF1 immunoprecipitates under standard experimental conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). However, when the amount of cDNAs obtained by retrotranscription and used in PCR reactions was increased by 10-fold, bands corresponding to hnRNPA/B and prothymosin &#x003b1; (PTMA) mRNAs (both already identified as AUF1 targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) were detected (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Interestingly, also anti-HuR antibody immunoprecipitated the KSRP target mRNAs while anti-TTP antibody immunoprecipitated only hnRNPF and GNAS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) as well as GM-CSF mRNA which is a typical TTP target transcript (data not shown). We obtained similar results performing immunoprecipitation of ribonucleoprotein complexes in C2C12 myoblasts (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>KSRP associates with AUF1p45 and hnRNPA1 in the cytoplasm of &#x003b1;T3-1 cells</title><p>HPLC gel filtration of S100 extracts from &#x003b1;T3-1 cells followed by anti-KSRP immunoblotting analysis, showed that KSRP is present in fractions of molecular mass ranging from 150 KDa to over-440 KDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, top panel). We have previously demonstrated that KSRP functionally associates with components of the mRNA decay machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In order to identify KSRP molecular partners additional to those already known, a yeast two-hybrid screening using KSRP as a bait was performed. We identified several potential KSRP interacting proteins (listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) including the chaperone protein 14-3-3&#x003b6; whose function in KSRP-dependent &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA decay was recently described by Gherzi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We found, among others, the cDNAs encoding two <italic>bona fide </italic>ARE binding proteins, the p45 isoform of AUF1 (AUF1p45) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and hnRNPA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Both AUF1p45 and hnRNPA1 elute together with KSRP in gel filtration fractions ranging from 100 to 200 KDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, middle and bottom panels and data not shown). The interaction of either AUF1p45 or hnRNPA1 with KSRP was confirmed by anti-KSRP immunoprecipitation of RNase A-treated &#x003b1;T3-1 cytoplasmic extracts followed by either anti-AUF1 or anti-hnRNPA1 immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). GST-fused KSRP was able to pull-down both endogenous AUF1p45 and hnRNPA1 from &#x003b1;T3-1 cytoplasmic extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These data, together with those presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> suggest that KSRP target transcripts belong to a ribonucleoprotein complex including AUF1p45 and hnRNPA1.</p><p>We investigated whether either AUF1p45 or hnRNPA1 or both directly interacted with KSRP target transcripts. UV-crosslinking experiments failed to display high affinity interaction of these ARE-BPs with the KSRP target transcripts in vitro (data not shown). This finding suggest that AUF1p45 and hnRNPA1 are part of the KSRP-containing ribonucleoprotein complex but do not directly interact with KSRP targets.</p></sec><sec><title>KSRP knock-down in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells stabilizes KSRP target transcripts</title><p>To verify the relevance of KSRP in the decay control of its target transcripts, stable knock-down of KSRP using a short-hairpin vector was performed in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells (&#x003b1;T3-1-shKSRP; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). KSRP knock-down led to two- to five-fold increase of the steady-state levels of KSRP target mRNAs in &#x003b1;T3-1-shKSRP when compared to mock-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). No changes were seen with the control &#x003b2;2-MG RNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Next, using actinomycin D, we analyzed the t1/2 of the identified KSRP target mRNAs in both mock-&#x003b1;T3-1 and &#x003b1;T3-1-shKSRP cells. Results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> showed that KSRP knock-down in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells strongly increased the t1/2 of all the transcripts (from less than 60 min. in mock-&#x003b1;T3-1 to more than 2 hours in &#x003b1;T3-1-shKSRP cells, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).</p><p>Overall these data indicate that KSRP interacts with a subset of mRNAs up-regulated in cells expressing constitutively active AKT1 and regulates their stability and steady-state levels in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>PI3K-AKT activation stabilizes KSRP target transcripts</title><p>We recently showed that PI3K-AKT activation in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells stabilizes &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA and induces its accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These events are mediated by KSRP phosphorylation and functional inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To investigate whether the activation of the pathway affects the stability of the novel KSRP targets, we took advantage of &#x003b1;T3-1-myrAKT1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, the kinase activity immunoprecipitated with anti-AKT antibody was ~5 fold higher in &#x003b1;T3-1-myrAKT1 than in mock-&#x003b1;T3-1 cells thus demonstrating that active AKT kinase was present in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells expressing myrAKT1. The steady-state levels of KSRP target mRNAs were increased by 2.5-4 fold in intact &#x003b1;T3-1-myrAKT1 cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In addition, the t1/2 of the KSRP mRNA targets was prolonged above 2 hours as a result of AKT1 activation in &#x003b1;T3-1-myrAKT1 cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>).</p><p>Since PI3K-AKT signaling is known to be physiologically activated by insulin treatment [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and literature cited therein], we investigated the effect of insulin treatment on the decay rates of KSRP target transcripts. Insulin treatment of insulin receptor overexpressing HIRc-B cells produced a strong activation of immunoprecipitated AKT activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and caused stabilization of KSRP targets in vitro (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><p>Notably, both the t1/2 and steady-state levels of some of the KSRP targets (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), as exemplified by PTMA, were not affected by PI3K-AKT activation although increased by KSRP knock-down in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these data indicate that activation of PI3K-AKT signaling increased both the t1/2 and the steady-state levels of a subset of KSRP target transcripts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we report that KSRP controls the half-life and the steady-state levels of a set of unanticipated labile mRNAs in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells. The expression and the stability of the majority of these KSRP target transcripts is increased upon activation of PI3K-AKT signaling. Furthermore, we show that KSRP forms a ribonucleoprotein complex together with its target transcripts and the RNA binding protein hnRNPA1.</p><p>Recently, we have shown that activation of PI3K-AKT pathway induces KSRP-controlled regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We hypothesized that PI3K-AKT activation could prolong the t1/2 of ARE-containing mRNAs additional to &#x003b2;-catenin by targeting KSRP.</p><p>In order to identify transcripts whose t1/2 and steady-state levels are controlled by KSRP and respond to PI3K-AKT activation, we performed a comparative analysis of the AU-rich transcriptome of &#x003b1;T3-1 cells focusing our attention onto KSRP target transcripts which are overrepresented in cells expressing a constitutively active AKT1. Microarray-based methods have been successfully used to study global patterns of transcript decay and comprehensively identify targets of RNA-binding proteins thus providing unique insights into gene expression programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We identified a set of mRNAs that interact with KSRP and whose t1/2 and steady-state levels are consistently increased by either KSRP knock-down or PI3K-AKT activation. Among these transcripts, three encode RNA binding proteins mainly implicated in pre-mRNA splicing events (hnRNPA1, hnRNPF, and hnRNPA/B), three encode signaling molecules (Gs&#x003b1;, PP2ACA, SORBIN), and one encodes the replication-independent histone H3.3A. To our best knowledge, none of these transcripts has been yet reported to undergo posttranscriptional control of its expression through regulation of mRNA decay rates.</p><p>Our present data (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) together with our previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] indicate that KSRP interacts with a rather broad array of ARE-like sequences. The criteria used by KSRP to recognize its RNA targets remain still unknown, and to date there are no reports that provide an explanation for its target recognition at the molecular level. Our unpublished structural studies on KSRP domains (M.F. Garcia-Mayoral et al., submitted) show a modularity of the interaction between K-homology (KH) domains 3 and 4 that can increase the adaptability to different RNA sequences/structures thus providing a possible explanation for the ability of KSRP to recognize highly heterogeneous RNA targets. These data indicate that KH3 and KH4 can adapt to different AU-rich sequences within the ARE without being limited by a rigid, pre-existing protein-protein interaction (M.F. Garcia-Mayoral et al., submitted). This provides the protein with a flexible recognition unit than can adapt to different RNA sequences and can mediate interactions in the structural environment of different 3'UTRs.</p><p>PI3K-AKT signaling has been reported to cause phosphorylation and activation of the SR-family members of splicing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, hnRNPA1 has been shown to antagonize the splicing activity of SR proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Increased expression of hnRNPA1 could be viewed as a mean by which PI3K-AKT signaling finely modulates select splicing events. Intriguingly, hnRNPA1 transcript interacts with KSRP in the context of a complex that includes hnRNPA1 protein, thus suggesting the existence of an auto-regulatory loop.</p><p>GNAS gene encodes the Gs&#x003b1; that is required for hormone-stimulated cAMP generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recently, Chen et al. demonstrated that GNAS gene deletion causes increased insulin sensitivity targeting AKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our data allow the hypothesis that AKT could, in turn, regulate Gs&#x003b1; expression and activity operating a negative feed back-control on insulin responsiveness.</p><p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) comprises a family of serine/threonine phosphatases, whose minimal component is a well conserved catalytic subunit [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]]. PP2A plays a prominent role in cell cycle regulation, cell morphology and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We have recently shown that PI3K-AKT activation increases the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin by prolonging its mRNA t(1/2) through functional inactivation of KSRP. Intriguingly, PP2A can de-phosphorylate &#x003b2;-catenin thus preventing its degradation and, therefore, it has been proposed as an activator of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore PI3K-AKT, inducing stabilization of the two KSRP target transcripts &#x003b2;-catenin and PP2ACA, could enhance the cellular levels of &#x003b2;-catenin protein operating a combinatorial positive control. On the other hand, either inhibition or disruption of PP2A complexes leads to AKT activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that PP2ACA mRNA stabilization and enhanced expression could operate a negative feed-back on the effects of either exaggerate or inappropriate PI3K-AKT signaling activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A potential model for KSRP-mediated control of PI3K-AKT/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is presented in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>.</p><p>SORBS1, the human gene that encodes SORBIN, was mapped to the locus which is a candidate region for insulin resistance found in Pima Indians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. CAP, the mouse homologue of SORBIN, is a cytoskeletal adaptor protein involved in modulating adhesion-mediated signaling events that lead to cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It has been shown that stable cell lines overexpressing CAP exhibit a reduced growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Recently, Katsanakis and Pillay showed that AKT phosphorylates the APS protein, a key factor in the signaling events that involve CAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our data support the existence of an additional point of cross-talk between PI3K-AKT signaling and the SORBIN/CAP pathway in insulin signaling.</p><p>Variations in the expression of histone H3.3A, a cell cycle-independent replacement histone, during differentiation of murine erithroleukemia cells, has been hypothesized to depend on post-transcriptional regulatory events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Although histone H3.3A expression regulation has not been reported to be controlled by PI3K-AKT signaling, it has been correlated to cell transformation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the functional role, if any, of the coordinated decay control of the identified transcripts by PI3K-AKT signaling under different physiological and pathological conditions.</p><p>Our data indicate that KSRP interacts with AUF1p45 and hnRNPA1 in the cytoplasm of &#x003b1;T3-1 cells. Only one of the PI3K-AKT-regulated KSRP targets, hnRNPA/B, is very weakly immunoprecipitated by anti-AUF1 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Conversely, anti-hnRNPA1 antibody efficiently immunoprecipitates KSRP target transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Both AUF1p45 and hnRNPA1 bind very weakly to the same RNAs in vitro (data not shown). hnRNPA1 has been implicated in many aspects of mRNA maturation, transport, turnover and in telomere and telomerase regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Hamilton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] reported that hnRNPA1 interacts with ARE-containing mRNAs and suggested a role for this factor in ARE-mediated decay. Our findings allow to hypothesize that AUF1p45 and hnRNPA1 play some, yet unidentified, regulatory role in the ribonucleoprotein complex that includes KSRP and its target transcripts. We can hypothesize that, in response to certain stimuli, the two KSRP-interacting ARE-BPs could acquire high affinity binding for target mRNAs thus either potentiating or terminating the decay-promoting activity of KSRP on the same transcripts.</p><p>The mRNA stability promoting factor HuR interacts with KSRP target transcripts both in vitro (data not shown) and in intact cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We have previously reported that the balanced interaction of KSRP and HuR to common sets of transcripts could allow a fine tuning of mRNA decay regulation upon specific stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Similar results were obtained by Linker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our present data further support the idea that complex interactions in the ARE-BP network are required to ensure accurate regulation of the t1/2 of select transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have identified several KSRP target mRNAs that are overrepresented upon activation of PI3K-AKT signaling. The interaction of KSRP with these transcripts was validated in vitro and in intact cells. Importantly, both KSRP knock-down and PI3K-AKT activation were found to increase the stability and the steady-state levels of these target mRNAs. Our findings provide comprehensive and valuable insight into the KSRP-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes that govern gene expression at the posttranscriptional level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast two hybrid screening</title><p>A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 47&#x02013;711 of human KSRP was cloned into pDBLeu vector (Invitrogen) and used as the bait. MaV203 yeast cells containing pDBLeu-KSRP constructs were tested for self-activation and the concentration of 3-Amino-1,2,3,-Triazole required to inhibit the basal endogenous expression of HIS3 gene was determined. A e12.5 mouse embryo head cDNA library was prepared using the pEXP-AD502 vector according to manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions. pDBLeu-KSRP-containing MaV203 yeast cells were transfected with the library and selected according to the activation of the three reporter genes HIS3, URA3 and LacZ according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of KSRP-co-purifying RNAs</title><p>To isolate mRNAs co-purifying with KSRP, the SNAAP (isolation of <underline>s</underline>pecific <underline>n</underline>ucleic <underline>a</underline>cids <underline>a</underline>ssociated with <underline>p</underline>roteins) technique described by Trifillis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] was used with minor modifications. Briefly, both GST and GST-KSRP fusion protein were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Cells expressing either protein were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 1X Complete protease inhibitors (Roche)), disrupted by sonication, and insoluble material removed by centrifugation. To eliminate bacterial RNAs, the extract was treated with 200 U/ml micrococcal nuclease (GE Healthcare) in the presence of 1 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>at 30 C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped with the addition of 5 mM ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Approximately 4 mg of either GST or GST-KSRP were bound to 1 ml GST-beads in a total volume of 5 ml in RNA binding buffer (RBB; 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 3.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1X Complete) at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h. Unbound proteins were removed with ten 5-ml washes in RBB. The washed beads were resuspended in 5 ml of RBB containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml heparin (Calbiochem) and 200 U/ml RNasin (Promega). Fifty mg of cytoplasmic S100 extracts from &#x003b1;T3-1 cells were precleared with 2 ml of glutathione Sepharose slurry (extensively washed in RBB) to remove background RNAs that bind to the glutathione Sepharose beads. Incubation of the precleared S100 extracts to the above described washed beads was carried out at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h under rotation, followed by six 5-ml washes in RBB. The RNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and chloroform, ethanol precipitated with GlycoBlue (Ambion), and washed with 70% EtOH. The dried RNA was resuspended in 50 &#x003bc;l DEPC-treated H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray hybridization and computational analysis of AREs</title><p>The glass microarrays contained cDNA probes representing more than 3000 ARE-cDNAs and control clones (their identities were obtained from AU-rich element-containing mRNA database ARED 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). The microarrays were hybridized with cDNA generated from total RNA (15 &#x003bc;g) and labeled with either Cy5 or Cy3 (control). The utilized hybridization protocol (Genisphere kit, Genisphere, Inc., Hatfield, PA) eliminated the possibility of signal contribution from genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. cDNA microarrays scanning, pre-processing, filtering of erroneous signals, and normalization were performed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>314 mRNAs enriched by at least 1.8-fold in KSRP-bound RNA samples (KSRP targets) and 314 mRNAs that were not enriched in KSRP-bound RNA samples (non-KSRP targets) were extracted from the microarray data.
