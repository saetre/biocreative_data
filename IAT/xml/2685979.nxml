The present study was designed to establish whether there is a direct causal link between the parasite load during its exponential phase of growth and the disappearance of peripheral blood leukocytes. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments performed with trypanosomes and purified peripheral blood mononucleated cells revealed the existence of a lymphotoxin embedded in the <italic>T. evansi</italic> membrane: a protein sensitive to serine proteases, with a molecular mass of less than 30 kDa. Lymphocytes death induced by this protein was found to depend on the intervention of a lymphocytic protein tyrosine phosphatase. When lymphocytes were exposed to increasing quantities of a monoclonal antibody raised against the extracellular portion of CD45, a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase covering over 10&#x00025; of the lymphocyte surface, <italic>T. evansi</italic> membrane extracts showed a dose-dependent decrease in cytotoxicity. As the regulatory functions of CD45 concern not only the fate of lymphocytes but also the activation threshold of the TCR-dependent signal and the amplitude and nature of cytokinic effects, this demonstration of its involvement in <italic>T. evansi</italic>-dependent lymphotoxicity suggests that <italic>T. evansi</italic> might manipulate, via CD45, the host's cytokinic and adaptive responses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Trypanosomiasis is a lethal disease affecting both humans and livestock.

To our knowledge, and in contrast to mechanisms underlying trypanosomiasis-associated weight loss, anaemia, or mortality, the underlying causes of lymphopenia have not been directly addressed so far. Some available data suggest, however, that lymphopenia can be viewed at least as a marker of trypanotolerance. For example, infection by <italic>T. congolense</italic> of trypanotolerant (West African Dwarf) and trypanosusceptible (Red Sokoto) goat breeds results in lymphopenia only in trypanosusceptible animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Adah1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation was confirmed later and extended to the trypanotolerant Djallonke sheep breed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Goossens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, when recording daily changes in the mouse haemogram after infection with <italic>T. evansi</italic>, we observed a remarkable synchrony between the peak of parasitaemia and the nadir of the white blood cell count <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-AntoineMoussiaux1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The present study was thus designed to establish whether there exists a direct causal link between the parasite load during its exponential phase of growth and the disappearance of peripheral blood leukocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were conducted with leukocytes (peripheral blood mononucleated cells &#x0005b;PBMCs&#x0005d; or splenocytes) purified from blood or spleens from healthy or parasitaemic C57BL/6 mice and phenotyped by flow cytometry. The mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Housing, inoculation, data collection, and euthanasia procedures complied with the NIH guidelines, and the experimental protocol was approved before the study by the Bioethics Committee of the University. The <italic>T. evansi</italic> isolate was obtained from the Institute of Tropical Medicine of Antwerp; it had been isolated in 1997 from a diseased camel by the Agro-Veterinary Institute Hassan II of Rabat (ITMAS #220404A). The parasites were first amplified by a single passage in immune-depressed BALB/c mice (cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/kg body weight). The inoculation procedure consisted of an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of a single 100 &#x000b5;l bolus of a suspension containing 1 to 1.2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> flagellates per millilitre (as measured with a Neubauer haemocytometre), i.e. &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> trypanosomes per mouse. Control mice were mock-inoculated with 100 &#x000b5;l of a suspension containing killed trypanosomes.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Flow cytometric phenotyping</title><p>Leukocytes were labelled with a combination of antimurine CD4-allophycocyanin (rat IgG2a, clone RM4-5, BD Biosciences), CD19-PE-Cyanin7 (rat IgG2a, clone 1D3, BD Biosciences), and CD8-APC-Cyanin7 (rat IgG2a, clone 53-6.7, BD Biosciences), propidium iodide, and annexin V-FITC (Apoptest-FITC&#x02122;, DakoCytomation). Three microlitres of each antibody were distributed into Eppendorf tubes. Then, 500 &#x000b5;l of fresh leukocytes (total leukocytes, PBMCs, or splenocytes, within 1 h of withdrawal &#x0005b;see below&#x0005d;) suspended in PBS were added, gently mixed, and incubated for 20 min on ice in the dark. Afterwards, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and the Apoptest-FITC&#x02122; kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (15 min). Samples were analysed within 10 min in a FacsCanto (BD Biosciences) flow cytometre. Instrument settings were adjusted using fresh PBMC samples in eight tubes (an unlabelled sample, five single-labelled samples, one isotype-matched nonpertinent control, and one sample labelled with the mixed antibodies) and FACS Diva&#x02122; calculation software (BD Biosciences). Detection and compensation stability were tested daily with SetUp&#x02122; beads and FACSCanto&#x02122; software (BD Biosciences). Dot plots were analyzed with FACS Diva&#x02122; (v.5.0.3., BD Biosciences) software. Absolute counts were obtained by multiplying the number of events detected in each subpopulation of events by the volume of the suspension analysed by the cytometer and by normalizing the result obtained to 1 ml mouse blood (taking the dilution factor of the blood into account). The volume of the cell suspension analysed is the product of the duration of the analysis (s) by the sample flow rate (1 &#x000b5;l/s).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> studies</title><p>Two successive <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were conducted first.

The second was designed to establish whether observed changes would be altered by neutralization of tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) or nitric oxide (NO) (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;18, of which 6 controls were mock-inoculated). TNF&#x003b1; neutralization was achieved by daily ip injection of 10 &#x000b5;g anti-mouse TNF&#x003b1; mAb (rat IgG1, clone MP6-XT22, Biosource) into each mouse (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Kim1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The L-NAME-treated and untreated control groups were mock-injected ip daily with 50 &#x000b5;l PBS. Seven successive blood samples were drawn from each mouse enrolled in each study, three before inoculation (bi) to reveal the normal leukogram (72, 48, and 24 hours bi) and four post-inoculation (pi) during the ascending phase of the first parasitaemic wave, as determined from preliminary studies (52, 64, 82, and 92 hours pi). The blood sampling procedure consisted in collecting a volume of 10 to 15 &#x000b5;l tail blood by capillarity with a heparinized 75-&#x000b5;l micro-haematocrit tube (Hirschmann Laboger&#x000e4;te). Parasitaemia and haematological changes were evaluated by flow cytometry as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-AntoineMoussiaux1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. For monitoring apoptosis/necrosis in leukocytes, 10 &#x000b5;l heparinized blood was gently mixed with 500 &#x000b5;l red blood cell lysis solution (0.15 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 10 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-EDTA, 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>) and leukocytes were harvested by centrifugation (8 min at 300 g and 4&#x000b0;C), washed once in ice-cold PBS with 5&#x00025; BSA, and suspended in 500 &#x000b5;l PBS for labelling.</p><p>After the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were conducted (see below), a third <italic>in vivo</italic> study was designed to establish whether the &#x0003c;30 kDa filtrate of the non-cytosolic fraction of the parasites would alter leukocyte counts and regressive changes when injected intravenously. Mice were treated iv with 100 &#x000b5;l of either PBS (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) or the semi-purified non-cytosolic fraction (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6), the latter corresponding to 4&#x02013;5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> trypanosomes per ml of blood. Two successive blood samples were drawn from each mice, the first 30 min before and the second 120 min after the injection and haemogram and leukocyte apoptosis/necrosis changes were monitored as aforedescribed.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> studies</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Cells</title><p>Peripheral blood lymphocytes and other mononucleated cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the pooled blood of a set of healthy donor mice by polysucrose density gradient centrifugation at room temperature (Accuspin&#x02122; System Histopaque&#x000ae;-1077, Sigma). After centrifugation the supernatant was discarded and the cell-containing opaque band at the interface between plasma and Histopaque&#x000ae;-1077 was collected carefully. The PBMCs were then washed once with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), centrifuged (300 g, 10 min at room temperature), washed another three times in HBSS, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (10&#x00025;), MEM non-essential amino acids (1&#x00025;), penicillin (1&#x00025;), streptomycin (1&#x00025;), and 2-mercaptoethanol (0.002&#x00025;) for cell count determination (Neubauer chamber). Then the cell suspensions were adjusted to 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml, distributed into Cellstar&#x000ae; 24-well plates (100 &#x000b5;l/well, i.e. 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well, Greiner Bio-One), and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C under 95&#x00025; humidity and 5&#x00025; carbon dioxide. After 30 or 60 min (see below), 50 &#x000b5;l of each well suspension was transferred to BD FACS tubes, diluted 10 times with PBS, and phenotyped with the Apoptest-FITC&#x02122; kit prior to flow cytometric detection of necrotic and apoptotic cells. Splenocytes were isolated by passaging minced spleen fragments through a nylon mesh and mixing with red blood cell lysis solution. Afterwards, they were conditioned and analysed like PBMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Parasites and parasite fractions</title><p>Trypanosomes were isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Lanham1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> from the pooled blood of a set of donor mice that had been inoculated 96 hours before exsanguination, i.e. during the exponential phase of parasite growth. Purified parasites were collected in phosphate saline glucose (pH 8), washed, and resuspended in the supplemented RPMI 1640 medium (live parasites) or PBS (killed parasites) for counting (Neubauer chamber). Trypanosome-free plasma from the same donor mice was obtained by centrifuging and filtering (0.2 &#x000b5;m pores) heparinized whole blood. Serial dilutions were made by adding plasma drawn from healthy mice. To generate trypanosome fractions, a suspension titrating 4&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> parasites per ml, obtained by DEAE-cellulose chromatographic isolation, was repeatedly freeze-thawed, thoroughly vortexed until no intact trypanosome could be detected under the microscope, and centrifuged for 30 min at 14 000 g and 4&#x000b0;C to separate the cytosolic and non-cytosolic fractions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Firstly, PBMCs were exposed to fresh trypanosomes and to trypanosome-free plasma purified from the pooled blood of a set of donor mice having been inoculated 96 hours before exsanguination, i.e. during the exponential phase of parasite growth. The stock suspension was adjusted to 10<sup>9</sup> parasites/ml, and a series of dilutions was made before 150 &#x000b5;l of each was distributed into the above-mentioned PBMC/splenocyte-containing 24-well plates. The dilutions were calculated so as to expose the PBMCs/splenocytes to parasite concentrations approximating those observed during the exponential phase of parasite growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. The PBMCs/splenocytes were thus exposed to the following parasite concentrations (each in triplicate): 0, 4&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>, 4&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>, 2&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>, 3&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>, 4&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>, and 6&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> trypanosomes/ml, corresponding to parasite-to-cell ratios of 0, 10, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1500 respectively. In the second study, PBMCs were exposed to live or dead trypanosomes (4&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>/ml) and to corresponding cytosolic and non-cytosolic fractions. In the third study, splenocytes were exposed to serial dilutions of the non-cytosolic fraction for 15 to 120 min. In the fourth study, the non-cytosolic fraction was first stored for 24 hours before being added to the splenocyte suspension. Different conditions were imposed during storage: (i) 4 or 37&#x000b0;C, (ii) 4 or 37&#x000b0;C with/without inhibitors of serine proteases (Pefabloc&#x000ae; SC, 1 mM, Fluka), (iii) 37&#x000b0;C with/without inhibition of cysteine proteases (E64, 10 &#x000b5;M, Sigma-Aldrich), (iv) 4 or 37&#x000b0;C with/without proteinase K (5 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), and (v) 37&#x000b0;C with/without DNAse I (2000 U/ml, Invitrogen). In the fifth study, the non-cytosolic fraction was sub-fractionated by means of Microcon centrifugal filter devices with cut-offs at 50 and 30 kDa (Millipore). Splenocytes were then exposed for 75 min to the recovered filtrates and retained material. In the sixth study, splenocytes were exposed to the non-cytosolic fractions (complete and both filtrates) for 75 min after addition of phosphatase inhibitor 1 or 2 (Sigma-Aldrich), each at 1&#x02236;100 (v/v) dilution, to the incubation mixture. At neutral pH, these inhibitors specifically inhibit serine/threonine or protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), respectively. Next, the phosphatase activity of each fraction was measured with a colorimetric <italic>p</italic>NPP Protein Phosphatase Assay Kit (AnaSpec SensoLyte&#x02122;). Finally, a CD45 PTPase inhibition assay was carried out, in which splenocytes were exposed to increasing concentrations (1, 1.5, and 2 &#x000b5;g/5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells) of anti-CD45.2 mAb (mouse IgG2a, clone 104-2, Abcam) for 10 min prior to addition of the non-cytosolic fraction. Anti-CD45.1 mAb (mouse IgG2a, clone A20, Abcam), targeting an epitope that is absent in C57BL/6 mice, was used as a control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>A mixed-model analysis was applied to the <italic>in vivo</italic> data in order to test the effect of infection on each dependent value using a combination of autoregressive structures within animals (time points) and a random effect between animals (SAS&#x000ae; software v. 8.2, <italic>Mixed procedure</italic>, SAS Institute Inc. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Littell1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>).

The quantitative values of the parasitaemia peak and leukocyte-count nadir and of the rising and descending slopes were quite reproducible from wave to wave and from mouse to mouse. In a second experiment, total lymphocytes and healthy (annexin V- and PI-negative), apoptotic (annexin V-positive and PI-negative), and necrotic (annexin V- and PI-positive) lymphocytes were counted during the exponential growth phase of the first parasitaemia wave by increasing the number of blood samples taken during the appropriate time window identified in the first experiment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005728-t001">Table 1</xref>). Overall, the counts of circulating parasites and lymphocytes were again found to evolve antisynchronously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005728-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

Populations P1 and P2 showed identical morphological profiles (FSC/SSC), whereas population P3 displayed a diminished FSC, suggesting a smaller size. As necrosis is a stepwise process in which cells become progressively smaller and more permeable to PI, the three populations most likely correspond to intact cells (P1) and to cells undergoing early (P2) and late (P3) steps of the necrosis process. The fact that a small population of cells undergoing necrosis (2.8&#x000b1;0.3&#x00025; &#x0005b;P2&#x0005d; and 11.7&#x000b1;0.3&#x00025; &#x0005b;P3&#x0005d;) was consistently found among mock-exposed control PBMCs probably reflects a deleterious effect of the purification process.</p><fig id="pone-0005728-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005728.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Exposure of mouse PBMCs to trypanosomes results in cell death.</title><p>Forward (FSC) and side (SSC) scatter dot plots (upper panels) and corresponding frequency distribution of PI incorporation among mock- and killed <italic>T. evansi</italic>-exposed PBMCs.

In contrast, PBMC exposure to a suspension in RPMI of live trypanosomes purified from a pool of blood taken from parasitaemic mice considerably modified the relative sizes of the three populations, increasing significantly the size of populations P2 and P3 and thus suggesting trypanosome-triggered induction of necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005728-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This pronecrotic activity was found to increase with the duration of PBMC exposure to the trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005728-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). A sigmoid profile was obtained when the relative size of population P2 was plotted versus the quantity of trypanosomes added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005728-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), the increase being quasi-linear at parasite-to-PBMC ratios between 500 and 1000.

The present total and subset-specific lymphocyte counts for control mice are similar to previously reported counts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Chen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The total lymphocyte count decreased sharply when the parasite load approached 10<sup>7</sup>/ml, reaching a nadir &#x0223c;6 hours after the peak parasitaemia and recovering quickly when parasitaemia declined. These measurements in laboratory mice confirm the observations of lymphopenia noted in most reports on trypanosomiasis cases. They suggest a possible causal link. Lymphopenia might imaginably arise through bone marrow or thymus suppression, altered lymphocyte trafficking, or through a direct pronecrotic or pro-apoptotic action of trypanosomes on lymphocytes, as recently described for the spleen marginal zone IgM&#x0002b; B cell population during early onset of a <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Radwanska1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. As peripheral lymphocyte counts recovered steeply after the parasite wave waned, suppression of leukopoiesis seems unlikely. Furthermore, the fact that inhibition of NO production and neutralization of TNF&#x003b1; exacerbated lymphocyte loss rules out the possibility that NO production or TNF&#x003b1; signalling might contribute to leukopenia as they contribute to anaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Mabbott1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Mabbott2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Magez1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the lymphopenia worsened concomitantly with increasing parasite load. This, again, suggests a link. No alterations typical of necrosis/apoptosis were detected among peripheral blood lymphocytes, even when activated caspase 3 was sought by western blotting in buffy coats from highly parasitaemic mice (&#x0003e;10<sup>8</sup> trypanosomes/ml, data not shown). Yet as altered lymphocytes most likely undergo rapid sequestration <italic>in vivo</italic>, the possible triggering of apoptosis or necrosis by trypanosomes was sought <italic>in vitro</italic>. As the lymphocyte subset ratios were significantly altered too, it might be that the process engaged or its kinetics differs between subsets. Moreover, while T lymphocyte counts showed a continuous decrease, B lymphocyte counts showed a biphasic change, with an early short-lived increase (52 h pi) followed by a dramatic abatment, which suggests that the expected B cell expansion duly occurred but was not sustainable in face of the rising parasitaemia.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> studies</title><p>After purification and a 60-min incubation at 37&#x000b0;C in RPMI, about 20&#x00025; of the mock-exposed PBMCs displayed spontaneously occurring regressive alterations typical of either necrosis (&#x0223c;15&#x00025;) or apoptosis (&#x0223c;5&#x00025;). An identical profile was observed when the cells were incubated in the presence of trypanosome-free plasma from parasitaemic, lymphopenic mice. These first <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggest (i) that the purification process itself affected about one-fifth of the cells and (ii) that trypanosomes do not secrete a soluble factor capable of causing necrosis or apoptosis of circulating lymphocytes and thus explaining the lymphopenia. Addition of live trypanosomes to the PBMC-containing medium did not cause apoptosis but it did lead to a concentration- and contact-time-dependent increase in the number of cells undergoing necrosis. To our knowledge, there exists no previous data establishing the existence of trypano-dependent necrosis, although it is known that <italic>T. cruzi</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-DosReis1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Lopes1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Zhang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>T. brucei</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Radwanska1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Radwanska2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> can cause apoptosis. The present study thus suggests that induction of necrosis by the parasite itself is at least partially responsible for the lymphopenia occurring concomitantly with parasitaemia peaks. When PBMCs were incubated with killed trypanosomes, the effect was similar, albeit less drastic. This suggests that parasite motion may favour the pronecrotic activity, probably by maximizing parasite-lymphocyte contacts. On the other hand, only the non-cytosolic fraction of the parasites was able to reproduce the pronecrotic effect exerted by whole trypanosomes. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a parasite-membrane-associated pronecrotic factor whose activity depends on direct physical contact with lymphocytes. Furthermore, it is known that the phospholipases released during the parasite fractioning procedure cleave part of the &#x000ab;variable surface glycoproteins&#x000bb; (VSGs), which are thus abundant in both fractions studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Jackson1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Magez2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It therefore seems likely that VSGs do not intervene in the necrotic process. By subjecting the non-cytosolic fraction to various pre-treatments we have refined our picture of the pronecrotic factor: firstly, it is resistant to protease inhibitors and to cysteine proteases but sensitive to serine proteases. This suggests that it consists of one or several non-cytosolic, and hence probably membrane-associated, proteins that are not proteases and that possess the cleavage site used by serine proteases. Secondly, our data concerning the sub-fractions obtained from the non-cytosolic fraction by successive filtrations show that the molecular mass of the pronecrotic factor is below 30 kDa; this again suggests that VSGs are not concerned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Uzcanga1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, intravenous injection of the &#x0003c;30 kDa non-cytosolic subfraction duly reproduced a dramatic lymphopenic trough, which demonstrates that the pronecrotic factor works <italic>in vivo</italic> as well.</p><p>Our results obtained with one phosphatase inhibitor added to the medium reveal that <italic>T. evansi</italic>-associated necrosis is PTPase dependent. As the inhibitor used (sodium orthovanadate) is cell permeable, the PTPase concerned could be parasitic or lymphocytic. The fact that the final filtrate obtained by parasite fractionation (&#x0003c;30 kDa) still exerts pronecrotic activity without showing any phosphatase activity rules out the possibility that the PTPase concerned derives from the parasite. This leads quite naturally to the hypothesis that the lymphocyte-membrane-associated PTPase CD45 might be the PTPase in question, given its status as a prototype PTPase and its abundance at the lymphocyte surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Hermiston1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This hypothesis is corroborated by our observation that addition of an anti-murine-CD45 mAb caused a 50&#x00025; decrease in the number of cells undergoing necrosis as a result of exposure to the various non-cytosolic trypanosome fractions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such an interaction between lymphocyte-associated CD45 and a trypanosomal-membrane-associated protein ligand. The known regulatory functions of CD45 concern the activation threshold of the TCR-dependent signal, the magnitude and nature of cytokinic responses, and lymphocyte fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Tchilian1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, CD45-null mice show increased cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Byth1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and ligation of CD45 by antibodies or galectin leads to cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Perillo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Fortin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Steff1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005728-Gregori1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The present demonstration of CD45 involvement in <italic>T. evansi</italic>-dependent lymphotoxicity thus points to a possible manipulation of the host's cytokinic and adaptive responses by trypanosomes via CD45. The large extracellular domain of CD45 is notable for its highly glycosylated and sialylated state, which varies according to the inclusion or exclusion of alternatively spliced exons 4, 5, and 6. The resulting isoforms are specific not only to the haematopoietic cell type, but also to the stage of differentiation and activation of the cell. This observation might explain why only a fraction of the circulating PBMCs showed PI incorporation upon exposure to trypanosome extracts. It has also been suggested that these alternative isoforms might interact with unique ligands, but to date, no isoform-specific ligand has been convincingly identified. In the present case, the leukotoxic trypanosomal ligand concerned remains to be determined. All we can say about it is that it is a serine-protease-sensitive membrane protein with a molecular mass of less than 30 kDa.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr M.-M.
