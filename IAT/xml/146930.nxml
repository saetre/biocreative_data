Hence, scs32 only partially suppressed the ts phenotype and was unable to suppress the Ino-phenotype of rpo26-31. SCS32 is identical to PUP3, which encodes a subunit of the yeast proteasome. scs32 was able to suppress the phenotype of other ts alleles of RPO26, all of which reduce the steady-state level of this subunit. However, scs32 was unable to suppress the ts phenotype of mutant alleles of RPO21, or result in accumulation of the unstable rpo21-4p. These observations suggest that the stability of non-functional or unassembled forms of Rpo26p and Rpo21p are regulated independently.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
