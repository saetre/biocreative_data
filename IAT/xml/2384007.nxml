Biotin is an essential co-factor for acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) the enzyme involved in the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, a committed precursor, needed for fatty acid synthesis. Biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) provides the co-factor for catalytic activity of ACC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>BPL/BirA (Biotin Protein Ligase), and its substrate, biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mt</italic>) were cloned and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21. In contrast to <italic>Ec</italic>BirA and <italic>Ph</italic>BPL, the &#x0223c;29.5 kDa <italic>Mt</italic>BPL exists as a monomer in native, biotin and bio-5&#x02032;AMP liganded forms. This was confirmed by molecular weight profiling by gel filtration on Superdex S-200 and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Computational docking of biotin and bio-5&#x02032;AMP to <italic>Mt</italic>BPL show that adenylation alters the contact residues for biotin. <italic>Mt</italic>BPL forms 11 H-bonds with biotin, relative to 35 with bio-5&#x02032;AMP. Docking simulations also suggest that bio-5&#x02032;AMP hydrogen bonds to the conserved &#x02018;GRGRRG&#x02019; sequence but not biotin. The enzyme catalyzed transfer of biotin to BCCP was confirmed by incorporation of radioactive biotin and by Avidin blot.

The resurgence of this disease has primarily been due to the emergence of drug resistant tubercle, especially to the most effective drug, isoniazid (INH) (1&#x02013;3). The ability of bacteria to survive inside hostile environment of host macrophage is primarily due to its complex lipid bilayer formed by mycolic acids, glycolipids, lipoproteins etc. In fact, it is estimated that lipids constitute 40&#x00025; of mycobacterial dry cell weight. Thus, biosynthesis and assembly of mycolic acids and other lipids constitute potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention for treating tuberculosis (4&#x02013;6). <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> genome contains &#x0223c;250 enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis as compared to just about 50 in <italic>E.coli</italic> (7, 8). Fatty acid synthesis involves carboxylation of nascent chain which requires acetyl CoA carboxylase, a biotin dependent carboxylase which has three functionally dissimilar domains: (1) biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP); (9) biotin carboxylase component that catalyzes Mg- ATP-dependent carboxylation of BCCP to form {COO}<sup>&#x02212;</sup>- BCCP; and transcarboxylase component that catalyzes transfer of carboxyl group from {COO}<sup>&#x02212;</sup>- BCCP to acetyl CoA to form malonyl CoA (9,10). ApoBCCP is biotinylated by <bold><underline>B</underline></bold>iotin <bold><underline>P</underline></bold>rotein <bold><underline>L</underline></bold>igase (BPL/BirA) to form holoBCCP, which then participates in carboxylation reaction. The biotinylation reaction by BPL is a two-step process:</p><p>Biotin&#x0002b;ATP&#x02192;biotinyl-5&#x02032;-AMP&#x0002b;PPi</p><p>Bio-5&#x02032;-AMP&#x0002b;apocarboxylase (BCCP)&#x02192;holocarboxylase (biotin- BCCP)&#x0002b;AMP</p><p>BPL (EC 6.3.4.15) catalyses transfer of biotin to an &#x003b5; -amino group of a specific lysine residue, which is usually the 35<sup>th</sup> amino acid from C-terminal of apoBCCP and converts it to active holoBCCP which promotes fatty acid initiation and elongation (11, 12). The biotinylation reaction is highly specific, as BCCP subunit of biotin dependent carboxylase is the only substrate for BPL.</p><p>There are two variants of prokaryotic BPLs classified as:</p><p><italic>Group I</italic>, a monofunctional enzyme lacks N-terminal HTH domain e.g. <italic>M.tuberculosis, A.aeolicus, P.horikoshii.</italic></p><p><italic>Group II</italic>, a bifunctional enzyme, has N-terminus HTH domain which attributes repressor function to the protein e.g. <italic>E.coli, B.subtilis, P.aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>In Group II BPL, adenylated biotin (bio-5&#x02032;-AMP), an intermediate of BPL/BirA catalyzed reaction complexes with the protein (<italic>E.coli</italic> BirA &#x02013; 321 amino acids) to cooperatively repress genes of biotin biosynthetic pathway (12). Group I BPL (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> BPL &#x02013; 266 amino acids) lacks N-terminal DNA binding domain and hence probably does not function as a repressor (13). So, the mechanism of repression of biotin biosynthetic pathway of group I BPL and organisms harboring them is yet to be ascertained.</p><p>One of the most successful anti tuberculosis drug, isoniazid, also inhibits elongation of fatty acid. Thus, our interest was focused on biotin protein ligase as it globally determines level of fatty acid synthesis. In this study, we expressed purified and characterized <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> BPL (<italic>Mt</italic>BPL) and its substrate BCCP. Moreover, this is the first report on thermodynamic parameters of group I BPL.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p><italic>Determination of dimerization of BPL by Superdex S200 column</italic>: Equimolar concentration of purified i) BPL, ii) BPL catalysed reaction: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH- 8.0 containing 0.1 mM BPL, 3 mM ATP, 5.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 500 &#x000b5;M biotin and iii) negative control which is reaction mixture without BPL were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. The whole enzymatic process was done in the absence of BCCP, in order to determine the oligomeric status of adenylate intermediate of BPL. The reaction mixture was then individually loaded onto Superdex S-200 FPLC column. BPL without its substrate eluted as a single peak at volume corresponding to a Mr of &#x0223c;29,500&#x000b1;150 Da, confirming that BPL exists mostly as a monomer in its native state. This was further confirmed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). <italic>Mt</italic>BPL incubated with biotin also eluted as a single peak of molecular weight of &#x0223c;29,500. <italic>Mt</italic>BPL catalyzed reaction with biotin and ATP resulting in bio-5&#x02032;AMP, gave three peaks corresponding to a minor peak of molecular weight range Mr of 56,000&#x000b1;350 Da, a second peak of Mr &#x0223c;29,500&#x000b1;150 Da and a third peak corresponding to low molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The sample that eluted at lower molecular mass range (peak 3) displayed absorption in UV region and was confirmed as ATP by thin layer chromatography. The minor peak 1 corresponding to molecular weight range of Mr &#x0223c;56,000 Da was the dimeric <italic>Mt</italic>BPL - bio-5&#x02032;AMP - <italic>Mt</italic>BPL. The second peak of molecular weight range Mr &#x0223c;29,500 was monomeric <italic>Mt</italic>BPL - bio-5&#x02032;AMP. Both peak 1 and 2 were holoenzyme (<italic>Mt</italic>BPL - bio-5&#x02032;AMP), as they biotinylated <italic>Mt</italic>BCCP in the absence of biotin and ATP. To confirm if the peaks exist in equilibria, the monomeric peak was repartitioned on the same column. The monomeric species eluted as a single peak of molecular size of &#x0223c;29,500 Da.

Biotin protein ligase which globally controls this pathway is a potential target for anti-mycobacterial drugs. <italic>Mt</italic>BPL shares &#x0223c;25&#x00025; and 31&#x00025; sequence homology with <italic>Ph</italic>BPL and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA respectively. It belongs to monofunctional group I BPL as it lacks the 60 amino acid N-terminal HTH domain.

Deletion of the N-terminal domain converted <italic>Ec</italic>BirA from bifunctional to monofunctional protein (16).</p><p>The present study shows that <italic>Mt</italic>BPL differs from biotin ligase of other species both in interaction with its substrates and molecular mechanism of catalysis. Homodimerization is coupled to co- repressor synthesis and is a pre-requisite for repressor function in <italic>Ec</italic>BirA (16). Monofunctional <italic>Ph</italic>BPL (Group I) is a dimer in all the three forms viz. apo, biotin and bio-5&#x02032;AMP liganded forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g008">Figure 8</xref>). <italic>Ph</italic>BPL in spite of lacking repressor function does exist as a dimer.

The peak corresponding to monomeric <italic>Mt</italic>BPL (peak 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g001">Figure 1</xref>) was holoenzyme as it biotinylated <italic>Mt</italic>BCCP. However, bio-5&#x02032;AMP binding does promote weak physiological dimerization of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL similar to that observed when biotin binds to <italic>Ec</italic>BirA.

It would be interesting to study the oligomerization property of this truncated protein on bio-5&#x02032;AMP synthesis Thus, our gel exclusion profiling studies suggest that monofunctional <italic>Mt</italic>BPL does not require dimerization for catalysis. Hence from studies on different BPLs, it is evident that oligomerization may not be a universal phenomena for all BPLs and some of them such as <italic>Ph</italic>BPL and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA, undergo oligomerization for compaction and thermo-stability in their apo/holo forms (17, 18).</p><fig id="pone-0002320-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002320.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>A schematic illustration of apo form, biotin and bio-5&#x02032;AMP forms of <italic>Ph</italic>BPL, <italic>Mt</italic>BPL and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002320.g008"/></fig><p>It is known that <italic>Ph</italic>BPL is a dimer in all the three forms, apo, biotin and bio-5&#x02032;AMP liganded, while <italic>Ec</italic>BirA is a dimer when associated with bio-5&#x02032;AMP but monomeric in apo and biotin-liganded form. From our studies it was observed that <italic>Mt</italic>BPL is monomeric in all the three forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Sequence analysis shows conserved sequences between <italic>Mt</italic>BPL, <italic>Ec</italic>BirA and <italic>Ph</italic>BPL. Four homologous sequences between the three BPLs are shown (19). However, the identity of other residues dispersed in the protein sequences are also conserved but are not specified. Sequence SS1 interacts with biotin in <italic>Ph</italic>BPL and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA. Earlier studies by Kwon and Beckett (2000) show that the consensus &#x02018;GRGRXGR&#x02019; sequence is involved in binding of biotin and bio-5&#x02032;AMP (20). Docking studies of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL and biotin show that sequence SS1 was involved in interaction with bio-5&#x02032;AMP but not biotin. In fact, except for residues <sup>66</sup>Gly and <sup>67</sup>Arg which were involved in hydrophobic interaction with the thiophene ring, the reminder of the conserved sequence appears to be of little or no consequence for the recognition of biotin. From ITC studies, it was observed that <italic>Mt</italic>BPL has a dissociation constant of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g004">Figure 4a</xref>). Hence, the hydrogen bond between the hydrophilic residues, Ser 38, Thr39, Asn40, Gln81, Ser85 and biotin contribute to this association. The hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile83, Leu84, Ala140, Gly141, Ile142, Leu143, Gly154, Val 155, and Gly156 probably dock the thiophene ring of biotin. Bio-5&#x02032;AMP interacts with Arg67, His70, Gly71, Arg72 of the conserved &#x02018;GRGRHGR&#x02019; sequence by H-bonds and hydrophobic interaction. Asn158 contributes two H-bonds to the adenylate and the purine ring stacks on the face of the indole ring of Trp74 and makes H-bond with Asn158, and side-chain of alanine 65. An analogous interaction in <italic>Ec</italic>BirA, is provided by Phe which replaces alanine of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL at the homologous position. In <italic>Ec</italic>BirA, biotin binding site is a hydrophobic groove with hydrogen binding partners Ser89 and Thr90 pre- positioned to accept biotin (21). From our computational studies, it was observed that homologous residues Ser38 and Thr39 of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL H-bond with biotin. Thus, residues Ser38, Thr39 for biotin and &#x02018;GRGRHGRGW&#x02019; sequence for bio-5&#x02032;AMP may contribute largely to association of ligands. From docking simulations, biotin has 52 and bio-5&#x02032;AMP has 117 interactions with <italic>Mt</italic>BPL. The number of interactions involved and the larger surface area occupied by bio-5&#x02032;AMP protects <italic>Ec</italic>BirA from proteolysis. This suggests that though bio-5&#x02032;AMP is an intermediate molecule; its complex with BPL is most stable. However, these computational analysis need to be confirmed by experimental studies.</p><p>The other focus of our study is the substrate specificity of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL for biotin. Desthiobiotin did not bind to <italic>Mt</italic>BPL nor was used in the biotinylation reaction. The thiophene ring and the hydrophobic tail would interact with the hydrophobic amino acids and the biotin carboxyl and ureido ring would interact with the hydrophilic amino acids. Since DTB lacks the thiophene ring, the interaction of the molecule with the hydrophobic amino acids is only via the hydrophobic tail and ureido ring. Also, biotin forms relatively stronger H-bonds (bond length &#x0003e;3.0&#x000c5;) as compared to desthiobiotin. This is reflected in the unfavorable binding energy of association between desthiobiotin and <italic>Mt</italic>BPL (Biotin&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;3.645 kcal/mol, Desthiobiotin&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x0002b;0.984 l/mol).</p><p>A second conserved sequence of KWPNDVL shares sequence homology with biotin binding protein avidin. However, this sequence does not interact with the ligands in all the three BPLs. Lys111 (<italic>Ph</italic>BPL) and Lys183 (<italic>Ec</italic>BirA) of the conserved &#x02018;KXAGXLVE&#x02019; play a critical role in adenylation reaction. However, from computational studies, no such interaction between this conserved lysine residue and the ligands were observed (21, 22).</p><p>Effector binding is central to a number of essential activation processes and provides essential information on interactions involved therein. The affinity of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL for its effectors biotin and bio-5&#x02032;-AMP was determined by ITC. The thermodynamic data are categorized into enthalpy, free energy changes and dissociation constants. <italic>Mt</italic>BPL exhibited similar dissociation constants of &#x0223c;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M for both the effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g004">Figure 4a, d and e</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Ec</italic>BirA displayed different affinities for its ligands: biotin and bio-5&#x02032;-AMP. Dissociation constants for biotin (4.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M) and bio-5&#x02032;AMP (4&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup> M) was very different and hence they have been classified as &#x02018;weak&#x02019; and &#x02018;strong&#x02019; effectors respectively (23&#x02013;25). The affinity of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL for bio-5&#x02032;-AMP was 5 orders of magnitude lower than that observed in <italic>Ec</italic>BirA (4&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup> M). Repressor function in <italic>Ec</italic>BirA is in association with bio-5&#x02032;-AMP (co-repressor) and hence very tight binding is required to perform this function (26). However, the N-terminal deleted <italic>Ec</italic>BirA had 1000 fold reduced affinity (&#x0223c;4&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M) for bio-5&#x02032;-AMP (16). This suggests that mono-functional group I BPLs exhibit attenuated affinities dedicated to perform only enzymatic function. The adenosine molecules, ATP, ADP and AMP did not show any appreciable heat changes in ITC. This is in contrast to crystallographic structure of <italic>Ph</italic>BPL which show interaction with adenosine molecules (22). However, in crystallographic structures, observations of the complexes of ligand which have extremely low affinities (&#x0003c;50 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) can often be observed which is typically difficult in biophysical studies. The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, calreticulin, for example, does not show binding to glucose, though density for glucose complexed to calnexin, a very closely related molecule was seen in the crystal structure (27).</p><p>Bio-5&#x02032;AMP, an intermediate of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL catalyzed reaction involves biotin and ATP as substrates. Hence, it was essential to determine the mechanism of association of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL with its substrates. These studies show sequential binding pattern of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL to them, as ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g004">Figure 4c</xref>) does not interact with BPL directly but on saturation with biotin, it exhibits a K<sub>d</sub> of &#x0223c;1.16&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g004">Figure 4d</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> BPL interacts first with ATP followed by biotin, in contrast to <italic>Mt</italic>BPL and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA (28). Biotin is the limiting substrate in <italic>Mt</italic>BPL catalyzed reaction similar to <italic>Ec</italic>BirA. Biotin binding perhaps contributes to structural transitions that may be required for interaction of ATP to form ternary complex between <italic>Mt</italic>BPL, biotin and ATP.</p><p>The Gibbs free energy for binding of biotin and bio-5&#x02032;-AMP to <italic>Mt</italic>BPL were almost similar. But for <italic>Ec</italic>BirA, there was a gain of &#x02212;4 kcal/mol of free energy on bio-5&#x02032;-AMP binding. This is probably to ensure that repressor was always in active form for binding to <italic>bioO</italic> (29, 30). <italic>Mt</italic>BPL does not require any enhanced BPL-bio-5&#x02032;-AMP stability for transfer of biotin to apoBCCP. Thus, thermodynamic studies reveal that molecular mechanisms of ligand interaction are very different between <italic>Mt</italic>BPL and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA on account of additional burden of repressor function in the latter molecule.</p><p>Binding of bio-5&#x02032;-AMP to <italic>Mt</italic>BPL is associated with larger enthalpy changes (&#x02212;17.2 kcal/mol) in comparison with &#x02212;11.12 kcal/mol for biotin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002320-t004">Table 4</xref>). However in <italic>Ec</italic>BirA, enthalpy changes are larger for biotin (&#x02212;19.2 kcal/mol) compared to that for bio-5&#x02032;-AMP (-12.3 kcal/mol). According to Brown and Beckett (24), the absence of a charged functional group to interact with the adenosine moiety could be the reason for the enthalpic penalty. In <italic>Ec</italic>BirA, there is a biotin binding loop (BBL) 115&#x02013;120 residues which is conserved and adenylate binding loop (ABL) consisting of residues 212&#x02013;223 (24, 25). On limited proteolysis, the region between amino acid residues 217&#x02013;218 was protected by bio-5&#x02032;-AMP (26). This suggests that adenosine of bio-5&#x02032;-AMP interacts at the ABL. BBL becomes ordered on biotin binding and then adenylate binding site is formed in <italic>Ec</italic>BirA. In contrast, there is no separate ABL and BBL in <italic>Ph</italic>BPL hence the biotin moiety of biotinyl-5&#x02032;-AMP and biotin share the same binding site. Also, the adenosyl moiety of bio-5&#x02032;-AMP and ADP interact almost at the same position. This sharing of binding site in <italic>Ph</italic>BPL which is strikingly different from that observed in <italic>Ec</italic>BirA suggests that catalytic binding sites are organized such that major conformational changes are perhaps not required in group I BPLs during the reaction (22). Bagautdinov <italic>et al</italic> (22) co-crystallized <italic>Ph</italic>BPL with biotin and bio-5&#x02032;AMP suggesting that the interaction does not involve any conformational change. On the other hand, exposure of <italic>Ec</italic>BirA crystals to bio-5&#x02032;-AMP resulted in cracking and crystal destruction due to conformational changes. Together, these data underscore striking differences in the organization of biotin and ATP binding site between <italic>Mt</italic>BPL and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA as well as the differences in the conformational changes they undergo upon binding of biotin/bio-5&#x02032;-AMP.</p><p>The dissociation constant of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL for its ligands was high relative to <italic>Ec</italic>BirA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002320-t004">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g004">Figure 4</xref>), hence enzyme turnover was determined by steady state kinetics. The kinetic constants show low K<sub>m</sub> for both biotin (0.42 &#x000b5;M) and ATP (21 &#x000b5;M). This is similar to that observed in eukaryotic biotin auxotrophs such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>A.thaliana</italic> which exhibit K<sub>m</sub> in nanomolar range for biotin and lower micromolar concentration for MgATP (28, 32). <italic>Ec</italic>BirA has comparable K<sub>m</sub> of 0.3 &#x000b5;M for biotin, but has higher K<sub>m</sub> of 300 &#x000b5;M for ATP. Though <italic>Mt</italic>BPL has higher dissociation constant for both biotin and bio-5&#x02032;-AMP, the K<sub>m</sub> values were comparable to that of <italic>Ec</italic>BirA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002320-t004">Table 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002320-t005">5</xref>). Thus, the lower binding affinity of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL for its ligands did not alter its enzymatic function.</p><p>Desthiobiotin (DTB) is precursor molecule for biotin but differs from it in several ways; both have an ureido ring but desthiobiotin lacks thiophene ring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002320.s001">Table S1</xref>). Wu <italic>et al</italic> (33) had suggested that <italic>Ec</italic>BirA incorporates desthiobiotin into SAPK, a protein with a biotinable lysine residue. Their assay was driven to 100&#x00025; incorporation at a concentration of 1 mM in 4 h. But <italic>Mt</italic>BPL did not promote desthiobiotin incorporation into BCCP at increased concentration and incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002320-g006">Figure 6a,b</xref>). From structural analysis of <italic>Ph</italic>BPL, it is evident that both thiophene and ureido side chains are accommodated in the hydrophilic bottom provided by glycine residues (Gly45,47,127,129) and the thiophene moiety interacts with the hydrophobic wall (22). DTB which lacks the thiophene side chain will not fit efficiently in such a structural frame work. The hexanoic acid attached close to ureido nitrogen may hamper interaction of ureido side chain as well. This argument is strengthened by the binding energy of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL (&#x0002b;0.984 kcal/mol) and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA (&#x02212;1.897 kcal/mol) for desthiobiotin by computational modeling. Monofunctional <italic>Mt</italic>BPL has an unfavorable binding energy for the association and this is confirmed by the inability of the enzyme to either bind or incorporate desthiobiotin. <italic>Ec</italic>BirA prefers biotin (&#x02212;3.491 kcal/ mol) to desthiobiotin (&#x02212;1.897 kcal/mol) and hence utilizes desthiobiotin at higher molar concentration and increased incubation period. Biotin synthase (<italic>BioB</italic>) utilizes desthiobiotin to synthesize biotin and activity of the enzyme is determined by bioassay. This is a very tedious assay and there is a need for more reliable, easy, quantitative and rapid assay. Biotin synthase enzymatically generates one molecule of biotin from desthiobiotin. At equimolar concentration of biotin/desthiobiotin, <italic>Mt</italic>BPL preferably incorporates biotin and this can be exploited to assay biotin synthase activity in a sensitive manner.</p><p>In summary, we have successfully cloned an enzymatically active <italic>Mt</italic>BPL and biotin acceptor molecule, BCCP of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Our protocol variation of reduced growth and induction time yielded nearly 90&#x00025; apo-BCCP. Our studies suggest that the mechanism of enzymatic process is at considerable variance from Group II BPL. <italic>Mt</italic>BPL binds initially to biotin with a moderate affinity as compared to <italic>Ec</italic>BirA. This complex then interacts with ATP to synthesize intermediate molecule bio-5&#x02032;-AMP and biotin is transferred efficiently to BCCP. From our studies, it is clear that reduced affinity of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL does not alter enzyme kinetic parameters, suggesting that enhanced binding affinity in <italic>Ec</italic>BirA probably contributes to repressor activity. However, in this study we report that <italic>Mt</italic>BPL is merely not an equivalent of N-terminal deleted <italic>Ec</italic>BirA, but has its own unique <italic>modus operandi</italic>, including specificity and affinity for its ligands to promote biotinylation of BCCP domain of acetyl CoA carboxylase, an enzyme critical for survival of the pathogen. Also, the differences in the architecture of biotin and ATP binding site of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL and <italic>Ec</italic>BirA and the exquisite specificity of <italic>Mt</italic>BPL for biotin over desthiobiotin can be harnessed for synthesizing inhibitors for this important enzyme which should aid in combating global spread of tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Biochemicals</title><p>D-biotin, desthiobiotin, IPTG and ATP (disodium salt) were purchased from Sigma, USA.
