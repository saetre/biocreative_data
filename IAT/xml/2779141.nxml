Improved understanding of the pathological process of these diseases would lead to the effective therapies to delay or ameliorate photoreceptor cell death. The rds mice is homozygous for a null mutation in the prph 2 gene, which encodes a transmembrane glyco-protein peripherin 2, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of normal photoreceptor outer segment. Consequently, the rds mice failed to develop photoreceptor outer segments and underwent progressive loss of photoreceptors by apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. In humans, over 10 different retinal phenotypes have been associated with mutations in the peripherin gene, including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and macular dystrophies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/Retnet/">RetNet</ext-link>).</p><p>In the recent decade, increasing attention has been focused on the pathogenic role of microglia in retinal degenerations. Accompanying photoreceptor degenerations in Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat, rd mice, and light-induced retinal degeneration mice, microglia was activated and migrated from inner retinal layer (IRL) to outer nuclear layer (ONL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Recently, Hughes et al. observed that accompanying photoreceptor degeneration in rds mice, microglia proliferated and migrated to the subretinal space, which confirmed the intimate association between activated microglia and the degenerative process in this animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. However the sequential relationship between microglial activation and photoreceptor apoptosis had not been fully elucidated. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), previously isolated from murine macrophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], is expressed in many cell types especially activated microglia, and induces the release of nitric oxide (NO) over long periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. The production of NO was a major factor for tissue damage after activation of microglia. Previous studies had shown that microglial derived NO played an important role in the pathogenesis of brain ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] and experimental autoimmune uveitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Two things should be considered: (1) The possibility that iNOS might take part in the retinal degenerative process in rds mice; and (2) the co-relationship between activated microglia and iNOS expression.</p><p>Minocycline is, a semi-synthetic, long-acting tetracycline derivative that has good penetration of the blood-brain barrier. It has recently been shown to have remarkable neuroprotective properties in models of neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], brain ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], Parkinson's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that minocycline treatment decreased the expression of iNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] and microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Recently, Hughes et al. observed that minocycline delayed photoreceptor apoptosis in rds mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The possibility that minocycline may exert its protective effect through iNOS-suppressive or microglial-suppressive mechanisms must be considered.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the sequential events of photoreceptor apoptosis, microglial activation, and iNOS expression in rds mice. We also examined the protective effect and possible mechanisms of minocycline on the retinal degeneration process in rds mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and procedures</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.

Afterwards the retinas were incubated with corresponding biotinylated secondary antibodies and HRP avidin-biotin complex for 3 h at 37 &#x000b0;C, respectively, and developed with DAB. Retinal wholemounts were examined by confocal microscope and counted by blinded observers. Positively stained microglia in the ONL were counted in a standard area of retina using a graticule at 40 objective magnification. At least ten non-adjacent areas per eye were counted for each stain.</p></sec><sec><title>Total RNA extraction and semiquantitative reverse transcription</title><p>A semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed to measure the expression levels of chemokine mRNA transcripts in the whole retina. The eyes were enucleated and bisected. The retinas were peeled from the eyecup and immediately homogenized in the extraction Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Grand Island, NY). Total RNA was isolated by chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with oligonucleotide primers using Superscript<sup>TM</sup> reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Afterwards PCR was performed. The primers and annealing temperature are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Each PCR product was separated on 2% agarose gel and analyzed with Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). The amount of RT-PCR products was corrected with &#x003b2;-actin expression. Because of the wide variation in expression levels of these genes, we used different cycles to obtain optimum expression. The levels of expression were then compared within the time course for one particular gene mRNA, but were not compared between genes. PCR experiments were repeated at least four times.</p><table-wrap id="t1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Oligonucleotides used for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain

Photoreceptor apoptosis started at P14 and peaked at P17. Retinal microglia were activated and infiltrated ONL at P17, which was three days after the initiation of photoreceptor apoptosis, and peaked at P28, which was 11 days after the peak of photoreceptor apoptosis. The up-regulation of iNOS expression was preceded the photoreceptor apoptosis. At the peak of iNOS expression, iNOS was predominantly expressed in photoreceptor outer segment. Expression of chemokines MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2;, RANTES and eotaxin were up-regulated during the retinal degenerative process. Minocycline treatment reduced the iNOS expression and delayed the initial photoreceptor apoptosis, but in the late stage of the disease, microglial activation and photoreceptor apoptosis persisted.</p><p>The aforedescribed sequential events suggest that NO might play an important role in the initial photoreceptor apoptosis. The microglial activation followed closely with the apoptotic process of the photoreceptors. However the initiation of photoreceptor apoptosis preceded microglial activation. So, microglia was not likely to be the initial instigator for rod apoptosis, but might influence the subsequent cone cell death in rds mice. Minocycline played its photoreceptor protective role partly through iNOS-dependent mechanism. We hypothesized that the initial gene defect in peripherin/RDS would result in the developmental disorder of photoreceptor outer segment, induce the high expression of iNOS, and secrete high levels of NO and induced the initial rod photoreceptor apoptosis. The apoptotic photoreceptors produced chemokines to activate and recruit retinal microglia to the lesion site. However the accumulation of activated microglia in the ONL not only cleared the debris, but also secreted cytotoxic factors to exaggerate subsequent cone photoreceptor death.</p><p>It is known that a low level of NO is an important mediator of homeostatic processes in the eye, such as regulation of aqueous humor dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], retinal neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] and photo-transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. However the production of NO at higher concentrations are toxic to the neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. A number of pathways could be involved in the NO-induced photoreceptor degenerative process, such as the following: (1) NO might act by eliciting a cGMP increase in the photoreceptor cells leading to excess calcium influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]; (2) NO could ADP-ribosilate certain photoreceptor proteins and modulate their activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]; and (3) NO could also act as a free radical capable of combining with oxygen derivatives, resulting in the production of the peroxynitrite anion ONOO<sup>-</sup>, which is highly cytotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. In the present study the iNOS expression was up-regulated in rds mice, and its up-regulation was preceded the photoreceptor apoptosis. We propose that NO might play an important role in the initial retinal degeneration in rds mice.</p><p>Previous studies on RCS rat and rd mice suggested that activated microglia, having migrated to the photoreceptor layer in response to the debris buildup in the subretinal space or photoreceptor dysfunction, might be the instigator of photoreceptor apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. In our present study on rds mice, by closely scrutinized the temporal relationship between photoreceptor apoptosis and microglial activation, we found that the photoreceptor apoptosis was preceded the microglial activation. This was consistent with the findings by Hughes et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In addition, minocycline treatment ameliorated the initial photoreceptor apoptosis at P17, at which point activated microglia was first presented in ONL. This event, but had no effect on the subsequent photoreceptor apoptosis at P28, at which time activated microglia in ONL reached its peak. We suggest that activated microglia is innocent in the initial photoreceptor apoptosis, but might be responsible for the subsequent photoreceptor apoptosis.</p><p>Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines acting through G-protein coupled receptors. Elevated expression of chemokines have been reported in ocular inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] and light-induced retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Recently, Zeng et al. observed that several chemokines were up-regulated in rd mice, which confirmed the intimate association of microglial activation and chemokines secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that the expression of mRNA transcripts for MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2; and RANTES was up-regulated from P12, peaked at P17, and declined to basal level by P28. Their expression was just correspondingly increased and declined accompanying photoreceptor apoptosis, suggested that they might be mainly secreted by apoptotic photoreceptor cells and play a major role in microglial activation and recruitment. The expression of mRNA transcripts for MCP-1, MCP-3 and eotaxin was up-regulated from P14 and peaked at P28, their expression was sustained at a relatively high level until P90, afterwards their expression was declined. The up-regulation of MCP-1, MCP-3 and eotaxin was coincided with the microglial activation, which suggested that activated microglia were the main source of these chemokines, and these chemokines might play a major role in recruiting more microglia to the lesion site.. It was noteworthy that the normal retina constitutively expressed detectable levels of RANTES and eotaxin. These two chemokines recognized the same receptor CCR3 (CC chemokine receptor 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that RANTES regulated the growth and survival of first-trimester forebrain astrocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. We suggest that they were not only mediators of microglial recruitment but they might also be regulators of retinal development as suggested by Bakhiet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>].</p><p>Minocycline has recently been shown to have remarkable neuroprotective properties in models of neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Evidence suggests that this apparent neuroprotective property is mainly through two separate mechanisms. The first of these mechanisms was probably through direct anti-apoptotic effect. Minocycline inhibited the caspase-3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] and inhibited the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. The second mechanism involved anti-inflammatory effects including preventing the activation and migration of microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], decreasing the induction of iNOS expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], and reducing the cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that minocycline treatment reduced iNOS expression and delayed the initial photoreceptor apoptosis in rds mice. Considering that NO played an important role in the initial retinal degeneration in rds mice, we suggested that minocyline treatment protect photoreceptor apoptosis partly through iNOS-dependent mechanism. However in the late stage of the disease, microglial activation and photoreceptor apoptosis persisted after minocycline treatment. The apoptotic photoreceptors produced chemokines to activate and recruit retinal microglia to the lesion site. However the accumulation of activated microglia in the ONL not only cleared the debris, but also secreted cytotoxic factors to exaggerate subsequent cone photoreceptor death. RP is initiated with the loss of night vision due to rod degeneration, and is followed by irreversible vision loss due to cone degeneration. Cone loss is responsible for the main visual handicap and its loss is indirect. Based on this study, we believe microglial suppressive factors might provide a beneficial role in these diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported
