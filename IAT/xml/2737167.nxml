In psoriasis, however, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) sense self-DNA that is transported to endosomal TLR9 upon forming a complex with the antimicrobial peptide LL37. Whether LL37 also interacts with extracellular self-RNA and how this may contribute to DC activation in psoriasis is not known. Here, we report that LL37 can bind self-RNA released by dying cells, protect it from extracellular degradation, and transport it into endosomal compartments of DCs. In pDC, self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes activate TLR7 and, like self-DNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes, trigger the secretion of IFN-&#x003b1; without inducing maturation or the production of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. In contrast to self-DNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes, self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes also trigger the activation of classical myeloid DCs (mDCs). This occurs through TLR8 and leads to the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, and the differentiation of mDCs into mature DCs. We also found that self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes are present in psoriatic skin lesions and are associated with mature mDCs in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the cationic antimicrobial peptide LL37 converts self-RNA into a trigger of TLR7 and TLR8 in human DCs, and provide new insights into the mechanism that drives the auto-inflammatory responses in psoriasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) sense viral infections through a subset of nucleic acid&#x02013;recognizing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed in endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira et al., 2006</xref>). These receptors include TLR3, which detects double-stranded viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexopoulou et al., 2001</xref>); TLR7 and TLR8, which recognize guanosine- and uridine-rich single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diebold et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lund et al., 2004</xref>); and TLR9, which recognizes the phosphodiester backbone in natural DNA or unmethylated CpG motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hemmi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haas et al., 2008</xref>). TLR7 and TLR9 are selectively expressed by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarrossay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kadowaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hornung et al., 2002</xref>), a subset of dendritic cells specialized in type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colonna et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilliet et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, classical human myeloid DCs (mDCs), which are potent stimulators of T cell responses by virtue of their inherent capacity to present antigens and migrate from the periphery into secondary lymphoid organs, do not express TLR7 and TLR9, but instead express TLR3 and TLR8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarrossay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kadowaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hornung et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Through endosomal TLRs, pDCs and mDCs efficiently sense viral nucleic acids but do not respond to self-nucleic acids released into the extracellular environment by dying host cells. Structural differences such as the high levels of unmethylated CpG motifs in viral DNA and clusters of U or GU-rich sequences in viral RNA have been considered a key factor in the discrimination between viral and self-nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krieg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diebold et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heil et al., 2004</xref>). However, more recently, it has become clear that this discrimination is mainly achieved by the intracellular localization of these TLRs, which allows recognition of viral nucleic acids released into endosomal compartments by the endocytosed virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barton et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, self-nucleic acids are rapidly degraded in the extracellular environment and fail to access endosomal compartments spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barton et al., 2006</xref>). Self-DNA and self-RNA can, however, become a potent trigger of pDC activation when they are aberrantly transported into TLR-containing endosomes in the context of autoimmunity. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), self-RNA and self-DNA are complexed with autoantibodies against the nucleic acid or nucleoproteins, which deliver the nucleic acids into endosomal compartments of pDCs via Fc&#x003b3;RII-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">R&#x000f6;nnblom et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Means et al., 2005</xref>). As a result, pDCs are continuously activated to produce type I IFNs, which drives the development of autoimmunity and disease formation. This has been demonstrated in mouse models of SLE using TLR7- or TLR9-deficient mice or inhibitors for TLR7 and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leadbetter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrat et al., 2007</xref>), and by a study showing that TLR7 gene duplication in mice induces SLE-like disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deane et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune-inflammatory disease of the skin, self-DNA forms complexes with the cationic antimicrobial peptide LL37. Self-DNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes gain access to endosomal TLR9, leading to an aberrant activation of pDCs to produce IFN-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lande et al., 2007</xref>). pDC-derived IFN-&#x003b1; initiates the autoimmune-inflammatory cascade in psoriasis, a process characterized by the activation of mDCs and their maturation into DCs that stimulate pathogenic autoimmune T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nestle et al., 2005</xref>). However, whether LL37 also interacts with extracellular self-RNA, and whether this pathway is involved in the activation of mDCs in psoriasis, is unknown.</p><p>Here, we found that LL37 also forms complexes with extracellular self-RNA. These complexes are highly protected from RNase degradation and gain access to the endosomal compartments of both pDCs and mDCs. Self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes induce TLR7 activation in pDCs and trigger the secretion of IFN-&#x003b1;. Self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes also trigger the direct activation of mDCs to secrete TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 and differentiate into mature DCs. This maturation of mDCs is triggered by endosomal TLR8 and is enhanced by the concomitant activation of pDCs to produce IFN-&#x003b1;. In-vivo, self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes are specifically found in psoriatic skin and the number of these complexes correlates with the presence of mature mDCs. The current findings identify self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes as endogenous triggers of TLR7 and TLR8 in human DCs, and provide a new link between the expression of antimicrobial peptides and DC-mediated inflammation in psoriasis.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>LL37 converts nonstimulatory self-RNA into a trigger of pDC activation to produce IFN-&#x003b1;</title><p>To determine whether the antimicrobial peptide LL37 enables pDCs to sense self-nucleic acids released by dying cells, we stimulated pDCs with supernatants of UV-irradiated U937 cells, which undergo apoptosis and secondary necrosis with the release of self-DNA and self-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">L&#x000f6;vgren et al., 2004</xref>).

Importantly, self-RNA isolated from a variety of cell types and tissue samples from various types of skin pathologies induced similar levels of IFN-&#x003b1; when mixed with LL37, indicating that cellular- or disease-dependent variations in RNA composition do not play a role in the responses to self-RNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090480/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). These data demonstrate that LL37 can convert otherwise nonstimulatory self-RNA into a trigger of pDC activation to produce IFN-&#x003b1;, and thus enable the RNA released during cell death to induce innate immune activation.</p></sec><sec><title>LL37 binds self-RNA to form aggregated complexes that are protected from extracellular degradation</title><p>Interestingly, when total human RNA purified from U937 cells was mixed with LL37 (but not GL37), we observed formation of particulate complexes that ranged in size from 1 to 30 &#x000b5;m that precipitated to the bottom of the culture plate. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the visible complexes contained RNA, as they fluoresced when stained with Ribogreen (which stains RNA preferentially, but also stains DNA) but not with DAPI (which stains DNA exclusively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Similarly, supernatants of dying U937 cells formed particulate complexes when mixed with LL37 but not with GL37. A large number of these complexes contained RNA given that they stained Ribogreen<sup>+</sup>/DAPI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and their formation was inhibited by RNase pretreatment of the supernatants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090480/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>).

Interestingly, we found that the antibody was able to stain these complexes but did not colocalize with the RNA stain, suggesting competition between binding of the antibody and staining with Ribogreen.

Yet, extracellular self-RNA normally does not lead to innate immune activation because it is rapidly degraded by RNases and fails to access endosomal compartments of DCs where TLR7 and TLR8 are located. Here, we found that extracellular self-RNA acquires the ability to trigger activation of TLR7 and TLR8 in human DCs by forming a complex with the endogenous antimicrobial peptide LL37. Previously, we had demonstrated that LL37 can form a complex with self-DNA, leading to TLR9 activation of pDCs to produce IFN-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lande et al., 2007</xref>). The present study shows that LL37 and the formation of RNA complexes also allow activation of classical mDCs, leading to the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 and differentiation into mature DCs with T cell stimulatory activity.</p><p>The formation of complexes between LL37 and RNA is driven by ionic interactions between the cationic residues of the peptide and the anionic phosphate backbone of RNA, similar to the phenomenon described for DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lande et al., 2007</xref>). In self-DNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes, the &#x003b1;-helical structure of LL37 appears to stabilize the interactions with the double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lande et al., 2007</xref>). Because vertebrate RNA is single stranded, it is unclear whether the &#x003b1;-helical structure of LL37 also plays a role in the formation and stabilization of complexes with RNA. It may be possible that LL37 preferentially binds to regions where RNA folds into complex structures containing double-helical regions capped by hairpin or internal loops.</p><p>The mechanism by which LL37 converts nonstimulatory self-RNA into a trigger of TLR7 and TLR8 in DC involves two distinct steps. First, the binding of LL37 condenses free RNA into compacted structures that are highly protected from enzymatic degradation, a phenomenon that is critical for subsequent internalization of the complex. Second, by forming these complexes, LL37 allows the association of RNA with cellular membranes and the transport across these membranes into endocytic compartments. A previous study showed that DNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes acquire net positive charges that allow binding to anionic proteoglycans in the membrane of CHO cells followed by lipid raft&#x02013;mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sandgren et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes interact with heparan-sulfate&#x02013;containing proteoglycans in the membranes of DCs, as indicated by the finding that heparinase pretreatment significantly reduced the uptake of the RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes into both pDCs and mDCs (unpublished data).</p><p>Internalized self-RNA triggers the activation of TLR7 and TLR8, which recognize uridine moieties common to both viral RNA and self-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diebold et al., 2006</xref>). Compared with viral RNA, self-RNA is highly methylated and contains high numbers of pseudouridines, which have been shown to lack the ability to activate and rather inhibit TLR7 and TLR8 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karik&#x000f3; et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robbins et al., 2007</xref>). Our finding that total cellular RNA isolated from cells or released by dying cells can trigger TLR7 and TLR8 activation indicates that non-modified sequences in mammalian RNA are sufficient to induce immune activation if RNA is protected from extracellular degradation and transported into the endosomal compartments. Accordingly, self-RNA has been previously found to trigger TLR7 activation if encapsulated into liposomes and transfected into DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diebold et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our study identifies self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes as small extracellular particles in inflamed skin of psoriatic patients, demonstrating that these complexes can form in vivo in the context of immunopathology. These tissue RNA particles were associated with the presence of mature mDCs, providing evidence that self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 particles are linked to mDC activation in vivo. Psoriasis is characterized by an early skin infiltration of pDC and their aberrant activation to produce IFN-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nestle et al., 2005</xref>). During later stages of the disease, however, psoriatic lesions are mainly characterized by large numbers of mature mDCs, which stimulate pathogenic T cells, whereas pDCs are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanesi et al., 2009</xref>). Based on our findings, we propose that self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes may trigger a concerted activation of pDCs and mDCs, which initiate the inflammatory process during early psoriasis. During later stages of the disease, inflammation may be exclusively maintained by mDCs that are activated by self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes.</p><p>LL37 expression is typically induced in epithelial cells or released by neutrophils in the context of tissue injury or infection. Although the mechanisms controlling LL37 expression are still poorly understood, recent studies revealed the key involvement of the vitamin D3 and hypoxia response pathways, as well as the effect of various microorganisms on the production of LL37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schauber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peyssonnaux et al., 2008</xref>). In psoriasis, LL37 appears to be continuously overexpressed by lesional keratinocytes, leading to sustained formation of nucleic acid complexes that trigger TLR7, 8, and 9 in DCs. As a result, the uncontrolled activation of pDCs and mDCs may induce high levels of self-antigen&#x02013;specific T cells and the development of overt autoimmunity. In contrast, LL37 expression in common skin wounds is short lived and may drive transient DC activation and inflammatory responses that participate in wound repair. It is possible that the transient LL37 expression and DC activation in skin wounds may induce low levels of self-antigen&#x02013;specific T cells; however, they are not sufficient to drive overt autoimmunity. Indeed, a recent report has shown that T cells are activated during tissue damage and participate in wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Toulon et al., 2009</xref>). It is also possible that the short-lived DC activation allows only activation of T cells that recognize high avidity antigens, such as those derived from pathogens invading the wounded tissue.</p><p>Persistent high levels of LL37 have also been reported in other chronic inflammatory diseases such as rosacea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamasaki et al., 2007</xref>), rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paulsen et al., 2002</xref>), colitis ulcerosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schauber et al., 2006</xref>), chronic nasal inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2003</xref>), sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agerberth et al., 1999</xref>), and cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bucki et al., 2007</xref>). Self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 and self-DNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes may also sustain the pathogenic inflammatory responses through TLR-mediated activation of DCs in these diseases, as we found in psoriasis. Thus, strategies to inhibit the expression of LL37 or the formation of LL37&#x02013;nucleic acid complexes should be explored for the treatment of these diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Collection of human samples.</title><p>Studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board for human research at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the Heinrich-Heine University in D&#x000fc;sseldorf.

In some cases, pDC supernatants were treated with a combination of anti&#x02013;human IFN-&#x003b1; (10<sup>4</sup> U/ml) antibodies, anti&#x02013;human IFN-&#x003b2; (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> U/ml) antibodies, and anti&#x02013;human IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; receptor antibodies (clone: MMHAR-2; 10 &#x000b5;g/ml) to block type I IFN activity (all from PBL Biomedical Laboratories).</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclease protection assays.</title><p>The suspension containing RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes were incubated with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml RNase A at 37&#x000b0;C. Then RNA in the suspensions was stained with Ribogreen (Invitrogen) and quantitated by fluorimetry at different time points. In other experiments the suspensions, either RNase treated or left untreated, were run on a 1% agarose gel (with ethidium bromide) and imaged in a UV transilluminator gel imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories).</p></sec><sec><title>Uptake of self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes in pDCs and mDCs.</title><p>pDCs or mDCs were stimulated with self-RNA<sup>Alexa488</sup> alone or with self-RNA<sup>Alexa488</sup>&#x02013;LL37 complexes.

After 4 h of stimulation, cells were stained with Alexa 647-conjugated anti&#x02013;HLA-DR (BioLegend) and the slides were mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase reporter assay.</title><p>HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng of TLR3-GFP or TLR8-HA expression vectors (both from Invivogen) and 100 ng of NF-&#x003ba;B luciferase reporter plasmid. The Renilla luciferase reporter gene (pRL-TK) was simultaneously transfected (5 ng) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. 24 h later, cells were collected and stimulated as indicated for 24 h. Poly I:C and ssPolyU complexed with cationic lipids (DOTAP; Roche) were used as positive controls for the activation of TLR3 and TLR8, respectively. Luciferase activity was measured with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue immunofluorescence and immunochemistry.</title><p>Immunofluorescence of DNA and RNA complexes was done on frozen sections of skin specimens after a 5-min stain with DAPI (0.1 ng/ml) and Ribogreen (1:100,000) followed by washes and mounting with the Prolong Gold mounting medium (Invitrogen). In some cases, sections were first incubated with mouse anti-LL37 (clone 3d11; HyCult Biotechnology) or isotype control overnight, followed by incubation with Alexa 647&#x02013;conjugated anti&#x02013;mouse IgG secondary antibody. Ribogreen and DAPI were added after the antibody incubations to achieve the best staining efficiency. The images were acquired using a confocal microscope (model TCS SP2; Leica). Immunohistochemistry for mature mDCs was performed on frozen sections of human psoriasis skin specimens using mouse anti&#x02013;DC-LAMP antibodies (clone 104.G4; Coulter Immunotech). Images were acquired using a microscope (model DP70; Olympus). Extracellular RNA complexes and DC-LAMP<sup>+</sup> DCs in tissue sections were counted in three best fields per section by two independent sample-blind investigators.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material.</title><p>Fig. S1 shows the differential pattern of cytokine production by pDCs and mDCs in response to self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes. Fig. S2 shows that self-RNA isolated from different cell lines or from tissues of different chronic inflammatory skin diseases induces comparable levels of IFN-&#x003b1; production in pDCs when combined with LL37. Fig. S3 shows characteristic microscopic morphology of self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes. Fig. S4 shows the quantitation of self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 and self-DNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes in supernatants of dying cells. Fig. S5 shows that pDCs and mDCs respond to RNA sequences that are bona fide TLR7 and TLR8 ligands when complexed with LL37 but not when given alone. Fig. S6 shows that self-RNA&#x02013;LL37 complexes trigger the maturation and secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 by circulating CD1c<sup>+</sup> blood DCs.
