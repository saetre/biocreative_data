The number of proliferating phoshpohistone3+ cells and Doublecortin+ (Dcx) SVZ neuroblasts was overall unaffected during the periods of greatest inflammation.

Both regions daily generate thousands of interneurons that integrate into synaptic circuitry. SVZ neuroblasts migrate long distances from their birthplaces near the lateral ventricles to the olfactory bulbs via the rostral migratory stream (RMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The SVZ, including human SVZ, contains cells that self-renew and are multipotential when exposed to appropriate growth factors in vitro; they are stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As such, they may provide a source for cell replacement, and many experiments have shown they attempt repair of damaged or diseased tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Hipppocampal microglia dampen neurogenesis during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Hematopoietic lineage cells comprise approximately five percent of cells in the SVZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], yet the constitutive and pathological role of these cells within the SVZ is poorly understood. SVZ microglia are distinctive: they express relatively high levels of CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase, they proliferate more than microglia in non-neurogenic regions, and are resistant to traumatic brain injury that causes microglial activation in adjacent nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Macrophages migrate into the brain during late development in certain foci, including the lateral ventricles and SVZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and then become resident microglia. Interestingly, neural macroglia (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) are generated in the SVZ during late development and migrate throughout the forebrain. Thus although microglial and macroglial lineages are different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], their emigration routes from the SVZ into the postnatal forebrain are very similar. These same migratory routes, fanning out into the forebrain from the SVZ, are followed by SVZ neuronal cells after a variety of injuries and diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>CD45 exhibits multiple splicing isoforms and modulates microglial and T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Upon activation, resident microglia undergo morphological changes consistent with their function: amoeboid for migrating to areas of injury and round for phagocytosis. FACsorting of immunofluorescent cells is used to distinguish resident microglia (CD45<sup>low</sup>) from infiltrating macrophages (CD45<sup>high</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We have shown that immunolabelling sections with anti-CD45 antibodies also reveals CD45<sup>low </sup>(the majority of cells under normal conditions) versus CD45<sup>high </sup>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Levels of CD45 expression correlate with levels of microglial activation, CD45<sup>high </sup>expression indicating significant activation. Interestingly, CD45 mutations have been observed in some multiple sclerosis (MS) patients suggesting that it is not merely a "marker" but may contribute to the etiology of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>MS is a demyelinating disease mediated by inflammation. In addition to loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin, neuronal apoptosis occurs in the forebrain and other regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The etiology of the disease is still elusive; possibilities range from spontaneous autoimmunity to a primary CNS insult such as infection. Because of the variability and uncertain etiology of MS, a variety of preclinical models are used to replicate specific features of the disease. The sclerotic lesions evident in the CNS are sites of CD45+ microglial, macrophage, dendritic cell, and T-cell accumulation indicative of an inflammatory response. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of susceptible SJL mice is a model used to study this response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The TMEV model is consistent with chronic, progressive inflammatory demyelination rather than the relapsing/remitting disease profile of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, TMEV results in the direct infection of microglia, whereas in EAE, microglia are activated secondary to the autoimmune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly the two co-receptors used by different Theiler's virus strains, sialic acid and heparan sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] are expressed at high levels in the SVZ. In fact, polysialic acid residues attached to the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) are required for SVZ neuroblast migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The SVZ augments new oligodendrocyte production in EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and syngeneic SVZ neurospheres ameliorated EAE pathology in mice, pointing to the potential for SVZ repair of MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The clinical MRI and pathological description of "Dawson's fingers", lesions extending from the lateral ventricles to surrounding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] suggest that the SVZ and periventricular regions are particularly sensitive to MS. Despite these tantalizing data, whether TMEV induces inflammation in the SVZ, and the effects of TMEV on SVZ neurogenesis and migration have remained unstudied until now. If SVZ inflammation is prominent in MS and this reduces neurogenesis, it may reduce autologous repair. Also, though there is an extensive literature on TMEV, a within-study comprehensive characterization of the time-course and anterior to posterior spread of viral induced CD45+ cell activation has not been carried out. Therefore, in these experiments we examined CD45+ cell activation and studied its spatio-temporal relationship to SVZ neurogenesis and emigration after TMEV. We show here with an antibody that recognizes all isoforms of CD45, that forebrain CD45+ cell activation precedes spinal cord activation and that the SVZ is the area with the most consistent CD45+ cell activation. We also document SVZ neuroblast emigration into inflamed periventricular regions and a delayed decrease in neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Eighty 6&#x02013;7 week old female wild type SJL/J mice (Taconic Labs) were used in the TMEV studies.

TMEV and sham mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane. 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>PFU BeAN 8386 virus, suspended in sterile 0.03 ml BSS, was injected into the right cerebellar cortex through a 27 gauge needle fitted with a needle guard to prevent penetration beyond 3.5 mm ventral to skull. Injections were localized to a point half-way to midline at ear level. Sham mice received injections of 0.03 ml BSS. Na&#x000ef;ve mice were not anesthetized or injected. All mice were monitored for changes in neurological status two to three times per week. Mice were assigned numerical scores as follows: 0 = asymptomatic; 1 = mild waddling gait; 2 = moderate waddling gait without spastic paralysis; 3 = severe waddling gait with mild spastic paralysis; 4 = severe waddling gait with moderate to severe spastic paralysis; 5 = total hind limb paralysis; 6 = moribund. Mice were further divided into three groups according to clinical scores or time point match for sham and naive: preclinical = prior to onset of any symptoms but after initial inflammatory/increased stress due to injections (D 14&#x02013;24); early onset = clinical score of 1 or more for 2 consecutive days (D 42&#x02013;47); chronic = increased clinical score (2 or 3) for minimum of 5 consecutive days (D 90).

Antibodies used: rat anti-CD45 (clone IBL-5/25; 1:500, Chemicon, Temeluca, CA); goat anti-doublecortin (C-terminus; 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz California), rabbit anti-BeAn (1:600, Miller Lab, Northwestern University), mouse anti-PSA-NCAM (1:500, Chemicon), rabbit anti-phosphohistone3 (1:500, Upstate Biotechnology). Sections were washed and blocked with 50 mM glycine in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to reduce autofluorescence of paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue. Sections were washed, blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% Donkey Serum, DS (Sigma), (PBS+), incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in primary antibodies, washed, incubated one hr at RT in Cy2 (1:200) or Cy3 (1:500) conjugated anti-primary secondaries, and rinsed in phosphate buffer (PB).

Emigrated Dcx+ cells were counted unilaterally. With the SVZ to the left margin of the field of view at 40&#x000d7;, Dcx+ cells in the striatum were counted, with the SVZ to the right margin of the field of view, septal Dcx+ cells were counted, with the SVZ in the middle of the field showing the full extent of the CC thickness, Dcx+ cells in the CC were counted, with the ventral 3rd of the SVZ in the middle of the field, emigrated Dcx+ cells in the ventral 3rd septum, striatum and surrounding ventral SVZ were counted. <italic>Phosphohistone3 cell counts</italic>. Images of phosphohistone3 labelled sections of the dorsolateral, medial septal and ventral-medial SVZ and were taken at 40&#x000d7; on a Leica DMRIB microscope.

The number of phosphohistone H3+ cells were counted and averaged for 6 consecutive sections per animal ranging from ~bregma 0.9 to 0.0. Only cells that had bright, complete labelling in the nuclei were included, cells that showed fragmented staining were excluded.

Sham animals occasionally showed unilateral "hot spots" of CD45 activation in the forebrain which were associated with few amoeboid or round CD45+ cells. This was rare and did not reach a score of 1; na&#x000ef;ve animals showed minimal CD45 activation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Most CD45+ cells in control mice had many branching processes and exhibited CD45<sup>low </sup>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The forebrain of preclinical TMEV mice showed cell activation already 14 days after TMEV injections and this continued through D24 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Bright CD45+ cell activation often surrounded blood vessels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Many CD45+ cells were large, and irregularly shaped; they appeared to be amoeboid.

Decreased numbers of Dcx+ neuroblasts were only found in "chronic mice", well after major inflammation had subsided. Surprisingly, Dcx+ cell numbers decreased in both the SVZ and dentate gyrus, even though only the former exhibited focal inflammation. Our results suggest that even though SVZ neuroblasts emigrate relatively soon after TMEV inoculation, any autologous repair may be attenuated by delayed decreases in neurogenesis.</p><p>One of the most novel and unpredictable findings of our study was that although forebrain activation of CD45+ cells was stochastic from section to section, and from mouse to mouse, it was remarkably consistent in the SVZ. Our results suggest that this is not a general response to demyelination since cuprizone induced demyelination did not activate CD45 expression in the SVZ. We favor two main possible mechanisms for our finding after TMEV infection: viral SVZ macrophage tropism or viral spread through the ventricular system. CD45+ cells are constitutively semi-activated in the SVZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and CD45+ cells were consistently activated in the SVZ and in the RMS. Since TMEV preferentially infects activated microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], the relatively high levels of constitutive macrophage activation in the SVZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] may predispose them to infection. Another interpretation of our study is that the ventricular system is a conduit for viral spread. CD45 activation was high in the preclinical group near the ventricular system: lateral ventricle, 3<sup>rd </sup>ventricle, periventricular hippocampus, and 4<sup>th </sup>ventricle. Immunodetectable virus was associated with SVZ neuroblasts and Theiler's virus exhibits tropism for sialic acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], thus it also possible that PSA-NCAM+ neuroblasts may be preferentially infected.</p><p>We found vigorous CD45+ cell activation throughout the forebrain already at two weeks after viral induction, suggesting that it commenced earlier. Microglial activation can occur quite rapidly, within hours to days after insults. By the time clinical symptomatology appeared in TMEV mice, CD45+ cell activation in the forebrain had diminished. In contrast to the forebrain, the major CD45+ cell activation in the cerebellum occurred three months after TMEV infection, which is surprising since TMEV was injected into the cerebellum. Similar to the cerebellum, the major spinal cord response was in the chronic group. Based on our results with this model, subtle forebrain inflammation mediated symptomatology may precede the severe spinal cord mediated motor defects in MS.</p><p>Whereas the large majority of newborn cells in the adult SVZ are young neurons, a few oligodendrocytes are also generated constitutively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. EAE induces increased numbers of oligodendrocyte genesis and emigration out of the SVZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Interestingly postmortem human studies suggest that SVZ cells, probably glioblasts, emigrate into adjacent regions in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The effects of preclinical models of MS on neurogenesis and neuroblast emigration were less clear, especially with regards to TMEV. This was important to address since, in addition to glial loss, a significant amount of neuronal loss occurs in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results show that even though neurons are lost in MS, neurogenic regions of the brain do not increase the production of newborn neurons. This is unlike multiple other models of neuronal loss such as stroke which generally increase neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>An interesting clinical observation is that MS is frequently associated with periventricular lesions; "Dawson's fingers" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As seen with MRI, these lesions extend from the ependyma into the corpus callosum and other brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The lesions course along subventricular zone (subependymal) blood vessels, suggesting they are routes of entry for destructive immune cells. As in Dawson's fingers, CD45+ cell activation was frequently associated with SVZ blood vessels and it may be that these were infiltrating macrophages. Recent studies have documented increased cell density and proliferation in the SVZ of MS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. These observations are compatible with the massive CD45+ cell activation we consistently observed around the lateral ventricles. High numbers of CD45+ inflammatory cells concentrate in the circumventricular organs, during EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and MS cerebral hemisphere lesions are primarily perivascular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Regardless of the mechanism, an increasing body of evidence suggests that periventricular regions, including the neurogenic SVZ, are particularly affected in preclinical models and human MS.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>CC: corpus callosum; C: chronic; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EAE: experimental allergic encephalomyelitis; EO: early onset; LV: lateral ventricle; MS: multiple sclerosis; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PC: preclinical; RMS: rostral migratory stream; SGZ: subgranuar zone; SVZ: subventricular zone; TMEV: Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GEG.
