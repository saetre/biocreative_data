At the metaphase to anaphase transition, proteolytic cleavage of the &#x003b1; kleisin subunit (Rad21) by separase causes cohesin's dissociation from chromosomes and triggers sister-chromatid disjunction. To investigate cohesin's function in postmitotic cells, where it&#x000a0;is widely expressed, we have created fruit flies whose Rad21 can be cleaved by TEV protease. Cleavage causes precocious separation of sister chromatids and massive chromosome missegregation in proliferating cells, but not disaggregation of polytene chromosomes in salivary glands. Crucially, cleavage in postmitotic neurons is lethal. In mushroom-body neurons, it causes defects in axon pruning, whereas in cholinergic neurons it causes highly abnormal larval locomotion. These data demonstrate essential roles for cohesin in nondividing cells and also introduce a powerful tool by which to investigate protein function in metazoa.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DEVBIO</kwd><kwd>CELLCYCLE</kwd><kwd>MOLNEURO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The investigation of nonmitotic functions of proteins essential for cell proliferation poses a major technical challenge: namely, how to inactivate such proteins without compromising cell proliferation. A good example is the highly conserved multisubunit complex called cohesin (<xref rid="bib12 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Guacci et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Michaelis et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>), which holds the products of DNA replication (sister chromatids) together and thereby ensures their segregation to opposite poles of the cells during mitosis and meiosis (reviewed in <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nasmyth and Haering, 2005</xref> and <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hirano, 2006</xref>). Cohesin forms a large tripartite ring composed of a pair of Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) proteins, SMC1 and SMC3, and an &#x003b1; kleisin protein, Scc1/Rad21, whose cleavage by separase causes cohesin's dissociation from chromosomes and triggers sister-chromatid disjunction at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Sister-chromatid cohesion requires two other non-SMC subunits, namely, Pds5 and Scc3/SA, that bind to cohesin's &#x003b1; kleisin subunit. The establishment of cohesion depends on the cohesin loading complex Scc2/Scc4 and on the acetyl-transferase Eco1/Ctf7.</p><p>The fact that cohesin forms a ring whose opening releases it from chromatin has led to the suggestion that it holds sister DNAs together by using a topological mechanism (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gruber et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, this type of function could also be of value in regulating aspects of chromosome organization that are independent of sister-chromatid cohesion and are not directly required for chromosome segregation. It is notable in this regard that the majority of cohesin is removed from chromosome arms during prophase/prometaphase in most eukaryotic cells by a separase-independent mechanism (<xref rid="bib9 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Kueng et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Only cohesin that subsequently persists on chromosomes is cleaved by separase at the onset of anaphase (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Waizenegger et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). As a consequence, there exists a large pool of cohesin ready to reassociate with chromosomes as soon as cells exit from mitosis during telophase. Cohesin is therefore tightly associated with chromosomes for much of the cell-division cycle and could have important functions on unreplicated genomes.</p><p>Much evidence has emerged recently that cohesin might have important roles in regulating gene expression (reviewed in <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dorsett, 2007</xref>). Approximately half of the cases of a multisystem developmental disorder in humans called Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), which is characterized by mental retardation, upper limb abnormalities, growth delay, and facial dysmorphisms, are caused by mutations in genes encoding NIPBL/Delangin (the human Scc2 ortholog), SMC1A, or SMC3 (<xref rid="bib5 bib21 bib31 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Deardorff et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Krantz et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Musio et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Tonkin et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Because even severe cases of CdLS appear not to be accompanied by defects in sister-chromatid cohesion, it has been suggested that CdLS is caused by misregulated gene expression during embryonic development. Consistent with this possibility, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Scc2 ortholog, Nipped-B, facilitates long-range enhancer-promotor interactions, at least for certain genes whose regulatory sequences have been mutated (<xref rid="bib8 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Dorsett et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Rollins et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in <italic>mau-2</italic>, the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans Scc4</italic> ortholog, cause defects in axon guidance (<xref rid="bib2 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Bernard et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Takagi et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). Recently, two cohesin subunits, Scc1/Rad21 and SMC3, have been implicated in expression of the hematopoietic transcription factors <italic>runx1</italic> and <italic>runx3</italic> in zebrafish (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Horsfield et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite these findings, it cannot be excluded that developmental &#x0201c;cohesinopathies&#x0201d; are in fact caused by &#x0201c;knock on&#x0201d; effects of compromising the establishment or maintenance of sister-chromatid cohesion. In the case of CdLS, for example, haploinsufficiency of NIPBL/Delangin might cause cell-type-specific sister-chromatid cohesion defects (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kaur et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) that would be overlooked by examining this process in only one type of cell. It is therefore vital to develop methods that permit observation of the effects on gene expression and development of eliminating cohesin's function completely without interfering with cell proliferation.</p><p>To analyze cohesin's function in a more sophisticated manner than hitherto possible, to our knowledge, in metazoa, we have used the tobacco etch mosaic virus (TEV) protease to cleave cohesin's &#x003b1; kleisin subunit in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in a cell-type-specific and/or temporally controlled manner. This process opens the cohesin ring and presumably abolishes its topological embrace of chromatin fibers (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gruber et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). As expected, expression of TEV protease in proliferating cells of fly embryos whose sole form of Rad21 contains TEV-cleavage sites causes precocious separation of sister chromatids and has a devastating effect on chromosome segregation. More remarkably, TEV-induced Rad21 cleavage in postmitotic neurons is lethal. It causes defects in the developmental axon pruning of mushroom-body &#x003b3; neurons within pupal brains and defects in cholinergic neurons that result in highly abnormal larval locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>A System to Inactivate Pre-Existing Cohesin Complexes</title><p>To inactivate cohesin, we chose cleavage of its &#x003b1; kleisin subunit (Rad21). Although this does not directly affect any known functional domain of Rad21, it severs and thereby opens cohesin's tripartite ring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A), leading to its rapid dissociation from chromosomes. To do this in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was necessary first to create a <italic>Rad21</italic> mutant strain, second to complement the <italic>Rad21</italic> mutation with a version of <italic>Rad21</italic> that contains cleavage sites for a site-specific protease, and lastly to express&#x000a0;a version of the protease that can accumulate within nuclei in&#x000a0;a tissue-specific and/or time-dependent manner.

DNA staining suggests that mitoses are normal throughout the first 16 epidermal cell divisions. Late mitoses and cell divisions in embryonic neural precursors also appear to be unaffected (data not shown). The maternal gene product is presumably sufficient to execute the embryonic cell-division program. Despite this, most (95%) homozygous mutant embryos die before hatching. The rare mutant larvae that hatch possess almost no motor activity and fail to grow. It is therefore conceivable that embryonic death arises from a defective nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Flies Expressing TEV-Cleavable Rad21 Are Viable and Fertile</title><p>To rescue <italic>Rad21</italic> mutants, we generated transgenic flies that express C-terminally myc-epitope-tagged versions of Rad21 with TEV-cleavage sites. A tandem array of three TEV consensus recognition sequences was inserted into four poorly conserved and putatively unstructured regions within Rad21's central domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A; for details, see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). The cleavability of these proteins was initially tested by cotransfecting tissue-culture cells with vectors expressing TEV-cleavable Rad21 (Rad21<sup>TEV</sup>) and TEV protease. This showed that all four versions of Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> were efficiently cleaved (data not shown). Equally important, Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> with three TEV sites at position 271 or 550 as well as a version lacking TEV insertions restored full viability and fertility of homozygous <italic>Rad21<sup>ex</sup></italic> alleles when expressed from a tubulin promotor (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). We were thus able to generate fly stocks that carry Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> as their sole source of Rad21.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Efficient TEV-Induced Rad21 Cleavage In Vivo</title><p>To test whether flies can tolerate TEV protease, we created transgenic flies that express v5-epitope-tagged TEV in an inducible manner, either directly from the heat-shock promotor (hs-TEV) or under the control of the Gal4/UAS system (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Ba and 1Bb). TEV tagged with three nuclear localization sequences (NLS) accumulated within nuclei and did not cause any notable phenotypes when expressed ubiquitously or in a tissue-specific manner by using a variety of different Gal4 driver lines (data not shown). Western blot showed that TEV induction caused the appearance of cleavage fragments of the expected size from Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> proteins, but not from endogenous Rad21 or transgenic Rad21 proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D and data not shown). Heat shock led to the accumulation of TEV and Rad21-cleavage fragments more rapidly when the protease was expressed from hs-TEV compared to hs-Gal4/UAS-TEV (data not shown). Importantly, TEV induction led to cleavage of most of the Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> pool within a few hours.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>TEV-Induced Rad21 Cleavage Causes Chromosome Missegregation</title><p>To investigate the consequences of Rad21 cleavage in a single cell cycle, we made use of the fact that zygotic expression is specifically switched on during embryonic cycle 14. Maternal Gal4 (&#x003b1;4-tub-Gal4) was used to drive expression of paternally contributed UAS-TEV in embryos containing Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> as their sole source of Rad21. Western blot confirmed that the expression of TEV causes a reduction in the level of intact Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> and the appearance of a &#x0223c;90 kDa TEV-cleavage fragment before mitosis 14 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A). The residual full-length protein presumably stems from embryos (50%) that did not inherit the TEV protease-containing chromosome. These results suggest that most, if not all, Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> is cleaved during cycle 14.</p><p>Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> cleavage had no effect on progression through the first 13 embryonic cell-division cycles, during which TEV is not expressed (data not shown). By contrast, as soon as zygotic expression is switched on, TEV had a devastating effect as cells embarked on mitosis 14. DNA staining and immunolabeling of embryos with anti-tubulin revealed the absence of any normal meta-, ana-, and telophase figures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). Despite the formation of bipolar spindles, condensed chromosomes failed to align on a metaphase plate and were found scattered throughout cells. Cells accumulated in this metaphase-like state, with high levels of Cyclin B and BubR1 concentrated at kinetochores.</p><p>These observations are consistent with the notion that Rad21 cleavage causes precocious loss of sister-chromatid cohesion. This would prevent the establishment of the tension at kinetochores needed to turn off the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) and causes mitotic arrest (<xref rid="bib26 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Logarinho et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Tanaka, 2005</xref>). To test this, we used time-lapse microscopy to observe chromosomes marked with histone H2Av-mRFP1 and kinetochores marked with EGFP-Cid. This revealed that, upon Rad21 cleavage, chromosomes condense during prophase of cycle 14, usually with paired, presumably sister, kinetochores similar to those found in a wild-type strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B, t &#x0003d; 0&#x02013;60 s, compare <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S1</xref> [WT] and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S2</xref> [Rad21-depleted]). However, during prometaphase, soon after biorientation, sister chromatids disjoin prematurely and often segregate to opposite poles. This highly abnormal process is asynchronous, with different chromosomes splitting at different times. As a result, chromosomes do not congress to a metaphase plate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movies S2 and S3</xref>). Exit from mitosis is delayed and cells arrest in a highly abnormal mitotic state, during which individual chromatids often lose their attachment to spindle poles, sometimes reorient, and move between poles (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>B). After &#x0223c;20 min, chromosome decondensation occurs abruptly and chromatids in the equatorial plane are cut by the cleavage furrow (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>C; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S4</xref>). Although the mitotic arrest caused by Rad21 cleavage is only transient, mitosis nevertheless lasts approximately six times longer than in wild-type. These results are consistent with data from previous RNAi experiments in tissue-culture cells (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Vass et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) and clearly show that Rad21 is essential for mitosis. We conclude that cohesin is necessary for sister-chromatid cohesion in the fly, as it is in yeast and vertebrate cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Cohesin Binds to Defined Regions on Polytene Chromosomes</title><p>We next used TEV cleavage to address whether cohesin has a role in holding together the multiple DNA molecules of polytene chromosomes in salivary glands. These chromosomes are generated by repeated rounds of DNA replication without intervening mitoses (endoreduplication) (reviewed in <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Zhimulev et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Immunostaining of wild-type polytene-chromosome squashes showed that Rad21, detected with a Rad21-specific antibody, localizes mainly to interband regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A), as has been suggested in previous reports (<xref rid="bib8 bib10 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Dorsett et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Gause et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Markov et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Several lines of evidence imply that these bands genuinely correspond to cohesin. First, coimmunostainings showed that myc-tagged Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> is bound to&#x000a0;the same chromosomal regions as endogenous Rad21 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). Second, cohesin's other three subunits (SMC1, SMC3, and SA/Scc3) colocalize with Rad21 on polytene-chromosome squashes (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>A). Third, staining by myc-, Rad21-, and SMC1-specific antibodies is greatly reduced after TEV-induced cleavage of Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> in flies in which this is the only form of Rad21 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>B). The fact that SMC proteins are also released implies that TEV cleavage of Rad21 releases the entire cohesin complex from chromosomes. Cohesin did not colocalize with known interband-specific proteins (Z4, BEAF32, Jil1, MSL2, CTCF), and its distribution differed significantly from numerous other proteins whose localization on polytene chromosomes has been well documented (PolII, Rpb3, HSF, trx, Pc, Su[Hw], CP190, Mod[mdg4]) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>A and S4B and data not shown). The cohesin holocomplex appears to be bound to distinct but as yet undefined regions of polytene chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>Polytene Chromosomes Persist after Rad21 Cleavage</title><p>To address whether cohesin holds polytene chromosomes together, we induced TEV by heat shock (from hs-TEV) in late third-instar larvae surviving on transgenic Rad21 with or without TEV-cleavage sites and containing morphologically normal polytene chromosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). After heat shock, TEV caused rapid cleavage of Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> and its disappearance from polytene chromosomes for at least 15 hr, but it had no effect on Rad21 without TEV sites or on the staining pattern of CTCF, a boundary-binding factor (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Moon et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and 4C). Surprisingly, the morphology of polytene chromosomes was unaltered by cohesin's removal (see DAPI stainings in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C), even when hypotonic or noncrosslinking conditions were used during spreading, which should favor their disassembly (data not shown). It is conceivable that the chromosomes retain their integrity by virtue of the small amount of full-length Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B) that persists after TEV cleavage (either due to resistance to TEV or due to Rad21 resynthesis). However, the simplest explanation for our results is that cohesin is not required for maintaining the integrity of polytene chromosomes.</p><p>Interestingly, cohesin is required for the normal development of salivary glands. In contrast to hs-TEV, which does not cause significant TEV expression at 18&#x000b0;C, leaky expression of TEV under the control of hs-Gal4/UAS at 18&#x000b0;C led to smaller salivary glands (&#x0223c;1/2 the size) containing thinner polytene chromosomes in 100% of wandering late third-instar larvae that survived on Rad21<sup>TEV</sup>, as compared to controls (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>). Importantly, this decrease in organ size was due to smaller, not fewer, cells per gland. Similar results were obtained by expressing TEV by using a salivary-gland-specific driver (F4-Gal4) (data not shown). These results suggest that cohesin has an essential function in nonproliferating, endocycling salivary gland cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><title>A Function for Cohesin in Neurons?</title><p>The finding that cohesin is required for normal salivary gland development suggests that cohesin does indeed have nonmitotic functions. Because cohesin is essential for cell proliferation, its putative additional functions would be best studied in postmitotic cells that do not require chromosome segregation. This raises two key questions. First, is cohesin widely present in postmitotic cells in the fly, and, second, is it possible to use TEV-mediated Rad21 cleavage to inactivate the complex in such cells? The answer to both questions is yes. Immunostaining showed that Rad21 is concentrated within the nuclei of most neurons in larval brains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C and data not shown). Moreover, expression of TEV in neurons from Rad21<sup>TEV</sup>-rescued flies during embryonic or larval development, by using the pan-neuronal drivers elav-Gal4 and nsyb-Gal4, causes developmental arrest and lethality (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.9"><title>Cohesin Rings Are Essential for Axonal and Dendritic Pruning</title><p>To investigate in more detail cohesin's function in neurons, we concentrated on postmitotic &#x003b3; neurons in the mushroom body of the fly brain.

Immunostaining with Rad21-specific antibodies detected endogenous Rad21 within the nuclei of &#x003b3; neurons and those of their neuronal neighbors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). TEV protease can be expressed in &#x003b3; neurons via specific Gal4 driver lines (e.g., H24-Gal4) (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Zars et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>) and localizes to their nuclei (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B). Crucially, TEV expression in Rad21<sup>TEV</sup>-rescued flies largely eliminated Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> from &#x003b3; neurons, but not from interspersed neighboring neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). In contrast, it had no effect on endogenous Rad21, which is not susceptible to TEV-induced cleavage.</p><p>We next analyzed the consequences of cohesin cleavage. The driver line 201Y-Gal4 is expressed in mushroom-body &#x003b3; neurons and has therefore been widely used in previous studies of the pruning process (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). In strains surviving on Rad21 without TEV sites and expressing 201Y-Gal4-driven TEV, the dendrites and axons of CD8-positive &#x003b3; neurons and of FasII-positive &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; neurons were indistinguishable from wild-type. The axons of &#x003b3; neurons initially projected into both dorsal and medial lobes (not shown) but were pruned by 18 hr after puparium formation (APF) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A, pruned axons are indicated with open arrowheads). In Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> larvae, &#x003b3; neurons also projected their axons into dorsal and medial lobes (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>A), but they failed to prune these projections during pupariation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A, middle row). However, the absence of axons of later-born &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; neurons (with high levels of FasII) in the center of the dorsal and medial lobes at 18 hr APF (compare upper right panel to middle right panel in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A) suggests that pupae arrest early after pupariation, before &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; neurons are born. This raises the possibility that the pruning defect is in fact caused by arrest at a developmental stage that preceeds &#x003b3;-neuron pruning.</p><p>Although specific for &#x003b3; neurons within the central nervous system, the 201Y-Gal4 driver is also expressed in muscles (O.S. and L. Luo, unpublished data). The developmental arrest might therefore be caused by inactivation of cohesin in muscles. To test this, we expressed Gal80 under control of the muscle-specific myosin heavy-chain (mhc) promoter (C. Winter and L.&#x000a0;Luo, personal communication) to prevent TEV expression and hence cohesin cleavage in muscles. Remarkably, this enabled pupae to develop well beyond the stage when pruning normally occurs. FasII-positive &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; neurons were now readily detected from 18 hr APF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A, bottom panels). Because &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; neurons are descended from neuroblasts that proliferate after giving rise to &#x003b3; neurons (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>), the mere presence of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; neurons implies that neuroblast proliferation is not blocked by the cleavage of Rad21 orchestrated by 201Y-Gal4. Importantly, the pruning defect in &#x003b3; neurons caused by Rad21 cleavage was still observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A, bottom panels).</p><p>If the pruning defect of postmitotic &#x003b3; neurons is caused by inactivation of cohesin in &#x003b3; neurons themselves and is not an indirect consequence of its inactivation in some other cell type, then expression of TEV protease under control of a different &#x003b3;-neuron-specific Gal4 driver should cause a similar phenotype. TEV expression via the H24-Gal4 driver confirmed that Rad21&#x000a0;cleavage in &#x003b3; neurons causes axonal pruning defects (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>B). Furthermore, comparison of &#x003b3;-neuron projections between strains with and without cohesin in H24-Gal4-positive cells revealed that &#x003b3; neurons also failed to prune their dendrites upon Rad21 cleavage (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>B). Although we did not observe axon-targeting defects during larval and early pupal stages, the axonal projections of brains from late pupae (&#x0003e;4 days APF), which contain fully differentiated adult structures, were very often disorganized and mistargeted (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>C). Our finding that a similar pruning defect accompanies Rad21 cleavage induced by two different Gal4 drivers, whose only common (known) feature is expression in &#x003b3;&#x000a0;neurons, implies that cohesin is needed for pruning of &#x003b3;-neuron axons and dendrites.</p><p>How might cohesin regulate pruning? Previous work has implicated the ecdysone receptor EcR-B1 as a key regulator of &#x003b3;-neuron pruning (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, pruning defects caused by <italic>SMC1</italic> mutations are suppressed by overexpression of EcR-B1 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Schuldiner et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The TEV-cleavage system should be ideal for testing whether cohesin is needed for EcR-B1 expression in all &#x003b3;&#x000a0;neurons. We found that Rad21 cleavage caused a major drop (at 18 hr APF) in the concentration of EcR-B1 within nuclei from most &#x003b3; neurons, but not from nuclei of other interspersed neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B). Only a minority of &#x003b3; neurons still contained detectable levels of EcR-B1 upon Rad21 cleavage (indicated by white arrows). These data suggest that cohesin is required for cell-type-specific EcR-B1 expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.10"><title>Cohesin Is Required in Cholinergic Neurons for Larval Locomotion</title><p>One of the advantages of the TEV system is that it enables protein inactivation in all neurons of a given type and thereby has the potential to cause changes in animal behavior. To investigate this, we expressed TEV under control of Cha-Gal4, which expresses Gal4 specifically in cholinergic neurons (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Salvaterra and Kitamoto, 2001</xref>). We noticed that this reduced the ability of Rad21<sup>TEV</sup>, but not Rad21, third-instar larvae to crawl up the sides of the vials. The larvae nevertheless pupariate, albeit within their food, and die as late pupae, with fully developed adult organs (data not shown). We used video imaging to compare locomotion of Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> and transgenic Rad21 third-instar larvae after placing them in the center of a Petri dish containing nonnutritive agar. This revealed that larvae with TEV sites in Rad21 moved less far than those without (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). More detailed analysis showed that larvae without TEV sites in Rad21 moved mostly in straight lines, whereas Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> larvae curved repetitively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>Bii and 7Biii), frequently turned their heads (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>Biv), and even moved backward (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>Bv; see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movies S5 and S6</xref>).</p><p>Three lines of evidence suggest that these dramatic changes are not caused by mitotic defects. First, chromosomes from brain cells expressing CD8-GFP driven by Cha-Gal4 were never positive for the mitosis-specific phosphohistone H3 marker (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>A), implying that Cha-Gal4 does not drive expression in dividing cells. Second, brains from larvae surviving on Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> and expressing TEV protease in cholinergic neurons do not have any detectable mitotic defects (&#x0003c;1%). Cohesion defects during mitosis would greatly delay passage through mitosis and therefore cause an increase in the percentage of phosphohistone H3-positive cells. No such effect was seen (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>). Third, we were unable to detect any gross morphological defects in the pattern of cholinergic neurons marked by CD8-GFP driven by Cha-Gal4 or any reduction in their numbers, either in the central nervous system (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>B) or in peripheral sensory organs (data not shown). We conclude that correct larval locomotion requires cohesin in cholinergic neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>A Tool by Which to Study Protein Function in Metazoa</title><p>Although it was known that TEV protease can inactivate protein function in budding yeast (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Uhlmann et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>), it was unclear whether TEV could be used in a complex metazoan organism. Our work shows that TEV can be expressed in a wide variety of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues without causing overt toxicity. More important, we show that TEV expression induces quantitative cleavage of TEV-site-containing, but not wild-type, Rad21 protein, and that this is accompanied by penetrant phenotypes both in proliferating tissues and, more unexpectedly, in cells not engaged in mitosis, such as neurons and salivary gland cells.</p><p>The system we have developed has many attractive features that should make it a powerful and versatile tool for studying protein function in vivo. First, the method causes protein inactivation within a few hours and does not rely on a gradual depletion of the protein, as occurs in methods that interfere with the protein's synthetic capacity, such as recombinase-mediated gene deletion or RNA interference. Second, the system is reversible. By using Gal80ts, TEV protease can be turned both on and off. Third, it is possible to be certain that phenotypes are caused by cleavage of the target protein by comparing the effect of TEV expression in animals whose target protein either does or does not contain TEV sites. Fourth, by targeting the protease to particular locations inside or even (by using a secreted protease) outside cells, it should be possible to direct inactivation of the target protein to specific intra- or extracellular compartments. The restriction of protein inactivation to specific cellular compartments may be easier to devise by using TEV than degron systems relying on the much more complex process of&#x000a0;ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dohmen et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). Unlike the MARCM system, which uses FLP/FRT-induced mitotic recombination to generate homozygous mutant clones in proliferating tissues, TEV cleavage can be triggered in all cells of a given tissue and at any stage of development, features that will greatly facilitate phenotypic and biochemical analyses. Because many eukaryotic proteins contain multiple functional domains connected by unstructured polypeptide chains, protein inactivation through TEV cleavage should be applicable to a large variety of proteins. It could also be used to clip off protein domains and thereby alter protein activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>The Integrity of the Cohesin Ring Is Essential for Sister-Chromatid Cohesion in Mitosis</title><p>Our first priority upon developing a system to cleave Rad21 was to use it to investigate the role of cohesin during mitosis. In yeast, cohesin has a vital role in holding sister chromatids together until all chromosomes have bioriented during mitosis, whereupon cleavage of Scc1/Rad21 by separase triggers sister-chromatid disjunction (reviewed in <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nasmyth and Haering, 2005</xref>). The consequences of depleting Scc1/Rad21 from tissue-culture cells by using RNA interference are, on the whole, consistent with the above-mentioned notion (<xref rid="bib4 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Coelho et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Vass et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). However, results from depletion experiments have not been able to directly explain the effects of inactivating cohesin within a single cell cycle.</p><p>We engineered a situation in which efficient cleavage of Rad21 occurred precisely as embryonic cells embarked on cycle 14, causing a devastating effect on mitosis. Chromosomes enter mitosis with paired sister kinetochores; however, instead of stably biorienting on a metaphase plate, they disjoin precociously, usually segregating to opposite poles. Importantly, these highly abnormal movements all take place prior to the APC/C-dependent activation of separase. These observations imply that cohesin is essential for the sister-chromatid cohesion necessary to resist mitotic-spindle forces in metazoan organisms as well as in yeast.</p><p>Our finding that most sister chromatids (in cells with cleaved Rad21) disjoin to opposite spindle poles, albeit precociously, suggests that their chromosomes possess sufficient cohesion to establish a transient form of biorientation, though possibly with low accuracy. We cannot at this stage determine whether this cohesion is mediated by cohesin complexes that have survived Rad21 TEV cleavage or by an independent cohesive mechanism such as residual sister DNA catenation. We can nevertheless conclude that the latter, if it exists, is incapable of resisting spindle forces and cannot therefore maintain sister-chromatid cohesion during a period in which the SAC has been activated and errors in chromosome biorientation are corrected. Thus, what really distinguishes cohesion mediated by cohesin from DNA catenation is its ability to be regulated by the SAC, and this may be the reason why eukaryotic cells appear to use cohesin for mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>The Cohesin Ring Has Key Functions in Nonmitotic Cells</title><p>Mutations in Scc2's human ortholog as well as in SMC1 and SMC3 cause the developmental defects associated with CdLS (reviewed in <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dorsett, 2007</xref>). It is unclear whether these defects are caused by mitotic errors during development or by defects in nonmitotic cohesin functions. The first clue that cohesin might indeed play key roles during development other than holding sister chromatids together was the finding that mutations in <italic>D</italic>.&#x000a0;<italic>melanogaster</italic><italic>Nipped-B</italic>, the ortholog of <italic>Scc2</italic>, alters the expression of genes whose regulatory sequences have been mutated (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rollins et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>If cohesin has nonmitotic functions during development, then these could occur in proliferating and nonproliferating (postmitotic) cells. To analyze cycling cells, it would be necessary to restrict analysis either to a short, specific cell-cycle stage (e.g., the G1 period) or to develop a means of differentially inactivating cohesin complexes engaged in nonmitotic functions, leaving intact those engaged in chromosome segregation. Analysis of&#x000a0;postmitotic cells is easier. It is merely necessary to devise&#x000a0;a protocol for inactivating cohesin only after cell proliferation has ceased.</p><p>Cleavage of Rad21 induced by postmitotic pan-neuronal drivers caused lethality, suggesting that cohesin has key functions in neurons. To investigate these in greater detail, we analyzed the effects of Rad21 cleavage in specific neuronal subtypes. The finding that the proliferative defects caused by a <italic>SMC1</italic> mutation in clones of mushroom-body neuroblasts are accompanied by defective pruning of axons (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Schuldiner et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) led us to investigate the effects of Rad21 cleavage in &#x003b3;&#x000a0;neurons. Our results show that Rad21 cleavage abolished the developmentally controlled pruning of both axons and dendrites in &#x003b3; neurons. These defects cannot have been caused by failures in cell division because cleavage had no effect on the birth of &#x003b3;&#x000a0;neurons or on their initial axonal projections.</p><p>Previous work on <italic>mau-2</italic> (the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Scc4 ortholog) has already provided a link between cohesin and axon development (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Benard et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Whereas Mau-2 was reported to act as a guidance factor required for correct axon and cell migration, investigation of &#x003b3; neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggests that cohesin mediates the elimination of axon projections and dendrites. However, our results do not rule out a function for cohesin in regulating axon guidance because Rad21 cleavage might not be complete when &#x003b3;-neuron axons start growing out in the first place. Indeed, we observed axon-projection defects in developmentally arrested late pupae.</p><p>It has not thus far been possible to show that &#x003b3;-neuron pruning defects cause changes in animal behavior. Cleavage of cohesin in the entire population of cholinergic neurons, in contrast, has a dramatic effect, causing larvae to turn frequently, move their heads back and forth, and even crawl backward. Importantly, the neurons clearly survive without functional cohesin and must be at least partially active, because larvae are not paralyzed&#x000a0;by cohesin cleavage, a phenotype seen when cholinergic transmission is switched off (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kitamoto, 2001</xref>). The locomotion defects are not dissimilar to those caused by mutations in <italic>scribbler</italic> (<italic>sbb</italic>) (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). <italic>sbb</italic>, also known as <italic>brakeless</italic> (<italic>bks</italic>) and <italic>master of thickveins</italic> (<italic>mtv</italic>), codes for a ubiquitously expressed corepressor of transcription (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Haecker et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref> and references therein). Expression of a <italic>sbb</italic> transcript exclusively in cholinergic neurons is sufficient to rescue locomotion defects of <italic>sbb</italic> mutants (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Suster et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). It therefore appears that the lack of <italic>sbb</italic> and cohesin in cholinergic neurons causes similar locomotion defects. Future work will have to show whether there is a link between <italic>sbb</italic> and cohesin. Our finding that cohesin has roles in neurons that are essential for normal behavior is consistent with the notion that the mental retardation invariably found in patients with CdLS is also due to defective neuronal function, as opposed to defective cell proliferation during development.</p><p>We have shown that suppression of 201Y-Gal4-induced TEV expression, specifically in muscles, bypasses the early pupal arrest in Rad21<sup>TEV</sup>-rescued flies and indicates that cohesin is essential in muscles as well as in neurons. In addition, although cohesin does not seem to be required for the maintenance of polytene-chromosome morphology, it is essential for normal progression through the endocycle in salivary glands. It is therefore conceivable that cohesin has key functions in most postmitotic cell types. What might these functions be? Cohesin is known to be required for efficient double-strand break repair as well as sister-chromatid cohesion (reviewed in <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nasmyth and&#x000a0;Haering, 2005</xref>), and it promotes repair by facilitating homologous recombination between sister chromatids. Its action in postmitotic neurons, however, must be on unreplicated chromatids. We suggest therefore that cohesin's function in neurons and other postmitotic G0 cells is more likely to be in regulating gene expression. The finding that cohesin cleavage reduces the accumulation of EcR-B1 within &#x003b3; neurons is consistent with this notion. Interestingly, recent data have shown that cohesin binds to the EcR gene in several fly cell lines (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Misulovin et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Future experiments should address whether cohesin acts as a general regulator of gene expression.</p><p>In summary, we provide definitive evidence that the cohesin ring has essential functions in cells with unreplicated chromosomes. It will be important in the future to establish whether cohesin functions by trapping chromatin fibers, as it appears to do in cells that have replicated their genomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Fly Strains</title><p>TEV-cleavage experiments were performed in a <italic>Rad21</italic> null background.

Late third-instar larvae of control strains were selected based on their characteristic wandering stage. Since Rad21-depleted larvae do not crawl up the walls of food vials, Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> larvae were considered as &#x0201c;wandering&#x0201d; based on their size and the fact that they stopped foraging within the food. &#x0201c;Wandering&#x0201d; third-instar larvae were placed in the center of 90 mm diameter Petri dishes coated with nonnutritive 2% agar. After 1 min of adaptation, the movement was recorded over a period of 2 min by taking images every 5 s with a Canon Power Shot S70 digital camera. Movies were assembled, and larval movement was manually tracked by using ImageJ 1.38&#x000d7; software. Total locomotion was measured by superimposing trails onto a 6 mm grid and counting the number of squares through which larvae moved. For detailed analysis of locomotion behavior, higher magnification movies were taken on a dissection scope coupled to a Canon Power Shot S70 digital camera. For temporal projection of larval movement, single images were extracted from the recorded movies with a time lapse of 2 s. Projections of 10 images (corresponding to 20 s periods) were obtained by using ImageJ software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="app1" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplemental Data</title><p>Supplemental Data include Supplemental Experimental Procedures, two tables, seven figures, six movies, and Supplemental References and are available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.developmentalcell.com/cgi/content/full/14/2/239/DC1/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.developmentalcell.com/cgi/content/full/14/2/239/DC1/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="app2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplemental Data</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc1"><caption><title>Document S1.

(a) UAS-TEV is controlled by the UAS/GAL4 system, enabling TEV expression by specific Gal4 driver lines. (b) TEV directly fused to the heat-shock promotor allows for its ubiquitous induction in a time-specific manner.

The scale bars are 50 &#x003bc;m in the top left panel, 10 &#x003bc;m in the top right panel, and 10 &#x003bc;m in the bottom panel. (Top) Most cells in &#x02212;TEV embryos have already completed mitosis 14 (arrowhead in whole embryo views). Dividing cells (arrow) during various mitotic stages (pro-, meta-, ana-, telophase) are shown in the high-magnification view. In &#x0002b;TEV embryos, the entire dorsolateral epidermis is arrested in mitosis. (Bottom) In &#x02212;TEV embryos, high levels of BubR1 and Cyclin B are only observed during metaphase (m), whereas anaphase (a) cells do not stain for BubR1 and Cyclin B. Arrested cells of &#x0002b;TEV embryos are Cyclin B positive and have high levels of BubR1 on separated sister kinetochores.</p><p>(B) Embryos surviving on Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> and expressing either only maternal Gal4 (&#x02212;TEV) or maternal Gal4-driven TEV protease (&#x0002b;TEV) were used for time-lapse imaging.
