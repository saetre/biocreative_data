The bacterial SWI/SNF homolog RapA&#x02014;an integral part of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNA polymerase complex&#x02014;has been implicated in remodeling post-termination DNA&#x02013;RNA polymerase&#x02013;RNA ternary complexes (PTC), however its explicit nucleic acid substrates and mechanism remain elusive. Our work presents evidence indicating that RNA is a key substrate of RapA. Specifically, the formation of stable RapA&#x02013;RNA intermediates in transcription and other, independent lines of evidence presented herein indicate that RapA binds and remodels RNA during transcription. Our results are consistent with RapA promoting RNA release from DNA&#x02013;RNA polymerase&#x02013;RNA ternary complexes; this process may be accompanied by the destabilization of non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes (putative DNA&#x02013;RNA triplexes).

However, the explicit role of these helicase-like protein subdomains remains undetermined, and none of the proteins of this superfamily described to date has shown helicase activity in conventional <italic>in vitro</italic> helicase assays utilizing duplex nucleic acid substrates. Mutations in SWI/SNF genes have been associated with pediatric cancers of brain and soft tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>); multiple, independent studies indicate that SWI/SNF proteins act as tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, purified SWI/SNF complexes produce ATP-dependent alterations of the chromatin structure, and these observations eventually led to the idea that SWI/SNF complexes act primarily as chromatin remodeling machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). In mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and yeast, the multiple individual SWI/SNF polypeptides are present as integral components of large multi-subunit nuclear complexes. The specific roles of individual SWI/SNF polypeptides in eukaryotic SWI/SNF and other nuclear complexes are debated. It has been suggested that the ATP-propelled sliding of SWI/SNF proteins along DNA might enhance nucleosome translocation during transcription and other cellular events that involve DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>). Existing studies associate the activity of SWI/SNF proteins almost exclusively with remodeling of DNA and histone&#x02013;DNA complexes, and their primary role <italic>in vivo</italic> is proposed to be global regulation of transcription and gene expression.</p><p>In contrast, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> contains only a single 110-kDa SWI/SNF polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), which shares homology with its eukaryotic counterparts throughout six characteristic helicase-like subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>), suggesting that they share similar basic functions. This homology also makes the <italic>E. coli</italic> SWI/SNF protein RapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) a particularly attractive target for analysis of the explicit role(s) of SWI/SNF polypeptides. RapA&#x02014;also referred to as HepA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)&#x02014;was identified as a subunit of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This relatively abundant protein, the copy number of which is roughly comparable to that of the RNA polymerase sigma<sup>70</sup> subunit, binds preferentially to the core RNA polymerase (with the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of the complex being in the nanomolar range, indicating a high degree of specificity of the interaction) at the interface of the alpha and beta-prime RNA polymerase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Rigorous study of <italic>rapA</italic> deletion mutation strains has produced no evidence of significant alterations in their rate of growth, mutation rates or UV sensitivity in comparison with <italic>rapA</italic> plus strains under a variety of experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), suggesting that the role of RapA differs from those proposed for eukaryotic SWI/SNF polypeptides. However, <italic>rapA</italic> deletion produces a unique phenotype, rendering bacteria incapable of efficient growth at relatively high salt concentrations in LB agar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Analysis of the role of RapA in transcription has indicated its capability for conditional stimulation of the polymerase's transcriptional activity (in a salt concentration-specific fashion, consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of the <italic>rapA</italic> deletion mutation) likely via promoting the dissociation of one or more components of the DNA&#x02013;RNA polymerase&#x02013;RNA ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, it remains unclear which component(s) of non-productive post-termination ternary complexes are specifically targeted by RapA; our previous hypotheses&#x02014;based on studies with eukaryotic SWI/SNF proteins&#x02014;solely focused on DNA as a substrate of RapA. The question of the explicit nucleic acid- and/or protein substrate specificity of RapA is important, because the function of SWI/SNF motifs V and VI have not been fully explained. Although they are present in all SWI/SNF proteins in addition to helicase-like motifs I&#x02013;IV, studies of distantly related DEAD/H DNA helicases have suggested that motifs I&#x02013;IV may be sufficient for translocation along DNA. X-ray structures of the catalytic domain of the RapA homolog from <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (SsoRad54) complexed to DNA have further confirmed DNA binding by a bacterial SWI/SNF protein and indicate that SWI/SNF motifs I&#x02013;III and IV&#x02013;VI form two semi-autonomous modules, both of which are bound to DNA in the reported structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>Our most recent work has focused on the determination of preferred nucleic acid and/or protein substrates of RapA. Excess RapA was previously shown to produce complex effects on <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, which included inhibitory effects at &#x02018;early&#x02019; timepoints and a significant increase in the number of completed transcriptional rounds in prolonged <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions, which was attributed to RapAs remodeling of DNA&#x02013;RNA polymerase&#x02013;RNA ternary complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In this study&#x02014;given that the interaction of RapA with the polymerase is well established&#x02014;using primarily purified native RapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) at a &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; (1:1) molar ratio with the polymerase, we have conducted experiments in order to clarify the general mechanistic aspects of this remodeling. Our work presents multiple, independent lines of evidence indicating that RNA is a key substrate of RapA. Our biochemical data, supported by a homology model of the RapA NTPase domain&#x02013;DNA complex, suggest that this RNA-remodeling activity of RapA may be in addition to its DNA-binding activity. Our results are consistent with a model in which RapA promotes RNA release from DNA&#x02013;RNA polymerase&#x02013;RNA ternary complexes. Taken together, our data indicate a novel RNA remodeling activity for RapA, a representative of the SWI/SNF protein superfamily. This finding could potentially deepen our understanding of the functions of all SWI/SNF proteins, and may point to yet-unidentified activities of eukaryotic SWI/SNF proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Enzymes</title><p>Native RapA was isolated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

However, it is unclear which component(s) of the ternary, post-termination DNA&#x02013;RNA polymerase&#x02013;RNA complex (PTC) are targeted by RapA. In principle, RapA may (i) facilitate the release of nascent RNA from RNA polymerase (Model 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), (ii) promote the release of RNA polymerase (with or without nascent RNA) from DNA (Model 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), and/or (iii) stimulate transcriptional cycling by means of disrupting non-productive DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes, irrespective of either the DNA-bound or free status of the polymerase (Model 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

If RapA were indeed to promote transcriptional cycling by displacing RNA polymerase from DNA, under most circumstances [the exception being a nearly instantaneous transfer of the polymerase from the terminator to the promoter section in the DNA template, which, at least in theory, cannot be entirely ruled out due to possible co-alignment of these two sections in supercoiled DNA (see Ref. 23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> therein)] this should be accompanied by a measurable increase in the fraction of free RNA polymerase in the system.

These experiments showed no detectable reduction in the amount of DNA-associated RNA polymerase in the presence of RapA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, densitogram; compare the levels of the large RNA polymerase subunits in reactions with or without RapA). Also, this set of experiments showed that &#x0003e;85% of RapA dissociated from the DNA-bound RNA polymerase, while &#x0003e;50% of the sigma<sup>70</sup> subunit was retained by the DNA-bound enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, graph).

Furthermore, a number of other independent experiments, which assessed the amount of DNA-associated RNA polymerase in reactions with or without RapA consistently showed no effect of RapA on the amount of DNA-associated polymerase (for example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> above). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Lack of the RapA effect on the amount of DNA-bound RNA polymerase in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions with supercoiled DNA. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription reactions carried out for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence or absence of RapA were fractionated on non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels, which were cast and run using 2&#x000d7; TBE, and the amounts of individual RNA polymerase subunits retained on supercoiled DNA were determined from quantitated SDS gels, as described in the text.

A pioneering work by Roberts and Crothers presented evidence for the formation of duplex DNA-single-stranded RNA triplexes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Because of the overall scarcity of data regarding specific conditions for DNA&#x02013;RNA triplex formation, we first set out to confirm the formation of non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes in a PAGE-based binding assay that allows unambiguous detection of complexes between unmodified and/or untethered templates. We have chosen to test the optimal conditions for rA&#x02013;dA&#x02013;dT interaction; the rationale being: (i) the likely similarity of rA&#x02013;dA&#x02013;dT triplexes to dA&#x02013;dA&#x02013;dT DNA triplexes, which are textbook examples of Hoogsteen complexes proven beyond reasonable doubt, (ii) the study of putative rA&#x02013;dA&#x02013;dT triplexes would be complementary to already existing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and (iii) homo-dA/dT tracts are relatively common in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, particularly under the promoter and terminator regions.</p><p>Under &#x02018;standard&#x02019; EMSA conditions (in 0.5&#x000d7; TBE) model DNA templates (which followed the basic design introduced in the study referred to above) incorporating (dA/dT)<sub>20</sub> homoduplexes (with varied composition of the 4-nt loop in DNA) showed no interaction with rA<sub>20</sub>, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, Gel 1). However, an increase in the ionic strength (to 2&#x000d7; TBE) led to the formation of stable DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes; the (dA/dT)<sub>20</sub> homoduplex was essential to the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, Gel 2), and the increase in the length of the dA/dT tract to (dA/dT)<sub>40</sub> resulted in an expected gel-retardation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, Gel 2; compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 14 and 15). Interestingly, the composition of the 4-nt loop in DNA contributed to the strength of the interaction, with C<sub>4</sub> or GATC being more preferred than G<sub>4</sub>. Stable DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes (putative DNA&#x02013;RNA triplexes) were formed when 2&#x000d7; TBE was supplemented with 5 mM magnesium chloride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, Gel 3); the reduced mobility of the nucleic acid probes may be due to Mg<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;nucleic acid interaction; however the formation of rA&#x02013;rA&#x02013;dT triplexes under these conditions cannot be entirely ruled out. The reduced interaction at lowered pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, Gel 4) suggests that O<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x02026; H hydrogen bonds may be essential for DNA&#x02013;RNA interaction. Next, we tested RNA probes in which the RNAs rA<sub>18</sub> tract is followed by a stem-loop structure (thus, the RNAs 3&#x02032;-end is blocked by a &#x02018;non-interactor&#x02019; extension); these templates also formed stable complexes with the indicated DNA probes under &#x02018;optimal&#x02019; conditions&#x02014;at relatively high salt concentrations, in the presence of magnesium. A detailed description of these experiments is provided as Supplementary Data (Figure S6). In general, our PAGE-based study produced results consistent with those reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), with relatively high salt concentrations and magnesium promoting non-canonical interactions, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Next, we constructed immobilized DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes, in which 5&#x02032;dA<sub>20</sub>dC<sub>4</sub>dT<sub>20</sub> DNA was immobilized on Poly (rA)&#x02013;agarose, to test the effect of RapA on their stability.

With these templates, the displacement of DNA from RNA in reactions containing RNA polymerase and ATP was enhanced by RapA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 6). When present at quantities equimolar to that of the polymerase, of all the transcription factors that were tested, RapA was the only protein that could assist RNA polymerase in disrupting DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes of this type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). This RapA activity required the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 6, compare red and blue bars). Furthermore, increasing the RapA/RNA polymerase molar ratio to 8:1 resulted in an increase in the amount of DNA displaced into the &#x02018;soluble&#x02019; phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), thus supporting the proposition that the ATP-dependent disruption of DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes was mediated by RapA. In the presence of excess RapA, RNA polymerase and ATP, more than 50% of the total amount of DNA in the sample was displaced from Poly(rA)&#x02013;agarose after 30 min. Furthermore, both RNA polymerase and RapA failed to disrupt these dA&#x02013;dT homoduplex DNA&#x02013;Poly(rA)&#x02013;agarose complexes efficiently when tested separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). The ability to separate RNA from DNA efficiently was gained only after mixing the two purified enzymes together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), further indicating the unlikelihood of contaminating enzymatic activities contributing to the observed effect. Our additional, control experiments showed that, if treated with Ribonuclease H (8 U/&#x000b5;l), these dA&#x02013;dT homoduplex DNA&#x02013;Poly(rA)&#x02013;agarose complexes yielded little or no DNA in the soluble phase (data not shown), suggesting non-Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing between DNA and RNA, in accord with our PAGE-based study of similar DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The nature of the explicit nucleic acid or protein substrate specificity of RapA may be the key to understanding the primary function of this protein and its prokaryotic homologs, with possible ramifications for all SWI/SNF proteins.

Interestingly, key differences between this partial RapA structure and that of SsoRad54 included several charged amino acids, which nearly co-align at certain viewpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>F and G) along the axis pointing into the DNAs major groove. Most prominent of these differences are Tyr235 and Glu233, both amino acids facing the DNAs major groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, E&#x02013;G). Other changes, such as Arg223 and Arg224, as well as His213, would likely fall into the interface between the two major domains of RapA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E; even though the sequence similarity between RapA and SsoRad54 within the domain-harboring SWI/SNF homology modules V&#x02013;VI was not sufficient to yield a predicted protein structure, it seems likely that the overall modular organization of the two proteins must be similar, as there is a consensus regarding the presence of SWI/SNF homology motifs V and VI in RapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>) despite the noted dissimilarity of RapA to the other members of Snf2 family between helicase motifs III and V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>)].</p><p>The homology model of the putative DNA-binding domain in RapA&#x02014;taken together with previously reported results indicating modulation of RapAs transcription-stimulatory activity by supercoiled-to-linear DNA template transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>)&#x02014;further supports the idea that RapA indeed possesses an NTPase/DNA-binding or &#x02018;translocase&#x02019; module.

Below, we summarize these lines of evidence.</p><p>(i) Perhaps the most significant result of this study, the identification of stable RapA&#x02013;RNA transcription intermediates (which was made possible by the development of specialized assays, in which non-denatured <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions are fractionated on high-resolution (43 cm&#x02013;long) 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 6 M urea) clearly points to a transient RapA-transcript interaction. The RapA&#x02013;RNA complexes in question are almost certainly catalytic intermediates; their poorly defined gel mobilities are likely due to conformational heterogeneity of the RNA component. Furthermore, our study of RapAs RNA-binding affinity in a purified system also showed significantly increased RNA-binding activity of the polymerase&#x02013;RapA complex compared to that of the polymerase alone. RapA showed low RNA-binding activity in conventional binding assays [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>)] yet formed RNA adducts in &#x02018;functional&#x02019; <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions. We believe that this apparent discrepancy may be due to the transient nature of the (high affinity) RapA&#x02013;nucleic acid interaction, which, functionally, may serve the purpose of minimizing RapA&#x02013;DNA interaction in the translocating core RNA polymerase&#x02013;RapA complex. It is possible to speculate that a conformational change imposed upon RapA in termination/post-termination transcription complexes may trigger the formation of high-affinity RapA&#x02013;transcript complexes and their subsequent dissociation from RNA polymerase; consistent with this, the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> (conducted under non-denaturing conditions) point to the dissociation of RapA from steady-state transcription complexes.</p><p>(ii) Our recent, independent study indicated that potentially non-productive interactions by nascent RNA may represent a primary obstacle to continuous transcriptional cycling <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In that study, we demonstrated that the transcription-stimulatory activity of RapA, under certain conditions, can be mimicked by the ribosomal protein S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), an RNA-binding protein entirely composed of six loosely homologous RNA-binding modules. The obvious conclusion is that the two proteins may promote transcriptional cycling by a similar mechanism which involves protein&#x02013;nascent RNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>(iii) Studies utilizing two independent techniques supported the formation of non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes (putative DNA&#x02013;RNA triplexes) <italic>in vitro</italic>. These DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes, which may resemble &#x02018;Hoogsteen&#x02019; complexes except for their substitution of a single RNA strand for one of the DNA strands, were stabilized by relatively high salt concentrations and magnesium, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). It is important to note that our data show formation of stable non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes well within the range of intracellular <italic>E. coli</italic> osmolarity [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36 B37 B38">36&#x02013;38</xref>), reviewed in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>)] suggesting that these potentially non-productive DNA&#x02013;RNA interactions may be relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, RapA promoted the RNA polymerase-mediated disruption of DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes in an ATP-dependent fashion. It is tempting to speculate that these immobilized templates could mimic &#x02018;non-productive&#x02019; post-termination complexes referred to earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), however more detailed studies are needed to consider the possible functional significance of this novel activity of RapA. Coincidentally, a recent study with eukaryotic SWI/SNF proteins has suggested similar roles in DNA triplex remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>(iv) A number of previously obtained results also provide correlative data pointing toward the involvement of RapA in RNA management. (a) Cross-linking of RapA at the interface of the RNA polymerase alpha and beta-prime subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and the competition for binding to the polymerase between RapA and the RNA-binding protein S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) (suggesting that RapA may be positioned near or at the RNA polymerase's RNA channel), plus (b) identification of RapA as an integral element of the bacterial apparatus for RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23">19&#x02013;23</xref>) also indirectly support its role in RNA management.</p><p>Taken together, arguments (i)&#x02013;(iv) provide a strong basis for the role of RapA in transcript management. If RapA indeed possesses a DNA binding or &#x02018;translocase&#x02019; module&#x02014;as further supported by our homology modeling data&#x02014;this RNA-binding activity is more likely to be in addition to its DNA-binding activity. Our work presents conclusive evidence of RapA-mediated RNA remodeling. Besides the data supporting a transient RapA&#x02013;RNA interaction (which suggests a conformational change in RNA), two independent, dissimilar sets of experiments clearly indicate more substantial RapA-mediated RNA remodeling: (a) RapA made 5&#x02032;-termini of RNA transcripts more accessible to T4 PNK exchange reaction (at minimum, suggesting possible peeling of the transcripts&#x02019; 5&#x02032;-termini from either DNA or RNA polymerase), and&#x02014;in agreement with this&#x02014;(b) RapA promoted destabilization of non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes (putative DNA&#x02013;RNA triplexes) in a system with immobilized nucleic acid templates. Both results indicate that RapA may act to free RNA transcript from non-productive interactions with either DNA or RNA polymerase. Furthermore, (c) <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, bottom panel) also suggest such a possibility.</p><p>Taken together, our results are consistent with RapA mediating RNA release from transcription complexes (Model 1 and variant of Model 3); identification of stable RapA&#x02013;RNA intermediates in functional <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays strongly supports this conclusion. Furthermore, the destabilizing effect of RapA on non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes (a variant of Model 3) also supports the RNA release model, if non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes indeed contribute to the formation of non-productive PTC. At present, we do not have any evidence in support of Model 2.</p><p>In summary, we propose that RapA remodels RNA&#x02013;DNA and/or RNA&#x02013;RNA polymerase complexes during transcription; this remodeling may ultimately contribute to transcript release. Our previously proposed, general model for RapA catalysis [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> therein] thus remains correct; however, we have shifted emphasis from the possible destabilization of RNA polymerase&#x02013;DNA complexes to remodeling of RNA&#x02013;RNA polymerase and RNA&#x02013;DNA complexes. We also propose that this hypothetical role of RapA in RNA remodeling may include the disruption of salt-stabilized non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes (putative DNA&#x02013;RNA triplexes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>); this activity likely accounts for pronounced slow-growth phenotype of the <italic>rapA</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, left panels; also, ref. 23), thus explaining the salt-selectivity of the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>A model for the hypothetical function of RapA: the disruption of non-canonical DNA&#x02013;RNA complexes in transcription.
