Studies pertaining to the generation, maintenance, and biological effects of telomere formation are limited in metazoans. A mutation, <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic>, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> decreases the rate of repair of double strand DNA breaks in oocytes, thus leading to chromosomes that have lost a natural telomere and gained a new telomere. Amino acid sequence, domain architecture, and protein interactions suggest that MU2 is an ortholog of human MDC1. The MU2 protein is a component of meiotic recombination foci and localizes to repair foci in S2 cells after irradiation in a manner similar to that of phosphorylated histone variant H2Av. Domain searches indicated that the protein contains an N-terminal FHA domain and a C-terminal tandem BRCT domain. Peptide pull-down studies showed that the BRCT domain interacts with phosphorylated H2Av, while the FHA domain interacts with the complex of MRE11, RAD50, and NBS. A frameshift mutation that eliminates the MU2 BRCT domain decreases the number and size of meiotic phospho-H2Av foci. MU2 is also required for the intra-S checkpoint in eye-antennal imaginal discs. MU2 participates at an early stage in the recognition of DNA damage at a step that is prerequisite for both DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control. We propose a model suggesting that neotelomeres may arise when radiation-induced chromosome breaks fail to be repaired, fail to arrest progression through meiosis, and are deposited in the zygote, where cell cycle control is absent and rapid rounds of replication and telomere formation ensue.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Telomeres are structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes required for chromosome stability. If unrepaired, a single chromosome end without a telomere is sufficient to kill a cell, but new telomere formation is rare. Previously, we described a gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> whose mutants, after irradiation, produced many progeny with chromosomes lacking a natural telomere. The new broken chromosome ends, however, bound telomeric proteins and behaved as telomeres. Here, we show that the protein encoded by this gene, a homolog of the human <italic>MDC1</italic> gene, is a component of the repair foci that form at double strand DNA breaks and are prerequisite for both cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. The protein acts as a scaffold, connecting a phosphorylated histone that marks the site of the break to a protein complex necessary for repair. These results suggest a model for formation of neotelomeres in which DNA breaks induced in mutant oocytes evade repair and are deposited into embryos, which contain an abundance of maternally deposited telomeric proteins. In this context a chromosome end not recognized as broken may be treated as a telomere. These results may provide a basis to understand neotelomere formation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A single unrepaired DNA double strand break (DSB) in a dividing cell is a potentially lethal event.

Two main pathways implicated in the repair of a DSB are homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). A cell responds to a DSB by recruiting a host of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins to the chromatin sites near the DSB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Pastink1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. While most of the DDR proteins function in either HR or NHEJ, a number of them influence both pathways, including the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex, BRCA1, histone H2AX, DNA PKcs and ATM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Li1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Lieber1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. A high degree of conservation in DSB repair systems makes it convenient to use a model organism such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> to investigate these basic processes. Thus, it may also be possible to obtain and characterize mutations for specific genes necessary for DNA repair.</p><p>Unrepaired broken chromosome ends are highly unstable, initiating cell cycle arrest or cycling through repeated breakage-fusion-bridge cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-McClintock1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the germline they are rarely transmitted to the next generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Muller1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, although occasionally these broken chromosomes are stabilized and are propagated normally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Mason1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism of de novo telomere addition to nontelomeric DNA is unclear, but in systems using telomerase to maintain telomeres the enzyme telomerase is known to play an important role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Yu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The bulk of our knowledge concerning de novo telomere formation comes from studying ciliates that undergo developmentally programmed chromosome fragmentation and healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Prescott1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In most organisms, the only evidence for telomere loss is through the detection of aberrant karyotypes including terminal chromosome deficiencies that are successfully propagated as a result of de novo telomere formation. Terminal deficiencies are frequent in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Mitelman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, as exemplified by malignant melanomas in humans containing deletions of chromosome 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Trent1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the consequences of terminal deficiencies in humans, it would be of interest to study the nature and mechanistic details of their generation and maintenance in a genetically amenable organism such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>An ionizing radiation-dependent, female-specific mutator (<italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic>) on chromosome 3 of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been described that specifically increases the recovery of terminal deficiencies, i.e., chromosomes that have lost a natural telomere. Mature <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> oocytes when treated with 5 Gy of &#x003b3; irradiation show an increase in the frequency of <italic>y</italic> mutants over the controls. Cytological and molecular analysis of the <italic>y</italic> mutant chromosomes from <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> mothers showed that the great majority were terminal deficiencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Mason2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> females exhibited a delay in the repair of &#x003b3; ray induced lesions in the oocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Mason2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as reduced meiotic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Mason3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Although lesions induced in mature sperm are repaired after fertilization under the genetic control of female to which the males are mated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Graf1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, these lesions do not potentiate terminal deficiencies when the female carries the <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> mutation, suggesting that the DNA repair machinery, per se, is not affected by this mutation. In addition, the transmission of DSBs from the oocyte to the zygote suggests a defect in cell cycle regulation.</p><p>We have endeavored to identify the function of MU2 and understand phenotype of <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> at the molecular level. mu2 mRNA encodes a polypeptide of &#x0223c;139 kDa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Kasravi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> that has a tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain at the C terminus. We show here that the MU2 protein is associated with ionizing radiation-induced foci in somatic cells and recombination foci during meiosis. The N terminus of MU2 contains a forkhead associated (FHA) domain that interacts with the MRN complex, while the BRCT domain interacts with histone variant H2Av phosphorylated at Ser 137 (&#x003b3;H2Av). This histone variant is homologous to mammalian H2AX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Madigan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, which when phosporylated marks DNA repair foci. MU2 also plays a role in the regulation of the intra-S checkpoint in eye-antennal imaginal discs. Based on amino acid alignment, functional similarities, domain architecture, and protein-protein associations, we propose that <italic>mu2</italic> is an ortholog of human <italic>mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1</italic> (<italic>MDC1</italic>) gene. Sequencing of the <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> cDNA revealed a frameshift mutation at aa 1065 leading to a stop codon and loss of the BRCT domain. The delay in the repair of radiation induced lesions in conjunction with the loss of cell cycle control in <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> mutants suggests a novel role of the mutation in the formation of new telomeres at the site of a DSB.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Location of MU2 In Vivo</title><p>Genetic studies suggested that oocytes mutant for <italic>mu2</italic> have a defect in the processing of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation and produce terminally deficient chromosomes at a high frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Mason1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Mason2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on phenotypic differences between males and females, it was proposed that the MU2 protein is a component of the oocyte nucleus. To understand the localization of MU2, transgenic animals expressing modified GFP (mGFP) tagged MU2 were made. Oocytes from these females showed that MU2 is concentrated in the oocyte nucleus at several stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000473-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), although the cytoplasm of more advanced oocytes was also fluorescent. The testes of transgenic males do not show any MU2 localization to the germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000473-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), although tagged MU2 localized to the somatic sheath cells, as was found for mu2 mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Kasravi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

A ring shaped localization of MU2 protein was also observed in the cytoplasm of more mature developing egg chambers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000473.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> mutants showed low levels of MU2 in their ovaries and poor nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000473-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Analysis of the mRNA levels of mu2 using RT PCR showed no significant difference between the wild type and in the mutants, suggesting a lack of nonsense mediated decay. Western analysis of larval and the adult tissues, however, showed a decrease in levels of MU2 protein. Further, the mutants showed a single band for MU2, rather than the two bands seen in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000473-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The presence of a single band with a decreased intensity is consistent with the low signal that we see in immunofluorescence studies. Sequencing of the cDNA from the <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> mutant showed that the C-terminal BRCT domain of the protein is obliterated due to a frameshift mutation at amino acid 1065 that leads to a premature stop codon. It is possible that the defective protein is rapidly cleared.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> females meiosis occurs within a 16 cell cyst in the germarium at the anterior end of the ovary.

MU2 co-localized with this DSB marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000473-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the germaria of <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> females showed very little to no staining with MU2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000473-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> germaria also showed a decrease in the number and the intensity of &#x003b3;H2Av foci when compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000473.s003">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting that the presence of MU2 affects the formation or stability of the &#x003b3;H2Av foci.

Thus, MDC1 acts as a scaffold for the assembly of the IRIF, the multiprotein complex in which DSB repair occurs. MEFs isolated from MDC1 null mice do form &#x003b3;H2AX foci, but the kinetics of focus formation are affected. We used RNAi of MU2 in S2 cells to understand the role of MU2 in the formation of &#x003b3;H2Av foci. Our studies indicated that foci are formed after irradiation, but their number and intensity are reduced. Further, the kinetics of formation are affected.

Thus, DNA breaks induced in <italic>mu2</italic> mutant oocytes would not be recognized properly. As a result, they would not induce cell cycle delay and would not be amenable to repair. Unrepaired broken chromosomes introduced into the zygote after completion of meiosis would then be subject to healing, i. e. the acquisition of a new telomere. In contrast, when males are irradiated and crossed to <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> females, no terminal deficiencies were found, while fertility remained high. Thus, lesions in sperm seem to be repaired when placed in a <italic>mu2<sup>a</sup></italic> mutant cytoplasm, and the effects of MU2 are limited to the oocyte nucleus. These chromosome breaks in the sperm pronuclei are generally repaired before syngamy, as evidenced by a paucity of mosaics among the mutants that are found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Graf2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. If recognition of the damage by MU2 were necessary, then the repair of damage in the sperm should also be compromised in the absence of the MU2 protein, which however is not the case. What is the difference between radiation induced lesions in oocyte chromosomes and in sperm chromosomes? There are at least two possibilities.</p><p>One possibility is that sperm chromosomes are packaged using arginine-rich histones. Chromatin remodeling and eviction of nucleosomes is required for IRIF formation in standard chromatin. Such eviction of conventional nucleosomes may not be required in the case of sperm chromatin, as it is already devoid of the lysine-rich nucleosomes, and the arginine-rich histones must be stripped away to allow chromosome decondensation in preparation for replication and syngamy. This may allow access of the induced lesion to repair enzymes in the absence of IRIFs.</p><p>Alternatively, a DSB introduced into a sperm chromosome would be amenable to repair because the break produces two broken chromosome ends that would be maintained in the same nucleus and thus available for NHEJ or HR to restore the chromosome. A broken chromosome in a mature oocyte, on the other hand, would only put a single broken chromosome end into the zygote after the completion of the meiotic divisions, because the acentric fragment would not move to the pole at anaphase and would be lost. Thus, this single broken chromosome end in the oocyte pronucleus would not be amenable for either NHEJ or HR. As there is no cell cycle control in the early embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-Glover1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, the broken chromosome ends may have a chance to associate with the telomeric proteins HP1 and HOAP, which are present in abundance in the embryo, and become established as new telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000473-g009">Figure 9</xref>). After syngamy the new diploid nucleus undergoes a rapid series of divisions to produce a thousand nuclei with 16,000 telomeres within 1&#x02013;2 hours. Thus, the young embryo seems poised to generate a large number of new telomeric ends in a very short time. This may explain why an unrepaired chromosome break may acquire a new telomere at a high rated during development of the young embryo. This result is reminiscent of work in maize, where broken chromosome ends are healed specifically upon entry into the zygote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000473-McClintock1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.
