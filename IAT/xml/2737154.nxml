To comprehensively address this hypothesis, a detailed analysis is presented examining the response profiles of B-2 lineage B220<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>+</sup> B<sub>MEM</sub> toward cognate protein antigen in comparison to bystander inflammatory signals. After in vivo antigen encounter, quiescent B<sub>MEM</sub> clonally expand. Surprisingly, proliferating B<sub>MEM</sub> do not acquire germinal center (GC) B cell markers before generating daughter B<sub>MEM</sub> and differentiating into plasma cells or form structurally identifiable GCs. In striking contrast to cognate antigen, inflammatory stimuli, including Toll-like receptor agonists or bystander T cell activation, fail to induce even low levels of B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation or differentiation in vivo. Under the extreme conditions of adjuvanted protein vaccination or acute viral infection, no detectable bystander proliferation or differentiation of B<sub>MEM</sub> occurred. The absence of a B<sub>MEM</sub> response to nonspecific inflammatory signals clearly shows that B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation and differentiation is a process tightly controlled by the availability of cognate antigen.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Life-long immunity is central to the survival of the host. This immunity is engendered by the persistence of memory T cells, memory B cells (B<sub>MEM</sub>), and long-lived BM plasma cells (PCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amanna et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D&#x000f6;rner and Radbruch, 2007</xref>). Long-lasting B cell&#x02013;mediated immunity has been referred to as serological memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Traggiai et al., 2003</xref>) and can be sustained by recurrent antigen exposure. In the absence of periodic exposure to antigen, it is thought that the production of inflammatory signals to unrelated antigens serve as mediators sustaining serologic memory through activation of B<sub>MEM</sub> in a noncognate manner. The in vitro and in vivo response profiles of antigen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> to cognate antigen and &#x0201c;nonspecific&#x0201d; or bystander inflammatory mediators are analyzed herein to critically evaluate the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of serological memory.</p><p>B<sub>MEM</sub> and long-lived PCs are the products of the germinal center (GC) reaction and express somatically hypermutated (SHM) immunoglobulin receptors of the switched isotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacLennan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McHeyzer-Williams and Ahmed, 1999</xref>). After B<sub>MEM</sub> exit from the GC reaction, they colonize the splenic marginal zones (MZs) and the B cell follicles, where they reside in a quiescent state for months or, likely, years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1991</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schittek and Rajewsky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>). Upon rechallenge with cognate antigen, histological studies in rats observed that B<sub>MEM</sub> egress toward the T cell&#x02013;rich periarteriolar lymphocytic sheath and, upon receiving T cell help, proliferate and differentiate into plasmablasts (PBs) situated in both the periarteriolar lymphocytic sheath and in the splenic red pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1991</xref>). Kinetic studies indicate that the generation of this response is rapid and peaks &#x0223c;4-5 d after secondary antigen encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minges Wols et al., 2007</xref>). The PB response dissipates shortly after its initiation, with a subset of PBs further differentiating into long-lived PCs resident in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 2006</xref>). Shortly after recall, B<sub>MEM</sub> cells are once again present in their initial anatomical positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1991</xref>). Despite numerous studies carefully mapping out the events of the primary humoral immune response toward protein antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacob et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacLennan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2007</xref>), relatively little is known about the events occurring during a secondary humoral immune response, including whether antigen reencounter results in the expression of GC markers by antigen-responding B<sub>MEM</sub> and/or if B<sub>MEM</sub> form GC structures en route to differentiating into PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacLennan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 2006</xref>). As the fate and behavior of antigen-activated B<sub>MEM</sub> is critical to our understanding of B<sub>MEM</sub> self-renewal, included in this study is a detailed analysis of the in vivo response of B<sub>MEM</sub> toward cognate antigen.</p><p>The mechanisms mediating the survival of B<sub>MEM</sub> are unknown. Although B<sub>MEM</sub> require phospholipase C &#x003b3; signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR) for survival, it is clear that the B<sub>MEM</sub> BCR need not be permanently engaged with antigen, as B<sub>MEM</sub> do not require the presence of persisting antigen or antigen complexes to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maruyama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Anderson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikida et al., 2009</xref>). It is apparent that B<sub>MEM</sub> occupy a survival niche independent from other B-2 lineage cell subsets, as, unlike all other mature cells of the B-2 lineage, they do not require BAFF and APRIL survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scholz et al., 2008</xref>). At the level of the organism, it is thought that humoral memory as a whole is sustained by the stem cell&#x02013;like qualities of B<sub>MEM</sub>, with this cell type undergoing low levels of self-renewal and replenishment of the long-lived PC pool over the lifetime of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Traggiai et al., 2003</xref>). To sustain serological memory in the absence of cognate antigen, it has been hypothesized that quiescent B<sub>MEM</sub> are periodically activated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists or bystander T cell help to undergo self-renewal events and differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) such as PBs and PCs in an antigen-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernasconi et al., 2002</xref>). A crucial element of this theory was the prediction that inflammatory stimuli associated with adaptive immune responses drive the activation of B<sub>MEM</sub> in an antigen-independent (i.e., nonspecific) manner in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernasconi et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Traggiai et al., 2003</xref>). Whether B<sub>MEM</sub> are indeed reactive to bystander inflammatory stimuli in vivo has not yet been tested from the vantage point of B<sub>MEM</sub>.</p><p>In this work, we detail the ability of B<sub>MEM</sub> to undergo self-renewal and to differentiate into ASCs in response to both antigen-dependent and bystander inflammatory stimuli. In studying these events, we also demonstrate that during clonal expansion in response to cognate antigen, B<sub>MEM</sub> do not express a GC B cell phenotype, and that GC structures are not generated en route to differentiating into ASCs. We find that B<sub>MEM</sub> are responsive to inflammatory stimuli in vitro, with activated B<sub>MEM</sub> displaying a markedly enhanced capacity to differentiate into ASCs when compared with naive follicular (NF) B cells. However, in vivo, in response to TLR agonists, polyclonal T cell activation, protein vaccination, and even acute vaccinia virus infection, B<sub>MEM</sub> neither clonally expand nor differentiate into ASCs, and thus appear ignorant to overt bystander inflammatory signals.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Antigen-specific and polyclonal B<sub>MEM</sub> cells are responsive to TLR agonists in vitro and display an enhanced capacity to differentiate into ASCs when compared with NF B cells</title><p>A comprehensive analysis of B<sub>MEM</sub> responsiveness to antigen and bystander inflammatory stimuli was undertaken both in vitro and in vivo. The term &#x0201c;bystander&#x0201d; is defined herein as stimuli acting on B<sub>MEM</sub> independent of BCR engagement. In these studies, we tracked B<sub>MEM</sub> specific for the thymus-dependent protein antigen R-phycoerythrin (PE), as immunization of BALB/c mice with this fluorophore elicits a detectable population of PE-binding B<sub>MEM</sub> at a high resolution (referred to as PE-B<sub>MEM</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayakawa et al., 1987</xref>). After immunization with PE adsorbed to alum i.p., PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> are readily detectable in the spleen at 0.01&#x02013;0.05% of total splenocytes beginning 21 d after immunization, with this population still present 60 d after priming (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090667/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayakawa et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schittek and Rajewsky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benson et al., 2008</xref>). In nonimmunized mice, a minute naive PE-binding population is observed at a 10-fold lower frequency (Fig. S1). The PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> in immunized mice are predominantly B220<sup>+</sup>PE<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgG1<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup> and express a phenotype consistent with long-lived affinity-matured B<sub>MEM</sub> (Fig. S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>). In all experiments (unless indicated otherwise), PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> from PE/alum-immunized mice were analyzed between days 60 and 90 after primary immunization.</p><p>The response of PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> to inflammatory stimuli was first analyzed by examining the response profile of B<sub>MEM</sub> to a panel of TLR agonists in vitro. We also included two other sources of B<sub>MEM</sub> in these in vitro analyses to first ensure that the results were reproducible in multiple systems and to test whether B<sub>MEM</sub> activation occurs in the absence of BCR cross-linking. The second system used B<sub>MEM</sub> raised against and specific for the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP), with this system having been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lalor et al., 1992</xref>). The third system used B<sub>MEM</sub> from a transgenic mouse in which the polyclonal B<sub>MEM</sub> population is readily identified. This latter source allowed for the isolation of B<sub>MEM</sub> without the need for BCR engagement by antigen, as when PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> and NP-B<sub>MEM</sub> are purified using antigen binding to denote specificity, cross-linking the BCR is inevitable.</p><sec><title>PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> cells.</title><p>From PE-immunized mice, PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> were first enriched by negative selection, and then electronically sorted based on a B220<sup>+</sup>PE<sup>+</sup>dump<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> phenotype, with post-sort analysis indicating high levels of purity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090667/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>NP-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> cells.</title><p>NP-B<sub>MEM</sub> were generated in a transgenic mouse strain where Cre recombinase was inserted in the C&#x003b3;1 locus, with this strain crossed with the Rosa26-EYFP reporter mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casola et al., 2006</xref>).

The response profiles of poly-B<sub>MEM</sub> and NF B cells to a panel of TLR agonists was examined after 3 d of culture with the indicated agonist. The agonists used, their abbreviations, the receptors for which they are specific for, and the concentrations used are as follows: Pam3CSK4 (P3C), TLR1/2, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml; LPS (LPS), TLR4, 10 &#x000b5;g/ml; FSL-1 (FSL1), TLR6/2, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml; S-27609 (609), TLR7, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml; CpG ODN 1826 (CpG), TLR9, 5 &#x000b5;M, &#x003b1;CD40 (&#x003b1;CD40), CD40, 10 &#x000b5;g/ml; and IL-4, 10 ng/ml.

PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> and corresponding NF B cells and IL-4&#x02013;only controls were stained with CFSE, whereas NP-B<sub>MEM</sub> and poly-B<sub>MEM</sub> with NF B cells and IL-4 only controls were stained with DDAO to track proliferation. After culture with the TLR4 agonist LPS, cells were analyzed for surface expression of B220 and CD138. The culture of all NF and B<sub>MEM</sub> with IL-4 resulted in a uniform B220<sup>+</sup> population after 3 d (unpublished data). Upon culture of NF B cells and B<sub>MEM</sub> with LPS, NF B cells remained primarily B220<sup>+</sup>CD138<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, whereas all three sources of B<sub>MEM</sub> generated a B220<sup>int</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> population of cells (&#x0223c;21&#x02013;30% of total) representing the phenotype of a ASC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and D</xref>). The ASCs derived from the three sources of B<sub>MEM</sub> were of the IgG isotype and, with the ASCs generated from PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> and NP-B<sub>MEM</sub>, specific for either PE or NP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref> and not depicted). NF B cells generated a high frequency of IgM<sup>+</sup> ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). The overall degree of proliferation by the three sources of B<sub>MEM</sub> was moderately less than NF B cells, although proliferation did occur, as indicated by comparison to the IL-4&#x02013;only cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and E</xref>). The population of B220<sup>int</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> cells generated from poly-B<sub>MEM</sub> arose in the daughter peaks, showing that B<sub>MEM</sub> undergo cell division while differentiating into B220<sup>int</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><p>The response of poly-B<sub>MEM</sub> and NF B cells was analyzed to either Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2 agonist), heat-killed <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (TLR2 agonist), poly(I:C) (TLR3 agonist), LPS (TLR4 agonist), flagellin from <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium (TLR5 agonist), FSL-1 (TLR6 agonist), S-27609 (TLR7 agonist), ODN 1826 (TLR9 agonist), and IL-4. Both NF B cells and poly-B<sub>MEM</sub> were responsive to agonists for TLR1/2, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Both poly-B<sub>MEM</sub> and NF B responded poorly or did not respond to agonists for TLR2, TLR3, and TLR5 (unpublished data). For each TLR agonist that NF B cells or poly-B<sub>MEM</sub> responded to, B<sub>MEM</sub> generated a sizable population of B220<sup>int</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> cells, whereas NF B cells maintained a B220<sup>+</sup>CD138<sup>&#x02212;</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). NF B cells also proliferated to a greater degree than B<sub>MEM</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Finally, it was observed that while engagement of CD40 drove proliferation of both B<sub>MEM</sub> and NF B cells, B<sub>MEM</sub> did not differentiate into B220<sup>int</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, H&#x02013;I</xref>). Collectively, these data show that B<sub>MEM</sub> are sensitive to multiple TLR agonists in vitro and do not require BCR cross-linking to become activated and differentiate into ASCs. Furthermore, upon activation, B<sub>MEM</sub> have an enhanced intrinsic capacity to differentiate into CD138<sup>+</sup> ASCs compared with NF B cells. Lastly, CD40 signaling appears to drive B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation, but to block differentiation in vitro.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>B<sub>MEM</sub> cells undergo rapid clonal expansion and differentiation into IgG<sup>+</sup> ASCs in response to soluble antigen</title><p>Having established that B<sub>MEM</sub> are responsive to bystander stimuli in vitro, we used the PE-antigen system to compare B<sub>MEM</sub> responsiveness toward cognate antigen versus bystander inflammation in vivo. We first performed a detailed analysis of the secondary humoral immune response to soluble PE (sPE) to define the behavior and kinetics of B<sub>MEM</sub> activation in vivo. Unlike naive hosts, it is well-established that previously immunized mice are responsive to low-doses of antigen in the absence of adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 2006</xref>). This heightened responsiveness results from the combined presence of antigen-reactive B<sub>MEM</sub> and CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells. In concordance with this, we observed that injection of naive mice with 1 &#x000b5;g sPE (or 10 &#x000b5;g; not depicted) failed to elicit PE-ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>), whereas PE-immunized mice produced high numbers of IgG<sup>+</sup> PE-ASCs. A robust IgM ASC response was only elicited when naive or PE-immunized mice were injected with 1 &#x000b5;g of sPE along with the TLR9 agonist CpG ODN 1826 (CpG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Thus, the IgG<sup>+</sup> PE-specific humoral response generated after sPE injection is likely the direct consequence of B<sub>MEM</sub> activation. These data demonstrate that a low level of sPE given in the absence of adjuvant is capable of activating PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> to differentiate into IgG<sup>+</sup> ASCs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>B<sub>MEM</sub> cells undergo rapid self-renewal and differentiation into IgG<sup>+</sup> PCs in response to soluble antigen.</bold> Either naive or PE-immunized mice were challenged with PBS, 1 &#x000b5;g sPE, or 1 &#x000b5;g sPE + 50 &#x000b5;g CpG and 3 d later, IgM<sup>+</sup>, and IgG<sup>+</sup> PE-PCs from the spleen were quantified by ELISPOT (A and B).

The same experimental setup used in G was used in H, except mice were injected with PBS, 1 &#x000b5;g sPE, or 1 &#x000b5;g PE with 50 &#x000b5;g CpG, with BrdU incorporation by PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> again depicted. Three to five mice per experimental group were used per experiment. Data presented are representative of two to three independent experiments, with A and B pooled from two independent experiments.

PE-immunized mice were injected with sPE, and a 5-d BrdU pulse was performed starting on the day of sPE injection, followed by a chase period. BrdU incorporation by B<sub>MEM</sub> was quantified at various times during and after the pulse period. After preenrichment, PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> were detected by excluding CD4/CD8/IgD/IgM<sup>+</sup> cells via a dump gate and gating them on B220<sup>+</sup>PE<sup>+</sup> cells, with these cells analyzed for BrdU incorporation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090667/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). PE-immunized mice receiving BrdU, but no antigen, and immunized mice receiving neither antigen nor BrdU were included as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). 2 d after sPE rechallenge, B<sub>MEM</sub> began to proliferate, with this response peaking by day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Fig. S3 A). In mice analyzed during the BrdU chase period (days 11 and 24 after sPE rechallenge), a proportion of B<sub>MEM</sub> remained BrdU<sup>+</sup> at a percentage similar to that observed at the peak of the response (35.5% &#x000b1; SEM 4.6 and 38.4% &#x000b1; SEM 5.1 versus 48.9% &#x000b1; SEM 5.8, respectively), indicating that 71&#x02013;77% of B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation occurs within the first 5 d after antigen rechallenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Fig. S3 A). A second PE-binding population was also observed in these experiments, with this population displaying a B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PE<sup>+</sup> phenotype (Fig. S3 A). When the BrdU incorporation frequencies by the B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PE<sup>+</sup> population in PBS versus sPE-immunized mice were compared, no differences were observed between the two groups over the 24-d kinetic analysis (unpublished data). This indicates that the B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PE<sup>+</sup> population does not respond to sPE, and as antigen-responsiveness is a crucial element of adaptive memory, we excluded these cells from further analysis. As BrdU labeling measures the accumulation of proliferation over the time of the BrdU &#x0201c;pulse&#x0201d; period, we also analyzed B<sub>MEM</sub> expression of Ki-67 at various times after antigen challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Ki-67 expression is an indicator of all stages of the cell cycle and provides a snapshot of the proliferative state of the B<sub>MEM</sub> at a given point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerdes et al., 1984</xref>). PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> are almost uniformly Ki-67<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, which is indicative of their quiescent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). By days 3 and 4 after sPE rechallenge, 76&#x02013;77% of B<sub>MEM</sub> cells were Ki-67<sup>+</sup>. At day 5, Ki-67 expression began to dissipate, and most PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> exhibited decreased Ki-67 expression on day 7, with this decrease more pronounced by day 11. By day 24, PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> were once again uniform in their lack of Ki-67 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). In correlating the expression pattern of Ki-67 by B<sub>MEM</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>) with the 5-d BrdU pulse followed by a chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), the results indicate that the majority of B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation occurs between days 2 and 5 after sPE rechallenge. In addition, the presence of BrdU<sup>+</sup> B<sub>MEM</sub> 24 d after sPE injection provides direct evidence that B<sub>MEM</sub> generate daughter B<sub>MEM</sub> after secondary antigen encounter.</p><p>A rapid increase in the numbers of IgG<sup>+</sup> PE-ASCs in both the spleen and BM was observed 3 d after sPE rechallenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and D</xref>). This burst in ASC numbers peaked 4 d after challenge in the spleen and 5 d in the BM, after which ASC numbers gradually subsided over the next 20 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Corresponding to the increase of ASCs after rechallenge was an increase in anti-PE IgG serum titers increasing 10-fold over the next 20 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). These data show that ASCs are rapidly generated within 3 d after antigen rechallenge and are present to substantial degrees in both the spleen and the BM. Soon thereafter, ASC numbers declined, indicating that short-lived ASCs are present in both organs.</p><p>The observation that &#x0223c;50% of B<sub>MEM</sub> respond to sPE as indicated by BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Fig. S3 A) led us to question whether either the antigen dose or the absence of adjuvant during antigen administration was limiting the frequency of responding B<sub>MEM</sub>. To test this, we varied the amount of sPE injected or added CpG during antigen rechallenge, with BrdU administration concurrently initiated. When analyzed 3 d later, it was observed that the dose of antigen positively correlated with the percentage of proliferating B<sub>MEM</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref> and Fig. S3 B). The addition of CpG had no further impact on the frequency of responding PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref> and Fig. S3 C). However, the addition of CpG to sPE modestly increased the number of splenic IgG<sup>+</sup> PE-ASCs elicited after 3 d when compared with sPE alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In sum, these data indicate that antigen can be a limiting factor in dictating the frequency of responding B<sub>MEM</sub>. Notably, TLR9 agonists failed to enhance the frequency of activated B<sub>MEM</sub>. This point indicates that CpGs alone may not play a role in driving in vivo B<sub>MEM</sub> activation.</p></sec><sec><title>B<sub>MEM</sub> cells proliferate upon in vivo antigen encounter and do not express GC markers or generate GC structures</title><p>The rapid kinetics of the B<sub>MEM</sub> response led us to question whether B<sub>MEM</sub> form GCs after antigen encounter. Clonally expanding B<sub>MEM</sub> were tracked to define their transitional stages en route to differentiating into ASCs. Under steady-state conditions, PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> displayed a GL7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PNA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Ki-67<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> phenotype as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lalor et al., 1992</xref>).

When PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> were harvested and analyzed 3 d after sPE challenge, they were GL7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PNA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Ki-67<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>, indicating these cells had responded to antigen because of Ki-67 expression, yet failed to express the GC markers GL7 and PNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). It was plausible that the failure of antigen-responding B<sub>MEM</sub> to gain a GC phenotype was caused by the solitary use of sPE, and that the induction of a GC phenotype requires the presence of an adjuvant. Therefore, CpG was added to sPE, and 3 d later, the phenotype of the responding B<sub>MEM</sub> was analyzed. The addition of CpG to sPE again elicited GL7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PNA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Ki-67<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> B<sub>MEM</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). It was considered possible that B<sub>MEM</sub> gain a GC phenotype later than 3 d after antigen encounter, so the phenotype of B<sub>MEM</sub> was analyzed at later points in time.

These data show that B<sub>MEM</sub> respond robustly upon rechallenge with cognate antigen, but do not acquire the expression of GC markers or form GCs in response to cognate antigen. In striking contrast, the response of B<sub>MEM</sub> to a battery of proinflammatory signals is remarkably silent. It has been proposed that serological memory is sustained by B<sub>MEM</sub> responding to bystander inflammatory signals by undergoing proliferation and differentiation. However, the findings of this study indicate that B<sub>MEM</sub> ignore these signals (TLR agonists, polyclonal T cell activation, aggressive vaccination, and acute viral infection), as they fail to drive B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation or differentiation in vivo.</p><p>Despite the preponderance of studies detailing the B cell dynamics of the primary humoral immune response, surprisingly few studies have detailed the events of the secondary humoral immune response. We have tracked B<sub>MEM</sub> and demonstrate that cognate antigen drives the rapid clonal expansion of B<sub>MEM</sub> and their terminal differentiation into ASCs, with these events occurring in the absence of GC formation. As has been widely reported, B<sub>MEM</sub> rapidly differentiate to ASCs upon secondary antigen encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">H&#x000f6;fer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minges Wols et al., 2007</xref>), with this ASC response first detectable 3 d after antigen challenge in both the spleen and the BM and with the splenic ASC response an order of magnitude greater than that observed in the BM. This wave of ASCs dissipates after 11 d, and it is probable that the remaining ASCs in the BM 24 d after antigen challenge have been culled into the long-lived PC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">H&#x000f6;fer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minges Wols et al., 2007</xref>). These data detail the activation of B<sub>MEM</sub> and define their proliferation as occurring between days 2 and 5 after antigen encounter. Proliferating B<sub>MEM</sub> occupy a transitional state defined as antigen-binding B220<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>Ki-67<sup>+</sup>GL7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PNA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> before generating quiescent daughter B<sub>MEM</sub> and/or differentiating into ASCs. This blasting state is unique because of the presence of high levels of CD38 expression by proliferating cells; CD38 is a phenotypic marker previously used to denote quiescent NF B cells and B<sub>MEM</sub> and is lost upon B cell activation and entry into the GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliver et al., 1997</xref>). Our finding that B<sub>MEM</sub> cells do not form or enter a GC reaction during their differentiation and expansion is consistent with classical studies indicating that B<sub>MEM</sub> might not undergo further SHM and isotype switching upon rechallenge with antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Askonas et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okumura et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Siekevitz et al., 1987</xref>). In these studies, limiting numbers of hapten-specific &#x0201c;parental&#x0201d; B<sub>MEM</sub> were adoptively transferred together with carrier-primed T cells into lightly irradiated hosts, followed by immunization of the hosts with soluble hapten-carrier antigen. Upon analyzing the isotype distribution and SHM exhibited by the parental B<sub>MEM</sub> and their progeny generated in response to cognate antigen, no change in diversity in either measure was observed. Our data showing that B<sub>MEM</sub> neither gain GC markers nor seed GCs are in concordance with these studies. It is apparent that B<sub>MEM</sub>, at least in these studies and in our presented data, are not instructed to enhance the affinity or isotype distribution of their antigen receptors during secondary antigen encounter.</p><p>Our data indicate that quiescent IgG<sup>+</sup> B<sub>MEM</sub> are not activated by TLR agonists or bystander T cell help, and thus do not undergo self-renewal events or differentiate into ASCs in an antigen-independent manner. We should note that our analysis was limited to IgG<sup>+</sup> PE-B<sub>MEM</sub> and that our experimental system excluded testing whether IgM<sup>+</sup> B<sub>MEM</sub> are responsive to bystander inflammatory signals. There is a growing body of evidence both in favor of and in conflict with the hypothesis that serological memory is sustained by the activation of B<sub>MEM</sub> by bystander inflammation. Evidence in favor of this theory includes in vitro observations in which human B<sub>MEM</sub> were shown to have increased sensitivity and to selectively proliferate and differentiate into ASCs in response to bystander stimuli as compared with NF B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernasconi et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2003</xref>). In vivo studies in humans found that for single-pathogen specificities, serum antibody levels linearly correlated with the frequency of B<sub>MEM</sub> present in a host, indicating that the ASC compartment was genealogically linked to and undergoing replenishment by the B<sub>MEM</sub> compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernasconi et al., 2002</xref>). Mouse studies also supported this link between the B<sub>MEM</sub> and ASC compartments as elimination of virus-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> led to a slow decay of virus-specific ASC numbers over time in comparison to mice still containing B<sub>MEM</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Slifka et al., 1998</xref>). Lastly, it was observed that during an immune response against a single pathogen, an increase in both blood ASC numbers and serum antibody levels occurred for specificities to other pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernasconi et al., 2002</xref>). This result was interpreted as evidence that host B<sub>MEM</sub> were recipients of antigen-independent stimuli and responded by differentiating into ASCs.</p><p>Despite these data suggesting that B<sub>MEM</sub> respond to bystander inflammation, more recent studies have put this hypothesis under scrutiny. In particular, further attempts to correlate antigen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> numbers with circulating ASCs in human subjects have been unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amanna et al., 2007</xref>). Mouse studies where long-lived ASC numbers were quantified after B<sub>MEM</sub> depletion observed no decay in ASC numbers over time, contrary to initial reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiLillo et al., 2008</xref>). Lastly, a series of studies reported that in mice that were administered a TLR agonist or in humans that were given a vaccine, ASC numbers and serum antibody levels against specificities other than the immunizing antigen did not increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Genova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amanna et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richard et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our studies show that the in vitro sensitivities of B<sub>MEM</sub> to activation are not representative of their sensitivities in vivo and cast doubt on the hypothesis that B<sub>MEM</sub> can be activated by bystander inflammation. Our in vitro studies examining the response profiles of murine B<sub>MEM</sub> to both antigen-dependent and -independent stimuli extended prior studies using human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arpin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernasconi et al., 2002</xref>) and murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richard et al., 2008</xref>) B<sub>MEM</sub>, as we observe that murine B<sub>MEM</sub> are sensitive to TLR agonists and have an enhanced intrinsic ability to differentiate into ASCs upon activation with TLR agonists, regardless of whether the BCR is engaged by antigen. Given these data, and our knowledge of the robust response of B<sub>MEM</sub> to cognate antigen in vivo, an exploration of the response of B<sub>MEM</sub> to several nonspecific inflammatory signals in vivo demonstrated that B<sub>MEM</sub> are in fact unresponsive to these stimuli. The first panel of signals tested was derived from activated T cells and included CD154 expression by these cells, as well as proinflammatory cytokines either alone or together with TLR agonists. We first analyzed the impact of agonistic &#x003b1;CD40 antibodies on B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation and differentiation. The injection of mice with &#x003b1;CD40 alone or with TLR4 or TLR9 agonists elicited substantial levels of B<sub>MEM</sub> and NF B cell proliferation. Despite this proliferation, these B<sub>MEM</sub> did not differentiate into ASCs. These data are in agreement with our in vitro observations, where &#x003b1;CD40 induced the proliferation of, yet failed to differentiate, poly-B<sub>MEM</sub> into ASCs. These studies also extend previous in vitro studies where CD40 signaling triggered human B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation, but impeded their differentiation into ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arpin et al., 1995</xref>). Using a second approach, we activated T cells in vivo through the injection of agonistic &#x003b1;CD3 antibodies, with this treatment given either alone or with TLR agonists. Injection of this antibody is known to elicit rapid and transient activation of T cells, which release a proinflammatory cytokine storm that includes IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, and TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferran et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scott et al., 1990</xref>). These stimuli did not induce either B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation or differentiation.</p><p>It is highly likely that the in vivo response of B<sub>MEM</sub> to overt antibody-mediated CD40 signaling does not represent the hypothetical situation where B<sub>MEM</sub> and activated T cells transiently engage in a CD40/CD40L synapse independent of an antigen bridge. As we found no B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation upon vaccination with an irrelevant thymus-dependent antigen or infection with vaccinia virus (a situation generating large numbers of activated CD4 T cells expression CD40L), it is probable that this interaction does not occur and is thus not a mechanism for propagating B<sub>MEM</sub> renewal. Instead, this data should be interpreted as in vivo proof that CD40 signaling drives B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation but blocks their differentiation into ASCs, indicating that differentiation occurs upon cessation of CD40 signaling.</p><p>Immunization with NP-KLH, along with alum and CpG, and infection with vaccinia virus results in the acute induction of both innate and adaptive immunity. B<sub>MEM</sub> ignored the stimuli associated with these responses and neither proliferated nor differentiated into ASCs during the multi-week period in which these immune responses were occurring. In summary, inflammatory signals associated with TLR signaling, T cell activation, and adaptive immune responses are incapable of driving B<sub>MEM</sub> proliferation or differentiation into ASCs.</p><p>The possibility remains that B<sub>MEM</sub> and long-lived PCs might survive for the lifetime of the host, with these populations not requiring self-renewal or replenishment and with serological memory not requiring maintenance. However, this hypothesis requires that B<sub>MEM</sub> and PCs survive for perpetuity, and this quality appears unrealistic. From our presented work, we show that B<sub>MEM</sub> do not clonally expand or differentiate in response to bystander inflammatory signals. It is possible that there are other signals capable of inducing in vivo B<sub>MEM</sub> expansion and differentiation that are not included in this analysis. Alternatively, the maintenance of serological memory may occur via a stochastic rather than an induced process, with B<sub>MEM</sub> not requiring an extrinsic signal to maintain serological memory such as those tested herein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and immunizations.</title><p>These studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Dartmouth College (Lebanon, NH).
