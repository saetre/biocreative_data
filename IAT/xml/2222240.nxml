Their primary function is to generate energy through oxidative phosphorylation in organelles. Mitochondria also play an important role in other biological activities such as programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], calcium signaling and generation of detoxification of reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Mitochondria consist of four subcompartments &#x02013; an outer membrane, an inner membrane, an inter-membrane space and matrix. The chaperone proteins, and the translocase components, help mitochondrial transport into the subcompartments through their membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. During the cytoplasmic translation of mitochondrial proteins, they are recognized by chaperone proteins which interfere with the folding of the protein. A positively charged signal sequence, on the mitochondrial protein, then binds to the translocase components called translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the protein is moved into the TOM complex. Translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], is an inner membrane protein complex that forms a pore, and acts to pull the mitochondrial protein through the pore. On the inside of the pore, different chaperone proteins recognize the mitochondrial protein and fold it into a functional form. The signal sequence is removed by a mitochondrial signal peptidase as the mitochondrial protein enters the matrix.</p><p>The leucine zipper-, EF-hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1) is one of the mitochondrial proteins that is posttranslationally imported into the mitochondrial inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This gene has been identified from the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] which is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation and mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In almost all patients with WHS, LETM1 is part of a deletion found at the chromosome 4 location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Its role in WHS may be based on mitochondrial K<sup>+ </sup>homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The human cervical cancer oncogene (HCCR) has been isolated and identified as a human oncoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; it has revealed strong tumorigenic features in experiments on nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Its role in tumorigenesis may be negative regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. HCCR-transgenic mice have been shown to develop breast cancers and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In order to investigate the functional role of HCCR-1, we predicted the biological features using bioinformatic tools. In addition, we identified the subcellular location and the targeting signal of HCCR-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>HCCR-1 has a LETM1 homologous domain, and is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein</title><p>Since HCCR-1 has been shown to have tumorigenic features previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] we focused on the biological functions of HCCR-1 in the cell. In order to determine the functional domain of HCCR-1 at the molecular level, Pfam version 18.0 was used to analyze its amino acid sequences and identified with the LETM1 homologous domain at amino acids 75 to 346 of HCCR-1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Sequence alignment between the domain from HCCR-1 and from the LETM1 protein using CLUSTALW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] showed a 57.61% sequence similarity. From the analysis using Pfam, we also identified several LETM1 domain-containing proteins, in various eukaryotic species, from human through fungi as well as plant (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>); these findings suggest that the domain has widespread application in organisms and is well conserved during evolution, and that the LETM1 domain may have an important biological function in the normal life cycle.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Alignments of HCCR-1 with its homologs</bold>.

The cells were fixed, mounted, and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, top through forth panels). We also used the HEK293 cell line which stably expresses the V5 tagged HCCR-1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, HEK293/HCCR-1-V5).

Therefore, HCCR-1 is predicted to be an integral membrane protein.</p><p>To examine whether HCCR-1 is a mitochondrial membrane protein, the HEK293/HCCR-1-V5 cell lines were studied for subcelllular fractionation experiments. Nuclear (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lane1), post-mitochondrial supernatant (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lane2), and mitochondrial (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lane3) fractions were separated by differential centrifugation. The isolated mitochondria were solubilized by treatment with alkaline sodium carbonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and ultra-centrifuged to separate the soluble proteins (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lane 5) from the insoluble integral membrane proteins (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lane 4). Each of the fractionated proteins were displayed by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to the V5 epitope (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, top panel), voltage dependant anion channel 1 (VDAC-1) which is expressed on the mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, middle panel) and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2) on the mitochondrial matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, bottom panel). The HCCR-1 protein was found in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lane3) which is consistent with the previous result shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. Treatment with alkaline sodium carbonate did not solubilize the mitochondrial integral membrane protein VDAC-1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, middle panel, lane 4), but did disrupt the mitochondrial membrane as a result of exposing the matrix protein SOD-2 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, bottom panel, lane 5). HCCR-1 protein also remained in the pellet fraction (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, top panel, lane 4); these findings suggest that HCCR-1 is exclusively localized in the mitochondrial membrane.</p><p>Since HCCR-1 was localized to the mitochondrial membrane, we evaluated the topological structure of HCCR-1. Bioinformatic analyses using the TMHMM Server Version 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], showed that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of HCCR-1 is exposed to the cytoplasm, and also predicted that HCCR-1 is a type II integral membrane protein.</p><p>To examine the HCCR-1 topology, the intact mitochondria were isolated from HEK293/HCCR-V5 cell lines and incubated with and without proteinase K or proteinase K plus Triton X-100. Each treatment was subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting using antibodies to the V5 epitope (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, top panel), TOM40 which expresses on the outer mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, second panel), TIM23 on the inner mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, third panel), and SOD-2 on the mitochondrial matrix (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, bottom panel). TIM23 and SOD-2 proteins were protease resistant in the mitochondria, which indicate that these proteins were not exposed to the surface. By contrast, Tom40, an outer membrane protein protruding to the surface, was sensitive to proteinase K and weakly detected by its polyclonal antibody (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lane 2). Interestingly, the immunoblot analysis, using anti-V5 monoclonal antibody, detected two sized proteins &#x02013; a full sized HCCR-1-V5 (about 39 kDa) and a little smaller sized protein (about 32 kDa); this indicates that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of HCCR-1 was partially degraded by the proteinase K, while the COOH-terminus of HCCR-1, containing V5 epitope, was protected from the protease activity in the intact mitochondria. This suggests that HCCR-1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This result also suggests that the topological structure of HCCR-1 is indeed consistent with the bioinformatic prediction as shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>. Upon disintegration of the membrane proteins by treatment with Triton X-100, all proteins were digested by proteinase K, showing that none of them was intrinsically protease-resistant (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lane 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial targeting sequences are in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of HCCR-1</title><p>The targeting signal, on mitochondrial proteins, often exists on their DNA fragments coding for the amino terminal region of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and does not have a conserved sequence, but rather share a common physical property. This feature is the ability to form an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix, one in which positively charged amino acids are localized to one surface of the helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This signal sequence is recognized by the receptors on the mitochondrial outer membrane and imported into mitochondria. We have shown that HCCR-1 is also a mitochondrial protein. This protein may be posttranslationally transported to mitochondria and then imported into mitochondria by recognition of the signal sequence.</p><p>To determine the mitochondrial targeting signal of HCCR-1, three different sizes of the NH<sub>2</sub>-teminal DNA fragments were subcloned into a pEGFP-N1 expression vector (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Each of the constructs was transfected into COS-7 cells and the mitochondria were stained and examined by confocal microscopy (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). HCCR D1-1, which contains NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal segments at positions 1 to 78 residues, was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm and nuclei (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, third panel). This distribution is more like that of GFP alone (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top panel). By contrast, the deletion mutants, HCCR D1-2 and D1-3, which contained at position 1 to 110 and 1 to 173 respectively, exhibited a typical mitochondrial pattern, and were overlaid with their mitochondrial staining (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, forth and bottom panels); this suggests that the D1-2 region which partially contains LETM1 domain, contains the mitochondrial targeting sequence and D1-1 region alone cannot reach the mitochondria. We also tested these constructs in NIH3T3 and MCF-7 cells, and obtained the same results as in COS-7 cells (Data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of HCCR-1 contains the mitochondrial targeting information</bold>.

To further characterize the HCCR-1 targeting signal, the positions 1 to 56 were deleted from HCCR D1-1, -2 and -3 constructs (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Each construct was transfected into COS-7 cells and examined by confocal microscopy (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The HCCR D2-1 construct exhibited a diffuse pattern in the cytoplasm and nuclei resembling that of GFP alone in COS-7 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, top panel). The HCCR D2-2 construct contains an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical domain. This construct also showed a diffuse distribution in cytoplasm and nuclei (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, middle panel), which is different from the pattern of HCCR D1-2, and suggests that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region from 1 to 56 is also required for mitochondrial targeting. However, some of the D2-2 mutant was transported to mitochondria (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, middle panel), which suggests that this region between 57 and 110 as well as the region from 1 to 56 is involved in the mitochondrial targeting. When the HCCR D2-3 construct was expressed in COS-7 cells, it was not detected in nuclei but in cytoplasm and other organelles (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, bottom panel). The D2-3 mutant contains the transmembrane domain which is moderately hydrophobic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This may result in absence in nuclei and reaching into the mitochondria or other organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Mitochondrial targeting of HCCR-1 requires the D1-2 region</bold>.

By contrast, D1-1 which contains NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of HCCR-1 and D2-2 which belongs the LETM1 domain of HCCR-1, were prevented from localizing to mitochondria. This suggests that the D1-1 region may be co-related with the D2-2 region for mitochondrial targeting.</p></sec><sec><title>HCCR D1-2 mutant was exclusively localized at the mitochondria</title><p>In order to confirm the previous results obtained by confocal microscopy experiments, COS-7 cells expressing HCCR D1-2 and D2-2 were subjected to subcellular fractionation.

This suggests that HCCR-1 cytosolic form such as HCCR-2 which is deleted at position 1 to 56 amino acids, may exist. This cytosolic form could act as a negative regulator of p53 or could not. However, we propose that this form may not affect the HCCR function because it may also mainly localize at mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Suppression of UVC- or staurosporine-induced apopotosis in HCCR-1 overexpressed cell</title><p>To verify the role of HCCR-1 on mitochondrial outer membrane and p53 negative regulation role, we used the HEK293 cell line which stably expresses the vector alone (HEK293/Vector) and V5 tagged HCCR-1 (HEK293/HCCR-1), respectively. The cells were stimulated with the 40 J/m<sup>2 </sup>of the short-wave length light (UVC) ray, 100 nM staurosporine or 300 nM actinomycin D for trigging apoptosis. After the stimulation, the cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by FACS. The cell number of apoptotic sub G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase in the HEK293/HCCR-1 cells after treatment with UVC or staurosporine was less increased in comparing with that in HEK293 and HEK293/Vector cells, in respectively (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The cell number of apoptotic phase in the HEK293/HCCR-1 after treatment with actinomycin D was not significantly changed at all tested cell line (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Our flow cytometric data indicate that UVC or staurosporine induced-nuclear apoptosis is retarded in HEK293/HCCR-1 cells, which suggest that HCCR-1 induces HEK293 cells more resistance to UVC-ray and staurosporine-triggered apoptosis, but not in actinomycin D.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Suppression of UVC- and stauroeporine-induced apopotosis in HCCR-1 overexpressed cell</bold>.

However, the previous immunofluorescence study showed that HCCR was predominantly localized in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, our resent analysis of HCCR mRNA using reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing has identified several HCCR isoforms from various cancerous cell lines and tissues (data not shown). The expression of these isoforms also depended on the cell type and tissues, while some of the isoforms were predicted to be different subcellular organelles. This could be invoked, for example, to account for the generation of the other cellular compartment pool of HCCR.</p><p>HCCR-1 has been isolated and identified as a strong oncoprotein with tumorigenic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, this protein has been localized to the mitochondrial membrane which has been deeply related to the intrinsic apoptotic signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Here, we showed that the oncoprotein HCCR-1 represses mitochondrial dysfunction caused by its uncontrolled expression. This may prevent the apoptotic signal, block the senescence, and induce cancer development. Therefore, the present data now make it possible to investigate mitochondrial function and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in HCCR-1 overexpressed cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report that HCCR-1 is a LETM1 domain homologous protein and is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein. Fluorescence microscopy and fractionation experiments showed that HCCR-1 localizes to the mitochondria in COS-7, MCF-7 and HEK293 cell lines and subcompartamentally at its outer membrane in HEK293 cell lines. Its topology is revealed by the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of HCCR-1 which is oriented toward the cytoplasm. We also demonstrated that the HCCR D1-2 domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;110) is required and sufficient for posttranslational mitochondrial import. Finally, the function of HCCR-1 on mitochondrial membrane suppresses the intrinsic apoptotic signal which is induced by UVC and staurosporine, in respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and Transfection</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 (ATCC CRL-1573), COS-7 (ATCC CRL-1651) and MCF-7 breast cancer (ATCC HTB-22) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
