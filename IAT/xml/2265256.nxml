We found IL2 to be responsible for T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-activated FOXP3 expression by both CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; human T cells, and as anticipated, FOXP3 expression restricted TCR-stimulated IL2 expression. However, no evidence could be found that FOXP3&#x0002b; cells actively suppress IL2 expression by FOXP3- cells. These data are consistent with an IL2/FOXP3-dependent negative feedback loop that normally regulates the T cell immune response. It follows that a defect in this negative feedback loop as a result of a deficiency of either IL2 or FOXP3 will lead to a hyperproliferative autoimmune syndrome, without the necessity of invoking an active suppressive function for FOXP3&#x0002b; T cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Thirty years ago, when the T cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL2) was first quantified, we found it to be produced only transiently after T cell activation by mitogens or antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Gillis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additional reports confirmed these initial findings, and CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; T cells were proposed to represent a unique lineage of immunoregulatory T cells or &#x0201c;Regulatory T cells&#x0201d; (T-Regs) that function normally to actively suppress immune responses to potential autoantigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-SuriPayer2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Subsequently, two functional characteristics of CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; T-Regs were described; anergy, defined by an incapacity to produce IL2 and proliferate when activated via the TCR, and as well, the capacity to actively suppress polyclonal T cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, via inhibition of IL2 production by TCR-activated &#x0201c;effector&#x0201d; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Thornton1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

These initial studies indicated that in the mouse, FOXP3 expression was restricted to CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; T cells, both in the thymus and in the periphery, thus consistent with the T-Reg phenotype. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of CD4&#x0002b;CD25- T cells by anti-CD3 together with anti-CD28 or IL2 failed to elicit FOXP3 mRNA expression. Accordingly, FOXP3 expression by CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; T cells was quickly adopted as a more definitive phenotypic definition of a T-Reg cell.</p><p>However, confounding these data were observations made with human T cells. Activation of human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) via anti-CD3 was found to result in an increase of FOXP3 mRNA in CD4&#x0002b; T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Walker1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, other recent studies demonstrated that IL2 provides a negative feedback effect on its own production via Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-5 (STAT5), although the mechanism whereby this occurs was left unexplored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Villarino1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recently, using several experimental approaches CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b;FOXP3&#x0002b; cells were shown to suppress effector CD4&#x0002b; T cells not by affecting early TCR activation or proliferation of effector T cells. Instead, because CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b;FOXP3&#x0002b; cells are anergic and cannot produce IL2, but can consume and degrade it, these cells induce cytokine deprivation-mediated apoptosis of effector T cells, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Pandiyan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, we focused on the role of IL2 itself in the TCR/CD3-induction of FOXP3 expression by normal human T cells, as well as the effect of FOXP3 on IL2 expression by both FOXP3&#x0002b; and FOXP3- cells. Our results, summarized in this report, are consistent with the interpretation that IL2-induced FOXP3 expression plays a larger role in immune regulation than has been conjectured until now, serving to provide for a negative feedback loop, restricting IL2 production. Thus, IL2 appears to have at least two important functions during T cell activation; 1) the promotion of proliferative clonal expansion of antigen-selected cells, and 2) a negative feedback mechanism that restricts IL2 production, thereby ensuring a self-limited proliferative response. By comparison, no evidence was found that FOXP3&#x0002b; cells are capable of actively suppressing IL2 production by FOXP3- cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>FOXP3 expression by resting and anti-CD3-activated PBMCs</title><p>A survey of 19 individuals revealed that only a few freshly isolated human T cells expressed detectable FOXP3, with a greater proportion in CD4&#x0002b; T cells (2.64&#x00025;&#x000b1;0.33&#x00025;) (Mean&#x000b1;SEM, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;19) vs. CD8&#x0002b; T cells (0.16&#x00025;&#x000b1;0.05&#x00025;) (Mean&#x000b1;SEM, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;19).

Moreover, several forkhead-specific REs adjacent to critical NF-AT REs in the promoters of several cytokine genes were identified.</p><p>Subsequently, the effect of FOXP3 expression vs. FOXP1 and FOXP2 was examined, and only FOXP3 specifically inhibited cytokine gene expression (IL2, IL4, IFN-&#x003b3;) by primary murine CD4&#x0002b; T cells. Furthermore, FOXP3 was shown to inhibit Rel family (NF-&#x003ba;B p65 &#x00026; NFAT) transcriptional activation of cytokine genes without inhibiting their DNA binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Bettelli1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, they found that FOXP3 physically associates with NF-&#x003ba;B p65 and NFAT proteins and inhibits their capacity to transactivate. These results were confirmed and extended by others who showed that FOXP3 is capable of repressing CREB- as well as NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Grant1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. As well, the crystal structure of FOXP2 complexed with NF-AT was solved, revealing that this protein complex forms an extensive protein-protein interaction interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Wu1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, mutations of FOXP3 predicted from this crystal structure to disrupt the FOXP2/NF-AT complex correlates with the loss of FOXP3-inhibition of IL2 gene expression.</p><p>Additional data have been recently reported on analyses of FOXP3 target genes by combining ChIP analysis with DNA arrays. Of interest, using these approaches, one group found that FOXP3 binds to &#x0223c;700 genes, and plays a dual role as both a transcriptional activator and repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Zheng1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Another group used a FOXP3- murine T cell hybridoma transduced with FOXP3 and found IL2 gene expression to be suppressed only in FOXP3&#x0002b; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Marson1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, many FOXP3-regulated genes that encode proteins associated with the TCR signaling pathway have been identified, most of which showed suppressed activation when the cells were TCR-stimulated.</p><p>By comparison with the wealth of these data, there have been only two recent reports regarding possible molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the putative T-Reg active suppression of IL2 production and resultant proliferation, both of which have invoked an increase in intracellular cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Bopp1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Deaglio1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. To date, the <italic>in vitro</italic> T cell proliferation assays for the capacity of T-Reg cells to suppress effector T cells have utilized high ratios of T-Regs to effectors, a situation that favors the inhibition of proliferation by the consumption of the T cell growth factor, IL2. In as much as T cell proliferation is dependent upon the concentration of IL2 available as demonstrated in our earliest studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Gillis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, because FOXP3&#x0002b; cells are restricted in their capacity to produce IL2, but can consume any IL2 produced by effector cells, decreased IL2-driven T cell proliferation in the presence of high ratios of FOXP3&#x0002b; : FOXP3- cells (e.g. 2&#x02236;1 to 1&#x02236;4) would necessarily be more apparent than real. Thus, aided by new assays to detect the accumulation of intracellular IL2, rather than its concentration in the surrounding media or its growth promoting effects, we could detect no evidence that FOXP3&#x0002b; cells can actively suppress IL2 expression by FOXP3- cells.</p><p>It is worthy of emphasis that these findings are entirely consistent with the recent report of Pandiyan and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Pandiyan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, who showed that CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b;FOXP3&#x0002b; cells did not suppress effector T cell production of IL2 or proliferation early after activation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, with or without APCs, thereby indicating that APCs are not essential for T-Reg cell-mediated suppression. Moreover, their data indicate that CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b;FOXP3&#x0002b; cells consume IL2, which leads inevitably to cytokine deprivation-induced apoptosis of effector T cells, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Thus, our findings are entirely consistent with the capacity of FOXP3&#x0002b; T cells to <italic>passively</italic> suppress ongoing proliferative immune responses by reducing the concentrations of IL2 available to effector cells, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. When the IL2 concentration is limiting, IL2R&#x0002b; cells rapidly cease proliferating, and undergo cytokine-withdrawal apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Pandiyan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> this mechanism is responsible for the retraction of &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of T cells that expand after an initial antigen stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Kuroda1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Blattman1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. This same mechanism could explain why attenuation of FOXP3 expression by genetic manipulation eradicates the suppressive function but not the restrictive function of FOXP3 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in that the FOXP3-attenuated cells only express low levels of IL2 receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Wan1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>From all of these various experimental approaches, the emerging picture is that FOXP3 expression in peripheral mature T cells both in mice as well as humans is dependent upon TCR/CD28 triggering of IL2. Moreover, the most consistent consequence of IL2-induced FOXP3 expression is the restriction of IL2 gene expression in response to TCR activation as well as reactivation. Therefore, all of these data indicate that FOXP3 plays a key role in the feedback down-regulation of T cell activation and proliferation via the regulation of IL2 gene expression, thereby functioning normally to dampen immune responses. This interpretation is entirely consistent with the hyperproliferative/autoimmune phenotypes of the IL2 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) and <italic>scurfy</italic> mice as well as XLAAD/IPEX patients.</p><p>However, no evidence could be found for an active suppressive effect of FOXP3&#x0002b; cells on FOXP3- cell IL2 expression. Our data thus question the relevance of FOXP3 as an exclusive marker for T-Regs, as has been emphasized recently by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Ziegler1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as the role of FOXP3 in T-Reg-mediated <italic>active</italic> suppression. Accordingly, further experiments will be required to clarify the postulated active vs. passive suppressive roles in regulating IL2 availability, as compared with the demonstrable restrictive role of FOXP3 in regulating IL2 expression. As well, whether other mechanisms are responsible for active suppression of effector cell proliferation remains to be investigated. However, it is clear that the IL2 regulation of FOXP3 and the FOXP3 regulation of IL2 will now assume a central role in many diseases of the immune system.</p><p>Since the point of control over immune reactivity occurs at IL2 gene expression, it is logical that defects in the IL2/FOXP3 negative feedback loop may lead to a preponderance of activating signals and autoimmunity. Conversely, if the pivotal point of IL2 gene regulation by FOXP3 is circumvented, for example by autonomous signaling via persistently active JAK3/STAT5, then malignancy could result, as shown experimentally by over expression of STAT5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001581-Kelly1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The therapeutic implications of our findings are obvious. In those situations where it can be documented that there is a deficiency in the IL2/FOXP3 negative feedback loop, such as in NOD mice, IL2 therapy may be beneficial. Moreover, blockade of the negative feedback loop could be used to enhance immune responses, for example for persistent infections, as anti-cancer therapy, and to enhance the efficacy of vaccines. Finally, FOXP3&#x0002b; T cells could be used as adoptive therapy to dampen unwanted immune responses, not by actively suppressing activated effector cells, but by passively removing IL2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Isolation, Culture and Activation</title><p>PBMCs from normal volunteers were isolated from whole blood using centrifugation over a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient.
