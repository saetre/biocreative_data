Alterations in Wnt signaling impact the balance between myogenic and adipogenic programs in myoblasts, partly due to the decrease of Wnt10b protein. As recent studies point towards a role for Wnt signaling in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that activation of Wnt signaling could play a crucial role in muscle insulin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here we demonstrate that SREBP-1c and Wnt10b display inverse expression patterns during muscle ontogenesis and regeneration, as well as during satellite cells differentiation. The Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway was reactivated in contracting myotubes using siRNA mediated SREBP-1 knockdown, Wnt10b over-expression or inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2;, whereas Wnt signaling was inhibited in myoblasts through silencing of Wnt10b. SREBP-1 knockdown was sufficient to induce Wnt10b protein expression in contracting myotubes and to activate the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway. Conversely, silencing Wnt10b in myoblasts induced SREBP-1c protein expression, suggesting a reciprocal regulation. Stimulation of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway i) drastically decreased SREBP-1c protein and intramyocellular lipid deposition in myotubes; ii) increased basal glucose transport in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant myotubes through a differential activation of Akt and AMPK pathways; iii) restored insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant myotubes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We conclude that activation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in skeletal muscle cells improved insulin sensitivity by i) decreasing intramyocellular lipid deposition through downregulation of SREBP-1c; ii) increasing insulin effects through a differential activation of the Akt/PKB and AMPK pathways; iii) inhibiting the MAPK pathway. A crosstalk between these pathways and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in skeletal muscle opens the exciting possibility that organ-selective modulation of Wnt signaling might become an attractive therapeutic target in regenerative medicine and to treat obese and diabetic populations.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first suggestion for a role of Wnt signaling in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes came from a study which reported a single nucleotide polymorphism locus in the Wnt5b gene that confered susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in a Japonese population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Kanazawa1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results strongly suggest that Wnt signaling, in contrast to insulin signaling, increases glucose transport in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant myotubes through the activation of AMPK-&#x003b1;1 and Akt2/AS160 pathways.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0008509.g008"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Hypothesis for an Interplay between Wnt Signaling and Insulin Sensitivity in Muscle Cells</title><p>Stimuli that induce GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle include insulin via the PI3K pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Hara1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, hypoxia through nitric oxide signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Etgen1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and contraction/exercise through AMPK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Wnt signaling stimulated glucose transport independent of insulin, but also restored insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant myotubes. Inactivation of GSK-3&#x003b2;<sup>Y216</sup> was followed by the phosphorylation of Akt1<sup>T308</sup> by PDK1. Then the subsequent phosphorylation of AS160<sup>S588</sup> induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. We don't know yet whether BIO induced PDK1<sup>S241</sup> autophosphorylation through the inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2;<sup>Y216</sup> or via a pathway not yet defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008509-g008">Figure 8b</xref>). In fact, BIO was reported to be an inhibitor of GSK-3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; through interactions within the ATP binding pocket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Meijer1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, but also an inhibitor of PDK1 in silico at concentrations ranging from 10 &#x000b5;M to 30 &#x000b5;M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Zahler1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, BIO 1 &#x000b5;M was an activator of PDK1 autophosphorylation in myotubes that were either sensitive or resistant to insulin. Insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation was reported to occur through a pathway involving IRS1/PI3K/PDK2/Akt2<sup>S473</sup>/AS160 in human skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Bouzakri1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and our results show that insulin stimulated a similar pathway in insulin-sensitive myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008509-g008">Figure 8d</xref>). In addition, BIO activated the AMPK pathway by phosphorylating AMPK-&#x003b1;1<sup>S485</sup>, but not AMPK-&#x003b1;<sup>T172</sup> both in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008509-g008">Figure 8e</xref>). These results are in accordance with those of Jensen et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Jensen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> which found that twitch-contraction increased AMPK-&#x003b1;1 activity, but not AMPK-&#x003b1;2, in mouse skeletal muscle. Altogether our findings demonstrate that Wnt signaling increased glucose transport in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant myotubes through a differential activation of Akt2/AS160 and AMPK-&#x003b1;1 pathways. Nevertheless, how BIO could have a permissive effect on insulin action in insulin-resistant myotubes remains to be determined.</p><p>As a switch in the differentiation potential of satellite cells to an adipogenic phenotype could be partly responsible for intramyocellular lipid deposition and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes, obesity and age-related sarcopenia, organe-selective modulation of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway could contribute to fight intramuscular fat depots and improve insulin sensitivity in these pathologies. For that purpose, the use of GSK-3&#x003b2;-specific inhibitors such as BIO-derivatives may have practical applications in endocrine and regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, as uncontroled canonical Wnt signaling is a hallmark of cancer and other degenerative diseases, understanding the ways in which the pathway is regulated in skeletal muscle is of critical importance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Europeen convention STE 123 and the French decree 2001-286.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Animals and Regeneration Experiments</title><p>Regeneration experiments were conducted on crushed Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) muscles of 2 month-old Sprague Dawley male rats according to Bassaglia and Gautron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008509-Bassaglia1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.
