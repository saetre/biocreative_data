We have now identified protein Mth212, a member of the ExoIII family of nucleases, as a possible initiator of DNA uracil repair in this organism. This enzyme, in addition to bearing all the enzymological hallmarks of an ExoIII homologue, is a DNA uridine endonuclease (U-endo) that nicks double-stranded DNA at the 5&#x02032;-side of a 2&#x02032;-d-uridine residue, irrespective of the nature of the opposing nucleotide. This type of activity has not been described before; it is absent from the ExoIII homologues of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>, all of which are equipped with uracil DNA repair glycosylases. The U-endo activity of Mth212 is served by the same catalytic center as its AP-endo activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The archaeal domain comprises a large number of thermophilic, extremely thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms, which suggests a correspondingly pronounced importance, among archaea, of genome protection against the eroding effect of spontaneous hydrolytic DNA damage. For example, the pre-mutagenic conversion of DNA cytosine to DNA uracil residues will occur at an increased rate compared to that in mesophilic organisms. In contrast to this expectation, no archaeal members of the otherwise almost ubiquitous DNA repair enzymes of the Ung family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) have been identified to date. Instead, three other families of DNA glycosylases were found to remove uracil residues from DNA in archaea; these are (i) Mig (Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I, <italic>Pa</italic>-Mig) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), (ii) &#x02018;<italic>Mj</italic>UDG&#x02019; (as exemplified by <italic>mj1434</italic> of <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) and (iii) tUDG with its sub-families tUDGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and tUDGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The first two families belong to the HhH superfamily, the third to the UDG superfamily.</p><p>None of these, however, qualifies as a general archaeal line of defense against DNA cytosine deamination. Mig enzymes have clearly evolved to counteract the deamination of DNA 5-methylcytosine residues (i.e. processing of T/G mismatches) with the lack of discrimination against U/G oppositions as substrates probably owed to its selective neutrality. The <italic>Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) also contains a reading frame whose sequence is closely related to the <italic>mj1434</italic> gene (<italic>mth746</italic>; 38% identity, 54% similarity at the protein level); its gene product, however, is devoid of DNA uracil glycosylase activity (L.S. and H.-J.F., unpublished data). Lastly, enzymes of the tUDGA and tUDGB families have been identified in both the bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and the archaeal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). While tUDGA homologues are present in many archaeal genomes sequenced to date and tUDGB homologues in several, no consistent pattern of occurence has emerged yet and, significantly, both tUDGA and tUDGB are lacking in a number of methanogenic archaea, including <italic>M.thermautotrophicus</italic>.</p><p>Hence, the question as to the DNA uracil repair function specifically relevant to <italic>M.thermautotrophicus</italic> and the general one (if any) of the entire archaeal kingdom, is still open. Having exhausted all bioinformatics options, we decided to approach the problem by fractionating total cell extract of <italic>M.thermautotrophicus</italic> while monitoring relevant biochemical activities. Here we report the discovery of a DNA uridine endonuclease (U-endo) activity that is not sequence- and mismatch-specific, carried by the product of gene <italic>mth212</italic>, a protein that was, until now, only known as a homologue of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ExoIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). This kind of activity has not been described earlier; it is clearly competent to specifically incise DNA next to uracil residues and may thus provide an initiation point for repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA): F<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, &#x000f8;80d<italic>lacZ</italic>&#x00394;M15, &#x00394;(<italic>lacZYA-argF</italic>)U169, <italic>deoR</italic>, <italic>recA1</italic>, <italic>endA1</italic>, <italic>hsdR17</italic> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), <italic>phoA</italic>, <italic>supE44</italic>, <italic>thi-1</italic>, &#x003bb;-, <italic>gyr</italic>A96 (Nal<sup>r</sup>), <italic>relA1</italic>, <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA): <italic>E.coli B</italic>, F<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>ompT, hsdS</italic> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), <italic>dcm</italic><sup>+</sup>, Tet<sup>r</sup>, <italic>gal</italic> &#x003bb;(DE3), <italic>endA</italic>, Hte [<italic>argU, ileY, leuW</italic>, Cam<sup>r</sup>] <italic>E.coli</italic> XL1-Blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>): <italic>recA1</italic>, <italic>endA1</italic>, <italic>gyrA96</italic> (Nal<sup>r</sup>), <italic>thi-1</italic>, <italic>hsdR17</italic> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), <italic>supE44</italic>, <italic>relA1</italic>, &#x003bb;-, <italic>lac</italic>-, [F&#x02032;, <italic>proAB lac</italic>I<sup>q</sup><italic>Z</italic>&#x00394;M15, Tn <italic>10</italic> (Tet<sup>r</sup>)]</p><p><italic>M.thermautotrophicus</italic> Delta H (DSM 1053) was cultured as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> (DSM 7222) was purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector for cloning of blunt-ended PCR-products was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) as part of the &#x02018;Zero Blunt<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> TOPO&#x02019; kit.</p><p>pET_B_001 is a derivative of vector pET-21d (Novagen, San Diego, CA), in which the multiple cloning site between NcoI and XhoI is replaced by the following 14 nt section: dTCTGCGGCCGCACA.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymes and chemicals</title><p>Benzonase was purchased from Sigma (Munich, Germany, 298 U/&#x003bc;l).

Substrates of the type shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> were synthesized and used in assaying individual fractions for 2&#x02032;-d-uridine-directed strand nicking, either initiated by a uracil DNA glycosylase or brought about directly by an endonuclease activity. Under nuclease assay conditions (see Materials and Methods), the pool of fractions indicated by the bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) gave the results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right column. U/G substrate is used up in favor of a major reaction product having the same electrophoretic mobility as the marker 23mer carrying a free 3&#x02032;-OH terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right column). The reaction is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and treatment of the reaction products with sodium hydroxide has no influence on their electrophoretic mobility. All of these observations are in stark contrast to reactions of the same substrate catalyzed by <italic>E.coli</italic> Ung uracil DNA glycosylase. In the latter case, the reaction is unaffected by EDTA but treatment with NaOH is required to liberate a 23mer carrying a 3&#x02032;-terminal phosphate group (compare corresponding tracks of left column). The most straightforward interpretation of this behavior of the cell extract fractions is direct endonucleolytic cleavage of the internucleotidic phosphodiester bond that links the mismatched 2&#x02032;-d-uridine residue to the 3&#x02032; oxygen atom of its immediate 5&#x02032; neighbour. The activity, in addition, was unaffected by the addition of Ugi (data not shown), the polypeptidic inhibitor of uracil DNA glycosylase Ung and related enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). At this stage, the series of bands moving faster than the 23mer was tentatively attributed to exonucleolytic processing of the primary reaction product.</p><p>In order to obtain a first impression of its substrate spectrum, the activity was tested with oligonucleotide duplexes containing U/A oppositions, T/G mismatches and with a single-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single 2&#x02032;-d-uridine residue (ssU). Again, results are displayed in the right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and compared, in each case, with the outcome of a corresponding uracil DNA glycosylase assay employing <italic>E.coli</italic> Ung enzyme (left column). With the U/A substrate, the 23 mer product is clearly detected, together with its characteristic series of shorter secondary products. After the limited incubation time applied, however, a substantial amount of substrate is left uncleaved, accompanied by its own series of faster moving material. Apparently, U/A is a less efficient substrate for U-directed strand nicking and exonucleolytic degradation acts on substrate and product alike. No trace of the characteristic 23mer is seen with the T/G substrate, but it is subject to exonucleolytic degradation. Incubation of the ssU substrate with the same protein pool does not yield the 23mer either; instead it is processed to a host of oligonucleotides of intermediate length. In contrast to the situation with the T/G substrate, they do not seem to result from exonucleolytic degradation (note the clear-cut boundary at the low molecular weight end of the product spectrum). The likely origin of these intermediate length oligonucleotides is discussed further below.</p><p>In summary, the data are most simply explained by the presence in <italic>M.thermautotrophicus</italic> of a DNA U-endo which is double-strand specific and independent of the nature of the nucleotide opposing the 2&#x02032;-d-uridine residue in the other strand.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of <italic>mth212</italic> as a candidate gene for the novel activity</title><p>A combination of column chromatography, gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and gene cloning was used to reveal the identity of the protein that carries the nicking activity described in the preceding paragraph. First, the fractionation illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, was repeated. Re-chromatography on heparin affinity resin using a more shallow gradient (data not shown) was followed by gel filtration through Superdex 75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). From the latter column, the activity eluted in two separate peaks which were pooled as indicated. Analysis of the two pools by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded the pattern of bands shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Both lanes of the gel were cut in narrow strips and proteins contained in them digested with trypsin <italic>in situ</italic>. Fragment peptides were eluted from gel slices and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis as described in Materials and Methods. The fragment patterns were matched against the NCBI database of expected fragments. More than 10 candidate proteins were identified for each of the two lanes. The presence of activity in both pools can be explained either by two different enzymes sharing the same properties or by one enzyme eluting at two different volumes. If the second assumption holds, one would have to expect at least one protein to be present in both pools. By this criterion, the product of <italic>mth212</italic> was chosen as the top candidate. A BLAST-search puts it into the category of ExoIII-like AP-endonucleases, a function that was recently verified experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>)</p></sec><sec><title>Cloned Mth212 protein exhibits the expected catalytic properties</title><p>Gene <italic>mth212</italic> was isolated by PCR and inserted into a pET-type expression vector. The protein was produced by heterologous gene expression in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified by Ni<sup>2+</sup> IMAC, followed by chromatography on heparin perfusion resin. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, for details refer to Materials and Methods). Purified Mth212 protein was tested for the newly discovered DNA U-endo function and also for acitivities known to be commonly associated with homologues of <italic>E.coli</italic> ExoIII (AP-endonuclease, double-strand specific 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease). Assay conditions were essentially as previously applied to <italic>M.thermautotrophicus</italic> cell extract. Results are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (also compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). With respect to U/G, U/A, T/G and ssU substrates, the pattern of activities displayed by the heterologously produced protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, second to fifth set of lanes from top) qualitatively matches that of the pool of proteins obtained upon fractionating total cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Not surprisingly, the enzyme proves to be an AP-endonuclease; in this function it accepts both double- and single-stranded substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, bottom two groups of lanes). Comparison of reactions of the AP/G and the ssAP substrates also serves to illustrate the double-strand specific exonuclease activity expected for an ExoIII homologue (note the absence of products with chain length smaller than 23 in the ssAP reaction). Knowing this also explains the exonuclease acitivity observed with the fractionated cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as residing, at least in part, in the same protein as the DNA U-endo activity. Surprisingly for a DNase, Mth212 processes the AP/G substrate to the 23mer (but not further) in the presence of EDTA, as has been noted in a similar fashion with the human homologue Ape1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Experiments with prolonged pre-incubation of enzyme with EDTA suggest this may be due to slow release of metal ion (data not shown).</p><p>Both AP- and U-endonuclease activities show turnover; complete conversion of substrate to product was demonstrated for substrate/enzyme ratios of up to 50 for the former and 10 for the latter substrate (data not shown).</p><p>Again, the ssU substrate is shortened in an apparently endonucleolytic fashion with no correlation of the cleavage point and the position of the single 2&#x02032;-d-uridine residue (also compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right column, bottom group of lanes). Possible folding states of the ssU 40mer at 65&#x000b0;C as predicted by a modified Zuker algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) suggest that the endonucleolytic cut may be directed by secondary structure. This interesting property of Mth212 is presently being investigated separately.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymological exploration of Mth212</title><p>Since Mth212, like all known ExoIII homologues, is an AP-endonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;8 from bottom), the endonucleolytic cleavage product observed could arise from a two-stage reaction: removal of uracil by a uracil DNA glycosylase (activity residing in the same or an accompanying protein), followed by an endonucleolytic cut at the resulting AP-site.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, a 2&#x02032;-deoxy-pseudouridine-containing substrate is cleaved, which excludes the possibility of a glycosylase activity participating in the reaction. The alternative mechanism of a direct endonucleolytic incision is corroborated by inhibition of the reaction by an internucleotidic phosphorothioate linkage located to the 5&#x02032;-side of the 2&#x02032;-d-uridine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lane 6). As expected, Ung responds to the modifications by pseudouridine and, alternatively, phosphorothioate, in an exactly complementary fashion (corresponding lanes of left column).</p><p>An endonucleolytic cut next to the DNA uridine residue is observed with all four U/X oppositions as substrates (X = A, C, G, T), whereas no incision is seen if U is replaced by T (data not shown). A limited set of different sequence contexts was investigated, none of which was refractory to endonucleolytic scission. There is, however, significant variation of cleavage rate (data not shown).</p><p>In good accord with the optimal and maximal growth temperatures of <italic>M.thermautotrophicus</italic> (65&#x02013;70&#x000b0;C for optimal, 75&#x000b0;C for maximal growth temperature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), AP-endo, U-endo and 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;-exo activities all reach a maximum at 70&#x000b0;C, beyond which they drop sharply (data not shown). U- and AP-endonuclease activities of Mth212 respond differently to varying buffer conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Similar observations have been made for AP-endo and damaged-nucleotide incision activities of Ape1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>Obviously, Mth212 nucleolytically processes a variety of different DNA substrates with conceivably rather different structural requirements to be met by the protein catalyst. This raises the question as to the number of distinct active sites of Mth212 involved in the various functions. For clarification of this issue, mutant (Mth212/D151N) was constructed in analogy to the previously studied mutant of the human homologue Ape1/D210N which is deficient in AP-endonuclease activity while still binding to substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Residue 151 was chosen on the basis of the multiple sequence alignment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, Mth212/D151N is completely devoid of both DNA U-endo and 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activities with only a trace of AP endonuclease activity detectable. At the same time, specific binding to an AP/G substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) proves the mutant protein to be properly folded. Clearly, these data are in accord with the assumption of a single active site serving all of the nucleolytic functions enumerated above.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible DNA U-endo activity of other ExoIII homologues</title><p>The new finding of a general, double-strand-specific DNA U-endo provided incentive to investigate how general this activity may be within the ExoIII family of enzymes.

At the same time, the enzyme strictly discriminates against DNA cytidine and thymidine residues. With these properties, Mth212 can plausibly substitute as an initiator of DNA uracil repair for any of the general DNA uracil glycosylases known (Mj1434, Ung, tUDGA, tUDGB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Projecting the Mth212 amino acid sequence onto known 3D structures of ExoIII-homologues devoid of DNA U-endo activity (compare above) did not yield any compelling lead as to the structural roots of the additional function. The subtle discrimination of DNA uracil residues from thymine on one hand and cytosine on the other, a property Mth212 shares with the structurally unrelated UDG family of glycosylases, is especially remarkable since members of the ExoIII family of enzymes typically catalyze a number of different phosphoester hydrolysis reactions on a broad spectrum of substrates. For herpes simplex and human UDG (Ung familiy), the structural basis of this discrimination has been elucidated by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). It will be interesting to see if and to what extent Mth212, along its own independent evolutionary path, found a different structural solution to this problem.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Michael Neuberger for gift of <italic>ugi</italic> gene.
