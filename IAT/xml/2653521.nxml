Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for about 90&#x02013;95% of all CAH cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Deficiency of cortisol results in excessive production of androgens leading to prenatal virilization in females and rapid somatic growth in both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. CAH has been traditionally divided into three forms; severe salt wasting (SW), less severe simple virilizing (SV) and asymptomatic non-classic (NC) form. The SW form is common and found in 75% of all CAH patients. In addition to decreased cortisol, aldosterone biosynthesis is also impaired in these patients resulting in severe renal salt loss and hypotonic shock, unless treated during the neonatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Patients with SV form do not have aldosterone deficiency and thus salt loss is not present. Symptoms like variable degree of ambiguous genitalia in females, growth acceleration and pseudoprecocious puberty are seen in SV forms. The milder non-classical form is asymptomatic at birth and presents with various degrees of late onset features of hyperandrogenism.</p><p>The wide spectrum of clinical manifestations seen in this disorder is due to varied degrees of enzyme activity caused by different mutations in the <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>gene encoding the steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme. Although, both large and point mutations have been seen in different populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], point mutations constitute a larger proportion. The <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>gene is part of a complicated structure, referred to as the RCCX-module located in human leukocyte antigen class III locus on chromosome 6p21.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Approximately 30 kb upstream of <italic>CYP21A2</italic>, a pseudogene (<italic>CYP21A1P</italic>) is present; which is 98% identical to <italic>CYP21A2. CYP21A1P </italic>cannot synthesize the functional protein due to presence of numerous deleterious mutations.</p><p>About 95% of the mutated alleles in patients with steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency are generated by transfer of DNA sequences from <italic>CYP21A1P </italic>to <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>by gene conversion events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The remaining 5% alleles have new/rare mutations due to random events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The number of rare mutations identified has increased dramatically in the last few years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Most of these mutations are unique to individual families but some are population specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Functional characterization of most of the mutants using site directed mutagenesis followed by <italic>in vitro </italic>expression analyses have been helpful in correlating clinical severity to the degree of loss of enzyme function caused by the mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However such studies are difficult to perform in routine laboratory set up with limited resources. Alternatively, these experimental assays could be complemented with computational studies; wherein the structural and functional perturbations of a protein by virtue of mutation/s could be predicted. Consequence of single mutation (W62G) on structural stability of lysozyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and structural perturbations caused by three different activating mutations of the <italic>hLHR </italic>gene found in four unrelated Brazilian boys with male-limited precocious puberty have been studied by MD simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Computational scientists have also used MD simulations to independently explore the role of mutations on protein stability and activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the present study, molecular modeling and MD simulations were carried out to understand the structural and probable functional implications of the triple valine insertion of human P450c21.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Clinical history of proband</title><p>The proband presented on day 30 with ambiguous genitalia and failure to thrive. She was the first child born of non-consanguineous marriage with an uneventful antenatal history. She was born at full term by normal delivery. Her clinical examination showed prominent phallus with clitoral hypertrophy and partial fusion of labia (Prader stage IV). Gonads were non-palpable. Genitogram and panendoscopy revealed normal bladder, common urogenital sinus, vagina, and uterine cervix. Her weight was initially 2.9 kg (well below the 0.4<sup>th </sup>centile). Later at 12 weeks her length was 54.7 cm (2<sup>nd </sup>centile) and weight 4.3 kg (2<sup>nd </sup>centile). Hormonal examination revealed elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) (8800 ng/dl; normal value &#x0003c; 630 ng/dl), testosterone (1.5 ng/ml; normal range 0&#x02013;0.28 ng/ml) and low cortisol (5.6 ug/dl; normal range 11&#x02013;18 ug/dl). Sodium and potassium levels were 138 mmol/l and 6.1 mmol/l respectively. Her chromosomal analysis revealed 46, XX normal karyotype. She was diagnosed as simple virilising CAH and put on a relatively low dose of 5 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of hydrocortisone and 50 &#x003bc;g of fludrocortisone daily. In second year, she showed normal development with 17-OHP level of 560 ng/dl. Her weight was 8 kg, height &#x02013; 74 cm and head circumference &#x02013; 45.3 cm (all below 0.4<sup>th </sup>centile). Her bone age was normal. She was continued with the same dose till her third year. Thereafter her dose had to be increased to 9 mg of hydrocortisone and 100 &#x003bc;g of fludrocortisone daily due to increased level of 17-OHP (7200 ng/dl).

The shift in the insertion site was clearly observed in the forward (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> part C) and reverse (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> part D) strand that further confirmed this insertion as duplication of TGTGGTGGT base pairs in exon 2, at nucleotide position 306 of <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>gene (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> part E). This novel insertion mutation was inherited from the father, while the I172N was inherited from the mother, but both parents were heterozygous for their respective <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>mutation and, therefore, clinically healthy.

In addition to these, hydrophobic residues occurring at 48, 51, 58, 61 63, 80, 81 and 82 positions and glycine residues occurring just before the insertion site at 56 and 64<sup>th </sup>position are also conserved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

As compared to the other templates, it also showed full-length sequence alignment with least number of gaps. The consensus predicted secondary structural elements of human P450c21 also aligned fairly well (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). There exists another experimentally elucidated structure for rabbit P4502c5 [1N6B; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]] with a better resolution as compared to 1DT6. The secondary structure compositions of both these PDB entries are identical and the RMSD between them is 0.8 &#x000c5;. Hence, 1N6B was considered as the ideal template for modeling of human P450c21. A theoretical structure of human P450c21 (PDB ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2GEG">2GEG</ext-link>) has been elucidated using rabbit P4502c5 (PDB ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1N6B">1N6B</ext-link>) as template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This structure was thus used to represent the WT and also serve as the template for modeling the MT.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of the theoretical structures</title><p>The Verify3D analyses of theoretical models of both WT and MT revealed that most of the residues had a positive score. For low-scoring regions of the model, it was observed that the corresponding regions of the template (1N6B) too shared a low score.

The structures were also colour-rendered based on the Verify3D scores generated by the Colorado3D server.

In concurrence to the above observation, the potential energy of the MT remains higher through out the dynamics as compared to the WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The loss of the secondary structures at the region near the insertion site during the course of the simulation clearly reveals a faster unfolding of the MT as compared to the WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

The change in distance between the C&#x003b1; atoms of these residues was monitored for the trajectories as a function of time for both the WT and MT structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The distance between these two residues in the native WT and MT structures is 0.6 nm. It has to be noted here that the starting structures for simulations of WT and MT were identical except for the triple valine insertion and the residues S108 and D287 were distantly placed from the insertion site. In WT dynamics the distance between these two residues was maintained at around 0.6 nm, while for the MT the distance initially increased to around 2.25 nm and later stabilizes at around 1.25 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The change in C&#x003b1; distances between the residues S108 and D287, both of which are postulated to be involved in heme and substrate binding, as a function of time</bold>.

It was hypothesized that these residues would have to participate in hydrophobic interactions to minimize the destabilizing effect caused by the surface exposed hydrophobic region. Additionally, they are positioned adjacent to the N-terminal transmembrane region of the protein. Hence these hydrophobic residues were suggested to be probably involved in binding with the ER membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These residues were considered as a cluster and the RMS deviation of the C&#x003b1; atoms of this cluster with respect to the starting conformation was compared for the WT and MT structures during the course of simulation.

Detection of underlying mutations in <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>gene encoding steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme is helpful both for confirmation of diagnosis and management of CAH patients. Different kinds of mutations result in different degrees of enzymatic impairment of P450c21, which result in varied phenotypes of CAH patients. Although, a large number of novel mutations have been reported in <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>gene over the past few years and these mutations have continued expanding worldwide, large insertion/duplication mutations are uncommon. A duplication of 16 bases (CCTGGATGACACGGTC) at codons 393&#x02013;397 of exon 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and a large duplication of 111 bases from codons 21 to 57 inserted at codon 58 in exon 1 of the <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>gene have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Once a novel mutation is encountered, it is necessary to carry out the functional studies to establish genotype &#x02013; phenotype correlation so that the prognostic evaluation can be made for the proper management of the patient.</p><p>A large number of mutations detected in <italic>CYP21A2 </italic>gene have been characterized to prove their clinical relevance and impact on P450c21 protein. For characterization of mutations, functional studies have been carried out by site directed mutagenesis followed by <italic>in vitro </italic>expression of the mutant protein in transiently transfected mammalian cells. The residual enzyme activity is then measured towards both natural substrates (17-OHP and progesterone) and compared with the WT protein. Percentage of enzyme activity is correlated with the clinical phenotype and accordingly the mutation is classified as SV, SW or NC type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However such studies are laborious, time consuming and in some mutant proteins, the biochemical and biophysical evaluation is not possible by <italic>in vitro </italic>studies. In such cases, <italic>in silico </italic>studies can provide additional clinically useful information that could not be possible by examining the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Molecular modeling has been used to study the putative effects of steroid 21-hydroxylase gene mutations. Structural features deduced from the models were in good correlation with clinical severity of P450c21 mutants, which shows the applicability of a modeling approach in assessment of new P450c21 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>In this particular case, the 9-bp insertion/duplication did not result in frameshift as expected from insertions/duplications in general; instead it led to insertion of three valine residues between V70 and L71. Since this insertion mutation does not exist in pseudogene, gene conversion may not be the cause of this mutation. This duplication might have been generated by intergenic recombination during meiosis. Theoretically, this insertion could lead to absence of residual 21-hydroxylase activity resulting in the severe SW phenotype. Given the fact that CAH is an autosomal recessive disorder, the clinical severity reflects the milder mutation present in the patient. Hence SV phenotype of our patient that reflected the mild mutation I172N present on one allele, could not give additional information about the possible structural perturbation caused by the novel mutation present on the other allele. In such compound heterozygous cases with a mild known mutation on one allele and a novel mutation on other allele, it is difficult to classify the mutation on the basis of clinical phenotype.</p><p>In the present study, molecular modeling and MD simulations were carried out to analyze the structural consequences of this insertion in P450c21 and to better understand the molecular pathology of CAH in the proband.</p><p>The structure of human P450c21 has not been experimentally elucidated. However, a theoretical model for it is available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2GEG">2GEG</ext-link>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]).

The trajectory analyses were carried out to understand i) the effect on the structural stability and ii) plausible functional implications of the insertion.</p><p>Studies on the unfolding dynamics of the WT and MT revealed that, although the two shared an identical starting structure &#x02013; except for the site of insertion, the MT exhibits faster unfolding and is less stable (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;B</xref>). It was also observed that the secondary structures are gradually lost at the site of insertion during the course of simulation in the MT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The observations indicate that the insertion seems to have a profound effect on reducing the intrinsic stability of human P450c21.</p><p>In the absence of experimental data, the interactions and stability of the regions of the protein predicted to be harboring functional importance were selected for trajectory analyses. Based on docking and homology studies of cytochrome P450s, residues S108 and D287 have been implicated in both heme and substrate-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Docking and structural studies have also helped in identification of hydrophobic patches in human P450c21, which are suggested to be involved in ER membrane binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The results of the present simulation studies revealed that the C&#x003b1; distance between the residues S108 and D287 increase drastically in the MT while it remains the same in the WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These residues are placed far away from the site of insertion and yet their interactions seem to be affected in the mutant. This indicates that the insertion of triple valine seems to have caused not only a local structural perturbation but also a drastic disturbance in the structural stability of protein. Similarly, in the case of the hydrophobic regions implicated in ER membrane binding, the RMSD observed during the course of simulation suggested that this region is highly unstable in the MT as compared to the WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p><p>The sequence logo reveals that the insertion occurs in a region flanked by the presence of many conserved residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Although the insertion does not occur in the immediate vicinity of the postulated heme and substrate binding residues; trajectory analyses reveal that their interactions seem to get disrupted in the MT. These observations indicate that the insertion could result in SW phenotype had it been present in homozygous state.
