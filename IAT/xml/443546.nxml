These epigenetic modifications are also used to regulate tissue-specific gene expression. Epigenetic differences between alleles can be significant either in the function of the IC or in the <italic>cis</italic>-acting effect of the IC on &#x02018;target&#x02019; genes responding to it. We have now examined the epigenetic characteristics of <italic>NDN</italic>, a target gene of the chromosome 15q11&#x02013;q13 Prader&#x02013;Willi Syndrome IC, using sodium bisulfite sequencing to analyze DNA methylation and chromatin immunoprecipitation to analyze histone modifications. We observed a bias towards maternal allele-specific DNA hypermethylation of the promoter CpG island of <italic>NDN</italic>, independent of tissue-specific transcriptional activity. We also found that <italic>NDN</italic> lies in a domain of paternal allele-specific histone hyperacetylation that correlates with transcriptional state, and a domain of differential histone H3 lysine 4 di- and tri-methylation that persists independent of transcription. These results suggest that DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 4 methylation are persistent markers of imprinted gene regulation while histone acetylation participates in tissue-specific activity and silencing in somatic cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications are associated with transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c3">3</xref>), X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c6">6</xref>) and genomic imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c10">10</xref>). Mechanistic links between DNA methylation and histone modification have been proposed whereby histone H3 K9 methylation can direct DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c12">12</xref>), which can in turn recruit histone deacetylases, thereby creating a closed chromatin conformation that inhibits transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c14">14</xref>). DNA hypermethylation is generally associated with decreased gene activity, although the nature of the mechanistic link is controversial in endogenous autosomal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c17">17</xref>). Histone hyperacetylation is associated with actively transcribed genes and genes poised for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c18">18</xref>). The effect of methylation of histones depends on the residue modified, as predicted by the histone code hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c19">19</xref>). Histone H3 can be methylated on lysine 4 and lysine 9 residues to mark either active or inactive chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c3">3</xref>). Whether the same mechanisms operate in tissue-specific control and allele-specific control is less well understood.</p><p>The <italic>SNRPN</italic> gene, located in the Prader&#x02013;Willi Syndrome (PWS) region on 15q11&#x02013;q13, and the <italic>H19</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>IGF2</italic> gene pair are among the most intensively studied imprinted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c20">20</xref>). These genes contain imprinting control elements that control germline imprint resetting of genes located in <italic>cis</italic>, even over large distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c23">23</xref>). Allelic epigenetic differences found at these imprinted loci with closely associated imprinting centers (ICs) can therefore either be associated with the IC itself or be the result of a response to the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c26">26</xref>). Current imprinting models do not address mechanisms for the extension of the epigenetic mark to target genes at a distance from their IC, nor the mechanisms for coordinate allele- and tissue-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c28">28</xref>).</p><p><italic>NDN</italic> is a small intronless gene located in the PWS region on human chromosome 15q11&#x02013;q13, and is one of a set of PWS candidate genes that are expressed exclusively from the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c32">32</xref>). PWS genes are target genes of the PWS IC, located at the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>SNRPN</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c33">33</xref>). We previously demonstrated developmentally dynamic patterns of maternal hypermethylation and paternal hypomethylation of the promoter CpG island in mouse <italic>Ndn</italic>, by sodium bisulfite sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c28">28</xref>). We have now characterized the allele-specific methylation of a similar promoter CpG island and a second downstream CpG island in human <italic>NDN</italic> by sodium bisulfite sequencing, and have finely mapped regions of histone acetylation and histone methylation surrounding <italic>NDN</italic> using antibody specificities previously shown to be differentially modified in imprinted regions. In contrast to <italic>SNRPN</italic>, <italic>NDN</italic> has a tissue-specific expression pattern, expressed in brain and fibroblasts among other tissues but silent in blood lymphocytes and derivative lymphoblastoid cell lines, thus allowing comparisons of DNA methylation and histone modification between tissues in which <italic>NDN</italic> is and is not expressed. We have evaluated the relative contribution of epigenetic changes associated with tissue-specific gene expression versus those associated with genomic imprinting. Our results suggest that DNA methylation and histone H3 K4 di- and trimethylation epigenetically differentiate alleles in this target gene, while histone acetylation acts in tissue-specific gene regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Tissues and cultured cell lines</title><p>Control fibroblasts from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell repository (GM00650), PWS fibroblasts (University of Miami Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders &#x00023;1889), and AS fibroblasts (15q11&#x02013;q13 deletion cell line, from Dr A. Beaudet, Baylor College of Medicine) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Control lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from primary blood lymphocytes (our laboratory number LCL10), PWS LCLs (GM09024B, GM09133) and AS LCLs (GM11515) were grown in RPMI supplemented with 15% FBS. Brain (cerebral cortex) samples were obtained from Dr Marc Lalande (University of Connecticut, AS sample) and the University of Miami Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders (PWS sample). Blood was collected from PWS and AS patients with fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic>-hybridization-verified deletions and from control individuals, with informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA extraction</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue culture cells by proteinase K&#x0002f;SDS digestion, phenol&#x0002f;chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c34">34</xref>). Blood was collected in sodium EDTA tubes and erythrocytes lysed in two successive washes with 4 vol of lysis buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 155mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, pH 7.4). After centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed with phosphate buffered saline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c35">35</xref>). Genomic DNA was extracted as above for tissue culture cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Sodium bisulfite sequencing</title><p>Sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA samples was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c32">32</xref>). For DNA methylation analysis, PCR and sequencing, 4 &#x003bc;l of the sodium-bisulfite-treated DNA was used in each 20 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction with primers designed to amplify bisulfite-converted DNA (see Supplementary Table). For the promoter CpG island, the first round PCR primers were NEC63F and NEC65R. Of the first round PCR, 1&#x003bc;l was used in the seminested amplification, with PCR primers NEC63F and NEC64R. Some of the reactions were done as a nested PCR reaction with the first round PCR primers NEC92F and NEC65R and second round primers NEC95F and NEC64R. For the 3&#x02032; CpG island, seminested PCR was performed as above, with first round primers NEC126F and NEC128R. The second round PCR primers were NEC127F and NEC128R.</p><p>PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels, gel-purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc.) and cloned into the pGEM&#x02013;T vector (Promega Corp.). Plasmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c36">36</xref>). At least 15 recombinant clones from at least 3 separate PCR reactions were sequenced using an Amersham kit with fluorescently labeled M13 forward and reverse primers, and analyzed on a LiCor automated sequencer.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed with reagents from Upstate Biotechnology [acetyl-histone H3 ChIP assay kit: &#x00023;17-245, acetyl-histone H4 ChIP assay kit: &#x00023;17-229, anti-dimethyl-histone H3 (Lys4): &#x00023;07-030, anti-dimethy-histone H3 (Lys9): &#x00023;07-212, anti-dimethyl-histone H3 (K79): &#x00023;07-366, ChIP assay kit: &#x00023;17-295] and Abcam [anti-histone H3 (trimethyl K4): ab8580, anti-histone H3 (trimethyl K9): ab8898]. The H3me3K9 antibody show significant cross-reactivity with H3me3K27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c37">37</xref>), therefore interpretations must include these modifications. The manufacturer's protocol was used with minor modifications. Crude lymphocyte preparations were made with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from 15 ml blood samples following the manufacturer's recommendations and expanded with phytohemagglutinin before being fixed as for other samples. LCL cultures and fibroblasts were fixed by the addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C and cells collected. Fixed chromatin was sonicated with three 10 s pulses at one quarter maximum power with a 2 mm tip on a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator 60. Samples were pre-cleared with protein A agarose beads prior to antibody addition. Mock control runs with no antibody were done and routinely gave no products from any primers used in this study. After reversal of the cross-links, DNA was extracted using commercially available binding columns (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen Inc.). The size of the resulting DNA fragments was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR was performed with 1 &#x003bc;l of template in each 20 &#x003bc;l reaction. SNRPN exon 1&#x0002f;IC primers were pair &#x02018;A&#x02019; as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c24">24</xref>). PCRx (Invitrogen) was used as a PCR enhancer with a subset of primer pairs (see Supplementary Table 1). Quantification of ChIP experiments was done by densitometric analysis of <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe hybridizations of slot-blotted PCR products detected on a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon and analyzed with ImageQuant 5.2 quantitation software. Band intensities were corrected to background then normalized to <italic>GAPDH</italic> or chromosome 16 centromeric sequence (CEN16) bands before calculating a paternal versus maternal allele ratio. ChIP experiments were done in quadruplicate for fibroblasts, while limited availability of patient blood allowed only duplicate analysis. PCR amplifications and detection were performed multiple times for each experiment. Primer and oligo probe sequences are provided as Supplementary Table 1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>CpG islands in the human <italic>NDN</italic> gene</title><p>An imprinting center in the upstream region of the <italic>SNRPN</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c21">21</xref>) controls the imprinting of a large cluster of paternally expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c38">38</xref>). One of these genes, <italic>NDN</italic> encoding necdin, is located &#x0223c;1.5 Mb proximal to <italic>SNRPN</italic> and is composed of a single 2.2 kb exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c31">31</xref>). To identify possible locations of cytosine methylation in <italic>NDN</italic>, we searched surrounding genomic DNA sequence (Genbank &#x00023;AC006596) for CpG rich regions. One CpG island of 880 bp, containing 73 CpG sites, is located in the promoter region of <italic>NDN</italic>, extending from 250 bp upstream of the transcription start site into the open reading frame (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f1">1</xref>). A second CpG island is located &#x0223c;4.4 kb downstream of the <italic>NDN</italic> transcription start; no equivalent downstream CpG island was found in the mouse sequence for 30 kb downstream of <italic>Ndn</italic> (Genbank &#x00023;AC027298). While the downstream <italic>NDN</italic> CpG island is contained within 1.2 kb, it contains an intervening sequence of 320 bp that is CpG poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Patterns of DNA methylation in <italic>NDN</italic></title><p>In a previous analysis of <italic>NDN</italic> promoter DNA methylation in lymphocytes from a control individual, a mixture of methylated and unmethylated clones were found that had an undetermined parent of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c39">39</xref>). In order to analyze the maternal and paternal alleles in isolation, we used cell lines and tissues lacking either the maternal allele and derived from Angelman Syndrome (AS) individuals carrying maternal deletion of 15q11&#x02013;q13, or lacking the paternal allele and derived from Prader&#x02013;Willi Syndrome individuals carrying a paternal deletion of 15q11&#x02013;q13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c32">32</xref>). We designed PCR primers appropriate for sodium bisulfite sequencing to analyze methylation of 73 CpG sites from the promoter CpG island and 19 CpG sites from a 350 bp segment in the 3&#x02032; end of the downstream CpG island. DNA was extracted from tissues or cells and treated with sodium bisulfite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c28">28</xref>). Individual DNA strands produced by nested PCR of sodium bisulfite treated DNA were cloned and sequenced. Complete conversion was assessed by &#x0003e;99% of non-CpG sites converted to T.</p><p>To understand the correlation of DNA methylation with imprinted gene expression, we analyzed the same region in patient fibroblast cell lines and brain (cerebral cortex) samples. In these tissues in which <italic>NDN</italic> is expressed, the inactive maternal allele is hypermethylated in the promoter CpG island compared to the paternal allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f2">2</xref>A and B). The maternal allele in fibroblasts is less methylated than the maternal allele in brain, but in both samples the active paternal allele is almost completely unmethylated. Considerable heterogeneity in the methylation pattern among different clones was noted, and no CpG site was methylated in all maternal clones or unmethylated in all paternal clones. The heterogeneity among clones in brain may be due to a mixture of cell types in which <italic>NDN</italic> is or is not expressed.</p><p>To verify that we could compare the epigenetic state of both alleles in both tissues in which <italic>NDN</italic> is active and those in which it is not, we first reconfirmed that <italic>NDN</italic> is not expressed in our LCLs or peripheral blood lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c29">29</xref>), and is expressed in fibroblasts (data not shown) by reverse transcription PCR of RNA from these cells. We then examined the DNA methylation of the <italic>NDN</italic> promoter CpG island in PWS and AS lymphocytes by sodium bisulfite sequencing. Overall, DNA hypermethylation of the maternal allele compared to the paternal allele was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f2">2</xref>C), with the maternal allele methylation levels similar to that seen in fibroblasts. In PWS and AS LCLs, the levels of methylation on the maternal and paternal alleles are distinguishable, but the levels of methylation on both alleles are higher than in lymphocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f2">2</xref>D). Notably, the paternal allele shows a considerable amount of methylation compared to that found in other cell types. A transition from maternal methylation to biparental methylation during culturing of T lymphocytes has also been shown for intron 7 of <italic>SNRPN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c40">40</xref>). The observed methylation differences in <italic>NDN</italic> between cultured LCLs and lymphocytes may be a reflection of the same phenomenon of alteration of epigenetic characteristics during culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Histone modification of <italic>NDN</italic></title><p>We next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation to investigate histone modifications across the <italic>NDN</italic> gene, using primer sets designed to give detailed coverage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f1">1</xref>). Regions B to G cover <italic>NDN</italic>'s transcription unit and 5&#x02032; CpG island, while regions A and H are several kilobases upstream and downstream respectively. We analyzed fibroblasts derived from PWS and AS patients. Consistent with previously identified patterns of histone H3 acetylation (H3Ac), we observed paternal bias in <italic>NDN</italic> in all regions assayed inside and outside of <italic>NDN</italic>'s transcription unit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f3">3</xref>A). A similar paternal bias in H4 acetylation was also present (data not shown). While differences in acetylation were present across <italic>NDN</italic>, consistent allelic differences were largest in region B, colocalizing with the promoter where there were greater than 4-fold differences between alleles. We then performed similar ChIP analysis with antibodies specific for di- and tri-methylated forms of lysine 4 and lysine 9 of the histone H3 tail (H3me2K4, H3me3K4, H3me2K9 and H3me3K9) and di-methylated lysine 79 of the histone H3 globular domain (H3me2K79). Consistent paternal bias in H3me2K4 was observed over regions B to E (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f3">3</xref>A). The most striking H3me2K4 difference was seen in region B with an average of greater than 7-fold paternal bias. Using trimethyl specific antibodies, a more restricted pattern of paternal bias in H3me3K4 was seen consistently over region B only. H3me3K4 showed approximately 3-fold paternal enrichment with very weak or inconsistent biases elsewhere in the gene. We did not observe any reproducible allelic biases in H3me2K9 although the H3me3K9 antibody did detect a variable and weak trend towards maternal bias (data not shown). Unambiguous analysis of this modification awaits commercial availability of more specific antibodies. No allelic differences were seen in methylation state of the H3me2K79 residue (data not shown).</p><p>We next performed similar experiments in patient blood lymphocytes to assay whether or not the H3me2K4 and H3me3K4 paternal biases were correlated with tissue type and <italic>NDN</italic> expression. It was previously reported that a region within region F is not associated with allelic histone acetylation in LCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c41">41</xref>) and the paternal allele is associated with histone H3 dimethylation at K4 (H3me2K4) in region C in blood lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c10">10</xref>). We confirmed this lack of allelic histone acetylation in PWS and AS LCLs and lymphocytes in region F as well as paternal H3me2K4 of region C in patient blood lymphocytes. No other regions spanning regions A to G in <italic>NDN</italic> had any allelic histone acetylation in lymphocytes. H3me2K4 allelic differences were distributed over a wider region than previously reported, covering most regions analyzed, although with a weaker bias than seen in fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f3">3</xref>B). A trend towards paternal enrichment for H3me3K4 was also found in lymphocytes, although the degree and distribution of this bias was much more variable. Overall, these results define a domain of paternal H3me3K4 lying within a domain of paternal H3me2K4 which itself is contained within a large domain of paternal H3Ac in fibroblasts, while lymphocytes show a more general allelic bias in H3me2K4 and H3me3K4 without allelic H3Ac.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>SNRPN</italic> allelic histone H3 lysine modification</title><p>To make comparisons between <italic>NDN</italic> and its imprinting center, we studied <italic>SNRPN</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>IC</italic>, which is expressed in fibroblasts and lymphocytes. We examined histone modification in exon 1 of <italic>SNRPN</italic>, previously described to be paternally enriched for histone H3me2K4 and maternally enriched for histone H3me2K9 in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c10">10</xref>). In fibroblasts, a H3me2K4 paternal bias was also seen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f3">3</xref>A), while we observed maternal bias in H3me2K9 in only some of our trials (data not shown). We next determined if this bias extended to the trimethylated forms, H3me3K4 and H3me3K9. H3me3K4 was found to be paternally enriched at <italic>SNRPN</italic> exon 1 at a level comparable to the enrichment seen with H3me2K4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f3">3</xref>A). Using antibodies specific to H3me3K9 however, did not show significant differences between alleles. In blood lymphocytes, we confirmed the paternal bias previously seen in H3me2K4, and discovered an H3me3K4 bias, as is seen in fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f3">3</xref>B). These observations are consistent with the fact that <italic>SNRPN</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>IC</italic> is expressed from the paternal allele in both fibroblasts and lymphocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our studies of histone acetylation are consistent with findings that developmentally regulated genes, such as <italic>NDN</italic>, are usually associated with domains of hyperacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c43">43</xref>) while changes in gene activity in response to stimuli are more frequently associated with localized changes in acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c44">44</xref>). In fibroblasts, in which <italic>NDN</italic> is actively transcribed, we identified allelic acetylation differences in a region of at least 10 kb surrounding <italic>NDN</italic>. Intriguingly, the paternal allele is hypoacetylated in the absence of DNA methylation in lymphocytes, suggesting that at this locus histone deacetylases are recruited by factors that are not dependent on DNA methylation, or that DNA methylation is lost after establishment of the hypoacetylated state. Limited studies of the murine <italic>Ndn</italic> promoter, in a region equivalent to human region D (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f1">1</xref>), indicate that neither allele is acetylated in liver, where necdin is inactive, whereas at least one allele is acetylated in brain, where necdin is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c43">43</xref>). Thus in both human and mouse, the acetylation state of <italic>NDN</italic> may act transiently in transcriptionally competent and transcriptionally active cells, and does not appear to remain as a longer lasting epigenetic imprinting mark.</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, H3me2K4 has been associated with active regions of the genome whereas a H3me3K4 state is only seen in actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c3">3</xref>). In light of this association for H3me3K4, it is of great surprise that lymphocytes, not actively transcribing <italic>NDN</italic>, would carry any paternal bias in this modification. This paternal allele shows a striking resemblance to the b-globin cluster in that even in a tissue not expressing <italic>NDN</italic>, it carries more H3me2K4 and H3me3K4 as does inactive &#x003b2;-globin genes, in contrast to other developmentally regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c45">45</xref>), which show little H3me2K4 and H3me3K4 modification. As those authors suggest, one possible explanation may be related to the long range function of the &#x003b2;-globin LCR, and at this locus, the PWS&#x0002f;AS imprinting center may share similar mechanisms of action. It is possible that the maintenance of the paternal state within the PWS&#x0002f;AS cluster requires all genes on that allele carry certain epigenetic marks regardless of tissue-specific transcriptional status.</p><p>Of greater interest are the wide region of paternal H3me2K4 and the nested region of H3me3K4 in fibroblasts. These modifications have been found to be markers of active regions and transcribed genes respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c3">3</xref>). Unlike histone acetylation, histone methylation status has been implicated as an early event in chromatin control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c46">46</xref>), with histone H3 methylation on residues lysine 4 and lysine 9 reciprocally marking active chromatin and heterochromatin respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c19">19</xref>). As allelic H3me2K4 and H3me3K4 is also present in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c10">10</xref>), we propose a model whereby histone H3 methylation at lysine 4 acts to mark allelic differential chromatin states at the <italic>NDN</italic> locus in response to the IC, and that this histone modification represents a persistent somatic mark of the active allele that allows histone acetylation to regulate expression of <italic>NDN</italic> in a tissue-specific manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh671f4">4</xref>). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that a promoter restricted distribution of H3me2K4 is a marker of monoallelic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c47">47</xref>). While these authors were not able to distinguish parental alleles, we show here that a similar bias is present in <italic>NDN</italic> on the paternal allele regardless of expression. Restriction of the H3me2K4 modification to near the promoter of this single exon gene is also consistent with their observations. It remains to be seen whether H3me3K4 also display distribution patterns characteristic of imprinted or other monoallelic genes versus biallelic genes. The multiple levels of histone modification in expressing and non-expressing tissues and persistent allelic identity of this imprinted locus may indicate involvement of remodeling complexes implicated in cellular memory. For example, the human trithorax group ALL-1 complex contains HMT activity towards H3K4, histone acetyltransferase activity, as well as chromatin remodeling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c48">48</xref>). It will be of great interest to study association of this or other regulatory complexes to maintenance of imprinting at the PWS&#x0002f;AS cluster.</p><p>DNA methylation in the imprinted target gene <italic>NDN</italic> appears to cooperate with other epigenetic alterations to regulate the final allele- and tissue-specific expression of <italic>NDN</italic>. The lack of DNA methylation on the paternal allele may signify that a different epigenetic mark, such as chromatin conformation or a specific protein&#x02013;DNA interaction, serves as an imprint carried from the male germ line. For example, <italic>SNRPN</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> have stable regions of nuclease hypersensitivity on the unmethylated paternal allele in the differentially methylated region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c49">49</xref>). We observed consistent DNA hypermethylation on the maternal allele compared to the paternal allele in human lymphocytes, fibroblasts and brain. Less striking maternally biased hypermethylation was previously noted in mouse tissues, while both alleles are relatively hypermethylated in the 3&#x02032; end of the murine CpG island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c28">28</xref>). Maternal DNA methylation may be important in maintaining allele-specific expression in tissues that express <italic>NDN</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>Ndn</italic>. Alternatively, the final methylation state may merely be a reflection of the competing tissue-dependent epigenetic modifications that may exclude DNA methylation. In support of the latter hypothesis, the murine <italic>Ndn</italic> promoter is relatively hypomethylated on both parental alleles in liver, in which <italic>Ndn</italic> is not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c28">28</xref>), but human <italic>NDN</italic> is differentially methylated in lymphocytes, in which <italic>NDN</italic> is inactive, and in fibroblasts in which <italic>NDN</italic> is active.</p><p>The developmental origins of somatic maternal epigenetic marks are not clear. In mouse and human oocytes, the necdin promoter is variably methylated, and at least in mouse, differences between the parental alleles are no longer present in blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh671c39">39</xref>). Histone H3 K4 methylation on the active allele could serve as a candidate initial epigenetic mark of imprinted target genes, or could translate an initial DNA methylation imprint into a long-term mark that differentiates the two alleles. It remains to be tested whether differential histone H3 methylation exists during early embryogenesis and throughout development and if it acts at the top of a chromatin control hierarchy above allelic DNA methylation and histone acetylation or is simply correlated with these other epigenetic differences. While the mechanism of chromatin changes at target genes by the imprinting center is unknown, our data suggests that allele- and tissue-specific epigenetic changes are coordinated for proper gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_11_3376__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_11_3376__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh671f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>NDN</italic> and surrounding regions.
