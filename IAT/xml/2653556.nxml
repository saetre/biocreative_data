The consequences of these perturbations can be measured using kinetic imaging, biochemistry, and gene expression analysis.</p><p>Here, we present comprehensive genetic perturbation analysis of a new model of the autonomous human circadian clock. Using this system, we analyzed the functional consequences of decreasing expression of individual and combinations of circadian clock components in a dose-dependent fashion using RNA interference (RNAi). Effects on cellular oscillations were monitored using kinetic imaging, and changes in gene expression of other clock components were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Using these data and applying biochemical constraints, we constructed gene interaction networks to describe, visualize, and mine the perturbation-induced changes for emerging network features. Disruption of gene function using previous methods, e.g., comparing knockout versus wild-type animals, lacked the statistical power necessary for uncovering such changes due to a lower number of gene doses (zero, one, or two copies). Using this new method, we uncovered several novel features of the circadian clock, including proportional response of gene expression, where levels of expression are altered actively and in a proportional fashion with respect to the gene being knocked down. By measuring the responses of most clock factors following perturbation of a single gene, we also observed signal propagation through interacting activator and repressor modules. Furthermore, our method uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors, providing the first example to our knowledge of multiple paralogs regulated in this fashion in a single pathway. We propose that the features we uncovered provide mechanisms to buffer the clock against genetic perturbation, and ultimately contribute to the extraordinary robustness of the oscillator.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Robust Circadian Oscillator Is Resistant to Perturbation of Most Components</title><p>To investigate the network features of the circadian clock that underlie its robustness, we used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knockdown clock components in immortalized human osteosarcoma cells (U-2 OS cells) that are amenable to both RNAi and quantitative kinetic imaging.

In general, the observed changes in oscillator function were consistent with the behavioral and/or tissue level rhythms seen in knockout mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000052-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Reasoning that the statistical power to analyze these studies was constrained by the number of perturbations, we based GDNA on the ability of RNAi to generate multiple levels of knockdown at finer intervals than is possible using traditional genetics approaches (i.e., from wild-type levels to approximately 10&#x00025; residual expression). Following dose-dependent depletion of each clock component, mRNA levels of other clock components were measured using quantitative PCR. Starting with the perturbed component, nonparametric Pearson correlations of relative gene expression levels were calculated and the shortest paths, or edges, were drawn between the perturbed gene and all other components in the network consistent with the biochemical nature of the perturbed component (i.e., targets of activators go <italic>down</italic> when activators are depleted; targets of repressors go <italic>up</italic> when repressors are depleted). To attribute signal propagation through the network, this process was repeated with first-order perturbed components (i.e., genes directly connected to the perturbed gene) until no further edges could be drawn. Unlike sequence analysis of gene regulatory regions, which predicts occupancy of transcription factors, or chromatin immunoprecipitation, which shows occupancy and predicts function, the GDNA procedure results in a genetic network based on the <italic>observed functional</italic> consequences of perturbation. It is important to note that although GDNA networks are consistent with many biochemical observations, they are genetic networks and not intended to be biochemically mechanistic.</p><p>We used GDNA to help characterize network features of the clock during conditions that generated loss of robust oscillator function, i.e., knockdown of <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Bmal1</italic>, and <italic>Per1</italic>. Knockdown of either of the obligate heterodimers <italic>Bmal1</italic> or <italic>Clock</italic> led to similar defects in function, with a dose-dependent loss of circadian rhythms and increasing levels of the <italic>Bmal1</italic>-luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">2</xref>D), whereas knockdown of <italic>Per1</italic> also led to loss of circadian rhythms, but with decreasing levels of the <italic>Bmal1</italic>-luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). mRNA levels of clock genes were measured in these samples, and we observed dose-dependent decreases in the target gene (<italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic>, or <italic>Per1</italic>) as well as dose-dependent changes in other circadian genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">2</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">2</xref>H). Despite all of these perturbations leading to loss of robust oscillations, no two perturbation conditions produced the same effects on gene expression. Knockdown of <italic>Bmal1</italic> led to a decrease in <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> and <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic> and an increase in <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Cry1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Knockdown of <italic>Clock</italic> led to decreases in <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic>, <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic>, <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, and <italic>Per3</italic>, and increases in <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Npas2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), whereas knockdown of <italic>Per1</italic> led to increases in <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic>, <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, and <italic>Per3</italic> and decreased <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>H). The dose-dependent changes in gene expression we observed in unsynchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>) were also observed throughout the circadian cycle in synchronized, oscillating cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000052-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Gene Dosage Networks (GDNs) were constructed from these data by drawing edges between the gene targeted by siRNA knockdown and genes that change in a manner consistent with the biochemical function of the target gene. For example, since BMAL1 is a transcriptional activator, its target genes must go down when <italic>Bmal1</italic> levels are decreased; therefore, in the <italic>siBmal1</italic> condition, direct edges are drawn between <italic>Bmal1</italic> and both <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> and <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The observed increases in <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> following knockdown of <italic>Bmal1</italic> could not occur directly by the BMAL1 transactivator, however, and therefore are likely to occur through signal propagation by the transcriptional repressors <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> and <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic>. As a result, we have drawn edges between the <italic>Rev-erb</italic>s and <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).

One feature of the circadian regulatory network uncovered by GDNA is the proportional responses in downstream gene expression following siRNA-induced perturbation. These proportional responses can be described using the simple linear equation, <italic>y</italic> &#x0003d; <italic>b</italic><sub>o</sub> &#x0002b; <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>x</italic>, where <italic>b</italic><sub>o</sub> is the baseline expression of the gene, <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> is the slope of the response, <italic>x</italic> is the expression level of the gene targeted for knockdown, and <italic>y</italic> is the expression level of the downstream gene. This is best exemplified using the results generated under <italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Per1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and <italic>Cry1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000052-sg003">Figure S3</xref>) knockdown conditions. Following dose-dependent knockdown of <italic>Bmal1</italic>, we observed linear proportional decreases in <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> and <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic> mRNA levels (Pearson correlations of <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.99 and <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 1.00, and slopes of <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; 0.97 and <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; 0.85, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). This is most easily explained by direct activation of the <italic>Rev-erb</italic> genes by Bmal1, which has been previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, and suggests that <italic>Bmal1</italic> is a strong contributor to <italic>Rev-erb</italic> expression. In the previous example of <italic>Rev-erb</italic> response to knockdown of <italic>Bmal1</italic>, the relationship is considered strictly proportional because the slope <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> is close to 1. Whereas targets of activators respond proportionally to their knockdown, targets of repressors respond in an inverse and proportional fashion. An example of an inverse linear proportional change is the response of <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> following depletion of <italic>Per1</italic>, where <italic>Rev-erb</italic> levels increase in a linear, but inversely proportional, fashion with respect to the decrease in <italic>Per1</italic> (<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; &#x02212;0.9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). However, not all of the relationships are strictly proportional. For example, the <italic>Per</italic> genes respond to <italic>Clock</italic> knockdown in a linear and proportional, but fractional, fashion, i.e., although the <italic>Per</italic> genes decrease when <italic>Clock</italic> levels fall, the relationship is best described by a fractional slope (<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; 0.4 &#x0005b;Per1&#x0005d;, <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; 0.3 &#x0005b;Per2&#x0005d;, and <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; 0.5 &#x0005b;Per3&#x0005d;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Finally, we see disproportional responses (with the absolute value of the slope greater than 1) of <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> genes following depletion of Cryptochromes. An approximately 50&#x00025; knockdown of <italic>Cry1/Cry2</italic> results in a 10-fold induction in <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> mRNA expression levels (slope is not calculated because of the double-knockdown condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g003">Figures 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000052-sg003">S3</xref>F). We validated these disproportional changes in gene expression in MEFs derived from wild-type and <italic>Cry</italic> double-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). While the vast majority of genetic responses to perturbation are proportional, with a slope close to &#x000b1;1, we observed disproportional responses only in the <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> depletion condition. These disproportional responses are likely to be specific to the biochemical activity of cryptochromes, and not simply because both paralogs were depleted, as these responses were also observed in the <italic>Cry1</italic> single-knockdown condition (when comparing <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; &#x02212;4.2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000052-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B).

This principle of proportionality has attractive implications for quantitative network deconstruction and modeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Network Features: Signal Propagation through Interacting Modules</title><p>Another feature we observed in the circadian network is signal propagation through interacting genetic modules of activators and repressors. The GDNs provide a framework to uncover these biological relay mechanisms through which modules communicate changes in gene expression. We observed combinations of proportional response modules that relay and propagate perturbation signaling through the clock network. For example, in the <italic>Per1</italic> perturbation network, we observed signal propagation through Repressor/Repressor modules resulting in a strictly proportional decrease in the level of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). When <italic>Per1</italic> is depleted, the <italic>Rev-erb</italic>s increase (which is likely due to the repressive function of PER1 on E-box sequences in the <italic>Rev-erb</italic> promoters), then that signal propagates to the target of the <italic>Rev-erb</italic> repressors, <italic>Bmal1</italic>, and is observed as a strictly proportional decrease in its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). In another example, we observed an Activator/Repressor relay following knockdown of <italic>Bmal1</italic>. By knocking down the activator <italic>Bmal1</italic>, we see a decrease in the <italic>Bmal1</italic> target gene <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> and an increase in <italic>Per2</italic>, which is likely a direct or indirect target of <italic>Rev-erb</italic> repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). We propose that the clock network combines these activator and repressor modules with various forms of proportionality to construct relays that generate complex gene expression responses to single gene perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Network Features: Paralog Compensation</title><p>Another prominent feature of clock network organization, paralog compensation, was revealed using GDNA. Following knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, we observed the up-regulation of gene paralog(s), usually transcriptional repressors, through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown. Following a decrease in <italic>Cry1</italic> expression, <italic>Cry2</italic> mRNA levels increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> mRNA was induced when <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic> was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), and knockdown of <italic>Per1</italic> led to a subsequent increase in both <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Per3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). This active method of gene compensation is distinct from redundancy, where one component is sufficient to sustain function. In addition, a high resolution time course of gene expression from synchronized, oscillating U-2 OS cells confirms that the unidirectionality of these changes cannot be explained by the phase of mRNA expression of these gene paralogs in the circadian clock (unpublished data; GEO accession GSE13949). Finally, the finite number of gene doses in knockout animals (a maximum of three: wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous) may explain why paralog compensation has not been widely observed in circadian network organization (aside from the increase in <italic>Npas2</italic> following knockout of <italic>Clock</italic> in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;) or other signal transduction pathways.</p><fig id="pbio-1000052-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Unidirectional Paralog Compensation in the Circadian Repressors <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic>, and <italic>Per1</italic></title><p>(A, C, and E) U-2 OS cells were transfected with doses of siRNA as indicated, and gene expression was measured from samples collected 48 h after transfection.

This unidirectional mode of regulation is also observed in the circadian network (e.g., <italic>Cry2</italic> knockdown has no effect on <italic>Cry1</italic> expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g004">4</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g004">4</xref>F, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g004">4</xref>G).

However, there are clearly differences between our system and the model in Liu et al., as we observe a functional oscillator in U-2 OS cells following knockdown of <italic>Cry1</italic>. This may suggest that the networks are wired differently depending on the tissue and/or species, or that genetic knockout and knockdown produce variation in phenotype. Because most compensatory gene expression changes we observe in the U-2 OS network occur in nonparalogous genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">2</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">2</xref>H), we propose that other gene expression changes may assist in conferring robustness to the oscillator.

We hypothesized that the compensatory increase in <italic>Cry1</italic> following knockdown of <italic>Bmal1</italic> contributed to oscillator function, and indeed, we observed a decrease in amplitude, an increase in arrhythmic cells, and more variability among replicate samples with double knockdown of <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Cry1</italic> relative to knockdown of each individual component alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Gene expression changes occurring under numerous perturbations may promote this genetic buffering effect. For example, knockdown of <italic>Clock</italic> led to dose-dependent decreases in its repressors, <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, and <italic>Per3</italic>, and increases in its heterodimeric partner <italic>Bmal1</italic> and paralog <italic>Npas2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000052-g002">2</xref>F).

For example, only 1&#x00025; of the more than 4,000 mouse knockout lines that have been created are heterozygous lethal (JAX mice database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jax.org">http://www.jax.org</ext-link>). Conversely, approximately 20&#x00025; of all homozygous knockout mice are embryonic lethal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jax.org">http://www.jax.org</ext-link>). Therefore, the sum of all pathways, networks, and processes required to take a single-celled organism through development into a viable postnatal mouse are tolerant of 50&#x00025; reduction in dosage of the vast majority of genes. Furthermore, gene loss is by no means the most prevalent cause of variability in gene dosage. In multicellular organisms, most genes are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion and often vary dramatically in their expression depending on cell type, tissue, or structure. Many conventionally defined pathways function throughout the organism (e.g., cell cycle, circadian clock, NFkB, Ap1, cAMP pathways) even though the relative expression of key pathway components varies across tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

We hypothesized that these active mechanisms must be at play in pervasive biological networks/pathways, such as the circadian clock, that function throughout the body of mammals. To explore these mechanisms, we devised a novel strategy termed Gene Dosage Network Analysis that combines dose-dependent knockdowns with functional and biochemical analysis. This analysis revealed strikingly simple principles of proportional response, signal propagation through activator and repressor modules, and paralog compensation that manifest in the highly buffered clock network. Proportionality took several forms&#x02014;fractional and strict&#x02014;and the disproportional responses seen in knockout of the <italic>Cry</italic> genes, which act as potent repressors. Upon perturbation, interacting activator and repressor modules produced signal propagation through key relay points to achieve complex and unexpected gene expression patterns. We also found several straightforward examples of paralog compensation, which is enabled by responsive backup circuits and acts to restore gene activity following knockdown of circadian repressors. These features, which we suggest interact to produce genetic buffering, may in part explain the prevalence of tissue-specific circadian clocks, despite tissue-specific variance in expression of clock components.</p><p>Previous investigations of functional systems have tended to contrast &#x0201c;passive&#x0201d; structural features (such as the existence of paralogs) that lend robustness to genetic knockout through redundancy of function with &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; rerouting of metabolic pathways in response to graded environmental exposures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

For example, loss of both <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> and <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic> still results in a functional oscillator even though <italic>Bmal1</italic> oscillations are disrupted (unpublished data and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;), indicating that this secondary feedback loop is not required for oscillator function and therefore may function to promote stability and robustness. Furthermore, these data support the idea that in addition to biochemical modeling of negative feedback loops, the molecular clock should be modeled at the network level &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000052-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. We propose extending the GDNA approach to investigate clock gene changes over time, in combination, and in different cellular and tissue contexts to learn more about network structure and function. Furthermore, by expanding the GDNA to encompass genome-wide measurements following perturbation, we can explore for novel components and network features. Finally, although the exact circuitry may differ by cell or tissue type, these general principles may be utilized in all circadian clock systems and indeed, in other biological networks, to maintain function in the face of genetic, tissue-specific, and environmental perturbation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>siRNA sequence information.</title><p>The target sequences of circadian gene siRNAs are supplied in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000052-st001">Table S1</xref>.

Each expression profile was normalized to its negative siRNA transfection control. Nonparametric Pearson analysis was performed using the perturbed component's mRNA expression profile as the first vector and mRNA expression of other components as each subsequent vector, thus generating the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; Pearson correlation. To estimate <italic>p</italic>-value, the expression measurements for each component of the vector were shuffled 1,000 times without replacement, and the true Pearson value was ranked in the distribution of these shuffled values. Edges were drawn when the Pearson correlation had a <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.10 and the target of the perturbed component behaved in a manner consistent with its established biochemical properties (we defined <italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Bmal2</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Npas2</italic>, and <italic>RORs</italic> as activators and <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>, <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Per3</italic>, and <italic>Rev-erb</italic>s as repressors). For example, beginning with the perturbed gene, we drew a line or edge between that component and all other genes that had a significant Pearson score, and gene changes occurred in the correct direction depending on whether the perturbed component was an activator or repressor. For example, for activators, edges were drawn to all components that had positive and significant Pearson scores, whereas for repressors, all target components had negative and significant Pearson scores. Following the first round of this analysis, additional rounds were performed from the second-order genes until all significant edges (with Pearson scores consistent with biochemical properties) were exhausted. Components targeted by siRNA are indicated by a green triangle indicating the knockdown of that gene. Genes that responded to this perturbation by reduction of their mRNA are indicated in green boxes, while induced genes are indicated by red boxes. Previously described edges in the literature (e.g., <italic>Bmal1</italic> regulation of <italic>Rev-erb alpha</italic> and <italic>Rev-erb beta</italic>) are indicated by a black line, and novel edges are indicated in blue. Where multiple genes could influence the expression of another component, all plausible edges were drawn. Of note, these networks require direct or indirect connectivity to the perturbed component. There are cases where significant Pearson scores were possible, but no connection to the perturbed component could be drawn. In these cases, these satellite networks were disregarded. Finally, these networks are meant as plausible representations of genetic networks consistent with biochemical properties and are not intended to be biochemically mechanistic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-1000052-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>U-2 OS Cells Contain a Robust Circadian Clock</title><p>Luminescence levels were measured from U-2 OS cells stably transfected with a <italic>Bmal1</italic>-luciferase reporter for 6 d, following synchronization with dexamethasone at time 0.</p><p>(164 KB JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000052.sg001.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-1000052-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Gene Expression Changes Resulting from siRNA Knockdown Are Conserved in Unsynchronized and Oscillating Cell Populations</title><p>U-2 OS cells were transfected with doses of siRNAs targeting <italic>Bmal1</italic>, and samples were collected from unsynchronized cells (B) or at 6-h intervals in oscillating cells (C&#x02013;H), as indicated by arrows in (A).
