Some of these unknown factors may not be traditional protein encoding genes. MicroRNA (miRNA) plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, but it is still unknown if variants in miRNA genes lead to predisposition to cancer. Considering the fact that miRNA regulates a number of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and oncogenes, genetic variations in miRNA genes could affect the levels of expression of TSGs or oncogenes and, thereby, cancer risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>To test this hypothesis in familial ovarian cancer, we screened for genetic variants in thirty selected miRNA genes, which are predicted to regulate key ovarian cancer genes and are reported to be misexpressed in ovarian tumor tissues, in eighty-three patients with familial ovarian cancer. All of the patients are non-carriers of any known BRCA1/2 or mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations. Seven novel genetic variants were observed in four primary or precursor miRNA genes. Among them, three rare variants were found in the precursor or primary precursor of the miR-191 gene. In functional assays, the one variant located in the precursor of miR-191 resulted in conformational changes in the predicted secondary structures, and consequently altered the expression of mature miR-191. In further analysis, we found that this particular variant exists in five family members who had ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings suggest that there are novel genetic variants in miRNA genes, and those certain genetic variants in miRNA genes can affect the expression of mature miRNAs and, consequently, might alter the regulation of TSGs or oncogenes.

Approximately 70% of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage. The 5-year survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is approximately 40% and has not significantly changed over the last two decades, despite advances in treatment. It has been demonstrated that prophylactic removal of ovaries in women at high risk for developing ovarian cancer is an effective prevention strategy and is especially applicable to women who are genetically predisposed to ovarian cancer. Therefore, identification of women who are predisposed to ovarian cancer at an early age is clearly needed. Unfortunately, so far, our understanding of the genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer is limited. Family history is the strongest known risk factor for ovarian cancer. Compared to a 1.6% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer in the general population, women with one first-degree relative with ovarian cancer have a 5% risk and women with two first-degree relatives have a 7% risk. The most common form of familial ovarian cancer can be attributed to mutations in either of the <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>genes, which account for 5-13% of ovarian cancer cases in Western countries and for half of the familial aggregation of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This suggests that other unidentified genetic events may contribute to ovarian cancer.</p><p>miRNAs are short, noncoding RNAs that have been identified in the genomes of a wide range of multicellular life forms as well as viruses. miRNAs can regulate gene expression by directly binding to the 3'UTR regions of protein-encoding genes, such as tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) or oncogenes, etc. It is known that there is a widespread misexpression of miRNAs in many cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], including ovarian cancer, but little is known regarding how inherited variability in miRNA genes may predispose towards cancer. In our previous analysis in 42 patients with familial breast cancer, we identified 7 novel genetic variants in 7 miRNA genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Among these 7 variants, an A to G change in <italic>pre-miR-30c-1 </italic>and a C to A change in <italic>pri-miR-17 </italic>were only observed in patients who are non-carriers of known <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>mutations. In further functional analysis of these two variants, we found both of them could cause conformational changes in the predicted secondary structures and subsequently modify the expression of mature miRNAs. More interestingly, we observed that miR-17 could bind to the 3'UTR of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>mRNAs in the target <italic>in vitro </italic>assay, suggesting that the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>gene is a target gene for miR-17. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that <italic>rs2910164 </italic>in <italic>pre-miR-146a </italic>is a risk modification factor for papillary thyroid carcinoma and liver cancer as well as early age of familial breast and ovarian cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that variations in miRNA genes may affect miRNA function, and potentially confer cancer susceptibility through regulation of key TSGs and oncogenes.</p><p>To examine whether genetic variants in miRNA genes might be able to explain some of the unidentified genetic predisposition in familial ovarian cancer, we screened genetic variants in select miRNA genes in ovarian cancer patients who are non-carriers of any known <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>or MMR gene mutations. Our hypothesis is that genetic variations in miRNA genes, if inherited in the germline, could affect the levels of expression of TSGs or oncogenes and, thereby, ovarian cancer risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>This study included genomic DNA samples from lymphocytes of eighty-three non-related probands from families with inherited ovarian cancer.

In this study, we found several novel genetic variants in the primary precursors or precursors of miRNA genes in patients with familial ovarian cancer, but who are non-carriers of any known <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>or <italic>MLH1/MSH1 </italic>mutations, representing enriched unresolved genetic susceptibility to ovarian cancer. One rare variant in the precursor of <italic>miR-191 </italic>results in conformational changes in the predicted secondary structures, and consequently alter the expression of mature miRNA. In further family analysis, we found that this variant exists in four extended family members, including two individuals who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer. At the same time, family members who are not carriers of this rare variant all appeared to be cancer free when they were recruited.</p><p>Consistent with our previous study in breast cancer and other literature reports, our screening did not reveal any genetic variants in mature miRNAs, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of miRNA genes. In order to further explore whether these rare variants exist in the general population, we genotyped 100 healthy women. As we expected, we didn't observe any of these rare variants in these healthy women. Although a "common disease-common allele" model has been accepted for most of the sporadic cancers, the situation in familial cancers might be different. So far, most of the genetic risk alleles contributing to familial ovarian cancer are rare mutations in <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>or <italic>MLH1/MSH1 </italic>genes. No common alleles have been found to be associated with familial ovarian cancer. Therefore, just like familial breast cancer, the model that best reflects familial ovarian cancer might be a "common disease-multiple rare alleles" model. The findings from this study provide the evidence to support this model.</p><p>The contribution of rare variants with medium or low penetrance in cancer predisposition is largely unknown. On one hand, because of their rarity, their population attributive risk tends to be low. On the other hand, it has been found that rare variants are more likely to have functional significance compared to common variants. In a recent publication by the Amos group, they reported that the minor allele frequency (MAF) distribution of functional variants was shifted towards rare variants compared with the variant distribution of neutral variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. They observed an inverse relationship between MAF and the proportion of functional variants, suggesting that rare variants tend to have more biological function compared to common variants. In this study, we found a rare variant in the precursor of the <italic>miR-191 </italic>gene that alters the secondary structure of the precursor miR-191, and thereby affect the expression of mature miR-191.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that the disturbance of the secondary structure of the miRNA precursor by sequence variations may affect the maturation process of miRNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, in this study, we found that the C to A variation causes a significant structure change in the stem region of the miR-191 precursor and results in the reduced production of mature miR-191. Similar findings have also been observed in our previous study in familial breast cancer and several other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We found an A to G change in <italic>pre-miR-30c-1 </italic>and a C to A change in <italic>pri-miR-17 </italic>in familial breast cancer patients who are non-carriers of known <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In further functional analysis of these two variants, we found both of them could cause conformational changes in the predicted secondary structures and, subsequently, modify the expression of mature miRNAs. The expression of mature miR-125a is decreased when a G:C match is replaced by a U:C mismatch in the stem region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, introduction of an artificial mutation to the stem of miR-30 and miR-21 precursors revealed that large bulges in the stem regions were detrimental to the production of miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Whether miR-191 plays any role in familial ovarian cancer is unknown. miR-191 is a member of the core miRNAs which are frequently misexpressed in a variety of human tumors, including, breast, ovarian, prostate, and colorectal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. So far, there is no report on why miR-191 is misexpressed and which target genes miR-191 might regulate. Using PITA algorithms, we found that miR-191 could potentially regulate several important genes which are related to familial ovarian cancer. They include <italic>MLH1</italic>, <italic>FANCC, FANCF </italic>and <italic>FANCD2</italic>. In our analysis, we found that SKOV-3 cells transfected with miR-191 expression vector had significantly lower MLH1 and FANCD2 expression (50% for MLH1 and 67% for FANCD2), compared to SKOV-3 cells transfected with empty vector. Our results provide an indirect evidence to support the target prediction. The contribution of mismatch repair (MMR) genes to familial ovarian cancer has been well-documented. A group of rare mutations in <italic>MLH1 </italic>gene contribute to familial ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The relationship between the Fanconi anemia (FA) genes (<italic>FANCC, FANCF </italic>and <italic>FANCD2</italic>) and familial ovarian cancer is intriguing. It has been reported that tissue-restricted hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents is a frequent finding in ovarian cancer patients or high risk women with no <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Ectopic expression of normal FANCD2 cDNA increased FANCD2 protein and induced MMC resistance in both hypersensitive cell lines tested, illustrating the key role of FANCD2 in the sensitivity of cross-linking agents. However, no FANCD2 coding region or promoter mutations were found, and there was no genomic loss or promoter methylation in FANCD2 in ovarian tumor tissues. This suggests that there might be other regulation mechanisms (such as miRNAs) which regulate FANCD2's expression in ovarian tissues.</p><p>One way to assess the genetic susceptibility of rare variants is to look at the inheritance of the variants in the families. In this study, we found that 5 out of a total of 13 relatives had CA genotypes and the other 8 had CC genotypes. Including the proband, three individuals who had the CA genotype were diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The relatives who had the CC genotype all appeared healthy when they were recruited. It appears that, to a certain degree, this rare variant in the precursor of <italic>miR-191 </italic>co-segregates with familial ovarian cancer, although we don't have enough families or extended family members to perform a meaningful pedigree analysis. Therefore, further screening of this rare variant in other families is necessary.</p><p>The global expression of miRNA in ovarian tumor tissues has been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For example, Zhang et al. used an array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) approach to identify miRNA loci gained/lost in ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Of 283 miRNA loci analyzed, 105 (37.1%) were determined to be significantly altered in their copy number in 93 primary ovarian tumor tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of miRNAs was consistent with the DNA copy number status for 73.1% of miRNAs, demonstrating that DNA copy number alterations may have an important effect on miRNA expression. Of interest is the loss of the <italic>miR-17-92 </italic>locus in not only ovarian tumor but also breast tumors and melanoma. In our study, we found a rare genetic variant in miR-17 gene. Although our study focuses on inherited genetic variants and miRNA expression studies focus on somatic alterations of miRNA expression, it would be interesting to look at the relationship between germline variants in miRNA genes and miRNA expression in ovarian tumor tissues.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. For example, it might be interesting to look at the links between genetic variants in <italic>miR-191 </italic>and target gene expression in matched tumor tissues. Unfortunately, the tumor tissues are not available for these patients. It would be nice to assess the relationship between these genetic variants in miRNA genes and the patients' phenotypes, such as clinical and demographic characteristics. Unfortunately, we don't have detailed information for this study population.</p><p>This is the first report to show the existence of genetic variants in selected miRNA genes in patients with familial ovarian cancer. We found that a genetic variant in the precursor of <italic>miR-191 </italic>could significantly change the secondary structures and, consequently, alter the expression of mature miRNAs. Future large population or family studies are needed to assess the contribution of miRNA variants to cancer risk as well as cancer phenotypes. Advanced <italic>in vivo </italic>molecular assays are warranted to further confirm our findings in functional analyses. Nevertheless, our data suggest that functional variants in miRNA genes might alter the expression of mature miRNAs. It opens the possibility that miRNA genes might be novel ovarian cancer predisposition genes, although this still needs to be cautiously tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JS carried out the molecular genetic studies and drafted the manuscript.
