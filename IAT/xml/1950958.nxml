Hundreds of these loci have been detected, but only a small number of the underlying causative genes have been identified. The main difficulty is the extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) in intercross progeny and the slow process of fine-scale mapping by traditional methods. Recently, new approaches have been introduced, such as association studies with inbred lines and multigenerational crosses. These approaches are very useful for interval reduction, but generally do not provide single-gene resolution because of strong LD extending over one to several megabases. Here, we investigate the genetic structure of a natural population of mice in Arizona to determine its suitability for fine-scale LD mapping and association studies. There are three main findings: (1) Arizona mice have a high level of genetic variation, which includes a large fraction of the sequence variation present in classical strains of laboratory mice; (2) they show clear evidence of local inbreeding but appear to lack stable population structure across the study area; and (3) LD decays with distance at a rate similar to human populations, which is considerably more rapid than in laboratory populations of mice. Strong associations in Arizona mice are limited primarily to markers less than 100 kb apart, which provides the possibility of fine-scale association mapping at the level of one or a few genes. Although other considerations, such as sample size requirements and marker discovery, are serious issues in the implementation of association studies, the genetic variation and LD results indicate that wild mice could provide a useful tool for identifying genes that cause variation in complex traits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) refers to the nonrandom association of variants at different sites in the genome. In recent years, LD has been of great interest in biomedical research because of its utility in &#x0201c;association studies,&#x0201d; where DNA sequence variants associated with disease traits are used to identify susceptibility genes. The resolution of this gene-finding tool depends on how the LD decays with distance between the associated sites. The pattern of LD decay is well known in human populations, where it provides high resolution on the order of one or a few genes. This paper shows that the pattern of LD in wild house mice (in contrast to laboratory mice) is very similar to that in human populations. This result means that wild mice (reared in the laboratory) could be used in association studies to identify genes that cause trait variation. Wild mouse association studies might complement those in humans by dealing with traits that are difficult to measure in humans (such as response to carcinogen exposure) and by filtering human associations for subsequent validation with genetically engineered mouse models.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Laurie CC, Nickerson DA, Anderson AD, Weir BS, Livingston RJ, et al.

The basic problem in gene identification is that most QTL have been discovered in F2 mapping populations, in which the confidence region for a QTL generally spans 20&#x02013;40 cM (containing hundreds of genes), and efficient methods for fine-mapping have not been available. The classical approach to fine-mapping is construction of congenic lines, which can take several years to achieve a resolution of 1 cM (containing about 15 genes) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In recent years, new genetic and genomic approaches have been used to reduce the time and improve the resolution of QTL mapping in mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030144-t001">Table 1</xref>).

To assess population structure and long-range LD, these mice were genotyped for a genome-wide set of 4,581 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a median distance between adjacent markers of &#x0223c;500 kb. These SNPs were ascertained in laboratory strains. In the Arizona mice, 89&#x00025; of the SNPs are polymorphic, and 67&#x00025; are &#x0201c;common&#x0201d; (i.e., minor allele frequency &#x0005b;MAF&#x0005d; &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>To assess short-range LD, we resequenced segments in four genomic regions, each on a different autosome, and each focused on a candidate gene from previous QTL studies of metabolic traits in laboratory mice (<italic>Alox15</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Apoa2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>C3ar1</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, and <italic>Nr1h3</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;). A total of 25.7 kb of sequence per mouse was obtained in segments of &#x0223c;1&#x02013;2 kb, with one segment in each gene of interest and the others at distances of 25, 100, and 200 kb away from the gene in a single direction. The observed nucleotide diversity (&#x003c0;, the average proportion of nucleotide differences between pairs of sequences) is 0.10&#x00025; in <italic>Alox15,</italic> 0.37&#x00025; in <italic>Apoa2,</italic> 0.45&#x00025; in <italic>C3ar1,</italic> and 0.09&#x00025; in <italic>Nr1h3</italic> (excluding coding sequence).

A total of 285 SNPs were discovered by resequencing the four regions in Arizona mice, and 163 of these are common (MAF &#x0003e; 0.05). In the same segments, public databases contain 63 SNPs that are polymorphic across classical inbred lines. The public databases do not contain a complete inventory of all SNPs that occur in laboratory strains, so these SNPs should be regarded as a sample.

Similarly, 67&#x00025; of the 4,581 SNPs in the genome-wide panel (ascertained in laboratory strains) are common in the Arizona population. These results suggest that roughly 50&#x00025; of the QTL found in classical line crosses will be segregating in the Arizona population, assuming that most QTL are due to SNPs (rather than structural variation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;) and that causal SNPs are distributed in the same way as other SNPs.</p><p>In a related study, T.

It has a high level of genetic variation that captures a large fraction of the polymorphisms (and presumably also the QTL) in laboratory mice. It also has a favorable pattern of LD in that strong associations are limited primarily to markers less than 100 kb apart, which provides the possibility of fine-scale association mapping at the level of one or a few genes.</p><p>Favorable patterns of genetic variation and LD are two basic requirements for useful association studies, but there are also important practical considerations such as obtaining an adequate sample size of interesting phenotypes and a sufficiently high density of SNPs to take advantage of the fine-scale LD. These are serious issues, but potentially tractable. Wild mice can be bred easily in the laboratory and phenotyped under controlled conditions, which should reduce the sample size requirements relative to human association studies. Family-based designs could be used to reduce the need to collect large numbers of mice in the wild. Furthermore, transgenic and knockout mouse technologies provide an immediate functional test within the same species for genes with putative associations, thus reducing the need for large replicate cohorts. In the short term, SNPs for association studies could be discovered in candidate genes by standard methods of resequencing. In the long term, new sequencing technologies may make this process much more efficient and less costly.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a great deal of investment in whole-genome association studies in humans, and these efforts are coming to fruition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. There are two areas in which mouse association studies could complement those in humans. (1) Recent reports of whole-genome association in humans show a small number of hits that are highly reproducible and a much larger number that are promising, but require validation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. One possibility for validation is transgenic testing in mice, but this process is time consuming and may not be appropriate when homologous genes play different physiological roles in the two species. However, a SNP&#x02013;trait association for a given gene in both humans and mice would suggest a true positive and also indicate that the trait is sensitive to variation of that gene in both species. Thus, candidate association studies in mice using human whole-genome association hits could provide an indication of whether transgenic testing in mice is likely to provide useful results. (2) Association studies in wild mice could be used for traits that cannot be measured easily in humans, such as response to carcinogen exposure, adverse effects of drugs at high dosage, susceptibility to disease agents, or gene expression in multiple tissues. Furthermore, the ability to control diet and other environmental exposures allows unbiased detection of genotype&#x02013;environment interactions. Therefore, despite the growing success of human association studies, wild mouse studies have potential for contributing to our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits of medical importance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Sample collection.</title><p>All aspects of the study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Arizona and were performed in accordance with institutional policy and National Institutes of Health guidelines governing the humane treatment of vertebrate animals.

For each model and set of mice, three to seven independent runs of the program were made, with burn-in and subsequent steps each numbering 25,000 (or, in some cases, 50,000).</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Relatedness analysis.</title><p>Degrees of inbreeding and relatedness in the mice in our study were estimated by maximum likelihood using a model that allows for inbreeding but no population structure, as described in Milligan &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, Hepler &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;, and Weir et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. This model is based on Jacquard's nine identity coefficients, &#x00394; &#x0003d; &#x00394;<sub>1</sub>,&#x02026;, &#x00394;<sub>9</sub>. Maximum likelihood estimates of the nine coefficients were obtained for each pair of individuals in our sample using an expectation&#x02013;maximization algorithm.

The data used for relatedness estimation consist of 3,928 autosomal SNPs from the genome-wide set. </p><p>We performed a simulation study in which the performance of the estimators was evaluated with a set of markers similar to those used in this study. Data were simulated via gene-dropping, with 3,928 autosomal markers having allelic frequencies that matched those observed in the Arizona mice. We obtained genetic map positions for 2,087 of the 3,928 markers directly from a map of 8,513 markers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, and the remaining positions were estimated by interpolation. Recombination frequencies for pairs of adjacent loci were obtained using Haldane's map function. In the simulations of meioses from parent to offspring, crossovers occurred along each chromosome according to a no-interference model. We simulated individuals and pairs of individuals with a variety of different levels of relatedness and inbreeding. In general, estimated kinship coefficients were within 0.063 units of the true values in 95&#x00025; of all simulated pairs of relatives. Estimated inbreeding coefficients were within 0.120 units of the true values in 95&#x00025; of all simulated individuals. Estimation was more accurate for certain situations: the estimated inbreeding coefficient was below 0.031 for 95&#x00025; of all simulated non-inbred individuals, and the estimated kinship coefficient was below 0.015 for 95&#x00025; of all simulated pairs of non-inbred unrelated individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Genome-wide LD in mouse inbred lines.</title><p>We started with the 60 classical and wild-derived inbred lines of Petkov et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, which were selected for their genetic diversity and to remove closely related &#x0201c;sibling&#x0201d; strains. Six of these lines were eliminated for lack of sufficient genotypic data (LT/SvEiJ, CAST/EiJ, MOLD/RkJ, CZECH/EiJ, SKIVE/EiJ, and PWK/PhJ). Genotypes for the remaining 54 lines were obtained from the Wellcome-CTC Mouse Strain SNP Genotype Set Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/INBREDS">http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/INBREDS</ext-link>). From a total of 12,614 SNPs that are polymorphic across the 54 lines, we selected 2,855 autosomal SNPs with six or fewer missing values to match the allelic frequency distribution (within 5&#x00025; bins) in a random subset of 54 Arizona mice, while maximizing overlap with the Arizona SNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Genome-wide LD in HS mice.</title><p>These data are from the HS QTL project &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030144-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, and genotypes were downloaded from their Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gscan.well.ox.ac.uk">http://gscan.well.ox.ac.uk</ext-link>).

These 1,940 animals belong to 85 different families. The samples of 94 or 54 animals belong to 33 or 22 families, respectively. We also analyzed a sample of 85 animals, consisting of one randomly chosen individual per family, and the LD results are very similar.

From a total of 12,112 SNPs genotyped in the HS animals, we selected a subset to match the corresponding Arizona set in terms of number and allelic frequency distribution (within 5&#x00025; bins) while maximizing overlap with the Arizona SNPs.

The two Asian samples were combined for allelic frequency and LD estimation. A SNP set was selected separately for each human group (Asian and European) to match the Arizona mouse set in terms of number, allelic frequency distribution (within 5&#x00025; bins), and chromosomal distribution (20 linkage groups, excluding human Chromosomes 20&#x02013;22), but otherwise at random. The two Asian samples were combined for LD estimation by first calculating the genotypic correlations for the Japanese and Chinese samples separately, testing for homogeneity, and then averaging the two correlations using Fisher's <italic>z</italic>-transformation. The two sets of correlations are very homogenous, since 1.1&#x00025; of the homogeneity tests are significant at the nominal level of 1&#x00025;.
