This region can be subdivided in nine parasegment-specific regulatory subunits. Recent genetic and molecular analysis has revealed the existence of two novel cis-regulatory elements Mcp and Fab-7. Mcp is located between iab-4 and iab-5, the parasegment-specific regulatory subunits which direct Abd-B in parasegments 9 and 10. Similarly, Fab-7 is located between iab-6 and iab-7, the parasegment 11 and 12-specific regulatory units. Mcp and Fab-7 appear to function as domain boundaries that separate adjacent cis-regulatory units. We report the analysis of two new Mcp mutant deletions (McpH27 and McpB116) that allow us to localize sequences essential for boundary function to a approximately 0.4 kb DNA segment. These essential sequences closely coincide to a approximately 0.3 kb nuclease hypersensitive region in chromatin. We also show that sequences contributing to the Fab-7 boundary appear to be spread over a larger stretch of DNA, but like Mcp have an unusual chromatin structure.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0286-a" xlink:role="3140"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3138"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3139"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0286.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3140"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0287.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3141"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0288.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3142"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0289.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3143"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0290.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3144"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0291.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3145"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0292.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3146"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
