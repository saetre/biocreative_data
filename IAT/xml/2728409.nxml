The dependency of methylation at H3K4 and H3K79 on the monoubiquitination of H2BK123 was recently challenged, and extragenic mutations in the strain background used for previous studies or epitope-tagged proteins were suggested to be the sources of this discrepancy. In this study, we show that H3K4 and H3K79 methylation is solely dependent on H2B monoubiquitination regardless of any additional alteration to the H2B sequence or genome. Furthermore, we report that Y131, one of the yeast histone H2A/H2B shuffle strains widely used for the last decade in the field of chromatin and transcription biology, carries a wild-type copy of each of the <italic>HTA2</italic> and <italic>HTB2</italic> genes under the <italic>GAL1/10</italic> promoter on chromosome II. Therefore, we generated the entire histone H2A and H2B alanine-scanning mutant strains in another background, which does not express wild-type histones.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>A nucleosome contains 146 bp of DNA wrapped twice around an octamer composed of two copies of each histone protein: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kornberg, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kornberg and Lorch, 1999</xref>). Nucleosomes are observed as a series of &#x0201c;beads on a string&#x0201d; via electron microscopy with the &#x0201c;beads&#x0201d; being the individual nucleosomes connected by the linker DNA, the &#x0201c;string.&#x0201d; Structural studies have demonstrated that histone N-terminal tails protrude outward from the nucleosome and can be posttranslationally modified by different enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Shilatifard, 2006</xref>).

This posttranslational modification of H3K4 by COMPASS requires prior H2BK123 (histone H2B lysine 123) monoubiquitination in yeast and H2BK120 in vertebrates, which is a process known as histone cross talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Dover et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sun and Allis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wood et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Shilatifard, 2006</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that histone H3K79 methylation by Dot1 also requires H2BK123 monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Briggs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wood et al., 2003a</xref>). Monoubiquitination of histone H2BK123 is mediated by the macromolecular complex containing the E2-conjugating enzyme Rad6 and the E3 ligase Bre1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Robzyk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wood et al., 2003a</xref>). This modification has been linked to transcriptional activation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Henry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Kao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Xiao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pavri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Shilatifard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Tanny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Studies in other eukaryotic organisms also have confirmed that this mode of regulation is well conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pavri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Smith and Shilatifard, 2009</xref>). However, a recent study performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Foster and Downs (2009)</xref> argued that monoubiquitination of H2BK123 in yeast is not the sole determinant for the methylation of H3K4 and H3K79. In their study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Foster and Downs (2009)</xref> observed the presence of both H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation in the H2BK123R mutant strain derived from an FY406 parental strain, which is contradictory to the previous findings, whereas both modifications were lost in an H2BK123R mutant derived in the Y131 background. Surprisingly, a triple KSS mutant (H2BK123R-S125A-S126A) in the FY406 background resulted in the loss of trimethylation of both H3K4 and H3K79. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Foster and Downs (2009)</xref> demonstrated that Flag-tagged H2B containing the K123R mutation (Flag-H2BK123R) abolished the trimethylation of H3K4 and H3K79, whereas untagged H2BK123R still possessed normal levels of trimethylation of both of the lysine residues in strain FY406. These observations led them to conclude that monoubiquitination of histone H2B alone is not required for the trimethylation of either H3K4 or H3K79, but that an additional &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; alteration to H2B or the mutation in the genome in combination with the K123 mutation caused the loss of histone H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation. In this study, we have addressed a possible role for the Flag tag on histone H2B in the regulation of H3K4 and H3K79 methylation. Our collective experiments have demonstrated that histone H3K4 and H3K79 methylation is solely dependent on H2B monoubiquitination and is independent of any other unknown factors or genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To further investigate the role of H2BK123 monoubiquitination in H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation and a possible role for the Flag epitope of H2B in this process, we set out to analyze the role of Flag-less H2B mutated in K123 for H3K4 and H3K79 methylation in several different strain backgrounds. We first wanted to be able to detect the presence of monoubiquitinated H2B in a Flag-less H2B background because the observation made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Foster and Downs (2009)</xref> that H3K4 trimethylation could be detected in a Flag-less H2BK123R strain could be because of the inadvertent presence of a wild-type copy of H2B. To address this, we generated polyclonal antibodies specific to monoubiquitinated H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and then shuffled a plasmid expressing H2B lacking an N-terminal Flag tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) into several different backgrounds, including Y131, FY406, DY20D, and JHY205. We analyzed the trimethylation levels of both H3K4 and H3K79 as well as the monoubiquitination of H2B in these backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Our antibody generated in this study is specific for monoubiquitinated H2B in yeast and is capable of detecting this modification in the presence or absence of a Flag tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2 A</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5 B</xref>). When this antibody was used, Flag-less wild-type H2B showed a band migrating slightly faster than that of Flag-tagged wild-type H2B as a result of the deletion of the Flag tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). However, no monoubiquitinated form of H2B was detected from K123A mutants in both Y131 and FY406 backgrounds and K123R mutants in DY20D and JHY205, regardless of the attachment of a Flag tag to H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Furthermore, we tested these strains for the methylation of histone H3K4 and H3K79 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Regardless of the presence or absence of a Flag tag on H2B, H3K4 methylation was detected in strains bearing wild-type H2B but not in strains in which H2B carries a point mutation at the K123 residue. Similar strains were generated independently in all of our laboratories, and we have each confirmed that there is no difference between Flag-tagged H2B and untagged H2B and that all of the histone modifications are consistent among the different strain backgrounds, including the FY406 background used in the study performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Foster and Downs (2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation is indeed solely dependent on H2B monoubiquitination regardless of an additional alteration to the H2B sequence or strain backgrounds.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of antibodies specific to K123-monoubiquitinated H2B.</bold> (A) Development of polyclonal antibodies specific to monoubiquitinated H2B.

The Y131 strain expressing Flag-tagged wild-type H2B under either glucose or galactose media has normal levels of H2B monoubiquitination and methylation of H3K4 and K79 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;6). To our surprise, when Flag-H2BK123R in the Y131 background was grown continuously in a galactose-containing media, the methylation of both of the H3 residues was present at levels close to those in the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;10). Because the N terminus of H2BK123R was tagged with Flag, we tested for the presence of monoubiquitination using a Flag antibody. There was no slower-migrating band in the histone H2BK123R bearing strain, indicating that there is no monoubiquitinated form of Flag-H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;10).

Black lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced out.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200906005_RGB_Fig3"/></fig><p>Because H2B monoubiquitination is required for the methylation of these lysine residues, we suspected that one of the two genomic <italic>HTB</italic> genes was not deleted in Y131 and that the genomic wild-type H2B was expressed in the K123R mutant strain in a galactose-dependent manner. We tested this possibility by using our antibody specific to monoubiquitinated histone H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In wild-type Y131 under glucose media, the Flag-tagged wild-type H2B produced only an upper band (Flag-tagged, monoubiquitinated H2B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lane 5, blue arrow). However, in wild-type Y131 under galactose media there are two bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lane 6). The upper band is Flag-tagged, monoubiquitinated histone H2B, and the lower band is Flag-less, monoubiquitinated histone H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lane 6). Similarly, the Flag-H2BK123R strain shows no H2B monoubiquitination under the glucose media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lane 7). However, the Flag-tagged H2BK123R strain grown under galactose media shows the band corresponding to Flag-less, monoubiquitinated histone H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lane 8). We have also detected the expression of wild-type H2B under the galactose condition when using H2B-specific antibodies (unpublished data). This suggests that Y131 contains a galactose-inducible version of wild-type H2B somewhere in the genome.</p><p>To understand the basis for these results between the two growth conditions, we sequenced the genomic regions around the deleted <italic>hta1-htb1</italic> (chromosome IV) and <italic>hta2-htb2</italic> (chromosome II) genes in strain Y131. We found that intact <italic>HTA2</italic> and <italic>HTB2</italic> genes were still present on chromosome II in the Y131 strains, and surprisingly, the bidirectional <italic>GAL1/10</italic> promoter was inserted between the two genes to exactly replace the bidirectional <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). The <italic>GAL10</italic> promoter drives the expression of <italic>HTA2</italic>, and <italic>GAL1</italic> drives the expression of <italic>HTB2</italic>. The presence of the <italic>GAL1/10</italic> promoter explains why wild-type H2B was expressed only under the galactose media and not under the glucose media. It remains somewhat of a mystery how <italic>GAL1/10</italic> was inserted exactly between the two genes in the first place, although the <italic>HIS3</italic> plasmid in the original Y131 strain carried a <italic>GAL1/10</italic>-regulated <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic> locus that may have been incorporated into the genome by a rare recombination event. Because Y131 is a widely used strain, mutants that affect <italic>GAL1/10</italic> transcription may not appropriately repress wild-type <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic> in glucose in this strain, and data obtained from its usage under prolonged growth in galactose conditions must be interpreted carefully. Studies using this strain to analyze effects of the H2B-K123R mutation on <italic>GAL1</italic> transcription were performed for short periods of galactose induction (2 h) when the expression of the genomic <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic> genes was not detected, and the transcription results have been recapitulated in other strain backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Xiao et al., 2005</xref>; unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>In the Y131 strain, the <italic>GAL1/10</italic> promoter is inserted between <italic>HTA2</italic> and <italic>HTB2</italic> on chromosome II.</bold> Schematic of the regions containing <italic>HTA2</italic>-<italic>HTB2</italic> genes on chromosome II. Although this region was deleted and replaced with <italic>URA3</italic> in the Y131 strain, a wild-type copy of <italic>HTA2-HTB2</italic> controlled by the <italic>GAL1/10</italic> promoter is present in this region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200906005_GS_Fig4"/></fig><p>Finally, we have now generated a histone H2A and H2B alanine mutant library in the FY406 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) in addition to the library we reported earlier in Y131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nakanishi et al., 2008</xref>), as one may wish to use this collection under galactose conditions for different genetic and biochemical screens. From our new library in FY406, we found three H2A (Y58, E62, and D91) residues and one H2B (L109) residue that are essential for viability. These data are in agreement with our previous published results in Y131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nakanishi et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, we tested our new library for H3K4 methylation and H2B monoubiquitination and identified the same residues in Y131, specifically those that regulate normal levels of H3K4 methylation in FY406, as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nakanishi et al., 2008</xref>). These residues include four residues within H2A (Glu65, Leu66, Asn69, and Asp73) and three residues within H2B (His 112, Arg119, and Lys123). This observation is consistent with our previous findings. Thus, strain differences did not cause any discordant results when grown under glucose media.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of the entire H2A/H2B alanine-scanning collection in an FY406 background.</bold> (A) The H2A/H2B alanine-scanning library was generated as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nakanishi et al., 2008</xref>). The complete removal of wild-type (WT) H2B was ensured by multiple rounds of 5-FOA selection and verified by sequencing. Each colony represents a strain expressing histones containing a single alanine substitution mutation of each of the residues of H2A and H2B. Red squares indicate the location of strains that are inviable in SD media containing 5-FOA (lethal mutants).

Therefore, we generated the entire <italic>h2a/h2b</italic> mutant collection in a background that can be readily used under galactose conditions and have now made this collection available to the entire scientific community.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of histone mutants</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in Table S1.

Each plasmid was transformed manually into yeast shuffle strains Y131, FY406, DY20D, and JHY205 using a standard yeast transformation protocol, and strains were grown on a synthetic dropout (SD) medium lacking histidine, SD-His (for Y131 and FY406 strains), or a medium lacking leucine, SD-Leu (for DY20D and JHY205 mutants). After 2 d of incubation, transformants were replica plated onto plates containing either SD-His plus 5-FOA or SD-Leu plus 5-FOA to select single-colony cells that had lost the plasmid containing the wild-type histones.

After transformation into E. cloni 10G ELITE electrocompetent cells using a 96-well electroporator, plasmids were prepared with a BioMekFX (Beckman Coulter) using the CosMCPrep kit (Agencourt). Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing using the aforementioned primers, and each plasmid was transformed into FY406 using a standard yeast transformation protocol. Transformants were selected on an SD-His medium followed by the second selection on a plate containing SD-His plus 5-FOA. To ensure the complete removal of the plasmid containing the wild-type histones, each single colony was inoculated into YPD medium plus 5-FOA in 96-well plates.
