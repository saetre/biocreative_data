To study how <italic>dp5</italic> transcription is regulated by NGF withdrawal we cloned the regulatory regions of the rat <italic>dp5</italic> gene and constructed a series of <italic>dp5</italic>-luciferase reporter plasmids. In microinjection experiments with sympathetic neurons we found that three regions of <italic>dp5</italic> contribute to its induction after NGF withdrawal: the promoter, a conserved region in the single intron, and sequences in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of the <italic>dp5</italic> mRNA. A construct containing all three regions is efficiently activated by NGF withdrawal and, like the endogenous <italic>dp5</italic>, its induction requires mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. JNKs phosphorylate the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun, and thereby increase its activity. We identified a conserved ATF site in the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter that binds c-Jun and ATF2, which is critical for <italic>dp5</italic> promoter induction after NGF withdrawal. These results suggest that part of the mechanism by which the MLK-JNK-c-Jun pathway promotes neuronal apoptosis is by activating the transcription of the <italic>dp5</italic> gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Apoptosis occurs extensively during the normal development of the mammalian nervous system, and is important for establishing neuronal populations of the correct size and for eliminating neurons that have made inappropriate connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Developing sympathetic neurons depend on nerve growth factor, synthesized by their target tissues, for survival. In the absence of nerve growth factor (NGF), these cells die by apoptosis and their death requires <italic>de novo</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Sympathetic neurons have been widely used for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of the molecular mechanisms of neuronal apoptosis and a considerable amount has been learned about the signalling pathways that regulate the cell death programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Following NGF withdrawal, the stress-responsive mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein kinase cascade is activated and JNKs phosphorylate the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun, which increases c-Jun activity and c-Jun expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">6&#x02013;10</xref>). The MLK-JNK-c-Jun pathway is required for normal NGF withdrawal-induced death and promotes the release of mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">11&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>The release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and other proapoptotic proteins from mitochondria is regulated by the Bcl-2 protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In sympathetic neurons, the multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax is essential for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release and cell death after NGF deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In contrast, the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, which can form heterodimers with Bax, inhibit cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release and protect against NGF withdrawal-induced death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). Finally, several proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family members are expressed in sympathetic neurons and three of these are regulated by NGF withdrawal: the <italic>dp5</italic>, <italic>bim</italic> and <italic>puma</italic> mRNAs and proteins increase in level after NGF deprivation, in all cases before the cell death commitment point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24">21&#x02013;24</xref>). These BH3-only proteins may promote sympathetic neuron apoptosis by binding to the antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, which would then be unable to interact with Bax, or possibly by directly binding to and activating Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>The BH3-only proteins that increase in level after NGF withdrawal are downstream targets of the MLK-JNK-c-Jun pathway. Expression of a c-Jun dominant negative mutant (Jun&#x00394;169) or the <italic>JunAA</italic> knock-in mutation in mice, which eliminates the two major JNK phosphorylation sites in c-Jun, reduce the increase in <italic>bim</italic> RNA and protein levels after NGF withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In addition, the MLK inhibitor CEP-1347, which prevents JNK activation, also reduces the increase in <italic>bim</italic> and <italic>dp5</italic> mRNA levels after NGF deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). To understand in general how JNKs and AP-1 transcription factors promote neuronal apoptosis it is important to determine the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins regulate Bim and Dp5 expression and NGF-dependent sympathetic neurons have been a useful model for these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Here, we use a <italic>dp5</italic> reporter gene assay, expression vectors for JNK and AP-1 inhibitor proteins, specific chemical inhibitors, and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate how NGF withdrawal activates <italic>dp5</italic> transcription in sympathetic neurons. We show that an ATF-binding site in the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter, closely related in sequence to the jun1 and jun2 TRE elements in the <italic>c-jun</italic> promoter, can bind c-Jun and ATF2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in chromatin, and is critical for <italic>dp5</italic> promoter activity in sympathetic neurons and for promoter induction following NGF withdrawal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>5&#x02032; RACE and cloning of the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter</title><p>5&#x02032; rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed on rat brain mRNA using the Marathon&#x02122; cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) with the <italic>dp5</italic>-specific primer 5&#x02032;-CTGCAGCCGCAGCGCGGTCACC-3&#x02032;. To isolate the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter, the 5&#x02032; RACE product was used as a probe to screen the rat P1 artifical chromosome (PAC) library RPCI31 (generated by P.Y. Woon and P. de Jong, UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre, Cambridge, UK). A 4-kb fragment from upstream of exon 1 was cloned and the remaining promoter sequence between the start codon and upstream 4&#x02009;kb fragment was generated by PCR. These sequences were ligated at an EcoRI restriction site to generate a 4.5&#x02009;kb fragment in pGEM&#x000ae;-T Easy (Promega UK Ltd, Southampton, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The <italic>dp5</italic> reporter construct <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC was generated by subcloning a 1017&#x02009;bp fragment containing the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter sequence from &#x02212;980 to +37, relative to the transcriptional start site, into pGL3-basic (Promega UK Ltd.), upstream of the luciferase gene. To obtain a reporter construct also containing part of the <italic>dp5</italic> intron (<italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;I 400), a 395&#x02009;bp region of the intron that is highly conserved was subcloned into <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC downstream of the SV40 polyadenylation termination sequence. The construct <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;3&#x02032; UTR was made by subcloning three fragments (a 645&#x02009;bp fragment containing the <italic>dp5</italic> stop codon, a 2.36&#x02009;kb fragment and a 2.02&#x02009;kb fragment) that spanned the entire <italic>dp5</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR into <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC downstream of the luciferase gene. <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALL was generated by subcloning the 395&#x02009;bp intron fragment into <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;3&#x02032; UTR. For all constructs, fragment orientation and positioning was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing.</p><p>Point mutations within the ATF-binding site in the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter were introduced into <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALL using the QuikChange<sup>TM</sup> II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and the oligonucleotides 5&#x02032;-CCCGGGCCGGATAACGTCTCCCCCTCCCCGCG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CGCGGGGAGGGGGAGACGTTATCCGGCCCGGG-3&#x02032; containing four point mutations.

Unless stated otherwise, SCG medium was supplemented immediately prior to use with 2.5&#x02009;S NGF (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Hornby, Ontario) at 50&#x02009;ng/ml and the antimitotic agents fluorodeoxyuridine and uridine (both from Sigma-Aldrich) each at 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;M. Sympathetic neurons were plated on 13&#x02009;mm diameter glass coverslips coated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine and laminin placed in 3.5&#x02009;cm dishes. Cells were maintained in 2&#x02009;ml of medium at 37&#x000b0;C in 10% CO<sub>2</sub> for 5&#x02013;7 days before being used for experiments. In NGF withdrawal experiments, the growth medium was removed and the cells were gently rinsed twice with SCG medium lacking NGF and antimitotic agents. The neurons were then refed with fresh medium containing NGF or a neutralising anti-NGF antibody (Chemicon Europe Ltd, Chandlers Ford, UK) at 100&#x02009;ng/ml. The MLK3 inhibitor CEP-11004 (provided by Cephalon, Inc., West Chester, PA) was dissolved in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 400&#x02009;nM.</p><p>The PC6-3 subline of the PC12 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen Ltd.) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FCS, 2&#x02009;mM glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and passaged once a week.

In NGF withdrawal experiments, the neuronally differentiated PC6-3 cells were rinsed twice with differentiation medium lacking NGF and then refed with medium containing NGF or anti-NGF antibody, as required.</p></sec><sec><title>Microinjection and dual luciferase assay</title><p>Sympathetic neurons were microinjected as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The different reporter constructs and expression vectors were injected at the concentrations indicated (see Results). The injection mix contained the DNA to be tested in 0.5&#x000d7; PBS (&#x02013;Ca<sup>2+</sup>, &#x02013;Mg<sup>2+</sup>) (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;ng/&#x000b5;l of the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase construct pRL-TK (Promega) to control for variations in the volume of DNA or number of cells injected per coverslip. The DNA was injected directly into the nucleus and at least 120 neurons were injected for each condition tested. Typically 50&#x02013;80% of the neurons survived injection.</p><p>At 16&#x02013;24&#x02009;h after injection, the neurons were harvested and luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Neurons were rinsed off the coverslips in ice-cold PBS and were collected by centrifugation before being lysed in 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of passive lysis buffer. The luciferase assay was then performed using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer following the protocol provided with the assay system. The output for firefly luciferase was normalized to the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase output (firefly luciferase output divided by <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase output). The relative induction of each construct was then calculated (for example, normalized luciferase activity in the absence of NGF divided by normalized luciferase activity in the presence of NGF). Each experiment was performed at least three times using different neuron preparations and the standard error of the mean was calculated.</p><p>For antibody co-injection experiments, the c-Jun (H-79) X and ATF2 (C-19) X rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were diluted in PBS (&#x02212;Ca<sup>2+</sup>, &#x02212;Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and centrifuged in Microcon YM-3 centrifugal filters (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) to remove sodium azide. The final antibody concentration was adjusted to 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/&#x000b5;l. Purified rabbit immunoglobulin in PBS (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used as a control.

Following NGF deprivation, both constructs containing the 1&#x02009;kb <italic>dp5</italic> promoter and either the conserved intron region or the 3&#x02032; UTR sequence showed higher levels of luciferase activity than the construct with the promoter alone, with induction factors of 3.61- and 3.23-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c).

We investigated the effect of CEP-11004 (at 400&#x02009;nM) on the level of c-Jun and ATF2 and c-Jun and ATF2 phosphorylation in sympathetic neurons cultured in the presence or absence of NGF for 16 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), c-Jun protein levels and c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation increased after NGF withdrawal. The increased phosphorylation was associated with a decrease in the mobility of c-Jun in SDS PAGE. These changes were reversed by CEP-11004. Similarly, phosphorylation of c-Jun at serine 63 and serine 73 was significantly increased after NGF withdrawal and this increase was inhibited by CEP-11004. In contrast, ATF2 protein levels did not change after NGF withdrawal and phosphorylation of ATF2 at threonine 71 was only marginally increased at 16&#x02009;h after the removal of NGF, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). To determine whether CEP-11004 had the same effect on <italic>dp5</italic> expression as CEP-1347, we treated sympathetic neurons with CEP-11004 at 400&#x02009;nM in the presence or absence of NGF for 16&#x02009;h and then isolated RNA and measured <italic>dp5</italic> mRNA levels by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>b).

As a control, we tested the binding of these AP-1 proteins to two well characterized binding sites, the <italic>collagenase</italic> TRE (a consensus AP-1 site) and the jun2 TRE (an ATF site) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). It has been reported that c-Jun homodimers have a very low affinity for both of these sites whereas c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers bind with high affinity to the <italic>collagenase</italic> TRE, and c-Jun/ATF2 heterodimers bind with high affinity to the jun2 TRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In agreement with these results, we observed a c-Jun/c-Fos/DNA complex, but no binding of c-Jun or c-Fos alone, with the <italic>collagenase</italic> TRE (lanes 1&#x02013;4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c), and a c-Jun/ATF2/DNA complex, but no binding of c-Jun alone, with the jun 2 TRE (lanes 5&#x02013;8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). We then tested the binding of the AP-1 proteins to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site (lanes 9&#x02013;14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). Neither c-Jun nor c-Fos alone bound to the <italic>dp5</italic> sequence but c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers bound with a low affinity (compare lane 11 with lane 3). In contrast, c-Jun/ATF2 heterodimers and ATF2 homodimers bound the <italic>dp5</italic> site with an affinity similar to the affinity of c-Jun/ATF2 for the jun2 TRE (compare lanes 12 and 13 with lane 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c).

Extracts from neurons maintained in the presence of NGF contained proteins that bound to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site (lane 2) and this binding (marked AP-1) was abolished by point mutations in the ATF site (lanes 5 and 6). After NGF withdrawal, a similar amount of specific AP-1-binding activity was observed but the pattern of bands was slightly different (compare lanes 2 and 3). To determine whether the specific protein complexes contained c-Jun and ATF2 we added antibodies specific for c-Jun or ATF2 or a Bim antibody, as a negative control, to the binding reactions. The Bim antibody did not alter the binding pattern observed with the &#x02013;NGF extract (compare lanes 7 and 8) whereas the c-Jun antibody supershifted some of the AP-1 complexes (lane 9). Phosphorimaging and quantitation revealed that the c-Jun antibody supershifted 45% of the AP-1/<italic>dp5</italic> complexes. Addition of the ATF2 antibody did not cause a clear supershift but did displace 42% of the AP-1/<italic>dp5</italic> complexes (compare lanes 10 and 7) and addition of both the c-Jun and ATF2 antibodies together supershifted 71% of the specific protein complexes bound to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site (compare lanes 11 and 7). We also performed an EMSA experiment in which we tested the effect of phospho-c-Jun (serine 63) and phospho-ATF2 (threonine 71) antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). With the &#x02013;NGF extract the phospho-c-Jun antibody supershifted the majority of the AP-1 proteins bound to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site (compare lane 15 to lanes 14 and 13). We confirmed that this was a supershift by measuring the distribution of peaks in a vertical line through the &#x02013;NGF lanes in a phosphorimage of the gel shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b. The AP-1 proteins were clearly displaced towards the top of the gel in lane 15 compared to lanes 14 and 13. In contrast, the phospho-ATF2 antibody only supershifted a small fraction of the <italic>dp5</italic>/AP-1 complex (compare lane 16 to lanes 14 and 13). These results demonstrate that after NGF withdrawal the c-Jun in sympathetic neuron extracts that binds to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site <italic>in vitro</italic> is phosphorylated at serine 63. In the case of ATF2, a smaller fraction of the AP-1 complex bound to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site is phosphorylated at threonine 71. We then compared the amount of phospho-c-Jun supershifted in DNA-binding assays performed with +NGF and &#x02013;NGF extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). Phosphorimaging and quantitation of the supershifted complex in lanes 19 and 20 revealed that the amount of c-Jun phosphorylated at serine 63 was 2-fold greater at 16&#x02009;h after NGF withdrawal. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>c-Jun and ATF2 in sympathetic neuron extracts bind to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Since large numbers of cells are required for conventional ChIP assays we used neuronally differentiated PC12 cells that had been cultured in the presence or absence of NGF for 16&#x02009;h, rather than sympathetic neurons. The binding of c-Jun or ATF2 to the <italic>c-jun</italic> and <italic>dp5</italic> promoters was studied by PCR using primers that flank the jun1 and jun2 TREs (a positive control) or the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a). The control antibody (Bim) did not immunoprecipitate either the <italic>c-jun</italic> or <italic>dp5</italic> promoter (lanes 3 and 4), whereas both the c-Jun and ATF2 antibodies precipitated the region of the <italic>c-jun</italic> promoter that contains the jun1 and jun2 TREs and the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter region that contains the ATF site (lanes 5&#x02013;8). These results indicate that c-Jun and ATF2 can bind to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site in living cells. In the case of both <italic>c-jun</italic> and <italic>dp5</italic> the amount of c-Jun or ATF2 bound to the promoter had not increased significantly at 16&#x02009;h after NGF withdrawal. These results are in agreement with previous studies that showed that the jun1 and jun2 TREs in the <italic>c-jun</italic> promoter are already bound by c-Jun and ATF2-containing complexes in a variety of unstimulated cells in culture and that the protein-DNA contacts are unchanged during gene activation by TPA and UV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Using an antibody specific for c-Jun phosphorylated at serine 63 we also investigated whether the amount of phospho-c-Jun associated with the <italic>c-jun</italic> and <italic>dp5</italic> promoters increased after NGF withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b). We found that the c-Jun bound to the <italic>c-jun</italic> promoter was phosphorylated at serine 63 and that this increased in level after NGF withdrawal (lanes 14 and 15). Similarly, we also observed that there was increase in the amount of phospho-c-Jun associated with the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter at 16&#x02009;h after NGF deprivation. In the case of both promoters, we found that phosphorylation of ATF2 at threonine 71 had not increased at 16&#x02009;h after NGF withdrawal (data not shown), consistent with the results of the immunoblotting experiments with sympathetic neuron extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>c-Jun and ATF2 bind to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site in the chromatin of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells.

The neuronally differentiated cells were then refed with fresh differentiation medium containing NGF (+N) or anti-NGF antibody (&#x02212;N).

The mutations in the ATF site in the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter completely obliterated its induction after NGF withdrawal by (i) decreasing the basal activity of the construct by 86% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a), and (ii) by reducing the induction factor after NGF withdrawal from 7.08- to 3.05-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>b). This demonstrates that abolishing the binding of c-Jun and ATF2 to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site not only reduces the induction of <italic>dp5</italic> expression following NGF withdrawal but also decreases basal promoter activity. Finally, we investigated the effect of the MLK inhibitor CEP-11004 (at 400&#x02009;nM) on the activity of the mutant construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>c). CEP-11004 did not significantly reduce the 3-fold increase in the activity of the reporter with mutated ATF site that occurs after NGF withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>c).

When c-Jun was mixed with ATF2, c-Jun/ATF2 heterodimers formed a protein/DNA complex that ran just below the ATF2/DNA complex (compare lanes 6 and 5). Jun&#x00394;169 also formed heterodimers with ATF2 that could bind to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site (lane 7). However, when the m0 leucine zipper mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), which blocks binding to ATF2, was present in Jun&#x00394;169 (&#x00394;169m0), the dominant negative c-Jun/ATF2/DNA complex was no longer observed (lane 8). Thus, Jun&#x00394;169 can only bind to the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site as a heterodimer with ATF2.

In an immunoblotting experiment with protein extracts prepared from uninfected sympathetic neurons and adenovirus-infected cells we confirmed that AdvJun&#x00394;169 and AdvlacZ express recombinant proteins with the predicted molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>c). We then tested the effect of the two adenoviruses on the level of <italic>dp5</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>d and e). Sympathetic neurons were cultured for 5 days <italic>in vitro</italic> and then infected overnight with the Jun&#x00394;169 or &#x003b2;-galactosidase adenovirus at MOIs that led to expression of the recombinant proteins in &#x0223c;50% of the infected neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). After infection, the cells were refed with +NGF medium and &#x0223c;24&#x02009;h later were rinsed and maintained in medium containing NGF or a neutralising anti-NGF antibody for 16&#x02009;h. RNA was then isolated and semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR was performed to measure <italic>dp5</italic> and <italic>nfm</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>d). Expression of Jun&#x00394;169 did not alter the level of the <italic>nfm</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>d). In the case of sympathetic neurons infected with AdvlacZ, the <italic>dp5</italic> mRNA increased 6.02-fold after NGF withdrawal, but in cells infected with AdvJun&#x00394;169 the induction was reduced to 2.34-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>e). This result suggests that in sympathetic neurons AP-1 activity contributes to the induction of the endogenous <italic>dp5</italic> mRNA following NGF withdrawal.</p><p>Microinjection of an antibody against c-Jun, but not Jun B or Jun D antibodies or control IgG, has been shown to inhibit the NGF withdrawal-induced death of sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). To study the individual contributions of c-Jun and ATF2 to the activation of <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALL after NGF withdrawal we therefore carried out an antibody co-injection experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>a). The <italic>dp5</italic> reporter construct was injected into the nuclei of sympathetic neurons together with control rabbit immunoglobulin or the c-Jun or ATF2 antibodies that had been used for chromatin immunoprecipitation. With the control antibody, <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALL was activated 5.3-fold on average after NGF withdrawal whereas co-injection of the c-Jun or ATF2 antibodies reduced the induction factor to 2.83- or 2.47-fold, respectively. At the concentration tested, neither of these antibodies affected basal promoter activity in the presence of NGF. Importantly, the c-Jun and ATF2 antibodies did not affect the activation of pCRE-Luc, a CREB reporter construct, when CPTcAMP, a membrane permeable cAMP analogue, was added to the cells to activate protein kinase A and CREB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>b). <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Co-injection of antibodies specific for c-Jun or ATF2 reduces the induction of a <italic>dp5</italic> reporter gene after NGF withdrawal.

These results suggest that following NGF withdrawal both c-Jun and ATF2 contribute to the activation of the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter in <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC+ALL and that the JNK phosphorylation sites in c-Jun are necessary for full induction of the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In sympathetic neurons the level of the <italic>dp5</italic> RNA increases substantially after NGF withdrawal, and this depends on the MLK-JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Here, we have investigated the mechanism by which this protein kinase cascade regulates <italic>dp5</italic> expression, and propose a model by which this occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). To identify regulatory sequences in the <italic>dp5</italic> gene we made reporter constructs containing different regions of <italic>dp5</italic> linked to luciferase. In microinjection experiments with sympathetic neurons, we found that constructs containing 1&#x02009;kb of promoter sequence alone or with a short sequence from the intron and/or the whole 3&#x02032; UTR were all activated following NGF deprivation. The highest level of induction was observed when all three regions were present together in the <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC+ALL construct. The increase in <italic>dp5</italic> RNA level after NGF deprivation was reduced by treating cells with the MLK inhibitor CEP-11004, confirming the results of Harris and Johnson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), who used the related compound CEP-1347. Not only did CEP-11004 decrease <italic>dp5</italic> expression after NGF withdrawal, but it also reduced the induction of a <italic>dp5</italic> luciferase reporter plasmid, suggesting that this construct behaves in a similar manner to the endogenous <italic>dp5</italic> gene. We also co-injected sympathetic neurons with the <italic>dp5</italic> reporter construct and an expression vector for the JIP-1 JBD. This JNK inhibitor protein strongly reduced the induction of <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALL after NGF withdrawal, suggesting that the activation of <italic>dp5</italic> transcription by MLKs is mediated by JNKs. <fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Proposed model showing the mechanism by which the JNK pathway contributes to increased expression of Dp5 after NGF withdrawal. Following NGF withdrawal, the MLK-MKK4/7-JNK pathway is activated leading to an increase in JNK activity and increased phosphorylation and increased expression of the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun, which can form heterodimers with ATF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13">6&#x02013;13</xref>). The <italic>dp5</italic> promoter contains a conserved ATF-binding site (5&#x02032;-TGATGTAA-3&#x02032;), which is bound by c-Jun and ATF2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in chromatin. These AP-1 proteins contribute to increased transcription of the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter after NGF withdrawal, which depends on JNK and AP-1 activity. Mutation of the ATF site, expression of Jun&#x00394;169 or the JIP1-JBD, or treatment of sympathetic neurons with the MLK inhibitor CEP-11&#x02031;004 all reduce induction of the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter after NGF withdrawal. Together with the other BH3-only proteins induced by NGF withdrawal (Bim<sub>EL</sub> and Puma) the Dp5 protein may promote cell death by binding to antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp175f10"/></fig></p><p>We identified a conserved ATF-binding site in the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter that is similar to the jun2 TRE in the <italic>c-jun</italic> promoter. We showed that this site is able to bind c-Jun and ATF2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in chromatin, and to study its role in the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter we mutated it in a <italic>dp5</italic> reporter construct so as to abolish AP-1 binding. This reduced the induction of the reporter plasmid after NGF withdrawal and significantly reduced basal promoter activity suggesting that this site is an important <italic>dp5</italic> promoter element. In sympathetic neurons cultured in the presence of NGF, the <italic>dp5</italic> ATF site may contribute to basal promoter activity by binding c-Jun/ATF2 heterodimers. After NGF withdrawal, the level of active, phosphorylated c-Jun present in the nucleus increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and this would lead to an increase in the activity of c-Jun/ATF2 heterodimers, which could contribute to the induction of <italic>dp5</italic> transcription.</p><p>To further study the role of AP-1 in the induction of <italic>dp5</italic> transcription we tested the effect of overexpressing a c-Jun dominant negative mutant, Jun&#x00394;169, that can form heterodimers with ATF2 and bind to ATF sites, but which lacks the first 168 amino acids of c-Jun including the N-terminal transactivation domain, the JNK docking site and the JNK phosphorylation sites. We found that Jun&#x00394;169 reduced the induction of a <italic>dp5</italic> reporter construct and also decreased endogenous <italic>dp5</italic> RNA and protein levels after NGF withdrawal suggesting that <italic>dp5</italic> is an AP-1 target gene and that the MLK-JNK pathway activates <italic>dp5</italic> transcription via the ATF site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). In addition, co-microinjection of either a c-Jun or ATF2 antibody together with <italic>dp5</italic>-LUC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALL reduced the activation of the reporter construct after NGF withdrawal suggesting that both c-Jun and ATF2 contribute to the activation of the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The expression of Dp5 increases in a range of neural cell types following injury, stress or survival factor withdrawal, and several studies suggest that JNK may regulate Dp5 levels in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli. <italic>dp5</italic> mRNA levels increase in cultured rat cortical neurons following treatment with &#x003b2;-amyloid peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) and this increase can be blocked by CEP-1347 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Work carried out with oligodendrocytes also suggests that the &#x003b2;-amyloid-induced upregulation of <italic>dp5</italic> and cell death is mediated by the JNK pathway since treatment with &#x003b2;-amyloid peptide increased JNK phosphorylation and AP-1 DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Recently, Ma <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) reported that expression of shRNAs against <italic>dp5</italic> can partially protect rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) against apoptosis induced by KCl deprivation. In addition, these authors also demonstrated that the ATF site in the <italic>dp5</italic> promoter is bound by c-Jun in CGNs and important for <italic>dp5</italic> promoter activation following survival signal withdrawal, in agreement with the results reported here.</p><p>Since the discovery that NGF withdrawal-induced death requires <italic>de novo</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) our understanding of the events that occur in sympathetic neurons following NGF deprivation has greatly increased and a number of the genes involved in this process have been identified. The MLK-JNK-c-Jun pathway is one of the important proapoptotic signalling pathways activated after NGF withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). Activation of the MLK-JNK pathway leads to the phosphorylation of c-Jun bound to the <italic>c-jun</italic> promoter, which increases the rate of transcription of the <italic>c-jun</italic> gene and increases the level of c-Jun, an important JNK substrate which is required for the normal NGF withdrawal-induced death of sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). c-Jun contributes to the increased expression of the BH3-only proteins Bim<sub>EL</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and Dp5 (43, and this study), which together with Puma, bind to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation. In addition, JNKs can regulate Bim<sub>EL</sub> at the post-translational level by phosphorylating serine 65 and potentiating its proapoptotic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Therefore in the future it will be important to identify other transcriptional targets of the JNK pathway as well as further investigate the post-translational effects of JNK phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Wellcome Trust (Senior Research Fellowship in Basic Biomedical Science 057700 to J.H.).
