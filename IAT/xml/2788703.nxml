Recent reports have identified a previously uncharacterized transmembrane protein, tetherin/CD317/BST-2, as a crucial host restriction factor that acts during a late budding step in HIV-1 replication by inhibiting viral particle release. Although tetherin has been shown to promote the retention of nascent viral particles on the host cell surface, the precise molecular mechanisms that occur during and after these tethering events remain largely unknown. We here report that a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, BCA2 (Breast cancer-associated gene 2; also called Rabring7, ZNF364 or RNF115), is a novel tetherin-interacting host protein that facilitates the restriction of HIV-1 particle production in tetherin-positive cells. The expression of human BCA2 in &#x0201c;tetherin-positive&#x0201d; HeLa, but not in &#x0201c;tetherin-negative&#x0201d; HOS cells, resulted in a strong restriction of HIV-1 particle production. Upon the expression of tetherin in HOS cells, BCA2 was capable of inhibiting viral particle production as in HeLa cells. The targeted depletion of endogenous BCA2 by RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells reduced the intracellular accumulation of viral particles, which were nevertheless retained on the plasma membrane. BCA2 was also found to facilitate the internalization of HIV-1 virions into CD63<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> intracellular vesicles leading to their lysosomal degradation. These results indicate that BCA2 accelerates the internalization and degradation of viral particles following their tethering to the cell surface and is a co-factor or enhancer for the tetherin-dependent restriction of HIV-1 release from infected cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Human cells possess multiple systems that render them resistant to viral infection. Recently, a transmembrane protein, tetherin, has been identified as an antiviral host factor in HIV-1-infected cells. Tetherin retains newly assembled virions at the plasma membrane and prevents viral release from the infected cells. However, the precise molecular mechanisms following the virion tethering remain largely unknown. In our current study, we have identified a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, BCA2, which co-localizes and interacts with tetherin in human cells. BCA2 was found to facilitate the internalization of HIV-1 particles captured by tetherin on the plasma membrane and to enhance the targeting of viral particles to the lysosomes. Conversely, the targeted depletion of endogenous BCA2 reduces the intracellular accumulation of viral particles. Additionally, the expression of a small viral protein Vpu, an antagonist of tetherin, counteracts the antiviral effects of BCA2. These results suggest that BCA2 is a potential antiviral factor that collaborates with tetherin to facilitate the degradation of nascent HIV-1 particles during &#x0201c;post-tethering&#x0201d; processes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exploits the host cell machinery to maximize viral particle production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Goff1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

To delineate the molecular determinants that regulate this process, we attempted to identify the Rab family member or its effector proteins that functionally interact with tetherin. As our initial screening test, we performed immunoprecipitation and GST-pull down analyses to examine the interaction of approximately 60 Rab family proteins with either tetherin or HIV-1 Gag protein. These in vitro interaction assays revealed that a Rab7-interacting protein, BCA2, could interact with tetherin (data not shown). To further confirm this interaction, we performed GST-pull down analysis with recombinant GST-BCA2. 293T cells were transfected with either N-terminal Myc-epitope-tagged wild-type tetherin or its deletion mutant devoid of the cytoplasmic tail domain (tetherin&#x00394;1&#x02013;20). Cell lysates were then subjected to GST-pull down analysis with either GST alone or GST-BCA2.

To investigate which of these is involved in the interaction with tetherin, we constructed BCA2 derivatives lacking these domains for use in immunoprecipitation analysis. Our results demonstrated that Myc-tetherin is efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with the full length BCA2, the N-terminal truncation mutant, BCA2&#x00394;N (148&#x02013;305 aa) or the RING domain deleted mutant, BCA2&#x00394;RING (1&#x02013;227 aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

These results suggest that tetherin can interact with the middle portion of BCA2 (147&#x02013;227 aa) located between the Rab-interacting domain and RING finger domain.

Together with our finding that BCA2 can restrict HIV-1 particle production only in tetherin-expressing cells, these data indicate that the function of tetherin, which is antagonized by Vpu, is likely required for the BCA2-mediated restriction of HIV-1 particle production.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that BCA2 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity which is essential for the downregulation of EGFR expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Sakane1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore examined whether this activity is necessary for the anti-viral effects of BCA2. We created a RING finger-defective mutant BCA2 (C228A/C231A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Amemiya1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and investigated its effect upon virus particle production. Although a tetherin-interacting motif defective BCA2 mutant (BCA2&#x00394;C) failed to restrict viral particle production, both WT and C228A/C231A BCA2 were capable of doing so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Moreover, the effect of C228A/C231A BCA2 mutant was modest increase than that of WT BCA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), probably due to the inhibition of both auto-ubiquitination and following degradation of this mutant as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Sakane1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicate that the ubiquitin ligase activity of BCA2 is dispensable for its function in the restriction of virus particle formation.</p><p>To next investigate the effects of BCA2 upon virus particle restriction in T cells, we created Jurkat cells stably expressing untagged BCA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). FACS analysis with a tetherin antibody revealed that these cells indeed express tetherin on their cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000700.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). The cells were then infected with either HIV-1<sub>NL4&#x02013;3</sub> or HIV-1<sub>NL4&#x02013;3</sub>&#x00394;<sub>Vpu</sub> at a low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05). In agreement with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Strebel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that Vpu-deleted virus replicated slightly less efficiently than WT-virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Our results showed that BCA2 expression reduces HIV-1 particle production in both WT- and &#x00394;Vpu-virus infected cells, although this effect was more prominent in cells infected with &#x00394;Vpu-virus (about 4-fold) than with WT-virus (about 2-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Interestingly, immunoblotting analysis revealed that the expression levels of endogenous BCA2 in HeLa and Jurkat cells were relatively lower than in HOS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000700.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>), implying that exogenous BCA2 expression would tend to impact virus particle restriction in these cells in the presence of functional tetherin.</p><p>To delineate the molecular mechanism by which BCA2 suppresses virus production, we performed immunoblotting analysis with a p24 antibody. Interestingly, the expression of BCA2 in HeLa cells significantly reduced the Gag protein levels, particularly cell-associated p24, but had no effect upon the expression of Vpu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>).

Of note, the BCA2-induced depletion of cell-associated p24 in the absence of Vpu was more prominent than in the presence of Vpu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). These data together suggest that BCA2 may enhance the degradation of nascent HIV-1 virions captured by tetherin on the plasma membrane.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that BCA2 affects the expression of HIV-1 proteins, we next performed pulse-chase analysis with pNL4-3&#x00394;Vpu-transfected HeLa cells. Our results demonstrated that BCA2 expression induces the rapid degradation of the HIV-1 Gag protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). Consistent with our immunoblotting data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>), the degradation of p24 was shown to be more prominent than that of Pr55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000700-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). Furthermore, our RT-PCR analysis revealed that BCA2 expression does not significantly affect the mRNA levels of HIV-1 Gag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000700.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).

This internalization and degradation of cell surface-retained virions may represent rate limiting steps in the tetherin-mediated restriction of viral release that are accelerated by BCA2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In our current study, we identify BCA2 as a functional tetherin-interacting protein. Although BCA2 is widely expressed in various cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Mizuno1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Burger1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, its antiviral effects have been observed only in cells expressing tetherin, suggesting that BCA2 cooperates with tetherin to achieve efficient restriction of viral particle production. BCA2 was found in our current analyses to play a crucial role in the internalization and degradation of nascent HIV-1 virions, following their tethering to the host cell plasma membrane. These internalization and degradation steps may be rate limiting during restriction by tetherin because the targeted depletion of BCA2 can shift the distribution of Gag to the plasma membrane and can partly overcome the release inhibition of Vpu-minus virions in HeLa cells.</p><p>Importantly in this regard, BCA2 directs HIV-1 particles to CD63<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> endosomes or lysosomes for degradation. The molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved have not yet been fully characterized. However, previous studies have demonstrated that BCA2 directly binds a small G protein, Rab7, and thereby plays crucial roles in vesicle trafficking to the late endosomes or lysosomes, in addition to lysosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Mizuno1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Burger2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, the aberrant expression of BCA2 not only affects epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR) degradation, but also induces the perinuclear aggregation of lysosomes and increased acidity within lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Mizuno1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Sakane1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Given our current data, these results indicate that BCA2 coordinates the trafficking of intracellular vesicles containing internalized viral particles to the lysosomes in conjunction with Rab7, resulting in the effective degradation of these virions. Consistently, in tetherin-positive HeLa cells, Gag protein has been shown to co-localize with the GTP-bound active form of Rab7 in the absence of Vpu (our unpublished observation). Furthermore, a dominant negative mutant of Rab5 can inhibit the internalization of nascent HIV-1 particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000700-Neil3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings raise the possibility that plasma membrane-tethered virions may go through a Rab5- and/or Rab7-dependent endocytotic pathway from the cell surface to the endosomes or lysosomes and eventual degradation. Notably, our immunoprecipitation data indicate that BCA2 interacts with tetherin at a region distinct from the Rab7 binding site. Consistently, an N-terminal truncation mutant of BCA2 can still interact with tetherin. These results suggest that BCA2 may simultaneously interact with Rab7 and tetherin at distinct regions and might therefore act as a physical scaffolding protein between these two proteins. During endocytosis, tetherin-BCA2 complexes might therefore recruit Rab7 to vesicles containing virions.</p><p>Although the function of BCA2 during HIV-1 restriction is likely to be dependent on tetherin, the antiviral effects of BCA2 were found to be still active against Vpu-positive viruses. However, the overexpression of Vpu can abrogate the antiviral effects of BCA2, indicating a potentially stoichiometric relationship between BCA2 and Vpu during BCA2-mediated viral restriction. Importantly, our current results suggest that BCA2 is not involved in regulating the expression of Vpu. However, it is possible that BCA2 antagonizes the function of Vpu in counteracting tetherin, although further analysis is needed to address this question.</p><p>Our current results additionally demonstrate that the effects of BCA2 depletion on particle production are about two-fold, which is a relatively modest impact compared with the 5-to-10-fold effects of Vpu in tetherin-positive cells. This indicates that the inhibition of BCA2 cannot fully restore Vpu-defective HIV-1 particle production to the level of the WT-virus. Apparently, capture of virions on the plasma membrane by tetherin provides restriction even when BCA2-depletion suppresses the internalization and degradation of nascent virions. These effected were further revealed by our subtilisin stripping assay; BCA2-depletion plus subtilisin treatment recovered &#x00394;Vpu-virus particle production to the level of the WT-virus. These results indicate that BCA2 very likely functions downstream of virus tethering on the plasma membrane (i.e. post-tethering stages).</p><p>In summary, the results of our current study demonstrate that BCA2 is a potential anti-HIV-1 host factor that partners with tetherin to facilitate the internalization and degradation of nascent viral particles. Our present findings thus shed new light on the molecular machinery underlying the tetherin-dependent HIV-1 restriction pathway. BCA2 and other molecules of this pathway may thus be potential new therapeutic targets for AIDS and its related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and transfections</title><p>HeLa, HOS and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS).
