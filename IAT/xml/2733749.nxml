We recently identified Inp2p as the peroxisome-specific receptor for Myo2p. In this study, we delineate the region of Myo2p devoted to binding peroxisomes. Using mutants of Myo2p specifically impaired in peroxisome binding, we dissect cell cycle&#x02013;dependent and peroxisome partitioning&#x02013;dependent mechanisms of Inp2p regulation. We find that although total Inp2p levels oscillate with the cell cycle, Inp2p levels on individual peroxisomes are controlled by peroxisome inheritance, as Inp2p aberrantly accumulates and decorates all peroxisomes in mother cells when peroxisome partitioning is abolished. We also find that Inp2p is a phosphoprotein whose level of phosphorylation is coupled to the cell cycle irrespective of peroxisome positioning in the cell. Our findings demonstrate that both organelle positioning and cell cycle progression control the levels of organelle-specific receptors for molecular motors to ultimately achieve an equidistribution of compartments between mother and daughter cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane-bound organelles organize the eukaryotic cell into distinct compartments that are each specialized for specific cellular functions. Compartmentalization allows a range of different processes to occur simultaneously within optimal microenvironments to increase the overall metabolic efficiency of cells. To maintain the advantages of compartmentalization, eukaryotic cells have evolved molecular mechanisms to ensure the faithful inheritance of their organelles during cell division.</p><p>The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> divides asymmetrically by budding. The accurate inheritance of its organelles is achieved by delivery of a portion of its organelles to the bud concomitant with retention of the remaining organelles in the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagarasanu and Rachubinski, 2007</xref>). This feature makes detection and isolation of mutants defective in organelle partitioning easier in budding yeast than in cells that divide by median fission, thus facilitating investigation of the spatial and temporal control of organelle motility.</p><p>The bud-directed movement of organelles is mediated by class V myosins, which are motors specialized in carrying cargo along actin filaments. The amino termini of all class V myosins contain a conserved motor domain that generates actin-based movements, whereas their divergent carboxyl termini form a globular domain called the tail that is specialized in capturing various organelles. Myo2p and Myo4p are the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> class V myosins (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reck-Peterson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bretscher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pruyne et al., 2004</xref>). Myo4p is involved in the movement of cortical ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estrada et al., 2003</xref>), whereas Myo2p powers the bud-directed movement of most other membrane-bound organelles, including Golgi elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rossanese et al., 2001</xref>), the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2003</xref>), peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoepfner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>), and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itoh et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boldogh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmann et al., 2008</xref>). Myo2p also drives the polarized transport of secretory vesicles, which is essential for cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Govindan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schott et al., 1999</xref>), and carries the plus ends of cytoplasmic microtubules into the bud for orientation of the nucleus before mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yin et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Ensuring the efficient transport of the different types of organelles carried by Myo2p requires tight control and coordination of Myo2p's attachment to and detachment from different organelles. Importantly, distinct Myo2p functions are genetically dissectible within the Myo2p tail. For example, mutations in the Myo2p cargo-binding domain were found that specifically disrupt either vacuole inheritance or polarized secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catlett et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, it was proposed that each organelle has its own Myo2p-specific receptor/adaptor that binds to a specific region in the Myo2p tail. Receptor proteins that physically connect Myo2p to its organelle cargoes have been shown to be indeed different and specific for each type of organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itoh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lipatova et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, although most yeast organelles are carried by the same motor, Myo2p, they move to distinct locations at different times in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fagarasanu et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pashkova et al., 2006</xref>). For example, at cytokinesis, both late Golgi elements and peroxisomes relocate to the mother&#x02013;bud neck where Myo2p accumulates. In contrast, vacuoles do not display Myo2p-dependent movements at this stage of the cell cycle, and no vacuolar structures are found at the mother&#x02013;bud neck. Also, late compartments of the Golgi follow Myo2p to the shmoo tips in G1-arrested cells, which is in contrast to peroxisomes and vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rossanese et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>). Thus, Myo2p associates with each type of organelle at a different and specific time in the cell cycle. The position of Myo2p receptors as mediators between the various organelles and the molecular engine driving their movement makes them ideally suited as regulatory targets for the organelle-specific patterns of movement occurring during the cell cycle.</p><p>We previously identified Inp2p as the peroxisome-specific receptor for Myo2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>). The levels of Inp2p fluctuate during the cell cycle in a pattern that correlates with the dynamics of peroxisome inheritance observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2007</xref>). Inp2p levels are low during early budding when peroxisomes are first observed to perform vectorial movements toward the bud and peak in medium-sized budded cells when most peroxisomes are inserted into daughter cells. Later in the cell cycle, when about half of the peroxisomes have been delivered to the bud, Inp2p levels start to decrease and return to basal values before cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">b</xref>). Inp2p does not associate uniformly with all peroxisomes but accumulates preferentially on a subset of peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagarasanu and Rachubinski, 2007</xref>). A correlation exists between the levels of Inp2p on different peroxisomes and their segregation fates, as only peroxisomes containing detectable amounts of Inp2p are selectively carried to the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>). These findings show that the availability of Inp2p on the peroxisomal membrane is an important determinant for the timing of Myo2p's attachment to peroxisomes. How Inp2p&#x02013;Myo2p interactions are regulated is currently unknown.</p><p>In this study, we identify the surface region of the Myo2p tail devoted to binding Inp2p and show that this region partially overlaps the region that binds secretory vesicles. By introducing point mutations in the peroxisome-binding region of Myo2p, we artificially uncoupled peroxisome inheritance from cell cycle progression to study the regulation of Inp2p by cell cycle&#x02013;dependent and organelle positioning&#x02013;dependent cues. Inp2p accumulates aberrantly on most peroxisomes in the mother cell if peroxisome inheritance is abolished. Our findings suggest that the inheritance of peroxisomes involves feedback mechanisms that regulate the levels of Inp2p relative to the positioning of peroxisomes in the dividing cell. We also show that Inp2p is a phosphoprotein whose level of phosphorylation is coupled to the cell cycle. Given that common principles govern the partitioning of all organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weisman 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagarasanu and Rachubinski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Nebenf&#x000fc;hr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng and Weisman, 2008</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pruyne et al., 2004</xref>), our findings point to the existence of regulatory events affecting the activity of organelle-specific receptors for molecular motors in response to organelle positioning and cell cycle progression that help to achieve an equidistribution of each organelle type between mother cell and daughter upon cell division.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of mutants of the Myo2p globular tail defective in peroxisome inheritance</title><p>The globular tail of Myo2p is composed of subdomains I (residues 1,131&#x02013;1,309 and 1,528&#x02013;1,574) and II (residues 1,310&#x02013;1,527; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pashkova et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2006</xref>). Analysis of the surface residues of the Myo2p tail to identify regions of high sequence conservation among the class V myosins from phylogenetically distant organisms led to the discovery of several patches of conserved residues in both subdomains I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pashkova et al., 2006</xref>). Conserved surface residues generally indicate sites of protein&#x02013;protein interaction. Therefore, the conserved patches on the surface of the Myo2p cargo-binding domain are likely to be regions that attach to specific cargoes. Indeed, the vacuole-binding site on Myo2p occupies a small region in subdomain I, whereas the residues required for Myo2p attachment to secretory vesicles reside within subdomain II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catlett and Weisman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catlett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pashkova et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Surface representation of the Myo2p globular tail.</bold> Subdomains I and II are shown in blue and red, respectively.

Cells were scored using a stringent all or none criterion for the presence of peroxisomes within buds using 3D confocal microscopy (see Materials and methods). Two point mutations, Y1415E and W1407F, in subdomain II of the globular tail were observed to induce severe defects in peroxisome distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Interestingly, Y1415 resides in the region of the Myo2p tail specialized in binding secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pashkova et al., 2006</xref>).

Two additional substitutions, Y1483A and E1484A, were observed to disrupt the transport of peroxisomes to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Quantification of rates of peroxisome inheritance showed that only 33% and 47% of small-budded cells and 61% and 70% of large-budded cells of the <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> and <italic>myo2-E1484A</italic> strains, respectively, displayed peroxisomal fluorescence within buds. Another mutation, <italic>myo2-K1408A</italic>, displayed a slight defect in peroxisome distribution, with 64% of small buds and 88% of large buds containing peroxisomes. This result may suggest that K1408 is part of the peroxisome-binding region of Myo2p; however, care should be taken in making such a conclusion because the <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-ammonium of the K1408 side chain is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of F1334 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Therefore, the effect of the K1408A substitution on peroxisome partitioning could be caused by a destabilization of the local architecture in subdomain II of the Myo2p tail.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutants of Myo2p defective in peroxisome inheritance display decreased affinity for Inp2p</title><p>If Y1415, W1407, Y1483, and E1484, whose mutation affects peroxisome transport to the bud, form a region on the surface of Myo2p specialized in binding peroxisomes, we expect mutations in these amino acids to decrease the affinity of Myo2p for its peroxisome-specific receptor, Inp2p. We have previously shown direct interaction between GST&#x02013;Myo2p and maltose-binding protein (MBP)&#x02013;Inp2p fusion proteins made in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>). We used a similar approach to quantify the interaction between Inp2p and the various Myo2p point mutants initially tested by microscopy for defects in peroxisome inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To improve the solubility of the MBP&#x02013;Inp2p fusion protein, only amino acids 241&#x02013;705 of Inp2p were used so as to exclude its predicted membrane-spanning region (amino acids 211&#x02013;239) while retaining the region between amino acids 241 and 705 capable of interacting with Myo2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>). Myo2p-Y1415E, Myo2p-W1407F, Myo2p-Y1483A, and Myo2p-E1484A displayed decreased affinity for Inp2p as compared with the wild-type Myo2p tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Also, Myo2p-K1408A was slightly impaired in its ability to interact with Inp2p. Interestingly, some Myo2p point mutants had an increased affinity for Inp2p when compared with the wild-type Myo2p tail, indicating that regions outside the Inp2p-binding domain of Myo2p may negatively regulate the Inp2p&#x02013;Myo2p interaction.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutants of Myo2p defective in peroxisome inheritance display decreased affinity for Inp2p.</bold> (A) Glutathione Sepharose beads containing either GST fused to the cargo-binding tail of wild-type or mutant Myo2 proteins or GST alone were incubated with extracts of <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;synthesized MBP&#x02013;Inp2p.

Consistent with both microscopy-based quantification of peroxisome inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) and in vitro binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), Myo2p-Y1415E, Myo2p-W1407F, Myo2p-Y1483A, and Myo2p-E1484A displayed less affinity for Inp2p than did wild-type Myo2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Interestingly, the L1411R mutation in the secretory vesicle&#x02013;binding region of Myo2p also disrupted interaction between Myo2p and Inp2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>); however, this mutation was not tested for defects in peroxisome inheritance because it does not support yeast viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pashkova et al., 2006</xref>). The inability of L1411R to bind Myo2p in the yeast two-hybrid assay could potentially extend the peroxisome-binding region of the Myo2p tail to the L1411 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). However, the other two mutations at L1411 that were tested, i.e., Myo2p-L1411A and Myo2p-L1411S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), preserved their ability to interact with Inp2p in yeast two-hybrid analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Moreover, both the L1411S and L1411R mutations have been shown to severely affect yeast cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pashkova et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that the L1411S substitution is sufficient to disrupt the attachment of Myo2p to secretory vesicles. The effect of the leucine to arginine mutation at L1411 in disturbing the Myo2p&#x02013;Inp2p interaction may therefore reflect a steric occlusion of the Inp2p-binding site in the Myo2p tail resulting from the long arginine side chain's hindrance of the ability of Inp2p to gain access to the neighboring amino acids, i.e., Y1415 and W1407, rather than a direct involvement of L1411 in attachment to Inp2p.

Inp2p-labeled peroxisomes were delivered to the bud and congregated at the bud tip. Inp2p was detected on peroxisomes in mother cells only when buds were small. This resulted in a highly polarized Inp2p-GFP fluorescent signal along the mother&#x02013;bud axis.

Notably, cells expressing the <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> mutation exhibited elevated levels of Inp2p-pA at all stages of the cell cycle compared with cells containing the wild-type <italic>MYO2</italic> allele. Because Inp2p levels are increased in cells with compromised peroxisome inheritance, we conclude that the cellular concentration of Inp2p is regulated by peroxisome positioning&#x02013;dependent cues, i.e., where peroxisomes are in the cell.</p><p>Our experiments also showed that Inp2p-pA from both the wild-type <italic>MYO2</italic> and the mutant <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> strains migrated as multiple species on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). To determine whether this migration pattern was caused by posttranslational modification of Inp2p-pA by phosphorylation, we treated cell lysates with alkaline phosphatase. This resulted in a collapse of the multiple Inp2p-pA species into a single, faster migrating species, demonstrating that Inp2p is indeed phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Phosphorylation of Inp2p-pA was coupled to the cell cycle and more pronounced at its beginning and end, whereas Inp2p at the peak of its expression 60 min after release from &#x003b1; factor arrest migrated as a single, fast migrating species in both <italic>MYO2</italic> wild-type cells and <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>).

Therefore, the increased levels of Inp2p in the <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> mutant are not the result of increased transcription of the <italic>INP2</italic> gene but rather reflect a posttranscriptional change at either the translational or posttranslational level.</p><p>The polarized distribution of Inp2p-GFP observed in wild-type cells could suggest that only a select subset of peroxisomes can accumulate Inp2p, which results in their transfer to the daughter cell. However, the observation that Inp2p is distributed over most, if not all, peroxisomes in <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> mutant cells is consistent with a model in which all peroxisomes can accumulate Inp2p, and Inp2p levels in the mother cell are reduced upon delivery of peroxisomes to the daughter cell. To test this model, we followed the dynamics of Inp2p-GFP in cells lacking the dynamin-like protein Vps1p. Cells lacking Vps1p typically contain only one enlarged peroxisome, probably because of inefficient peroxisome fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoepfner et al., 2001</xref>). During cell division, the large peroxisome present in <italic>vps1&#x00394;</italic> cells emits a tubular projection that passes through the mother&#x02013;bud neck into the daughter cell. This peroxisomal tubule eventually undergoes fission, resulting in two peroxisomes: one located in the mother cell and the other in the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoepfner et al., 2001</xref>). Inp2p-GFP in small-budded cells was present over the entire peroxisomal tubule, but its distribution was asymmetrical, with Inp2p being concentrated on that part of the peroxisomal tubule present in the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). However, in cells where the elongated peroxisome divided, the Inp2p-GFP signal was not detectable in the mother cell, and Inp2p-GFP decorated only the peroxisome in the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). In contrast, in the <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> mutant lacking Vps1p, the one or two peroxisomes that were present remained in the mother cell and were decorated by Inp2p-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Interestingly, we never observed elongated peroxisomes in this Myo2p mutant, suggesting that elongation of the enlarged peroxisome observed in <italic>vps1&#x00394;</italic> cells carrying wild-type Myo2p is the result of pulling forces exerted by Myo2p&#x02013;Inp2p transport complexes on the peroxisomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fagarasanu et al., 2006b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Dynamics of Inp2p in cells lacking Vps1p or overproducing Inp1p.</bold> (A) <italic>vps1&#x00394;</italic> cells containing <italic>MYO2</italic> or the <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> allele and expressing Inp2p-GFP and peroxisomal mRFP-SKL were grown in YPD to mid-log phase, and confocal images were captured.

Interestingly, each Myo2p cargo displays Myo2p-dependent motility at a distinct time in the cell cycle. Also, the ultimate destination of Myo2p-driven transport is specific for each type of organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fagarasanu et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weisman, 2006</xref>). Therefore, Myo2p's attachment to and detachment from organelles are independently regulated for each type of organelle.</p><p>It is crucial to understand the structural basis for Myo2p's association with its cargoes to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that allow it to move multiple cargoes to distinct places at different times. The regions on the surface of Myo2p required for binding two of its cargoes, namely the vacuole and secretory vesicles, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catlett et al., 2000</xref>). These regions were found to be distant from one another and simultaneously exposed on the surface of the globular tail of Myo2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pashkova et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that the tail does not have a major role in regulating cargo binding. Rather, the availability of cargo-specific receptors must dictate the timing of organelle attachment to Myo2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fagarasanu et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pashkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weisman, 2006</xref>). In this study, we defined the surface region of the Myo2p tail devoted to binding peroxisomes and showed that this region is distinct from the region previously identified to bind vacuoles but partially overlaps the region that binds secretory vesicles. Recently, two surface residues that participate in vacuole binding were found to also function in the Myo2p-driven transport of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmann et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the yet unidentified mitochondrion-binding region of Myo2p overlaps its vacuole-binding region. These findings challenge the currently held view that the spatial segregation of various organelle-binding regions is an important feature of Myo2p, allowing it to function as a scaffold that exposes all its cargo-binding sites at the same time while still avoiding competition for the transport of different cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weisman, 2006</xref>). Overlap in the regions on the Myo2p surface specialized in binding different organelles suggests that different types of organelle could potentially compete with one another for access to Myo2p. This capacity for steric exclusion in myosin&#x02013;organelle interactions would impose a tight temporal regulation on the activities of organelle-specific Myo2p receptors during the cell cycle and result in different receptors acting at different times in the inheritance of their specific organelles.</p><p>In this study, we elucidated the spatial and temporal parameters that contribute to the regulation of Inp2p, the peroxisome-specific receptor for Myo2p. The levels of Inp2p fluctuate during the cell cycle, being maximal when peroxisome inheritance occurs and decreased later in the cell cycle when about half of the peroxisomes have been delivered to the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>). To gain insight into how Inp2p is regulated during the cell cycle, we followed the dynamics of Inp2p when peroxisome transfer to the bud was prevented or delayed using mutants of Myo2p that are defective in binding and transporting peroxisomes. Cells harboring such Myo2p mutants as the sole copy of Myo2p produced buds devoid of peroxisomes but still progressed normally through the cell cycle, thereby effectively dissociating the two processes of peroxisome segregation and cell cycle progression. We found that under these conditions, Inp2p levels were increased, indicating that the cellular abundance of Inp2p is not intrinsically linked to the cell cycle but rather determined by the distribution of peroxisomes in the dividing cell, i.e., by organelle positioning&#x02013;specific cues. Moreover, in contrast to wild-type cells in which the Inp2p signal is highly polarized toward the bud, most peroxisomes in the mother cells of <italic>myo2</italic> mutants contained increased amounts of Inp2p. Therefore, the misplacement of peroxisomes caused by point mutations in the Myo2p tail influenced both the localization and levels of Inp2p. These data are consistent with a scenario in which the synthesis of Inp2p in the mother cell and its initial accumulation on a subset of peroxisomes precede its Myo2p-driven transport along with peroxisomes to the bud. In the bud, Inp2p&#x02013;Myo2p transport complexes are eventually disassembled through the regulated degradation of Inp2p, releasing the transferred peroxisomes from Myo2p. Accordingly, when the association of peroxisomes with the translocation machinery is disrupted, as is the case for the <italic>myo2</italic> mutants with compromised peroxisome inheritance, Inp2p is protected from the bud-specific proteolytic turnover. A degradation of Inp2p in the bud to terminate peroxisome motility agrees with current models for the inheritance of other organelles, such as yeast vacuoles. Vac17p, the vacuole-specific receptor for Myo2p, was proposed to be degraded in the bud after the transfer of vacuolar membranes into the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our data are also consistent with the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms that survey the intracellular distribution of Inp2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). If the increase in Inp2p levels in the <italic>myo2</italic> peroxisome inheritance mutants resulted exclusively from a lack of Inp2p degradation at its destination, i.e., in the bud, one would expect approximately the same number of peroxisomes to contain detectable levels of Inp2p in the wild-type and <italic>myo2</italic> mutant strains. However, this is not the case, as the inheritance mutant <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> displays increased amounts of Inp2p on most, if not all, peroxisomes in the mother cell. These findings strongly suggest the existence of a regulatory feedback mechanism from bud to mother cell that causes Inp2p to accumulate aberrantly on peroxisomes in the mother cell upon disruption of peroxisome inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Because the levels of <italic>INP2</italic> mRNA are essentially the same in wild-type cells and cells of the <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> mutant, this proposed feedback mechanism must operate posttranscriptionally, most likely through degradation machinery acting on Inp2p. Cellular surveillance mechanisms that monitor peroxisome partitioning could be envisioned to trigger the degradation of Inp2p in response to efficient peroxisome inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). If the Inp2p degradation machinery is present in both mother cell and bud, its activation would not only cause the release of transferred peroxisomes from Myo2p but would also prevent new recruitments of additional peroxisomes from the mother cell. Thus, proteolytic degradation of the receptor/adaptor protein in the myosin-capturing complex could represent an effective mechanism not only for depositing a moving organelle at its proper destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weisman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagarasanu and Rachubinski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Nebenf&#x000fc;hr, 2008</xref>) but also for terminating organelle inheritance.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>A model for Inp2p regulation.</bold> At the beginning of the cell cycle, Inp2p is loaded onto all peroxisomes.

First, the highly polarized Inp2p-GFP signal along the cell division axis in wild-type cells not only demonstrates the selectivity of Myo2p in carrying those peroxisomes that have increased amounts of Inp2p to the growing bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagarasanu et al., 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">b</xref>) but also shows that Inp2p is not degraded as soon as it is exposed to the bud environment. The degradation of Inp2p is probably influenced by the extent of peroxisome transfer and is thus triggered after a sufficient number of peroxisomes have been partitioned to the daughter cell. Second, although the Inp2p-GFP signal in wild-type cells is not uniformly distributed among different peroxisomes, most likely all peroxisomes can acquire Inp2p, but its levels on some peroxisomes may be below the threshold of microscopic detection. Evidence to support this comes from the observation that in cells lacking the peroxisomal anchor protein Inp1p, wherein all peroxisomes have lost their ability to remain attached to the cell periphery, the entire peroxisome population is eventually transferred to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fagarasanu et al., 2005</xref>), presumably in an Inp2p- and Myo2p-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagarasanu and Rachubinski, 2007</xref>). This shows that in the <italic>myo2</italic> peroxisome inheritance mutants, the distribution of Inp2p on peroxisomes is probably similar to that found in wild-type cells, but the amount of Inp2p is increased. The delay in peroxisome partitioning in these mutants is sufficient for Inp2p levels on all peroxisomes to increase above the detection threshold, allowing for direct monitoring of how peroxisome inheritance feeds back onto Inp2p levels in the mother cell. Third, we observe a decrease in the Inp2p-GFP signal on peroxisomes in the mother cell in an inheritance mutant when peroxisomes are segregated to the bud. This suggests an inverse relationship between Inp2p levels in the mother cell and the efficiency of peroxisome transfer to the bud. Fourth, the levels of Inp2p in a peroxisome inheritance mutant, while being significantly increased, still oscillate in the cell cycle with the same pattern observed for wild-type cells. Therefore, cell cycle&#x02013;related fluctuations in Inp2p levels occur irrespective of the efficiency of peroxisome inheritance. This provides further proof that Inp2p turnover can occur both in the mother cell and the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). The degradation complex might be present in the cytosol or even on the peroxisomal membrane, but it appears that its activity is determined by both peroxisome positioning and cell cycle cues.</p><p>The presence of only one greatly enlarged peroxisome in cells lacking Vps1p facilitates the analysis of Inp2p dynamics because it leads to the accumulation of all Inp2p molecules in the membrane of a single peroxisome. Under these circumstances, it was evident that Inp2p-GFP initially sampled the entire peroxisome, with its leading edge containing higher levels of Inp2p. However, later in the cell cycle, only that part of the enlarged peroxisome present in the bud preserved Inp2p, and no Inp2p-GFP could be detected in the mother cell. In contrast, in cells lacking Vps1p and expressing the <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic> mutation, the peroxisomes in mother cells contained detectable amounts of Inp2p. This observation is consistent with our model in which the peroxisomes that initially accumulate Inp2p, or in the case of <italic>vps1&#x00394;</italic> cells, the region of the tubule that initially accumulates Inp2p, are delivered to the bud first and ultimately trigger the down-regulation of Inp2p in the peroxisomes remaining in the mother cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>Feedback regulation of Inp2p could be provided by a posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation, that would make Inp2p susceptible to degradation. In this study, we show that Inp2p is a phosphoprotein whose level of phosphorylation correlates with the cell cycle, being more pronounced at the start and end of the cell cycle. Notably, Vac17p was shown to be activated in the mother cell by phosphorylation by Cdk1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng and Weisman, 2008</xref>) and in the bud by Cla4p and Ste20p, an event that leads to its turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartholomew and Hardy, 2009</xref>). The existence of two temporally distinct phosphorylation events of Inp2p hints at the possibility of successive steps of checkpoint-dependent activation and inactivation of Inp2p, such as its preparation for binding to Myo2p early in the cell cycle and its preparation for degradation late in the cell cycle. However, because the times at which the phosphorylated forms of Inp2p appear and disappear are the same in wild-type cells and cells of the peroxisome inheritance mutant <italic>myo2-Y1483A</italic>, the timing of phosphorylation of Inp2p is probably coupled to the cell cycle and not related to intracellular peroxisome placement.</p><p>In closing, we have shown that Inp2p, the peroxisome-specific receptor for Myo2p, is subject to both spatial and temporal regulation. Our findings point to the existence of cell cycle&#x02013;dependent and organelle positioning&#x02013;dependent mechanisms that control the activity and levels of organelle-specific receptors for the molecular motors that drive the intracellular motility of different membrane-bound compartments. Given that the different types of organelles compete for access to these motors, cells have developed multiple levels of regulation for their organelle-specific receptors so as to ultimately achieve an equal distribution of compartments between mother and daughter cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains and culture conditions</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200904050/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.

Cells of these strains were transformed with pRS413 (HIS3) containing either wild-type <italic>MYO2</italic> or <italic>myo2</italic> harboring a point mutation. Transformants were streaked onto SM lacking histidine and uracil (SM-His-Ura) to select for the presence of both plasmids and then onto SM containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to remove pRS416-MYO2.

Essentially, 200 &#x000b5;l of hot nonfluorescent medium was used to prepare a thin agarose pad on a slide with two 18-mm square wells (Cel-line Brand). 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;l culture was placed onto the slide, covered with a coverslip, and sealed with Valap (1:1:1 mixture of vaseline, lanolin, and paraffin). Cells were incubated at room temperature for image capture.

A piezoelectric actuator was used to drive continuous objective movement, allowing for the rapid collection of <italic>z</italic> stacks. The sides of each pixel represented 0.057 &#x000b5;m of the sample. Stacks of 30&#x02013;50 optical sections spaced 0.125 &#x000b5;m apart were captured.</p><p>Acquired images were deconvolved using algorithms provided by Huygens Professional Software (Scientific Volume Imaging BV). For this method, 3D datasets were processed to remove noise and reassign blur through an iterative classical maximum likelihood estimation algorithm and an experimentally derived point-spread function. The transmission image was treated differently. In Huygens, a Gaussian filter was applied to the transmission image, and blue color was applied to the transmission image using Imaris software (version 6.1; Bitplane, Inc.). The level of the transmission image was modified, and the image was processed until only the circumference of the cell was visible. To prevent interference of internal structures captured in the transmission images, the internal structures were removed in Photoshop (Adobe). Imaris was subsequently used to display the deconvolved 3D dataset with the processed transmission image and to prepare the image files before final figure assembly in Photoshop and InDesign (Adobe).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of rates of peroxisome inheritance</title><p>Rates of peroxisome inheritance were quantified essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fagarasanu et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2006a</xref>). Cells synthesizing genomically encoded Pot1p-GFP were grown in YPD, transferred to SCIM, and incubated in SCIM for 16 h to achieve an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5. Peroxisomes were visualized by direct fluorescence confocal microscopy. For each randomly chosen field, three optical sections of 5-&#x000b5;m thickness were collected at a <italic>z</italic> axis spacing of 1.6 &#x000b5;m using a high detector gain to ensure the capture of weak fluorescent signals. Optical sections were projected to a single image. All visibly budded cells were considered for analysis. Budded cells were assigned to two size categories according to bud volume expressed as a percentage of mother cell volume: category I, 0&#x02013;24% (representing small-budded cells); and category II, 24&#x02013;48% (representing large-budded cells). Because cell volume is not directly accessible, bud area was first measured using image browser software (LSM 5; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and grouped into two &#x0201c;area&#x0201d; categories, which superimpose on the aforementioned &#x0201c;volume&#x0201d; categories if a spherical geometry is assumed for all cells, according to bud cross-sectional area expressed as a percentage of mother cell cross-sectional area: category I, 0&#x02013;39%; and category II, 39&#x02013;61%. Buds were scored using an all or none criterion for the presence or absence of peroxisomal fluorescence. Quantification was always performed on at least 50 budded cells from each category of bud size.</p></sec><sec><title>Staining cell structures</title><p>Yeast vacuoles were stained with <italic>N</italic>-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-(6(4(diethylamino)phenyl) hexatrienyl) pyridium dibromide (FM4-64; Invitrogen).
