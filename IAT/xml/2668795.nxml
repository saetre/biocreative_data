Acid sphingomyelinase knockout mice (ASMko) are a suitable model to address the role of sphingolipids in synaptic regulation as they recapitulate a mental retardation syndrome, Niemann Pick disease type A (NPA), and their neurons have altered levels of sphingomyelin (SM) and its derivatives. Electrophysiological recordings showed that ASMko hippocampi have increased paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation. Consistently, electron microscopy revealed reduced number of docked vesicles. Biochemical analysis of ASMko synaptic membranes unveiled higher amounts of SM and sphingosine (Se) and enhanced interaction of the docking molecules Munc18 and syntaxin1. <italic>In vitro</italic> reconstitution assays demonstrated that Se changes syntaxin1 conformation enhancing its interaction with Munc18. Moreover, Se reduces vesicle docking in primary neurons and increases paired-pulse facilitation when added to wt hippocampal slices.

However, much still remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which lipids influence synaptic function and about the enzymatic activities regulating their action. This knowledge is essential to understand not only the molecular mechanisms of cognition but also the defects underlying the cognitive impairment that accompany most lipidosis. Among them, NPA results from loss of function mutations in the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) gene leading to severe mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Brady1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. ASM is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of SM into ceramide in the lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Stoffel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Its absence causes the accumulation of SM in these organelles, which is a hallmark in NPA patients.

Furthermore, accumulation of SM and its derivatives also occurs at the plasma membrane of hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Galvan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This moved us to consider these mice a suitable model to investigate the involvement of sphingolipids in synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The absence of ASM causes a drastic increase of SM in synaptic membranes</title><p>To determine whether lack of ASM activity affects synaptic membrane lipid composition, mass analysis of lipids was performed on synaptosomes of age-matched (7months) wild type (wt) and ASMko mice. The synaptosome isolation procedure was refined so that no traces of myelin and lysosomes, which are loaded with SM in ASMko conditions, could interfere with our measurements (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005310.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This study revealed a 3-fold increase in SM levels in ASMko synaptosomes compared to wt (176&#x000b1;40 and 59&#x000b1;17 nmol/mg protein, respectively, mean&#x000b1;SD, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3). In contrast, the amounts of other lipids such as cholesterol (362&#x000b1;66 and 270&#x000b1;53 nmol/mg protein), ceramide (3.2&#x000b1;0.1 and 2.7&#x000b1;1 nmol/mg protein), phosphatidylcholine (306&#x000b1;107 and 266&#x000b1;79 nmol/mg protein), phosphatidylserine (64&#x000b1;28 and 38&#x000b1;6 nmol/mg protein) and phosphatidylethanolamine (247&#x000b1;74 and 200&#x000b1;29 nmol/mg protein), were not significantly altered. These results evidence that ASM deficiency alters the synaptic membrane lipid composition by drastically increasing SM levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>ASM deficiency leads to the alteration of short-term synaptic plasticity events</title><p>Alterations in the lipid composition of the synapses could affect synaptic transmission. To test if this is the case when ASM activity is lacking, synaptic transmission and short-term synaptic plasticity of Schaffer collateral (Sc)-CA1 synapses were next investigated in hippocampal slices from 7-month-old wt and ASMko mice. Basal synaptic transmission measured by input-output analysis was normal in ASMko mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, short-term synaptic plasticity in ASMko slices showed enhanced paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), while synaptic depression remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To determine whether the increased levels of SM in ASMko conditions could explain the electrophysiological alterations, we assessed the effects of the addition of exogenous SM to slices of wt mice. Input-output analysis of SM-treated slices showed no differences with respect to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). However, PPF ratio was increased mimicking the results obtained in ASMko slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We could not detect abnormalities in PTP under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This could be due to the high dependence of PTP on events occurring inside the presynaptic terminal (i.e. mitochondrial calcium buffering), which would not be affected if the exogenously added SM only reaches the plasma membrane. In any case, these results indicate that the accumulation of SM is responsible, at least in part, for the alterations in presynaptic function observed in ASMko mice. This is also supported by the fact that the lipid increase precedes these alterations. Thus, we registered normal PTP and PPF in hippocampal slices from ASMko mice of 1 month of age (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005310.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), when symptoms of the disease are not yet evident but SM increase is already detectable. However, this increase is only 0.6-fold of that occurring at 7 months (126&#x000b1;13 and 192&#x000b1;14 nmol/&#x000b5;mol phospholipids in 1- and 7- months-old ASMko, respectively). This suggests that a certain threshold in SM accumulation must be achieved for the aberrant phenotypes to occur during the progression of the disease.</p><fig id="pone-0005310-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005310.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Basal synaptic transmission and plasticity in wt and ASMko hippocampal slices.</title><p>(A,B) Input-output plots of stimulus versus FV amplitude (A) and stimulus versus fEPSP slope (B) in wt and ASMko slices stimulated at intensities ranging from 10 to 150 &#x000b5;A.

No significant differences in ultrastructure were found in 1-month-old mice. However, a reduction in the size of the presynaptic area in ASMko mice was noticeable at 2 and 5 months being most significant in symptomatic 8-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, the total number of synaptic vesicles was diminished in ASMko mice (ASMko 51.4&#x000b1;4.2, wt 71.7&#x000b1;6.6) although their density was not altered with respect to wt synapses (ASMko 295.3&#x000b1;16.95 vesicles/&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, wt 304.7&#x000b1;44.2 vesicles/&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>), given the smaller size of ASMko presynaptic boutons. Notably, while the number of docked vesicles was not significantly reduced at 1 month of age the reduction was evident in 8 month old ASMko mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) (number of docked vesicles per synapse: ASMko 2.07&#x000b1;1.07, wt 4.64&#x000b1;1.70); number of docked vesicles per &#x000b5;m of active zone: ASMko 8.84&#x000b1;2.76, wt 16.98&#x000b1;3.2). Despite these changes, the general appearance of the neuropil was normal, the only detectable sign of degeneration being the presence of lipid inclusions in the cell body of pyramidal neurons. These inclusions were already significant at 1 month of age filling the cytoplasm at 8 months (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005310.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Stereological methods revealed a similar density of axospinous synapses in the stratum radiatum of both genotypes at 8 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that although synapses are retained in the hippocampus of ASMko mice even at advanced stages of the disease, there is a marked decrease in the dimension of presynaptic specializations and in the pool of docked vesicles.</p><fig id="pone-0005310-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005310.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Smaller size of the presynaptic compartments and reduced number of docked vesicles in ASMko mice hippocampus compared to wt.</title><p>(A) Representative electron micrographs showing axospinous synapses in the CA1 stratum radiatum of wt and ASMko mice.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that could impair synaptic vesicle docking in ASMko mutants we analyzed Munc18 and syntaxin1 expression levels, membrane attachment and interaction in synaptosomes from 7-month-old wt and ASMko mice. While total levels were similar, the pool of Munc18 associated to membranes was significantly increased in ASMko synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Consistently, immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the interaction of Munc18 with syntaxin1 was 1.9-fold higher in ASMko conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

Only Se had a strong effect in the intrinsic fluorescence of syntaxin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To define the precise mechanism of action of Se, we analyzed syntaxin1 conformational changes upon addition of different Se analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These experiments revealed that the substitution of the free primary hydroxygroup of Se was allowed with a neutral group (D-galactosyl sphingosine is active) but not with a charged group (SPC is inactive). The double bond of Se was not necessary to induce a conformational change as D,e-sphinganine was still able to alter the intrinsic fluorescence of syntaxin 1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). However, 2-amino-1-hexadecanol, resembling sphinganine but lacking the secondary hydroxygroup, was ineffective. On the other hand, the configuration of this hydroxygroup seemed less critical (both D,erythro- and L,threo-sphingosine being active). The length of the hydrophobic tail was important as C12-sphingosine failed to change syntaxin1 conformation compared to Se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, the free aminogroup (N-acetylation resulted in an inactive compound) and its configuration (D,threo-sphingosine has less effect), did control the interaction with syntaxin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, alkylation of the aminogroup was allowed (N,N-dimethyl-sphingosine is still active) suggesting that it is not the aminogroup itself but the positive charge that is important to induce conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The differential effects obtained with the diverse analogues used in the same experimental conditions (i.e. concentration, solvent, temperature, time of incubation) strongly support that the alterations in fluorescence are not due to protein denaturation or fluorescence quenching but to specific conformational changes. Altogether, these data point to Se as a physiological regulator of syntaxin1 conformation and shed light on the structural requirements for their interaction.</p><fig id="pone-0005310-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005310.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Se alters the conformation of syntaxin1.</title><p>(A) Fluorescence spectra of syntaxin1 at excitation of 280 nm in the presence of 100 &#x000b5;M SM, N-acetyl-Se (C2-cer), Se, SPC or the different solvents used to solubilized the lipids (buffer, DMSO and ethanol).

Indeed, ASMko synaptosomes from 7-month-old mice contained 4&#x02013;5 fold more Se than wt (266.8&#x000b1;102.8 and 59.6&#x000b1;15.1 pmol/mg protein, respectively, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3). Moreover, treatment of wt synaptosomes with Se, which raised Se levels without affecting other lipids (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005310.s005">Figure S5</xref>), enhanced 1.36-fold Munc18-syntaxin1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). To directly prove that high Se levels impair vesicle docking we labeled the ready releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles in cultured hippocampal neurons by using 500 mM sucrose solution containing the fluorescent dye FM4&#x02013;64 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Toonen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, to demonstrate that Se accumulation results in the alteration of presynaptic plasticity we measured PPF in hippocampal slices of wt mice treated or not with Se. PPF increased upon Se addition similarly to the behavior observed in slices from ASMko mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005310-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These observations confirm Se as a modulator of Munc18-syntaxin1 interaction, vesicle docking and presynaptic plasticity. They also indicate that increased levels of this lipid contribute to the docking and electrophysiological defects observed in neurons from 7&#x02013;8-month-old ASMko mice.

Although the involvement of complexes of SNARE and Munc18 in such process is established, the need to identify factors involved in the control of the conformation or binding capabilities of these proteins has been acknowledged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Toonen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We here show that SM, Se and their regulatory enzyme ASM, are among these factors. Thus, when ASM is lacking, SM accumulates leading to high levels of its derivative Se. We demonstrate that Se increase affects presynaptic plasticity events, impairs vesicle docking in primary neurons and alters the interaction of the docking molecules Munc18-syntaxin1 by changing syntaxin1 conformation. We also offer insight on how this occurs along the progression of NPA disease. Hence, Se increase precedes these defects that appear when the levels of this lipid reach a certain threshold. Furthermore, we provide detail on the structural requirements in the Se molecule necessary to change syntaxin1 conformation, which could open perspectives for future drug design. Such an effect had been only shown for arachidonic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Connell1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the latter favors the open, fusion competent, conformation of syntaxin1 without affecting Munc18-syntaxin1 interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Connell1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Because we observe that Se enhances their contact without changing the levels of these proteins, we propose that this lipid promotes the closed conformation of syntaxin1, which has the highest affinity for Munc18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Gerber1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the balance of arachidonic acid and Se levels at the synaptic membrane could be a key factor for docking and fusion by differentially modulating syntaxin1 conformation.</p><p>Our results showing an increased interaction of Munc18-syntaxin1 yet reduced number of docked vesicles, are in agreement with the proposed role of Munc18 in controlling the size of the ready releasable pool of vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Toonen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, they are in apparent contradiction to the view that the formation of the Munc18-syntaxin1 complex correlates directly with the docking process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Toonen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Dulubova1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Graham1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Gerber1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering that we move in a disease scenario, it might still be that altered Se levels all over the synaptic ASMko membrane sequester Munc18, through enhanced syntaxin1 interaction, to membrane areas different from the active zone and incompetent for docking.</p><p>Finally, our work provides with the functional consequences that the lack of ASM have in short-term presynaptic plasticity events. Anatomical analysis offered insight on the events underlying the functional observations. Thus, that the density of the reserve pool vesicle store is not affected in ASMko conditions could explain why synaptic depression is not altered. The finding that the basal response is also not affected in ASMko synapses, despite the reduction in the ready releasable pool of vesicles and the increase in PPF, is surprising. However, several facts could explain this observation. First, the density of neurotransmitter receptors (NT Rcs) has been proposed as a key element for the basal synaptic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Raghavachari1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. We have shown that ASMko synapse is smaller, however biochemical analysis of wt and ASMko synaposomal preparations revealed similar levels of NT Rcs (unpublished observations). Hence, it is possible that in such conditions a higher density of NT Rcs at the postsynaptic compartment compensate for the reduced presynaptic release, rendering the basal response as efficient as in the wt situation. Moreover, the absence of neurodegeneration and the presence of a normal density of axospinous synapses would also contribute to the normal basal synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Likewise, although the membrane attachment of Munc18 is altered, it has been shown that reduction or overexpression of Munc 18 do not affect the basal synaptic strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Toonen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, increased PPF and PTP are consistent with the scarcity of docked vesicles, which could imply a reduction in basal probability of neurotransmitter release, favouring the enhancement of synaptic strength after repeated stimulation. Because abnormalities in such events have been linked with learning impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005310-Silva1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> our results could explain, at least in part, the severe mental retardation that characterizes NPA patients in which ASM is missing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Antibodies against the following molecules were used: Lamp-2 (CD 107b, BD Transduction Laboratories); Synaptophysin (Clone Sy-38, Boehringer Mannheim); Myelin Basic Protein (D-18, sc 13912 Santa Cruz); Munc 18 (116002 polyclonal, SySy); Syntaxin1 (110101 monoclonal, SySy); SNAP25 (111002 polyclonal SySy); Vamp2 (104211 monoclonal SySy).
