The effects of vitreous on expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), metallothionein (MT) -1a and -2a, and c-fos were investigated. Activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding sites are located in the promoter region of HO-1 and MT genes and the effects of vitreous on c-fos activity were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Low passage cultures of human RPE cells were grown in the presence or absence of vitreous or transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;). The expression of HO-1 and MTs was measured by real time PCR and, in the case of HO-1, by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Specific inhibitors were used to investigate possible signaling pathways. The effect of vitreous on activation of AP-1 transcription factor was determined by immunoblotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, or immunofluorescence microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Incubation of RPE cells with vitreous resulted in increased expression of HO-1, MT-1a and MT-2a. TGF-&#x003b2; caused an increase in HO-1 expression, although not to the extent mediated by vitreous, but had little effect on MT expression. Addition of inhibitors of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (SB431542 or TGF-&#x003b2;-neutralizing antibodies) decreased the vitreous induction of HO-1. Several reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenchers inhibited the TGF-&#x003b2;-induced or vitreous-induced elevation of HO-1 mRNA but had no effect on vitreous-mediated induction of MT expression. Inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK; SB203580) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; SP600125) pathways inhibited vitreous-induction of HO-1. C-fos, a component of AP-1 transcription factor complexes, exhibited increased expression and activation in the presence of vitreous.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>TGF-&#x003b2;, a known component of vitreous, can account for some but not all of the regulation of the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory HO-1 gene in human RPE cells, but it does not participate in the vitreous-mediated upregulation of MTs. Both vitreous and TGF-&#x003b2; signals increased HO-1 expression via ROS but the latter were not involved in vitreous-mediated MT expression. Increased p38, JNK, and c-fos activation may be implicated in vitreous modulation of HO-1.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells form a monolayer between the retina and the choriocapillaris. These cells constitute one aspect of the blood retinal barrier and play a critical role in the maintenance of the neural retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. They do not normally divide after birth but may do so in some pathological situations. In proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), for example, breach of the blood-retinal barrier, accompanied by a tear in the neural retina that allows vitreous contact with the RPE cell monolayer, can lead to cell division and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of the RPE cells. The resulting fibroblast-like cells can move into the vitreous where they participate in the formation of a fibrotic epiretinal membrane that may contract, leading to retinal detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Risk factors for PVR include trauma to the eye, contact between RPE cells and the vitreous, breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Gene array analyses of the changes that occur in cultured RPE cells that have been exposed to vitreous and undergo EMT indicate an inflammatory or stress response as the cells transform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] (Ganti et al. Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science. In press). The vitreous-induced changes in gene expression also include increased expression of genes involved in anti-oxidant responses, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), metallothioneins (MT), and hypoxia-induced factor-1 (Ganti et al., In press). Increased expression of such genes may help to resolve inflammation and protect the cells from apoptosis.</p><p>HO-1 participates in many anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] and is expressed by human RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] and other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] cells under a variety of conditions. For example, HO-1 expression is increased by such stimuli as heavy metals, hypoxia, hyperoxia, inflammation, and certain growth factors and cytokines, many of which signal via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. MTs are small proteins containing up to 30% cysteine which bind metals, particularly zinc, and are powerful anti-oxidants that may participate in the resolution of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Since MTs, like HO-1, are induced in response to oxidative stress and inflammation, it is not surprising that many of the same factors control their expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) is a growth factor involved in EMT, cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis during normal development and in certain diseases, including PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. It is present in normal vitreous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] and increases HO-1 expression in human RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>We investigated the vitreous induction of HO-1 and MT in low passage human RPE cells. We found that vitreous led to an increase in HO-1 expression that was partly caused by TGF-&#x003b2;, and that the rise in HO-1 expression was signaled via ROS generation. MT-1a and MT-2a were also induced by vitreous but their expression was not under the control of TGF-&#x003b2; or ROS. Concurrent with these changes in anti-oxidant proteins was the activation of c-fos, a component of AP-1 transcription factor complexes that binds to sites in the promoters of HO-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], MT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] and MT-2a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] genes and which has been implicated in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human vitreous and retinal pigment epithelial cells</title><p>Human donor eyes were obtained postmortem from Lifepoint (Columbia, SC) or The Lions' Eye Bank (Portland, OR). The protocol adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human tissue. The cornea, iris and lens were removed and the vitreous obtained by inverting the eyecup and gently squeezing the eye while pulling the vitreous gel out into a sterile plastic culture dish. RPE cells were isolated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] and cultured in F-10 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1% ITS culture supplement (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA).

The medium was removed from subconfluent RPE cells that were then treated with 25% vitreous in complete medium, or fresh complete medium, for various times. The cells were subconfluent at the time of treatment and were still subconfluent at the time of RNA or nuclear protein extraction.</p><p>In some experiments, medium or vitreous-containing medium was supplemented with TGF-&#x003b2;1 (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), SB431542, a TGF-beta type I receptor antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>] (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO), neutralizing pan-specific anti-TGF-&#x003b2; antibody (R&#x00026;D Systems).

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK), p38 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3) kinase were inhibited by PD98059 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), SP600125 (Sigma-Aldrich), SB203580 (Calbiochem), and LY294002 (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time quantitative PCR</title><p>RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNase on the column. Reverse transcription was carried out with 1 &#x003bc;g total RNA per 20 &#x003bc;l reaction using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and simultaneous priming with both random hexamers and oligo (dT); Ganti et al., In press. After reverse transcription, the reactions were diluted to 300 &#x003bc;l. "Negative-control" reactions without reverse transcriptase were carried out to ensure that the results were RNA dependent. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in 25 &#x003bc;l reactions using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad) with 1 &#x003bc;M of the appropriate primers, and 5 &#x003bc;l of diluted cDNA The PCR products were detected using an IQ Real Time PCR iCycler (Bio-Rad). PCR primers were designed using Oligo 6 (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO) and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Expression of ribosomal protein, large, P0 (RPLP0) mRNA was used as an internal standard (normalization/loading control). The ratio of target gene mRNA expression in treated versus untreated cells was determined according to the method of Pfaffl et al. using the Real-time Expression Software Tool for Excel (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gene-quantification.info">REST-XL</ext-link>) version 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. This method determines the changes in the target gene expression relative to changes in the internal standard (RPLP0) and corrects for differences between the efficiencies of the different primer pairs (for efficiencies, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The software applies a randomization test (2000 randomizations) to determine statistical significance of the results. Use of REST-XL analysis in the non-normalized mode showed that levels of RPLP0 gene expression did not vary significantly between control and vitreous-treated cells. Each qPCR assay was performed in quintuplicate, and the experiment was repeated at least three times with different RPE cell/vitreous donors.</p><table-wrap id="t1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Primers used for <sub>Q</sub>PCR.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="211" span="1"/><col width="231" span="1"/><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Gene</bold><hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Primers (5'-3')</bold><hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" scope="row" colspan="1">Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F: GTCCGCAACCCGACAGCA<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" colspan="1" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1">R: TCCTCCAGGGCCACATAGATG<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" scope="row" colspan="1">Metallothionein 1a (MT1a)<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F: GCGCCTTATAGCCTCTCAAC<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" colspan="1" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1">R: CAAGTTTGTGCAGGTCACTCT<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" scope="row" colspan="1">Metallothionein 2a (MT2a)<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F: ACTCTAGCCGCCTCTTCAG<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" colspan="1" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1">R: AAGTCGCGTTCTTTACATCTG<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" scope="row" colspan="1">Normalization gene: Ribosomal protein, large, PO (RPLPO)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F: TTAAACCCCCTCGTGGCAATC<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" colspan="1" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1">R: CCACATTCCCCCGGATATGA</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>F represents forward primer; R represents reverse primer.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Cells were washed with ice cold PBS and lysed with a protein extraction buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X100, 50 mM NaF, 1 &#x003bc;M sodium metavanadate, 20 &#x003bc;l protease inhibitor cocktail/ml [Pierce]).

Genes associated with inflammation and stress, including interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES), and cyclo&#x000f6;xygenase-2 (COX-2) were significantly overrepresented among the genes induced by vitreous compared to their representation in the total genes on the arrays. Vitreous treatment also resulted in increased expression of mRNAs encoding a number of anti-oxidant proteins, including HO-1 and MT-1E.

This EMT is similar to that which occurs in vivo in PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>]. Vitreous also stimulates RPE cells to express proteins associated with an inflammatory response; for example, the expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, COX-2, and mPGES is increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] (Ganti et al., In press). Increased oxidative stress is a frequent component of inflammatory disease, including in the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>], and subsequently provokes an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant response. Thus, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, upregulate antioxidant proteins, including HO-1 and MTs, as part of the resolution phase of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. Preinduction of HO-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>] or MTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>] can ameliorate inflammation and protect against apoptosis and oxidative injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>]. The observation that vitreous-treated RPE cells in culture express enhanced levels of HO-1, MT-1a, and MT-2a is consistent with these proteins being induced as part of a protective response against stress and inflammatory mediators.</p><p>There are several isoforms of HO. HO-1 is the inducible form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. This enzyme catalyzes the breakdown of heme to iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide. Biliverdin is then reduced to bilirubin (a powerful anti-oxidant) while iron (a pro-oxidant) is sequestered by ferritin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Several genes encode MTs in a tissue-specific manner but most commonly expressed are MT1 and MT2 of which there are several isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. These small multifunctional cysteine-rich proteins act as anti-oxidants by scavenging oxygen and hydroxyl radicals and as anti-apoptotic agents by inhibiting caspase-3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. HO-1 expression is elevated during inflammation resulting from the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (including TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukins 1&#x003b1;, 1&#x003b2;, 6, 8, 12, and 18 and interferon-&#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>] and many of the same cytokines also up regulate MT expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>].

Thus, these proteins provide a negative feedback during inflammation that inhibits oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>].</p><p>The importance of HO-1 and MT as anti-inflammatory agents led us to investigate the components of vitreous that may control anti-oxidant gene expression. Although vitreous comprises mainly collagen and water, it contains a number of other proteins in smaller amounts, among which are many growth factors. Many of these vitreous constituents are not well characterized, and it is unlikely that a single stimulatory molecule is responsible for the induction of HO-1 and MTs; more probable is a complex interaction between multiple factors that act synergistically to promote an anti-oxidant response. One well characterized vitreous protein, however, is TGF-&#x003b2;, which has been implicated in PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] and in EMT responses in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>]. This growth factor induces HO-1 in RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] and many other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Thus, we examined the role of TGF-&#x003b2; in the anti-oxidant response using inhibitors of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.</p><p>When TGF-&#x003b2; binds to the TGF-&#x003b2; receptor (TGF-&#x003b2;R), the TGF-&#x003b2;R type II component phosphorylates the TGF-&#x003b2;R type I component, activating its kinase activity and leading to further phosphorylation signaling events, including the activation of smad 2 and 3 transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r65">65</xref>]. SB431542 is a TGF-&#x003b2;R type I antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>], which substantially inhibits vitreous-mediated upregulation of HO-1, as does a panspecific anti-TGF-&#x003b2; neutralizing antibody. This implies that a TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent pathway plays an important role in the induction of HO-1. The fact that neither inhibitor reduces the increase in expression of HO-1 by more than 60% suggests that other pathways are also involved. This is not surprising since HO-1 mRNA expression can be controlled by multiple pathways at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Neither SB431542 nor the neutralizing antibody had any effect on vitreous-mediated MT1a or MT2a mRNA expression and thus vitreous factors other than TGF-&#x003b2; are responsible for MT mRNA induction. Moreover, TGF-&#x003b2; added to RPE cells, while inducing HO-1, had no effect on MT mRNA expression as measured by qPCR, although we previously found a weak response in RPE cells measured by Northern blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; added to RPE cells did not induce HO-1 to the level that would have been expected, given the effect of TGF-&#x003b2; inhibitors on vitreous-induction of HO-1. This could be because there are factors in vitreous that act synergistically to increase signaling via the TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent pathway.</p><p>HO-1 gene expression is frequently induced by ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] and TGF-&#x003b2; can signal via ROS generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r68">68</xref>]. It was therefore possible that vitreous could induce changes in expression of HO-1 genes via ROS generation. Several ROS quenchers decreased vitreous-mediated HO-1 mRNA expression. NAC is a glutathione analog and ROS scavenger and usually completely suppressed HO-1 upregulation by vitreous or TGF-&#x003b2;, although it had little, if any, effect on MT-1a or MT-2a mRNAs. Although NAC has been commonly used to implicate ROS in signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r69">69</xref>], it has other effects that complicate the interpretation of the data. For example, it can act directly on TGF-&#x003b2; leading to its inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Thus, the inhibition of the vitreous effect could be due to inhibition of the TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent component as well as a ROS-dependent component. Because of this, other ROS scavengers and quenchers were used, including catalase (which breaks down hydrogen peroxide), taurine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r70">70</xref>], and DMSO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r71">71</xref>]. All of these reduced vitreous-mediated induction of HO-1 expression and supported the importance of the signaling role of ROS, although none of them showed as great an effect as NAC; this would be consistent with NAC suppressing other pathway(s) besides those mediated via ROS.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; classically signals via smads, which bind to the promoters of their target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r72">72</xref>]. However, other signaling pathways via ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK are also important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. Although these MAPK pathways often transmit growth factor, extracellular matrix and cytokine signals, respectively, there is cross-talk between them that is particularly evident between the p38 and JNK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r73">73</xref>]. These signaling pathways participate in the control of HO-1 expression in a number of cell systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. In human RPE cells, the PI3 kinase and MEK 44/42 pathways appear not to be involved in the control of HO-1 expression by vitreous, as judged by the lack of effect of LY294002 and PD98059, respectively, whereas inhibitors of the JNK and the p38MAPK pathways (SP600125 and SB203580) reduced vitreous-meditated HO-1 mRNA expression. P38 MAPK can be activated by TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r74">74</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r76">76</xref>] and mediates some of its effects in a smad-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r75">75</xref>], AP-1-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r77">77</xref>]. JNK can also be activated by TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r76">76</xref>] and regulates the activity of AP-1 transcription factor complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r78">78</xref>] (as well as smads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r79">79</xref>]) by phosphorylation. These data suggest the possibility that vitreous and TGF-&#x003b2; might induce their anti-oxidant responses via AP-1 activation.</p><p>AP-1 complexes consist of homo- or hetero dimers of basic leucine zipper family members, including c-jun, c-fos, and several other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r81">81</xref>]. We found vitreous caused an increase in AP-1 site binding activity, and that part of this was associated with complexes containing c-fos. Vitreous also caused an increase in c-fos mRNA and protein expression and translocation of c-fos to the nucleus. This is important because AP-1 activity has been implicated in expression of HO-1 and MTs. The promoter region of the HO-1 gene has many transcription factor binding sites, including those for AP-1, leading to complex regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r82">82</xref>]. MT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r83">83</xref>] and MT-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r84">84</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r86">86</xref>] promoters also contain AP-1 binding sites. Studies of enhanced HO-1 and MT expression as a result of oxidative stress and inflammation often implicate AP-1 transcription factor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r87">87</xref>] and, although the promoter elements that control TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated HO-1 induction have not been identified, AP-1 activation has been implicated in the induction of several other TGF-&#x003b2;-responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r89">89</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our data show that vitreous can initiate an anti-oxidant response in human RPE cells, as exemplified by an increase in HO-1 and MT expression. It is likely that TGF-&#x003b2; and ROS signaling participate in the induction of HO-1 by vitreous, and that the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways are involved. Both p38 and JNK target AP-1 transcription factor complexes and, since AP-1 is important to the regulation of HO-1 and MT in other systems, it is possible it is involved in the vitreous-mediated response. In contrast, the pathway for MT induction by vitreous is quite different and does not utilize TGF-&#x003b2; or ROS signaling and does not involve p38 or JNK signaling.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Eye Institute Grants EY12711 (D.M.H.) and EY10516 (R.H.).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Strauss</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The retinal pigment epithelium in visual function.</article-title><source>Physiol Rev</source><year>2005</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>845</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15987797</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="book">Campochiaro PA.
