Nevertheless, since brains of higher primates have evolved rapidly, one might expect acceleration in DNA sequence evolution in their brain-expressed genes. In this study, we carried out full-length cDNA sequencing on the brain transcriptome of an Old World monkey (OWM) and then conducted three-way comparisons among (i) mouse, OWM, and human, and (ii) OWM, chimpanzee, and human. Although brain-expressed genes indeed appear to evolve more rapidly in species with more advanced brains (apes &#x0003e; OWM &#x0003e; mouse), a similar lineage effect is observable for most other genes. The broad inclusion of genes in the reference set to represent the genomic average is therefore critical to this type of analysis. Calibrated against the genomic average, the rate of evolution among brain-expressed genes is probably lower (or at most equal) in humans than in chimpanzee and OWM. Interestingly, the trend of slow evolution in coding sequence is no less pronounced among brain-specific genes, vis-&#x000e0;-vis brain-expressed genes in general. The human brain may thus differ from those of our close relatives in two opposite directions: (i) faster evolution in gene expression, and (ii) a likely slowdown in the evolution of protein sequences. Possible explanations and hypotheses are discussed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>When calibrated against the genomic average, the rate of evolution among brain-expressed genes in humans is probably lower than or equal to that of other closely related primates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Whether comparing morphology or cognitive ability, it is clear that the human brain has evolved rapidly relative to that of other primates. But the extent to which genes expressed in the brain also reflect this overall pattern is unclear. To address this question, it's necessary to measure any variations in the DNA sequences of these genes between human and chimpanzee. And, to do this as accurately as possible, it's also important to require an appropriate reference group to act as a benchmark against which the differences can be measured. We therefore compared publicly available genomic sequences of chimps and humans with complementary DNA sequences of several thousand genes expressed in the brain of another closely related primate&#x02014;the macaque, an Old World monkey&#x02014;as well as the more distantly related mouse. Our analyses of the rates of protein evolution in these species suggest that genes expressed in the human brain have in fact slowed down in their evolution since the split between human and chimpanzee, contrary to some previously published reports. We suggest that advanced brains are driven primarily by the increasing complexity in the network of gene interactions. As a result, brain-expressed genes are constrained in their sequence evolution, although their expression levels may change rapidly.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Wang HY, Chien HC, Osada N, Hashimoto K, Sugano S, et al.

The hypothesis that sequence evolution might have sped up in humans has been bolstered by the observation of rapid evolution in the expression levels of genes in the human brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

Because this study was based on comparison with a small set of &#x0201c;housekeeping genes,&#x0201d; the possibility that the control group, rather than the brain-expressed genes, deviate from the norm has to be carefully evaluated.</p><p>For comparative studies, we obtained high-quality full-length cDNAs from the brain of an Old World monkey (OWM) (a cynomolgus monkey, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Macaca fascicularis</named-content>) for two reasons. First, the OWM is well positioned for two types of three-way comparisons: mouse&#x02013;OWM&#x02013;human and OWM&#x02013;human&#x02013;chimpanzee. Second, high-quality brain cDNAs can be ethically obtained from OWMs under controlled conditions. We sequenced clones of full-length cDNA libraries from different regions of the brain (frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and brain stem; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cloning and Sequencing of Brain-Expressed Genes in the Cynomolgus Monkey</title><p>In total, 60,000 cDNA clones were subjected to 5&#x02032;-end sequencing, and 19,400 different transcription units were identified. Among these transcription units, 4,600 clones were randomly chosen for full-insert sequencing. The average length of these cDNAs after sequencing was 1,770 bp. Among them, 65&#x00025;, or 2,996, matched RefSeq entries. The rest of the sequences matched either human expressed sequence tags or human genomic sequences. With redundancy excluded, the number of protein-coding sequences in our dataset was 2,498, with the average coding sequence (CDS) being 335 codons in length. Most of the sequences (1,774, or 75&#x00025;) had more than 50&#x00025; of their length in CDS. These cDNA sequences played a central role in delineating the brain-expressed genes analyzed in this report.</p><p>In this dataset, 2,170 (87&#x00025;) of the cDNAs matched at least one of the functional categories, the top 19 of which are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-st001">Table S1</xref>. Brain appears to express more genes in the categories of intracellular protein traffic and protein targeting and localization, but fewer genes in the categories of developmental process and cell proliferation/differentiation, when compared with the genome-wide distribution. This is consistent with the known functional requirements of the mammalian brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Brain-Expressed Genes Have Evolved More Slowly Than Other Genes in the Genome</title><p>We calculated the number of substitutions per site for synonymous sites (Ks) and nonsynonymous sites (Ka) for each brain cDNA and the genome-wide collections of CDSs of mouse and rhesus monkey <italic>(M. mulatta)</italic>. The averages are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t001">Table 1</xref>. The cDNA samples were collected from four different regions of the brain, and although the evolutionary rates varied somewhat among different regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-st002">Table S2</xref>), the differences were not significant. Therefore, genes from different regions were pooled in the following evolutionary analyses.</p><p>The average Ka/Ks ratio for brain cDNAs was 0.133 and 0.087 for the human&#x02013;OWM and human&#x02013;mouse comparisons, respectively. We also calculated genome-wide Ka/Ks ratios for the same comparisons (0.177 and 0.138, respectively), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t001">Table 1</xref>.

Furthermore, calculation of Ka/Ks ratio for each of 19 functional categories suggests that this slower evolution among brain-expressed genes is &#x0201c;global&#x0201d; across all functional categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). An exception are the genes of &#x0201c;electron transport,&#x0201d; which appear to have evolved unusually fast in the human&#x02013;OWM comparison. In this category of genes, the subunits of COX and the electron transport chain components have previously been documented to be fast evolving &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Another important point (the relevance of which will become clear in the Discussion) is that the slower evolution reported here was true for both brain-expressed genes and brain-specific genes, the latter being expressed exclusively or mainly in the brain. In general, tissue-specific genes evolve more rapidly than non-tissue-specific genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; as the latter are expected to experience broader selective constraints. This trend apparently is not true among brain-expressed genes identified by microarray hybridization experiments. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we compare genes expressed in any combination of brain, muscle, and liver (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Genes are classified into seven categories&#x02014;those expressed in only one of the three tissues, those expressed in two of the three tissues (three categories for each), and those expressed in all three tissues (one category). Genes expressed in the brain tended to have a lower Ka/Ks, and genes that are expressed only in the brain, but not in the liver or muscle, had the lowest Ka/Ks. This observation is in agreement with Khaitovich et al.'s &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; recent study. The set of genes expressed in both brain and liver had the highest Ka/Ks among the brain-expressed gene categories, but this set was also the smallest and, hence, least statistically informative.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Apparent Faster Evolution of Brain-Expressed Genes in Humans in the Absence of Calibration</title><p>We next calculated the number of lineage-specific substitutions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref>A (human versus OWM, with mouse as the outgroup) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref>B (human versus chimpanzee, with OWM as the outgroup). To separate synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, we used the method of Yang &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The rates of protein evolution among brain-expressed genes for human and OWM lineages are not significantly different (Ka/Ks &#x0003d; 0.122 versus 0.113; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The rate along the mouse lineage, at 0.092, is significantly lower than those in the other two lineages (<italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>).</p><p>Because humans and OWMs have been separated from each other for more than 30 million years, changes in the last few million years in, say, the human lineage would be difficult to detect. To see the lineage effects more clearly, we used the smaller phylogeny of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref>B among human, chimpanzee, and OWM. In this comparison, Ka/Ks ratios in both the human and chimpanzee lineages are higher than that along the OWM lineage (about 0.160 versus 0.130; <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref> depicts unrooted trees and the line to the outgroup (mouse or OWM) depicts the distance from the common ancestor of human/OWM or human/chimpanzee to mouse or OWM, respectively.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref> appears to support the simple expectation, based on the phenotypic divergence of the brains, that the rate of molecular evolution follows the order apes &#x0003e; OWM &#x0003e; mouse. This conclusion is of course tentative, as it is necessary to have a proper calibration against a group of reference genes (i.e., non-brain-expressed genes). Not surprisingly, this calibration is where most studies diverge. For example, if the set of reference genes is small, one may mistakenly conclude there has been rapid evolution of brain-expressed genes when, in fact, it is the reference genes that have evolved slowly (In a previous study, Dorus et al. used only 99 slowly evolving genes for reference &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.) In what follows, we used either 4,840 or 14,204 genes as the genomic average for reference.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Slower Evolution of Brain-Expressed Genes in Humans, Calibrated against the Genomic Average</title><p>To calibrate the distant phylogenetic comparisons of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref>A among human, OWM, and mouse, we used 9,488 genes for the genomic average (including 1,469 brain-expressed genes). In this set of reference genes&#x02014;like for the brain-expressed genes&#x02014;Ka/Ks ratios for primates were greater than that for mouse (0.161 and 0.150 versus 0.130, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the accelerated protein evolution reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g002">Figure 2</xref>A (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t002">Table 2</xref>) is a genome-wide phenomenon. When we take the Ka/Ks ratio of brain-expressed genes, &#x0005b;Ka/Ks&#x0005d;<sub>B</sub>, divided by that of the genome average, &#x0005b;Ka/Ks&#x0005d;<sub>G</sub>, the ratios are 75.8&#x00025;, 75.3&#x00025;, and 70.8&#x00025; in the lineages of human, OWM, and mouse, respectively. Calibrated against the genome average, brain-expressed genes may indeed have evolved faster in primates than in the lineage to mouse. However, the large phylogenetic distance between rodents and primates makes this estimation less robust and less interpretable than the differences between the two primates. Between them, there is no sign of acceleration in the human lineage.</p><p>We computed the Ka/Ks ratios along the lineages to human, chimpanzee, and OWM. There are currently two large sets of chimpanzee sequences&#x02014;the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium (&#x0201c;Consortium&#x0201d;) sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; and the Celera sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. When either dataset is used as the benchmark for the genomic average, the results agree qualitatively. The quantitative differences have turned out to be informative (see below), and they, again, illustrate the importance of calibration against the genomic average. For each dataset, we selected the chimpanzee genes that overlap with the OWM and human datasets for comparison (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>The Consortium sequences.</title><p>In this dataset, the genomic averages of Ka/Ks in human and chimpanzee were both higher than that in OWM (0.219 and 0.213 versus 0.172, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t003">Table 3</xref>). The acceleration in the genomic average matches that in the brain-expressed genes such that the brain/genome ratios (&#x0005b;Ka/Ks&#x0005d;<sub>B</sub>/&#x0005b;Ka/Ks&#x0005d;<sub>G</sub>) are all around 75&#x00025;.

Note that the set of brain-expressed genes is not the same as that in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t003">Table 3</xref> because the two sets of chimpanzee sequences have different overlaps with our collection of brain-expressed genes. The slowdown in the brain/genome ratio in humans is pronounced, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t004">Table 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>The combined analysis of the Consortium and Celera datasets.</title><p>The differences between the two sets are largely due to gene selection, as the overlap is modest. Furthermore, for the same genes, the Celera dataset sometimes does not include all the exons. With respect to quality control, low-quality bases (quality score &#x0003c; 20) were masked for Consortium sequences, but quality scores are not available for Celera sequences. Nevertheless, because the Celera sequences have slightly lower Ks values, the differences cannot be attributed to possible higher error rates in that dataset.</p><p>The reason for the seemingly inconsistent results between the two datasets is due primarily to the differential inclusion of very slowly evolving genes along the human and chimpanzee lineages (Ka &#x0003c; 0.002). In the Celera dataset, genes with Ka &#x0003d; 0 are overrepresented, compared with the Consortium dataset, whereas the overrepresentation is reversed for genes with 0 &#x0003c; Ka &#x0003c; 0.002 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Among these genes, stochastic fluctuation is probably too large to reveal any lineage effect between human and chimpanzee. Indeed, when these very slowly evolving genes are removed from the analysis, the discrepancy disappears. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050013-t005">Table 5</xref>, we show the analysis of the combined Celera/Consortium datasets, consisting of genes with Ka &#x0003e; 0.002.

An increase in the Ka/Ks value across the genome is thus expected. Another study of a set of 201 brain genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; also reported more nonsynonymous substitutions in the human lineage than in the chimpanzee lineage, although the difference was not significant and was not calibrated against synonymous changes.</p><p>What then may account for the slow sequence evolution among brain-expressed genes, when calibrated against the genomic average, in species with more advanced brains? We shall first discuss potential biases in the observations, then we will address this question.</p><p>First, our sampling might be biased toward more abundantly transcribed genes; such highly expressed genes may be slowly evolving &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. We used two different sources of expression studies to correlate the Ka/Ks ratios of genes and their expression levels. In both cases, the correlation coefficient was very low, with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x02264; 0.01 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for details). Furthermore, in the comparisons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g001">Figure 1</xref>, genes were chosen from brain, liver, and muscle by the same expression criteria, and yet brain-expressed genes were still the most slowly evolving ones.</p><p>Second, sampling of brain-expressed genes could have been biased toward certain categories of genes, which may happen to be slowly evolving. For example, housekeeping genes, which generally evolve slowly, might be disproportionately represented in our collection. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-sg001">Figure S1</xref>, the slowdown was observed across all known categories of genes, thus alleviating this concern.</p><p>Another potential concern is the differences between tissue-expressed and tissue-specific genes. One might argue that the accelerated morphological changes in the human brain could be correlated with the accelerated evolution of only brain-specific (but not all brain-expressed) genes. Positive selection probably works most effectively on tissue-specific genes, as there would be fewer conflicting requirements among tissues to meet. Indeed, positive selection probably accounts for the rapid evolution of genes specifically expressed in male reproductive tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. However, brains appear to be different, as brain-specific genes evolved even more slowly than brain-expressed genes between human and mouse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050013-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We also analyzed 262 brain-specific genes in primates (from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hugeindex.org">http://www.hugeindex.org</ext-link>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-st003">Table S3</xref>, brain-specific genes evolved even more slowly than brain-expressed genes in each of the lineages to macaque, chimpanzee, and human.</p><p>When tissue-specific genes evolve more slowly than the rest of the genome, the explanation is most likely a stronger selective constraint in that tissue. In such a case, all genes expressed in that tissue should experience some of those constraints. Brain-expressed and brain-specific genes may all be slowly evolving for reasons of shared constraints. It seems possible that the stronger selective pressure on brain-expressed genes is the consequence of the higher complexity of the biochemical network in the brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies from yeast and nematode also showed that proteins with more interacting partners evolved more slowly (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, but see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;). The increase in selective pressure could result from a more diverse biochemical environment of the brain. Mutations would not be tolerated if they disrupted the existing interactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>While human cerebral cortex is severalfold larger than that of chimpanzee, it contains only 50&#x00025; more neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. As RNA abundance is relatively constant per gram of brain tissue &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, transcript abundance per neuron must be greater in the human than in the chimpanzee brain.

On the basis of individual neurons of the brain, humans may indeed have a more active, or even more complex, transcription profile than chimpanzees.</p><p>We suggest that such abundant and complex transcription may increase gene&#x02013;gene interactions and constrain CDS evolution. Can this constraint of complex interactions then be compatible with the apparent rapid evolution in the expression of brain genes in humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;? The mechanistic basis for protein&#x02013;protein interaction driving protein sequence evolution may be quite different from that of protein&#x02013;DNA interaction driving expression profile differentiation. Guss et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; presented a case where a change in the protein sequence of a selector gene could change the expression of the entire regulatory network. This type of large-scale trans-regulation may be a characteristic of brain-expressed genes. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, we compare the level of nucleotide changes associated with expression differences in genes. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050013-st004">Table S4</xref> suggests that brain-expressed genes may be under more extensive trans-regulation than their liver counterparts.</p><p>Our results do not contradict the finding of accelerated amino acid changes in some brain-expressed genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050013-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.
