Their intrinsic cleavage activity makes them theoretically superior to traditional antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) in terms of inhibitory capacity. Recent advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c3">3</xref>) have extended the range of targets so far that virtually any limited stretch of RNA is now likely to contain a useful target. However, other problems, including methods of delivery and target site selection, remain to be solved. The latter, in particular, appears to be a critical step in the design of antisense or ribozyme molecules for suppression of target gene expression, as there may exist only a few sites within any mRNA that are accessible to hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c5">5</xref>). We have compared two commonly employed methods for the rational selection of target sites, secondary structure prediction and <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> accessibility assays. As target we have used the mRNA for a novel human protein kinase, PSKH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c6">6</xref>).</p><p>RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms based mainly on energy minimization have intrinsic limitations, although subject to continuous improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c8">8</xref>). An established theory for selection of target sites based on predicted structure is also required. The possible modulation of RNA structures by protein binding <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c10">10</xref>) cannot yet be modeled and has so far limited their use in designing antisense ODNs or ribozymes. A positive correlation between the inhibitory effect of an antisense RNA and low local folding potential has been noted (high &#x00394;<italic>G</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c11">11</xref>). Together with more recent data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c14">14</xref>), this suggests that extended single-stranded or unstructured regions may be the best targets for antisense ODNs. However, although ribozymes targeting predicted loop regions have proved efficacious in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c16">16</xref>), there are also examples of failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c17">17</xref>). A recent systematic analysis of the hybridization of tRNA-Phe to a set of complementary ODNs determined that all high-yield heteroduplexes involved RNA sequences forming both double-stranded stems and single-stranded regions, and that bases of the latter regions were often stacked onto the stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c18">18</xref>). This suggests the requirement for at least some degree of helical conformation in the secondary structures of favorable targets.</p><p>The accessibility of different stretches of the mRNA for hybridization with short antisense ODNs may be determined <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> by RNase H-mediated cleavage of the RNA at regions where the ODNs hybridize to the target transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c22">22</xref>). Screening of a large set of ODNs targeting potential ribozyme cleavage sites has been employed to select the most promising sites for ribozyme targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c19">19</xref>). Accessibility assays with specific ODNs have also been performed in cell extracts on endogenous transcripts in order to better approximate the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c22">22</xref>). The most accessible sites within any target RNA may be selected by performing the RNase H-assay with a randomized set of ODNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c21">21</xref>) or with a target-specific set of cDNA fragments prepared by partial DNase I-digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c23">23</xref>). ODN libraries in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c21">21</xref>) have been more or less completely randomized. We wanted to identify specific sites amenable to cleavage with standard hammerhead ribozymes, and to restrict the analysis to those triplets that are cleaved most efficiently. Since the hammerhead ribozyme seems to prefer a purine in the first position of the cleavage triplet and a C or an A in the third position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c24">24</xref>), we decided to concentrate on the triplets GUC, GUA, AUC and AUA in our analysis. Four ODN libraries, each specific for one of these cleavage triplets, were synthesized and used to screen <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed PSKH1 RNA for accessible sites.</p><p>Based on a study of the most active ribozymes expressed <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> from a randomized library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c25">25</xref>), the ribozymes used in the present study were designed to have symmetric 8&#x0002b;8 nt arms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c26">26</xref>). Chemically synthesized ribozymes of similar arm lengths have subsequently been successfully employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c29">29</xref>). The stem II structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f1">1</xref>) was chosen to be 2bp long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c30">30</xref>). The activity of such truncated ribozymes in cell culture has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c29">29</xref>). For increased nuclease stability of the ribozymes, we have retained unmodified ribonucleotides in only five catalytically important positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c32">32</xref>). Deoxyribonucleotides were used in the flanking arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c34">34</xref>) and 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-alkylated ribonucleotides in the core and stem&#x02013;loop II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c35">35</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f1">1</xref>). Nuclease stability of ribozymes was increased further by an inverted thymidine at the 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c32">32</xref>) and by a hexanol moiety at the extreme 5&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c36">36</xref>). Ribozymes used <italic>in vivo</italic> frequently include short stretches of phosphorothioate linkages at the 5&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c29">29</xref>), 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c34">34</xref>) or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c27">27</xref>) for stabilization against exonucleases. We included two phosphorothioates at the 5&#x02032;-end and one at the 3&#x02032;-end. DNA nucleotides in the arms have been reported to increase catalytic efficiencies of ribozymes <italic>in vitro</italic>, most likely due to increased product dissociation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c39">39</xref>). DNA-armed ribozymes may recruit RNase H activity upon hybridization with the target RNA and thus enhance their apparent activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c40">40</xref>). We are here primarily interested in the accessibility of cleavage sites. Anything that reduces the importance of intrinsic ribozyme cleavage activity and increases the importance of target-specific inhibition of expression is desirable.</p><p>Cellular delivery of ribozymes is commonly accomplished with various cationic liposome formulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c29">29</xref>). We have used the cationic liposome reagent lipofectamine to co-transfect HeLa cells with a mixture of ribozyme, a firefly luciferase reporter gene construct containing the complete coding cDNA of the target PSKH1, and a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase-encoding plasmid serving as an internal transfection control. We have succeeded in constructing a ribozyme against PSKH1 mRNA which reduced the activity of the corresponding reporter gene to 20&#x02013;25&#x00025; in a concentration dependent manner. A correlation is observed with certain features of the predicted secondary structure of the target mRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs.</p><sec><title>Synthesis and purification of hammerhead ribozymes</title><p>Automated RNA and DNA synthesis was carried out on an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA&#x0002f;RNA synthesizer. 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-Alkyl ribozymes containing five unmodified purine ribonucleotides were synthesized by solid phase &#x003b2;-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c41">41</xref>), using the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-<italic>tert</italic>-butyldimethylsilyl protection strategy for the ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c43">43</xref>).

A stock dilution of RNA in buffer was heated to 95&#x000b0;C for 60 s and then preincubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min before adding enzyme. An 8.0 &#x000b5;l mixture of RNA, buffer and enzyme was then mixed with 2.0 &#x000b5;l 200 &#x000b5;M ODN library, yielding the indicated final concentrations of components.

The MFold program generated many suboptimal secondary structures that differed minimally in energy from the optimal folding. Although these secondary structures displayed varying degrees of folding differences, certain substructures could be identified that demonstrated a considerable degree of conservation. High conservation of these substructures among alternate suboptimal structures may increase their likelihood of being &#x02018;true&#x02019; structures (i.e. contained in the actual secondary structure of the mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>). Therefore, in selecting GUC sites for hammerhead ribozyme targeting, we have screened 10 optimal and suboptimal secondary structures of the first 1.0 kb of the PSKH1 transcript, as transcribed from pTRE-PSK-Luc, for recurring substructures. All selected target sites were located within identical substructures in at least six out of the 10 most energetically stable structures, including the optimal structure (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb1">1</xref>). For some target sites, several of the suboptimal structures diverged only slightly from the consensus in ways that did not significantly change the basic characteristics of the substructure. Due to the lack of a consensus on what kind of structures make the best targets, we have chosen GUC targets (guc238, guc287, guc519 and guc712) that are predicted to be located within very different substructures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f2">2</xref>). The guc238 cleavage triplet is located within a large internally looped stem in which the 5&#x02032; arm (stem&#x000a0;I) of the corresponding ribozyme is complementary to the nucleotides of the loop. The guc287 target sequence, on the other hand, is predicted to fold into a short stem&#x02013;loop structure. The guc519 target site is located at the end of what is essentially a very long basepaired region that is interrupted by occasional short bulges. A ribozyme was also designed targeting guc712, located at a particularly stable hairpin structure at the end of a very long, and presumably very stable, stem. This target site was included due to the high conservation of its secondary structure among suboptimal structures of the target RNA (identical in 10 out of 10 and 19 out of the 20 energetically most favorable structures). In addition to the above target sites, the first GUC site in the RNA (guc118) was selected due to its close proximity to the translation initiation region (only ~20 nt downstream of the initiation codon). This region has often been targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c48">48</xref>) because the RNA in this region might be relatively open due to the need for binding of the components of the translation machinery. The predicted secondary structure for the guc118 target consists of a stem with two internal loops (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> accessibility assays with semi-randomized ODN libraries and specific ODNs</title><p>Target triplet-specific, semi-randomized ODN libraries were used to screen <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed PSKH1 RNA for hybridization-accessible GUC, GUA, AUC and AUA sites. Accessible sites were identified by RNase H-mediated cleavage of the RNA at the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids generated by hybridization of antisense ODNs to target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c21">21</xref>). Screening of a 1.03 kb PSKH1 transcript from the pcDNA3-PSK plasmid was performed separately with each of the four ODN libraries (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f3">3</xref>A). Since the transcript was uniformly labeled, cleavage at any position produced two cleavage products. This complicated the interpretation of the data since each pair of cleavage fragments suggested two possible sites of cleavage. Screening reactions were subsequently performed on a longer RNA transcript (1.37&#x000a0;kb) that differed from the first transcript in its 3&#x02032;-end. This facilitated the interpretation of cleavage data, as 5&#x02032; cleavage fragments were identical for the two RNAs. Screening of two differently sized transcripts increased confidence in the results. Any accessible sites that are not identified in the longer transcript are likely to be due to structural features of the specific transcript that may not be represented in the full-length mRNA. Such sites are more likely to be encountered at the ends of the transcripts since the local folding of these regions will be most strongly affected by the lack or presence of additional sequences. Consequently, any cleavage sites originating within the first or last 200 nt of the transcript were ignored in the selection of accessible sites by library screening, as were cleavage sites that could not be detected in the longer transcript.</p><p>The screening assays demonstrated several reproducible cleavage sites that obeyed the above restrictions. Most cleavage sites were identified with the GUA and GUC libraries, while no useful sites were identified with the AUA library (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f3">3</xref>A). Screening of PSKH1 RNA with the GUA library produced two very prominent cleavage fragments that were not produced by any of the other libraries, demonstrating their GUA triplet specificity. The sizes of these two fragments were estimated at ~615 and 405 nt. Their combined estimated size of 1020 nt was in good agreement with the transcript length (which was 1030 nt). The shorter fragment was shown to be the 5&#x02032; cleavage fragment, as it was also present when screening the longer RNA transcript (data not shown). The size of this fragment was consistent with cleavage near a site corresponding to position 460 in the PSKH1 cDNA. Examination of the sequence indicated a suitable GUA triplet at position 463&#x02013;465 as the only probable site of cleavage. Screening with the GUC library produced six closely spaced fragments with estimated sizes ranging from 470 to 560 nt which fitted nicely into three pairs with combined sizes of the expected length (1020&#x02013;1030 nt). By a similar analysis as for the GUA library cleavage fragments, the putative cleavage sites were identified as guc519, guc539 and guc548, respectively. One of these sites, guc519, had previously also been selected on the basis of MFold secondary structure predictions (see above) prior to the antisense library screening. The AUC library screening also produced several fragment pairs, but these were either weaker than their GUA and GUC counterparts, or could not be unambiguously assigned to a specific triplet. The screening assays were performed with a ratio of ODN (40 &#x000b5;M) to target RNA (50 nM) of 800:1, which given the complexity (4<sup>10</sup> &#x0003d; 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) of the libraries corresponds to a ratio of specific ODN (40&#x000a0;pmol) to RNA of roughly 1:1250. This might seem too low a ratio to reasonably account for the degree of cleavage observed. However, the observed cleavage would correspond to a turnover of only ~100 molecules&#x0002f;h. Furthermore, the concentration of ODNs that can productively hybridize to a given target site may be significantly higher as mismatches corresponding to the ends of the ODNs are not expected to severely impair hybridization efficiency. Non-triplet-specific cleavage events (involving ODNs with mismatched or wobble-paired triplets, as well as partial hybridization of only the random-armed portions) may also conceivably occur, although they are less likely to account for the major cleavage events. Non-specific cleavage events would also be expected to result from screening with more than just one library. Examples of such cleavage events were observed, but did not include the selected cleavage sites. Nonetheless, to ensure that putative ribozyme target sites were properly identified, the provisional identifications were subsequently confirmed by cleavage of the RNA with the corresponding specific antisense ODNs. In all cases, the cleavage fragments produced by the specific ODNs co-migrated with the corresponding cleavage fragments produced by the library screenings (data not shown). These results demonstrate the utility of triplet-specific semi-randomized ODN libraries in identifying potential target sites.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> cleavage assays were performed with specific ODNs against all sites targeted by ribozymes to investigate whether the sites that were selected by library screening were more accessible than target sites selected by alternative means. The specific ODNs, like those of the semi-randomized libraries, were designed to have the same recognition sequences as a corresponding hypothetical 6&#x0002b;6 armed hammerhead ribozyme. The <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assays demonstrated that all the ODNs targeting sites that were selected by library screening resulted in stronger cleavage than the best among the ODNs targeting sites selected by theoretical&#x0002f;structural considerations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f3">3</xref>B). Furthermore, the strongest cleavage was achieved with the ODN (O-465) corresponding to the GUA site that was cleaved most strongly in the library screenings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f3">3</xref>A). Thus accessibility data obtained from library screening assays were representative for the hybridization efficiencies of the corresponding unique ODNs. Consequently, major cleavage events do not appear to be substantially influenced by the presence of non-specific ODNs in the library screening. This suggests that neither positive nor negative cooperativity of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c49">49</xref>) occurs to a significant degree under our assay conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular uptake of ribozyme</title><p>FITC-labeled control ribozymes were used to investigate the cellular uptake of ribozyme under the optimized co-transfection conditions by spectroscopy. In order to distinguish between intracellular uptake and membrane association by spectroscopic analysis, uptake experiments were performed in parallel by incubating cells on ice as well as at 37&#x000b0;C. Similar amounts of MRz-FITC and ARz-FITC ribozymes were found to be associated with cells following incubation both on ice (26&#x02013;28&#x00025; of total added ribozyme) and at 37&#x000b0;C (58&#x02013;59&#x00025; of added ribozyme) (data not shown). The increase in cell-associated fluorescence at the higher temperature, suggests that in excess of 30&#x00025; of ribozyme has been internalized. The cellular association of ribozyme following incubation on ice was shown to have a linear dependency on ribozyme concentration in the range 0&#x02013;100 nM (data not shown). This is consistent with a state of equilibrium between membrane-bound and free (in medium) ribozyme. Assuming that this equilibrium is maintained upon internalization of ribozyme at the permissive temperature, the amount of internalized ribozyme is determined by the formula <italic>I</italic> &#x0003d; <italic>T</italic>(&#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b1;)&#x0002f;(<italic>T&#x02013;</italic>&#x003b1;), where <italic>T</italic> is the total amount of ribozyme added to cells, and &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are the measured cell-associations upon incubation on ice and at 37&#x000b0;C, respectively. Net uptake of ribozyme under the given transfection conditions was estimated at 42&#x02013;45&#x00025; (data not shown). Co-transfection optimization experiments performed at various w&#x0002f;w ratios (1:1 to 6:1) of lipofectamine to total nucleic acids demonstrated that uptake was only slightly influenced by lipofectamine concentration above a certain threshold (2:1 w&#x0002f;w ratio) that constitutes a molar excess of positive charges (from cationic liposomes) in the complexation mixture. Below this threshold (at a 1:1 w&#x0002f;w ratio, yielding complexes of net negative charge), uptake was severely impaired (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy of ribozymes in co-transfection experiments in HeLa cells</title><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> efficiency of the selected ribozymes was evaluated in a cell culture assay in which 100 nM of ribozyme was co-transfected with a plasmid coding for a PSKH1&#x02013;luciferase fusion protein. In order to correlate for transfection variability and improve experimental reproducibility, a plasmid coding for <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Rluc) under the control of an EF1&#x003b1;-promoter was added to the transfection mixture as an internal control. This control proved to be essential as the general expression levels of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase varied up to 2&#x02013;3-fold within the same experiment for different ribozymes (data not shown). Experiments were performed as far as possible with the full complement of ribozymes of identical chemistry so that in each experiment, the efficacies of ribozymes were compared under identical conditions. In each experiment, the relative firefly luciferase activity for all ribozymes was normalized to the levels for the control ribozyme (the expression of which was set at 100&#x00025;). Normalization was always performed relative to the relevant control ribozyme. The data from experiments with both methylated and allylated ribozymes are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f4">4</xref>. The most effective methylated ribozyme in co-transfection assays proved to be MRz-287, targeting guc287. This ribozyme reduced the level (normalized) of luciferase expressed from the reporter gene to ~23&#x00025; of the control levels, i.e. the levels in cells treated with irrelevant control ribozyme. The second most efficient ribozyme was MRz-519, which resulted in ~65&#x00025; inhibition of expression. The ribozymes targeting sites guc118 and guc548, exhibited similar inhibitory effects, with residual expression levels just over 40&#x00025;. At the other end of the spectrum we find the ribozymes targeting guc712 and guc539, which result in only ~30&#x00025; inhibition.</p><p>Three of the ribozymes were synthesized also in the allylated version to evaluate any systematic differences in inhibitory capacity of methylated and allylated ribozymes. The effect of the allylated ribozymes varied over a relatively wide range, resulting in residual reporter gene expression ranging from ~35&#x00025; for ARz-519 to 95&#x00025; for ARz-539 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f4">4</xref>). Comparing the data for these ribozymes with those of their methylated counterparts, we observed the same activity ranking. For both types of modification a ribozyme targeting the guc519 cleavage site was superior to the ribozymes targeting the two other sites, gua465 and guc539, of which the latter site appeared to be least amenable to cleavage. This constitutes evidence that the observed inhibitory effects of these ribozymes are sequence specific. The difference in activity of methylated and allylated versions of otherwise identical ribozymes varies with the target of the ribozymes. While the two types of ribozymes targeting guc519 are equally active, the allylated ribozymes targeting gua465 and guc539 are less active than their methylated counterparts. The combined data suggest that methylation generally results in superior ribozymes and, further, that the allyl modification seems to be more detrimental to ribozyme efficacy when targeting poorly accessible sites. Reduced efficacy of allylated ribozymes is not due to differences in intracellular uptake, as the methylated and the allylated FITC-labeled ribozyme were internalized to the same level by lipofectamine-mediated transfection (see uptake experiments).</p></sec><sec><title>Ribozyme effects depend on ribozyme concentration and target gene promoter strength</title><p>The concentration dependence of the ribozyme effect was investigated in co-transfection experiments in which the concentration of the active anti-PSKH1 ribozyme was varied and the total concentration of ribozyme adjusted to 100 nM with control ribozyme. For dose-dependence experiments, the most active allylated (ARz-519) and methylated (MRz-287) ribozymes were selected. These experiments confirmed the dose-dependence of the ribozyme effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f5">5</xref>A). We next wanted to investigate whether increasing the steady-state target gene expression would reduce the specific inhibitory effect of ribozymes. Higher expression of the reporter was achieved by placing it under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter in the pcDNA3 expression plasmid. This resulted in 20-fold enhancement of reporter expression (data not shown) compared to the weaker tetracycline-responsive promoter. In co-transfection experiments, this increase in reporter expression was accompanied by reduced apparent efficiencies of three of the most active PSKH1 ribozymes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f5">5</xref>B). The average levels of inhibition of target gene expression with the weak promoter were 73, 63 and 51&#x00025; for ribozymes MRz-287, MRz-519 and MRz-548, respectively. With the strong promoter, yielding the 20-fold higher expression of reporter (measured in control ribozyme-treated cells), their inhibitory activities were 60, 43 and 33&#x00025;, respectively. Thus the inhibitory effect of ribozymes, as expected, was dependent on the concentrations of both ribozyme and target, but the ribozymes were able to inhibit almost completely the 20-fold increase in the target mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparing ribozymes selected by MFold secondary structure prediction and <italic>in vitro</italic> accessibility assays</title><p>Ribozymes were ranked based on their inhibitory activity in co-transfection assays, with tied ranks given to ribozymes resulting in residual expression levels differing by &#x0003c;3&#x00025; (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb2">2</xref>). This classification can be used to assess the relative merits of the two methods of target site selection. The four ribozymes that were selected on the basis of library screening data (MRz-465, MRz-519, MRz-539, MRz-548) were compared to those selected on the basis of structural considerations (MRz-118, MRz-238, MRz-287, MRz-519, MRz-712) by Wilcoxon&#x02019;s rank sum test on unpaired samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c50">50</xref>). The rank sums for the two groups of ribozymes were 18 (average rank &#x0003d; 4.5) and 20 (average rank &#x0003d; 5.0), respectively, which are higher than the critical rank sum of 11 required for a 5&#x00025; significance level. From these data, ribozyme targets selected on the basis of <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> accessibility are no more susceptible to ribozyme cleavage <italic>in vivo</italic> than those selected by structural prediction or other considerations.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation of ribozyme efficacy with the predicted target secondary structure</title><p>The two methods of target selection both resulted in ribozymes with very diverse inhibitory activities. We therefore decided to investigate whether there was any correlation between predicted structure of target sites and the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of corresponding ribozymes. We approached this by attempting to break down the secondary structures of the target sequences in readily quantifiable parameters. In doing so we have disregarded certain factors that may influence hybridization efficiency but which cannot be easily quantified. Such factors include the positioning of single-stranded stretches within the target sequence and the ability of a specific hammerhead sequence to assume its proper catalytic three-dimensional structure. The presence of so-called free ends, the positioning of single-stranded stretches at the ends of target sequences, may be expected to be correlated with enhanced antisense binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c12">12</xref>), while elements of strong secondary structure in the neighborhood of the target sequence proper might impede ribozyme folding. We do not imply that these factors are unimportant, merely that as they cannot be easily quantified, other more readily quantifiable parameters should be investigated for predictive value. Three potentially important parameters for target site accessibility were local free energy of folding of the target sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c11">11</xref>), the size of single-stranded stretches (loops) that may function as &#x02018;hooks&#x02019; for nucleation of duplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c52">52</xref>), and the length and stability of stems and helices. Stems and helices may need to be opened up for full hybridization of ribozyme to occur and their length and stability may therefore influence hybridization efficiency. Consequently, the target sequences of all ribozymes were decomposed into length of the major loop, stem and helix, while free energies have been calculated both for the target sequence as a whole and for its major helical region (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb1">1</xref>). Target sequence free energies were calculated for the energetically optimal folding of the RNA, by adding up the energy contributions from all base-pairings, stacking interactions, bulges and various loops that are contained within the target sequences, as indicated by the MFold program. MFold was also used to determine the free energy of the most stable (&#x02018;limiting&#x02019;) helical region and to estimate the strength of the ribozyme-target hybrid (by folding the corresponding <italic>cis</italic>-acting ribozyme in which catalytic and substrate strands were connected through a 5 nt loop at stem I).</p><p>Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c53">53</xref>) was used to investigate the level of correlation of ribozyme efficacy ranking with various features of the predicted secondary structure of the target sequences (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb2">2</xref>). No correlation was observed with the length of the major loop (Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.16) or ribozyme&#x02013;substrate duplex free energy (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.18). The correlation with target sequence free energy was weak (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.35) and not significant. Ribozyme efficacy was, however, significantly correlated (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.025) with both the length of the major base-paired stretch (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.75) and the energy of the most stable helix (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.77) within the target sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb2">2</xref>). Correlation was improved (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.84) when considering stem length and helix stability together (for this analysis, the rank was taken as the average of the two individual ranks for stem and helix). Correlation coefficients were not significantly affected by ranking ribozyme activity without the use of ties (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb2">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we have analyzed DNA-armed chemically modified hammerhead ribozymes targeting eight GUC and GUA sites selected by two different methods, <italic>in vitro</italic> accessibility assays and MFold prediction. In a co-transfection controlled assay, the ribozymes resulted in residual luciferase reporter gene expression ranging from 23 (MRz-287) to 72&#x00025; (MRz-539) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f4">4</xref>). This activity may in part be due to the presence of DNA arms which allow RNase H-mediated cleavage of DNA&#x02013;RNA hybrids. Target gene expression normalized to the expression of a co-transfected non-target gene allowed the control of any non-target-specific sequence effects of the ribozymes. Non-specific effects are occasionally encountered in association with extended stretches of phosphorothioate (P&#x0003d;S) linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c19">19</xref>). In an attempt to minimize such effects, no more than two consecutive P&#x0003d;S linkages were incorporated. Finally, ribozymes of different chemistry (with methylated RNA instead of DNA in the arms) against two of the targets (guc519 and guc548) were less efficient in inhibiting target gene expression than their DNA-armed counterparts (unpublished data). In combination, the above data make it unlikely that the observed effects are due to aspects of ribozyme sequence or chemistry unrelated to hybridization-specific activity.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of ribozymes was dependent on both the ribozyme concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f5">5</xref>A) and the steady-state expression levels of the reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f5">5</xref>B). A reduced inhibitory effect was observed for three selected methylated ribozymes when expressing the reporter gene from a stronger promoter resulting in 20-fold higher expression levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f5">5</xref>B). However, the molar amount of target suppression when the stronger promoter was used increased to a degree almost matching the increase in the level of the exogenous target. This interesting fact suggests an enzymatic rather than a stoichiometric effect of the ribozymes on target gene expression. The enzymatic function may derive entirely from the ribozyme or include RNase H activity. It should, however, be noted that the increase in the total level of PSKH1 mRNA by expressing the exogenous transcript from the stronger promoter depends also on the unknown level of the endogenous transcript, which is another target for the ribozyme. The level of suppression achieved with the best ribozyme in this study (77&#x00025;) is similar to that which has previously been reported for the best of several unmodified ribozymes in a similar luciferase reporter gene co-transfection assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c16">16</xref>). Other comparable studies have reported inhibition levels in the range of 40&#x02013;80&#x00025; for a set of 15 ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c54">54</xref>), 50&#x00025; inhibition with a pair of variously modified ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c29">29</xref>), and 40&#x02013;55&#x00025; inhibition for a pair of 2&#x02032;-F-pyrimidine modified ribozymes with phosphorothioates at both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c27">27</xref>). Thus our results, achieved with generally more extensively modified ribozymes, compare favorably with previous reports.</p><p>We have also attempted to evaluate the relative effects of two commonly employed types of 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-modifications on the activity of ribozymes. The same rank order of ribozymes targeting three selected sites was observed for both methylated and allylated DNA-armed ribozymes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f4">4</xref>). Allylated ribozymes were generally less efficient in inhibiting reporter gene expression in co-transfection assays compared to their methylated counterparts. The difference in activity of methylated and allylated versions of otherwise identical ribozymes appeared to correlate with the susceptibility of the target to inhibition by ribozyme. While the ribozyme targeting the least accessible of the dually target sites (guc539) apparently was most sensitive to the type of alkylation, ribozyme species of either modification were equally efficient when targeting the most susceptible site (guc519).</p><p>Predicted secondary structures of targets selected on the basis of the MFold program were very diverse and included a short stem&#x02013;loop (guc287), a stem with a large internal loop (guc238), a bulged stem (guc519), and a hairpin structure (guc712), as well as a site near the translation initiation site that was presumed to be relatively unstructured (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f2">2</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> accessibility assays with cleavage triplet-specific ODN-libraries identified three accessible GUC sites and one GUA site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f3">3</xref>A). <italic>In vitro</italic> cleavage assays with specific ODNs against all sites targeted by ribozymes confirmed that the sites that were selected by library screening were indeed more accessible <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> than sites selected by alternative means (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f3">3</xref>B). This confirms the utility of such semi-randomized libraries for identifying the most accessible sites <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, ribozymes targeting sites selected on the basis of <italic>in vitro</italic> accessibility assays were no more efficient in inhibiting target gene expression in a co-transfection assay than ribozymes targeting sites selected by theoretical means. In fact, the ribozyme targeting the most accessible site <italic>in vitro</italic> (MRz-465) ranked only as the fifth most active (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb2">2</xref>), while the target site of the best ribozyme (MRz-287), was relatively inaccessible <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f3">3</xref>B). The lack of correlation between <italic>in vitro</italic> accessibility and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy data is consistent with previous observations of other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c58">58</xref>). A possible explanation for the poor correlation is that the target mRNA is folded differently <italic>in vitro</italic> than <italic>in vivo</italic>. The secondary structure of the folded RNA may not be the energetically most stable (fast local folding events may prevent more energetically favorable interactions between distal regions). Structural features that promote hybridization <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> may also differ. Furthermore, the hybridization efficiency of 13mer antisense ODNs may not be entirely representative for the hybridization characteristics of longer (32mer) hammerhead ribozymes with varying degrees of secondary structure of their own. Finally, the generation of higher-order mRNA structures and modulation or masking of the mRNA secondary structure by RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c10">10</xref>) or protein complexes (ribosomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c59">59</xref>) <italic>in vivo</italic> may influence accessibility of target sites, although these factors would also tend to rule out the applicability of secondary structure predictions for target site selection. Recent data suggest that performing <italic>in vitro</italic> accessibility assays on an endogenous transcript in a protein environment (cell extracts) may improve the accuracy of the predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>in vitro</italic> accessibility assays proved to be of limited predictive value for the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, correlative studies suggested that secondary structure predictions might have some merit. Significant correlation was found between ribozyme efficacy and the presence of short stems and energetically unstable helices within the ribozyme target sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb2">2</xref>). Ranking of ribozymes according to these two criteria, the relative efficacies of ribozymes were predicted nearly perfectly, the only significant discrepancy being the ribozyme targeting gua465. As well as being most accessible <italic>in vitro</italic>, this site also has a secondary structure that according to the above criteria should make it a significantly better target site than observed here. Other factors, such as the lack of single-stranded bases near the ends of the target sequence or a prohibitive environment for ribozyme folding, may explain the results. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, there is an apparently clear correlation between ribozyme efficacy and predicted target sequence secondary structure. Furthermore, the combined data from this study suggest that the previously reported correlation of ribozyme efficacy with local folding potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c11">11</xref>) may be incidental. Our data suggest that high target sequence free energy alone may not be sufficient for efficient ribozyme targeting. We propose that the above correlation is a consequence of the need to have some unpaired regions to facilitate fast nucleation of duplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c52">52</xref>), combined with short base-paired regions and helices of low stability that easily open up. Fulfillment of these criteria will in many cases result in a low local folding potential (high free energy) for the target site.</p><p>A recent study on the effect of varying RNA secondary structure on the efficiency of specific antisense ODNs concluded that target sequences located within regions designed to be unstructured were most effective, while targets within stable stem&#x02013;loop structures were ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c13">13</xref>). Recent reports by Patzel and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c14">14</xref>) described a theoretical approach for antisense ODN target site selection based on the prediction of large single-stranded stretches (loops) by MFold. Our data do not support a correlation of ribozyme activity with the length of loops, possibly because all our targets had shorter predicted loops than recommended in the above studies. Our hypothesis and the conclusions of the above studies are, however, not mutually exclusive. Target sites containing very large loops will have a good probability of also containing short helical regions, which we propose to be the limiting factor. In fact, applying our hypothesis of target site evaluation to three previously well characterized target sites (t351, t398, t498) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c22">22</xref>) within mRNA for murine DNA methyl transferase, the same rank susceptibility of targets, in perfect accordance with actual inhibition data, is predicted by both theories.</p><p>In addition to the structure of the target site, the composition of the target sequence may also be of some importance. Sequences with a high G&#x0002b;C content will hybridize more efficiently with the complementary arms of their ribozymes and possibly increase the efficacy of the ribozyme. Although a general correlation between hybrid stability and ribozyme efficacy was not supported by our data (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb2">2</xref>), it is worth noting that the most efficient ribozyme, MRz-287, has a substantially higher affinity for its target sequence than the other ribozymes (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd626tb1">1</xref>) due to an unusually high G&#x0002b;C content (13 out of 16&#x000a0;nt). In conclusion, the target sequence of MRz-287 represents the proposed desirable structural features for a good ribozyme&#x0002f;antisense target site. The target sequence consists of alternating short stretches of paired and unpaired bases, which limit stems and helical regions to no more than 3 bp. All other target sequences fold into secondary structures containing longer and more stable helical regions. One study has reported that hybridization accessibility for hammerhead ribozymes is correlated with the presence of unpaired bases near the cleavage triplet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd626c60">60</xref>). Although our data do not suggest this to be a critical requirement for <italic>in vivo</italic> activity, the above criterium is also fulfiled for the guc287 target site, as the longest single-stranded stretch is situated around the cleavage triplet and includes the base preceding the scissile bond (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd626f2">2</xref>). All of the above mentioned features of guc287 add up to a very effective ribozyme target site, in good agreement with its observed inhibitory capacity in HeLa cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our study indicates that there is a poor correlation between the apparent <italic>in vivo</italic> accessibility of a target and its accessibility in a completely cell-free <italic>in vitro</italic> assay as performed here. Thus such assays appear to be of limited value even for a preliminary selection of target sites. However, predictions by the MFold program suggest a correlation of certain features of the predicted secondary structures of target sequences, helical stability in particular, with ribozyme efficacy. The generality of these findings will, however, need to be investigated in an alternate test system. If these correlations should be confirmed, this would represent a significant improvement in the preliminary selection of candidate ribozymes. Ultimately, however, an empirical cell-based assay will still need to be performed to select the best of these candidates.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd626f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic of the hammerhead ribozyme hybridizing to its target mRNA.
