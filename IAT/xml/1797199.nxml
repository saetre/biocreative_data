The main reservoir of meningococcal carriage is the human nasopharynx, where occasionally this asymptomatic colonization is followed by invasive disease. The disease progression is rapid and much remains unknown about the disease process. Many meningococcal surface-associated virulence factors have been characterized; among these are pili, PilC, Opa, lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and the capsule. Meningococcal pili mediate attachment to host cells, and each pilus is composed of thousands of interactive PilE subunits, a pilus-associated adhesin PilC, and possibly other not yet identified components. Opa proteins are integral outer membrane proteins that mediate invasion of human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Merz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Many surface exposed virulence factors of <italic>Neisseria</italic> undergo phase and antigenic variation, <italic>i.e.</italic> alteration of gene expression by on-off switching of a given gene product or by DNA rearrangement, which may augment bacterial adaptability and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-deVries1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Ilver1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Opa expression undergoes phase variation due to frequent changes in the number of pentameric sequence repeats within the signal-peptide coding region, which alter the open-reading frame. Studies of bacterial virulence factors and host cell receptors have revealed complex and multifunctional contact points and signal transduction patterns during interaction between bacteria and target host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Edwards1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-GrayOwen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the main disadvantage of these models is the unknown effect of iron on the host immune response and especially on the innate defense mechanisms. I.n. infection in infant mouse models may be used to study early events in the pathogenesis of meningococcal infection, however these models are not ideal since the bacteremia levels are low (maximum of 58&#x00025;) while meningitis seldom develops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Salit1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Mackinnon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

CD46 transgenic mice infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> are susceptible to meningococcal disease in contrast to nontransgenic mice that clear the infection and survive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Johansson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, in the CD46 transgenic mouse model, infection leads to sepsis and meningitis in adult mice without preinjection of enhancers, such as iron compounds. Bacterial replication in the blood and passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) occur in CD46 transgenic mice, but not in nontransgenic mice. Furthermore, induction of early immune responses after i.p. challenge of the transgenic mice resemble manifestations of meningococcal disease in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Johansson2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, CD46 transgenic mice represent a suitable model system to study meningococcal disease and test vaccines <italic>in vivo</italic> in adult mice.</p><p>In this study, we used <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to monitor meningococcal sepsis in CD46 transgenic mice.

The luxCDABE genes, which are required for the production of bioluminescent light, were expressed under the control of the meningococcal <italic>porA</italic> promoter and inserted into a non-coding chromosomal region of the meningococcal strain FAM20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, insertion of the <italic>porA</italic> promoter significantly increased the bioluminescent signal. The bioluminescent strain FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold> maintained expression of pili, PilC, LOS and the capsule, and showed no changes in the <italic>pilE</italic> gene sequence or growth rate as compared with the parent strain (data not shown). To evaluate the virulence of FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold>, we used a previously reported mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Johansson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and challenged CD46 transgenic mice i.p. with 10<sup>8</sup> FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold>. After 24 h, strong bioluminescent signals were detected in the mouse body and in the brain of CD46 transgenic mice, but no signals were seen in nontransgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As the original FAM20 strain, FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold> caused lethal disease within 2 days after infection. Further, the intensity of the emitted signals was proportional to the bacterial counts in blood and tissues (data not shown), allowing both temporal and spatial analysis regarding meningococcal disease progression. Construction of FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold> resulted in both Opa<bold><sup>ON</sup></bold> and Opa<bold><sup>OFF</sup></bold> clones, which showed no differences in growth, in adhesion and invasion of host pharyngeal epithelial cells, or in virulence using the CD46 transgenic mouse model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000241.s001">Figure S1</xref> and data not shown). In summary, the data from both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrate that the novel bioluminescent strains are stable and have equivalent virulence as compared with the parental strain.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Three diverse disease patterns of meningococcal disease in CD46 transgenic mice</title><p>Meningococcal disease begins when bacteria successfully enter the bloodstream and survive host defenses. To study meningococcal sepsis we set up an intravenous (i.v.) infection model in CD46 transgenic mice. We found that 1&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> bacteria were an optimal dose to induce severe meningococcal sepsis with a lethal outcome. Infection with fewer bacteria, <italic>i.e.</italic> 5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>/mouse, resulted in clearance and 100&#x00025; survival (data not shown). The optimal infection dose was high, however, recent reports have shown that patients with meningococcal disease may have bacterial loads of up to 6&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/ml blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Hackett1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Tobiason1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Infection with 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mouse corresponds to 5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/ml in blood, which is within the range of bacterial load found in humans. Thus, mice were challenged with 10<sup>9</sup> bacteria/mouse and analyzed by bioluminescent imaging at different time points. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, nontransgenic mice infected with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> cleared the bacteria within 24 h, while infection of CD46 transgenic mice resulted in three different disease patterns. Many of the CD46 transgenic mice, <italic>i. e.</italic> 43&#x00025; (20/46), demonstrated a &#x0201c;sepsis-like&#x0201d; pattern resulting in a lethal outcome within 2 days after infection. In 35&#x00025; (16/46) of the mice, a &#x0201c;meningitis-like&#x0201d; disease pattern was observed with signals mainly located in the brain and spinal region. Puncture of the cisterna magna of the mice in this group revealed high bacterial numbers in CSF 24 h post-infection (data not shown) and these mice died 2 or 3 days post challenge. Interestingly, a &#x0201c;mild disease-like&#x0201d; pattern appeared in a smaller number of mice (10/46), which displayed relatively low bacteremia levels of less than 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, infection of CD46 transgenic mice leads to three different patterns of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Disease progression selects for Opa expression</title><p>We were interested to further analyze the mild meningococcal disease. To study disease dynamics a more sensitive detection scale was used to monitor bacterial load at 6 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 4 days after i.v. infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Unexpectedly, the signals disappeared after 2 days and the mice appeared to have recovered. However, the signals reappeared day 3. Five out of ten mice showed bacteria accumulating in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g003">Figure. 3A, top panel</xref>), while the bacterial counts in the CSF were almost 1000 times higher than in the blood. The remaining mice displayed strong signals in the whole body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, lower panel), with high bacterial blood counts, indicating fulminant bacteremia. Bacterial reappearance after the apparent recovery always led to a lethal outcome. These data imply that meningococcal dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic> is more complicated than we have previously understood. Reappearance of bacteria at day 3 and 4 suggested survival of a small population of bacteria. In an attempt to identify possible phase and antigenic variation of meningococcal virulence factors, bacteria were recovered from thyroid gland, thymus, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, nasal wash, CSF, and blood, at day 1, 3 and 4 after infection with FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold>Opa<bold><sup>OFF</sup></bold>. All recovered bacterial isolates retained expression of PilC, pili, LOS, and the capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). Further, sequence variation of the <italic>pilE</italic> gene was not detected (data not shown). Interestingly, in 67&#x00025; (4/6) of the mice all isolates recovered at day 3 or later expressed Opa, whereas at earlier infection stages Opa-expression was negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, upper panels). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated expression of OpaA and OpaB in all isolates, while OpaD remained undetectable as in the initial inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). The expression pattern of Opa proteins was consistent after subculturing bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that Opa expression was selected in mice. In order to analyze the impact of Opa in disease development, CD46 transgenic mice were challenged i.v. with an Opa<bold><sup>ON</sup></bold> isolate recovered from blood. The bacterial blood counts were significantly higher (5.6&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>&#x000b1;5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) at 24 h post infection compared with the initial inoculum (2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>&#x000b1;1&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, these data implicate that Opa proteins play an important role during disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Meningococci accumulate in the thyroid gland after intravenous infection of CD46 transgenic mice</title><p>In addition to the bacterial signals in the mouse body and brain, <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging (BLI) also revealed strong signals that persisted over time in the thyroid gland and the nasal region of CD46 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Further analysis of the thyroid gland demonstrated strong bioluminescence in a dissected thyroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), and high bacterial counts in homogenized tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the bacterial load was higher in the thyroid than in the blood. Immunohistochemical examination of thyroid tissue sections revealed that bacteria were primarily located in cellular layers, and not in the lumen of thyroid follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Almost no bacteria were detected in thyroid glands from nontransgenic mice. In order to investigate the thyroid function during meningococcal disease, the blood level of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T4), was measured. Unexpectedly, uninfected CD46 transgenic mice exhibited lower T4 levels than nontransgenic mice (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). In response to infection, T4 levels dropped in both CD46 transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice. After 3 days of infection, T4 levels increased in nontransgenic mice as the mice recovered, whereas T4 levels were undetectable in CD46 transgenic mice after 2 days, which then had a lethal outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title><italic>N. meningitidis</italic> translocates from blood to the respiratory mucosa</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> BLI also revealed a strong focal signal in the oral-nasopharyngeal region of infected CD46 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This signal was detected over several days, sometimes with increasing intensity. To analyze the presence of bacteria in the nasopharynx, we collected nasal washes and measured the bacterial counts. At 24 h post-infection, high numbers of bacteria (7&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml) were collected from nasal washes of CD46 transgenic mice, with over 95&#x00025; of the recovered bacteria being bioluminescent meningococci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). No meningococci were found in nasal washes from infected nontransgenic mice or uninfected mice kept in the same cage as the challenged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and data not shown), indicating that meningococcal colonization of the respiratory mucosa is not a consequence of aerosol transfer of bacteria from other infected mice. Bacterial transmigration to the respiratory mucosa was further verified by immunohistochemical examination. Large numbers of meningococci were identified in the mucosa and submucosa of the nasal cavity of CD46 transgenic mice challenged with FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g005">Figure 5B, upper panel</xref>). Furthermore, clusters of meningococci were found in the nasal cavity and tracheal lumen, occasionally associated with the mucosal surface (data not shown). These data suggest the novel idea that <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> can translocate from blood to the respiratory mucosal surface in CD46 transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Bacterial translocation from blood to the respiratory mucosa is PilC1 dependent</title><p>The pilus-associated adhesin PilC1 plays a critical role in mediating attachment to host epithelial target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Nassif1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Morand1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to study the role of PilC1 in meningococcal disease and bacterial targeting to the respiratory mucosal surface, we generated a bioluminescently labeled PilC1 mutant. The resulting strain designated FAM20&#x00394;<italic>pilC1</italic><bold><sup>LU</sup></bold> displayed equivalent growth rates <italic>in vitro</italic> as compared to FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold> (data not shown). I.v. infection of mice with the bioluminescent PilC1 mutant, resulted in strong bacteremia, however, the bioluminescent signal in the nasal region was weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Nasal washes confirmed fewer meningococci in mice infected with the PilC1 mutant (2&#x000d7;10<sup>2</sup> CFU/ml) than with the PilC1-expressing FAM20<bold><sup>LU</sup></bold> (7&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Further, immunohistochemical examination failed to detect the PilC mutant in the epithelial cell layer, although minor amounts were detected in the submucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, lower panel). Surprisingly, the PilC1 mutant induced bacteremia, triggered IL-6, crossed the BBB, and caused lethal disease at similar rates as the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations suggest that PilC1 is dispensable for bacteremia and further bacterial passage through the blood-brain barrier, but instead plays a crucial role in targeting <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> to the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> is a strict human specific pathogen that causes sepsis and meningitis. Meningococcal disease has a rapid onset with high mortality. The understanding of disease development is crucial for development of novel therapeutic strategies and vaccines against meningococcal disease. In this study, we used bioluminescent meningococci to image the disease progression in CD46 transgenic mice and demonstrated novel aspects of the dynamics of meningococcal disease. Imaging analysis of meningococcal sepsis revealed for the first time, three disease patterns, the two most common being sepsis and meningitis. The third group of mice developed a mild disease pattern during the first 2 days of infection. In humans, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> is most commonly associated with rapid onset of meningitis and severe sepsis, but may also cause mild systemic meningococcal disease. Therefore, i.v. challenge of transgenic mice with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> resembles human meningococcal disease features, supporting the system as a useful tool for studying meningococcal pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> imaging and immunohistochemistry showed accumulation of bacteria in the thyroid gland of CD46 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This finding encouraged us to analyze the function of the thyroid by measuring the thyroid hormone T4 serum level. T4 was undetectable in CD46 transgenic mice after 2 days, whereas in nontransgenic mice T4 levels returned to normal as bacteria were cleared. These data indicate that an impaired thyroid function is associated with more severe disease. Uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines occurs after meningococcal challenge of CD46 transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Johansson2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Competition for limited amounts of transcription factors involved in both cytokine synthesis and thyroid hormone metabolism could explain the resultant T4 reduction. In addition, it is also possible that decreased T4 levels inhibit the bactericidal capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) since thyroid hormones can be an important iodine source for the myeloperoxidase-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-halide antimicrobial and cytotoxic system in human PMNLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Mezosi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, in a septic rat model thyroid hormone supplementation showed a beneficial effect on both survival and the severity of sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Inan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, CD46 transgenic mice have constitutively lower levels of T4 than the nontransgenic control mice. Further studies will address how CD46 influences the thyroid function and whether low constitutive T4 levels increases the susceptibility to meningococcal disease. It has been reported that T4 is reduced at the beginning of bacterial and viral meningitis in human infant patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Szychowska1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there is no available data about the frequency of ongoing thyroid disorder in patients with meningococcal disease.</p><p><italic>N. meningitidis</italic> can adapt to the host environment and escape the immune defenses via phase and antigenic variation of surface components. Earlier studies of experimental gonococcal urethritis in human volunteers have shown that Opa proteins are not required for the initial colonization of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> to host epithelium, instead Opa protein expression is selected during the course of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Jerse1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> that reappeared in mice at later stages of infection invariably expressed Opa, independent of the isolation sites. The inoculum did not express detectable Opa protein. However, bacteria that translocated to CSF and respiratory mucosa at day 1 post-infection also lacked Opa, indicating that these steps are independent of Opa expression. Our data suggest that turning on Opa expression probably enhances late stage meningococcal adaptation and survival. Further, reappearance of bacteria shows that meningococci are capable of rapid growth in CD46 transgenic mice.</p><p>An interesting and novel finding in this study is the translocation of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> to the respiratory mucosa of CD46 transgenic mice after i.v. infection. The PilC1 mutant did not reach the upper respiratory mucosa, indicating that bacterial interaction with respiratory epithelium is PilC1 dependent and probably not a result of vascular leakage in the nasal cavity. Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic> data in this study support previous <italic>in vitro</italic> findings that PilC1 mediates a direct interaction with epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Nassif1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Both PilC1-expressing <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and the PilC1 mutant induced bacteremia, meningitis and uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, PilC1 is most likely dispensable for meningococcal interactions with host immune defenses in blood and passage across the BBB. Since both the PilC1 mutant and the wild-type strain induced similar proinflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000241-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), it is still possible that entry of the PilC1 mutant into the CSF may be a result from sepsis-induced cell damage of the BBB.</p><p><italic>N. meningitidis</italic> reached the CSF and the respiratory mucosa in CD46 transgenic mice, but not in nontransgenic mice, suggesting that CD46 is a critical component of disease, either by interacting with bacteria at the site of translocation or by protecting bacteria at earlier stages allowing bacterial survival. Since the PilC1 mutant were not found at the respiratory mucosa, but crossed the BBB, it is likely that the mechanisms by which <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> interacts with these two cellular barriers are different. In humans, CD46 is expressed as four major isoforms, BC1, BC2, C1 and C2, depending on alternative splicing of an extracellular serine/threonine/proline rich domain and the choice between one of two cytoplasmic tails, Cyt-1 and Cyt-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-RileyVargas1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been reported that CD46 transgenic mice express distinct CD46 isoforms in throat epithelium and the BBB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Johansson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, different mechanisms for bacterial adhesion and invasion might be required. Nevertheless, our data cannot exclude that an additional unknown factor may interact with PilC1 at the respiratory epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000241-Kirchner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that bioluminescent <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> strains together with the CD46 transgenic mouse model provide a potent tool for <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations of meningococcal disease. Disease dynamics and thyroid targeting during meningococcal sepsis revealed in this study might lead to new strategies to improve the clinical outcome in human patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; was used for cloning. <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> FAM20 belongs to serogroup C, MLST sequence type 11.
