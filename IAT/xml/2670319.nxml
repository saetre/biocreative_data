Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs, EC 1.2.1) oxidize aldehydes into carboxylic acids, using NAD<sup>+ </sup>or NADP<sup>+ </sup>as a co-factor. As such ALDHs play an important role in detoxifying aldehydes that are generated endogenously or introduced from the environment. ALDHs are very diverse in that some only use either NAD<sup>+ </sup>or NADP<sup>+ </sup>as the co-factor, while others can use both, some oxidize only a limited number of aldehydes, while others have broader substrate spectra, and ALDHs exist in various subcellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria, plastids and microsomes.</p><p>Over 550 ALDH genes have been identified across virtually all species, and those from eukaryotes have been classified into more than 20 families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Family 2 ALDHs are mitochondrial or cytosolic homotetrameric enzymes. The well studied human mitochondrial Family 2 ALDH, ALDH2, detoxifies acetaldehyde generated via alcohol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Family 2 ALDHs in plants have gained attention since the cloning of <italic>rf2a </italic>gene, a nuclear restorer gene for cytoplasm male sterility in maize, which encodes a mitochondrial Family 2 ALDH, RF2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although the molecular mechanisms associated with the restorer function of the <italic>rf2a </italic>gene remain to be resolved, several studies in maize and other species have provided clues as to the physiological functions of Family 2 ALDHs in plants.</p><p>Consistent with the physiological function of human Family 2 ALDH in detoxifying acetaldehyde, Liu and Schnable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] demonstrated that acetaldehyde is one of the best substrates <italic>in vitro </italic>for RF2A, based on the ratio of <italic>K</italic><sub>cat </sub>to <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. In addition, one of the mitochondrial Family 2 ALDHs in rice may be responsible for efficient detoxification of acetaldehyde during re-aeration after submergence of rice plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These studies all suggest a role of Family 2 ALDHs during ethanolic fermentation, which is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and generates acetaldehyde and ethanol. The detoxification of acetaldehyde by ALDH produces acetate. In yeast and mammals, it has been established that acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) can utilize acetate to synthesize acetyl-CoA, both in the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>ACS is targeted to the plastid and is encoded by a single gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In plastids acetyl-CoA is utilized for <italic>de novo </italic>fatty acid biosynthesis. Although the acetyl-CoA pool generated by ACS from acetate seems redundant for fatty acid biosynthesis, ACS is hypothesized to play a specialized role in certain cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Besides, the redundancy of acetyl-CoA pool from ACS observed above might be due to the low concentration of acetate, probably 0.05 mM (less than one third the <italic>Km </italic>of this enzyme) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, the feeding of radio-labeled acetate indicates that isolated plastids can use exogenous acetate for fatty acid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To understand how and when ACS contributes to the acetyl-CoA pool of plastids, the study of acetate biosynthesis would be the key, which is readily diffusible across membranes. One potential pathway would be through ALDH utilizing acetaldehyde generated via ethanolic fermentation by PDC from pyruvate or by ADH from ethanol.</p><p>In yeast, the PDC-ALDH-ACS pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is termed the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) bypass and is used to generate acetyl-CoA involving both cytosolic and mitochondrial ALDHs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], predominantly when PDH is mutated. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In plants, studies conducted in the Kuhlemeier lab have demonstrated that high expression of PDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and ALDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] coincides with high rates of ethanolic fermentation in tobacco pollen. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. They supplied growing pollen tubes with <sup>14</sup>C-ethanol and found label incorporated into fatty acids, indicating that ethanol can be used for fatty acid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], presumably via the ADH-ALDH-ACS pathway. To provide direct evidence for the presence of the PDH bypass in plants, this study utilized a reverse genetics approach in Arabidopsis to test which (if any) ALDHs are involved in the flux from ethanol into fatty acids.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The PDH and PDH bypass pathways</bold>.

This is not possible for two reasons. First, blocking the Arabidopsis PDH pathway by mutating the E2 subunit of the PDH complex results in lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Second, pyruvate is unstable and acetaldehyde is toxic. Hence, instead <sup>14</sup>C-ethanol was fed to plants that were wild type for the PDH pathway and either wild type or mutant for the ALDH genes. The substitution of ethanol for pyruvate or acetaldehyde is appropriate because ethanol should be predominantly, if not exclusively, oxidized to acetaldehyde via ADH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Because well established means to detect acetyl-CoA do not exist, flux through the PDH bypass was measured by determining the incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C-ethanol into extracted saponifiable lipids, which should consist primarily of fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p><sup>14</sup>C-ethanol was fed to whole seedlings, seedling leaves, and inflorescences. The incorporation rates were compared between single or double <italic>aldh </italic>mutants and their wild type siblings. No differences were detected in whole seedlings or seedling leaves between the <italic>aldh2C4 </italic>homozygous mutants from either allele (<italic>aldh2C4-1 </italic>and <italic>aldh2C4-2</italic>) and their wild type siblings (data not shown). We, therefore, conclude that the cytosolic Family 2 ALDH is either not involved in the ADH-ALDH-ACS pathway, or can be compensated for by the mitochondrial paralog(s).</p><p>Comparisons were also made using all three tissue sources from the <italic>aldh2B4 </italic>single mutant (<italic>aldh2B4;ALDH2B7</italic>), the <italic>aldh2B7 </italic>single mutant (<italic>ALDH2B4;aldh2B7</italic>), the <italic>aldh2B4;aldh2B7 </italic>double mutant and their wild type siblings (<italic>ALDH2B4;ALDH2B7</italic>), all of which were in a uniform WS genetic background (Methods). No statistically significant differences in rates of incorporation were observed in seedling leaves among any of the examined genotypes (data not shown). In contrast, statistically significant differences were observed in whole seedlings and inflorescences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Generally, the comparative results among the four genotypes obtained from whole seedlings and inflorescences are similar. In both whole seedlings and inflorescences, the double mutant of the two mitochondrial ALDHs (<italic>aldh2B4;aldh2B7</italic>) exhibits statistically significant differences relative to the wild type. This demonstrates the role of the mitochondrial ALDHs in the incorporation of ethanol and provides direct evidence for the presence of the PDH bypass in sporophytic tissue (i.e., seedlings).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Incorporation rates of <sup>14</sup>C-ethanol into fatty acids in whole seedlings (A) and inflorescences (B)</bold>.

This conclusion is based in part on the observation that in both tissues the <italic>aldh2B4 </italic>single mutant exhibits less incorporation than the wild type. In addition, in both tissues, the rate of incorporation is not statistically different in the double mutant than in the <italic>aldh2B4 </italic>single mutant. Hence, there is no evidence to indicate that ALDH2B7 contributes substantially to this pathway. Surprisingly, in both tissues, the <italic>aldh2B7 </italic>single mutant (<italic>ALDH2B4;aldh2B7</italic>) exhibits more incorporation than the wild type, but only in the inflorescence is this difference statistically significant. This may indicate that in the <italic>aldh2B7 </italic>mutant, the plant responds by increasing the expression of ALDH2B4, but this hypothesis remains to be tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression analyses of Family 2 ALDH genes</title><p>To understand the expression patterns of the three Family 2 ALDH genes, quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted on RNA extracted from different tissues from adult wild-type WS plants.

Analysis of a PDC mutant of petunia provided further support for the expression of the PDH bypass in pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This study left open, however, the question of whether the PDH bypass functions in sporophytic tissue. We used a reverse genetics approach to compare the incorporation rates of <sup>14</sup>C-ethanol into fatty acids in sporophytic tissue (seedlings) of Arabidopsis <italic>aldh </italic>mutants versus their wild type controls. This study and that of Lin and Oliver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which demonstrated lower incorporation rates in an ACS knockout mutant than wild type, provide direct evidence for the presence of the PDH bypass in sporophytic tissue of plants. Specifically, lower rates of incorporation were observed in the <italic>aldh2B4;aldh2B7 </italic>double mutant as compared to wild type controls, in both whole seedlings and inflorescences.</p><p>The <italic>aldh2C4 </italic>single mutant did not exhibit differences in incorporation relative to wild type. Because ALDH2C4 can oxidize acetaldehyde, at least <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], this result suggests either that ALDH2C4 is not required for the PDH bypass or that it is involved in the PDH bypass but its absence can be compensated for by the presence of one or both of the mitochondrial ALDHs. Of the two mitochondrial ALDHs, ALDH2B4 appears to play a more important role in the PDH bypass pathway in both whole seedlings and inflorescences.</p><p>This study establishes the presence of the PDH bypass in whole seedlings, thereby demonstrating that the PDH bypass is not exclusive to pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This conclusion is consistent with our qRT-PCR results, which show constitutive expression of <italic>ALDH2B4. </italic>On the other hand, the findings that a knockout of ALDH2B4 has no discernable phenotype and that an ACS knockout mutant has only modest effects on plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] suggests that the PDH bypass is not essential under tested conditions. It is not clear whether the PDH bypass is involved in the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA or the removal of fermentation intermediates. Lin and Oliver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] provided evidence for the latter in that their ACS knockout mutant is more sensitive to ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetate than are controls. Surprisingly, there are no obvious visible phenotypes associated with any of the single, double or triple Family 2 ALDH mutants, even though a Family 2 ALDH has an essential role in the development of maize anthers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PDH bypass, which has previously been shown to be expressed in pollen, can produce acetyl-CoA in the absence of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). We provide evidence of the existence of the PDH bypass in sporophytic tissue. Surprisingly, no obvious visible phenotypes are associated with the triple ALDH mutants, which should block this pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Growth of plants</title><p>Wild type and T-DNA insertion lines of Arabidopsis seeds were planted in soil.
