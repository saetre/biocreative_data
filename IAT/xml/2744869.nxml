DCs can be generated <italic>in vitro</italic> by culturing human monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4 followed by LPS induced DC maturation. We set out to study the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins during maturation and activation of human monocyte-derived DCs from peripheral blood <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that the expression of SOCS2 mRNA and protein is dramatically up-regulated during DC maturation. Silencing of SOCS2 using siRNA, inhibited DC maturation as evidenced by a decreased expression of maturation markers such as CD83, co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD86 and HLA-DR. Furthermore, silencing of SOCS2 decreased LPS induced activation of MAP kinases (SAKP/JNK, p38, ERK), IRF3, decreased the translocation of the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor and reduced downstream gene mRNA expression. These results suggest a role for SOCS2 in the MyD88-dependent and -independent TLR4 signaling pathways. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that SOCS2 is required for appropriate TLR4 signaling in maturating human DCs via both the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The innate immune system is the first line of defense protecting the host from invading pathogens.

This was demonstrated by a clear increase of both SOCS2 mRNA and protein during DC maturation and the finding that SOCS2 silencing leads to an impaired maturation of DCs. LPS stimulation of iDCs where SOCS2 had been silenced failed to express CD83, a typical marker of DC maturation. In addition, such cells showed a lower expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD86 and HLA-DR. We showed that SOCS2 silencing decreased both MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling in the TLR4 signaling pathway. This finding was corroborated by a corresponding decrease of LPS inducible genes encoding the effector cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2; and CCL-4. A SOCS2 dependency was also demonstrated for gene expression of INF-&#x003b2;, CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 i.e. genes related to the MyD88-independent signaling pathway. LPS stimulation under conditions of SOCS2 knock-down resulted in a decreased expression of all of these genes. Our results were substantiated at the protein level by Western Blots of protein extracts. Down-regulation of SOCS2 led to a decrease in NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation in response to LPS stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Carmody1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and also the phosphorylation of IRF3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Doyle1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and the activation of MAP kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Nakahara1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> was reduced in LPS stimulated cells where SOCS2 had been silenced. Thus, SOCS2 regulates TLR signaling via the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway.</p><p>SOCS2, as other members of this family is thought to function as a subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-FloresMorales1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The SOCS box, placed at the C-terminus serves to interact with Elongins C and B, cullin5 and Rbx2 forming the catalytic core of the complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Bullock1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Kile1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The SH2 domain of SOCS2 serves to interact with phosphotyrosine residues the targeted substrate directing the specificity of the ubiquitin ligase reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Bullock1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. For other members of the family it has been demonstrated that SOCS targets are polyubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Kile1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Orr1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, the most common effect of SOCS proteins is to reduce signaling. In dendritic cells, this is the case with SOCS3 and SOCS1, which have been shown to inhibit TLR signaling targeting TRAF6 in the case of SOCS3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Frobose1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and MAL in the case of SOCS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Mansell1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, SOCS2 elimination reduce LPS induced signals suggesting that negative regulators of TLR4 signaling are themselves targeted for degradation by SOCS2. Such negative regulators should themselves be tyrosine phosphorylated in order to interact with SOCS2. Interestingly, SOCS2 can control levels of other SOCS proteins such as SOCS3 and SOCS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Tannahill1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and such interactions may explain why LPS signaling is diminished in the absence of SOCS2. Other SOCS proteins are not the only possible targets and proteins such as DNAX-activating protein 12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Hamerman1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> and the Tyro3/Axl/Mer family of receptor kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Rothlin1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> have been shown both to be tyrosine phosphorylated as well as to act as negative regulators of TLR signaling. Interestingly, both of these pathways target MAL an early signaling intermediaries in the TLR signaling cascade. Because both the MAL/MyD88 and the TRAM-TRIF pathways are both affected by SOCS2 knock-down, it seems plausible that SOCS2 targets act early on the signaling pathway, in line with possible actions of SOCS1 or the Tyro3/Axl/Mer receptor family. In a more complex scenario, it is possible that SOCS2 has separate targets for MyD88 dependent and independent pathways. In this case several negative regulators such as Src homology 1-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 which targets IRAK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-An1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, Src homology 2-containing tyrosine phosphatase which targets TANK binding kinase 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-An2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 which targets p38MAP kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Lasa1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> mention some of the possibilities. Obviously this is a complex problem that requires a careful examination in future studies. It is important to note that SOCS2 is known to have stimulatory activity on certain cytokine signaling pathways. It can increase the action of IL-6, an effects that has been attributed to SOCS2 reversing the inhibitory action of SOCS1 on IL-6 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Naka1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. This phenomenon may also affect the activity of cytokines produced during dendritic cell maturation that have a positive feed back on the process.</p><p>Animal experiments support a role for SOCS2 in immune regulatory pathways. Mice where the SOCS2 gene has been ablated demonstrate an increased inflammation and mortality during T.gondii infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Machado1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, LPS treatment of splenic DCs of SOCS2 knock out mice did not influence proinflammatory cytokine expression (TNF, IL12 p40, IL6 and IFN-&#x003b1;). Similarly, LPS could not change baseline levels of MAP kinases family, but caused a slight decrease in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007178-Machado2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. The reason why DC cells from SOCS2 knock out animals seem to respond differently from human cells is unclear. The fact that mature DCs in mice instead of immature DCs in humans were treated with LPS might explain the absence of LPS reactivity in DCs from SOCS2 knock out mice. Alternatively, it may exists a functional difference between human and mouse DCs regarding SOCS2.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that SOCS2 positively regulates maturation of human DCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is achieved by promotion of TLR4 signaling through both the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The procedure of human PBMCs isolation was performed following approval by the Ethics Committee of the Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cell culture media and reagents</title><p>L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin and FCS (Hyclone, Logan, UT); Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden); RPMI-1640 cell culture medium and LPS derived from Escherchia coli O26: B6 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA); Recombinant human GM-CSF and recombinant human IL-4 (Invitrogen Biosource, Camarillo, CA); and CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Human monocyte isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were purchased from the sources indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Generation of human monocyte-derived DCs</title><p>Human PBMCs were isolated from fresh heparinized blood buffy coats (not older than 8 hours) from healthy donors provided from the Department of Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, by a standard procedure of Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation.
