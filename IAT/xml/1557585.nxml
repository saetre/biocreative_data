Although it is known to involve specific recognition of short consensus sequences by the splicing machinery, the mechanisms by which 5&#x02032; splice sites are accurately identified remain controversial and incompletely resolved. The human <italic>F7</italic> gene contains in its seventh intron (IVS7) a 37-bp VNTR minisatellite whose first element spans the exon7&#x02013;IVS7 boundary. As a consequence, the IVS7 authentic donor splice site is followed by several cryptic splice sites identical in sequence, referred to as 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites, which normally remain silent. This region, therefore, provides a remarkable model to decipher the mechanism underlying 5&#x02032; splice site selection in mammals. We previously suggested a model for splice site selection that, in the presence of consecutive splice consensus sequences, would stimulate exclusively the selection of the most upstream 5&#x02032; splice site, rather than repressing the 3&#x02032; following pseudo-sites. In the present study, we provide experimental support to this hypothesis by using a mutational approach involving a panel of 50 mutant and wild-type <italic>F7</italic> constructs expressed in various cell types. We demonstrate that the <italic>F7</italic> IVS7 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites are functional, but do not compete with the authentic donor splice site. Moreover, we show that the selection of the 5&#x02032; splice site follows a scanning-type mechanism, precluding competition with other functional 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites available on immediate sequence context downstream of the activated one. In addition, 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites with an increased complementarity to U1snRNA up to 91&#x00025; do not compete with the identified scanning mechanism. Altogether, these findings, which unveil a cell type&#x02013;independent 5&#x02032;&#x02212;3&#x02032;-oriented scanning process for accurate recognition of the authentic 5&#x02032; splice site, reconciliate apparently contradictory observations by establishing a hierarchy of competitiveness among the determinants involved in 5&#x02032; splice site selection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Typically, mammalian genes contain coding sequences (exons) separated by non-coding sequences (introns). Introns are removed during pre-mRNA splicing. The accurate recognition of introns during splicing is essential, as any abnormality in that process will generate abnormal mRNAs that can cause diseases. Understanding the mechanisms of accurate splice site selection is of prime interest to life scientists. Exon&#x02013;intron borders (splice sites) are defined by short sequences that are poorly conserved. The strength of any splice sequence can be assessed by its degree of homology with a splice site consensus sequence. Within exons and introns, several sequences can match with this consensus as well as or better than the splice sites. Using a system in which a splice site sequence is repeated several times in the intron, the authors showed that linear 5&#x02032;&#x02212;3&#x02032; search is a leading mechanism underlying splice site selection. This scanning mechanism is cell type&#x02013;independent, and only the most upstream splice site of all the series is selected, even if splice sites with a better match to the consensus are in the vicinity. These findings reconciliate contradictory observations and establish a hierarchy among the determinants involved in splice site selection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Borensztajn K, Sobrier ML, Duquesnoy P, Fischer AM, Tapon-Bretaudi&#x000e8;re J, et al.

The accurate recognition of exons is a process that requires assembly of the major spliceosome, a macromolecular machinery that involves the coordinated action of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and more than 100 polypeptides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

As a puzzling paradox, in higher eukaryotes, introns are essentially defined by three short and poorly conserved sequences: the 5&#x02032; splice site, the branch point, and the 3&#x02032; splice site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, as splice site consensus motifs are degenerated, within a typical mammalian transcript, several sequences, in addition to the authentic splicing elements, referred to as pseudo-sites, may match the consensus splice site signals, and sometimes even better than the real splice sites. These elements define a set of pseudo-exons that greatly outnumber genuine exons, but that are normally not included in mature mRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A number of structural features has been shown to play a key role in 5&#x02032; splice site selection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. One of them is the splice site sequence itself. The 5&#x02032; splice site consensus sequence comprises nine partially conserved nucleotides at the exon&#x02013;intron boundary: MAG/guragu (with M and r standing for A or C and a or g, respectively, and / denoting the cleavage site). This consensus actually reflects the base pairing between the donor splice sequence and the 5&#x02032; terminus of the U1snRNA, which is involved in the early steps of splicing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. For a given splice site, the strength of this interaction is usually assessed by its consensus value (CV) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Besides this interaction, different sets of auxiliary cis-regulatory elements, known as splicing enhancers or silencers, contribute to the identification of authentic 5&#x02032; splice sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The situation may be complicated by the presence, within several genes, of minisatellites, with their first monomer element spanning an exon&#x02013;intron boundary. As a consequence, the exact sequence of the splice donor site is reiterated in the following intron. Such minisatellites provide an outstanding physiological model to study the mechanisms underlying splice site selection. However, the resulting splicing pattern has been investigated in very few cases only, and demonstrated the activation of only the most and second-most upstream pseudo-sites. Such is the case for the second intronic sequence of the human interferon-inducible <italic>6&#x02013;16</italic> gene, in which the authentic splice donor site is followed by 25 pseudo-sites, whereas transcript analysis demonstrated the constitutive utilisation of the two most proximal pseudo-sites in addition to the authentic one &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Two pseudo-sites are also utilised in addition to the authentic splice donor site in the human <italic>CBS</italic> gene, encoding the cystathionine beta-synthase, that contains a minisatellite in intron (IVS) 13 with 15&#x02212;20 monomer repeats&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

The IVS7 5&#x02032; authentic donor splice site UGG/gugggu (where / represents the cleavage site) is, therefore, followed by four to eight copies of 5&#x02032; pseudo-splice sites that are strictly identical in sequence; however, strikingly, in physiological conditions, only the most upstream 5&#x02032; splice site is used &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

This observation led us to propose the existence of a physiological mechanism that, in the presence of consecutive splice consensus sequences, would exclusively stimulate and select the most upstream 5&#x02032; splice site, rather than repress the 3&#x02032; following pseudo-site(s) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

RT-PCR amplification of <italic>F7</italic> transcripts isolated from Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells transfected with the wild-type minigene yielded a 842-bp amplicon resulting from normal splicing of the entire IVS7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 1). This result, which was obtained with the use of primers Pe and Pm, was reproduced with other primer sets that flank IVS7 (unpublished data).</p><p>By contrast, in similar assays performed with the mutant constructs p<italic>F7</italic>m and p<italic>F7</italic>m1 to p<italic>F7</italic>m5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;7), no normal splicing could be detected. More precisely, transient transfection of constructs p<italic>F7</italic>m1 to p<italic>F7</italic>m4 resulted in the generation of two kinds of aberrantly spliced products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;6), one of size that was always slightly larger than expected. Sequencing of the corresponding RT-PCR products demonstrated that sequential inactivation of the 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites led to the activation of the next, most upstream functional IVS7 5&#x02032; pseudo-site available. Such activation of a cryptic site led to the retention of short portions of IVS7 in the corresponding mutant cDNA between exons 7 and 8, accounting for the slight size differences between the resulting RT-PCR products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g002">Figure 2</xref>B); sequencing of the second aberrantly spliced product, which was smaller in size than expected, showed that it corresponds to a unique molecular species lacking the entire exon 7 (exon skipping), thereby demonstrating that, for those constructs, the IVS6 donor splice site was utilized in combination with the IVS7 acceptor splice site. Strikingly, the relative amount of the two observed splicing products seemed to differ according to the construct, as shown after ethidium bromide staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 3 to 6). Indeed, although our approach was not quantitative, the intensity of the larger products corresponding to the activation of each of the cryptic sites clearly decreased according to the number of inactivated pseudo-sites, while concurrently, the intensity of the smaller product lacking exon 7 increased. In keeping with these observations, in cells transfected with the p<italic>F7</italic>m5 construct, in which all pseudo-sites were inactivated, only the product resulting from exon 7 skipping could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 7), whereas in cells transfected with the p<italic>F7</italic>m construct, in which only the first 5&#x02032; splice site was inactivated, a single product was identified, resulting from the activation of the 5&#x02032; pseudo-site located in the second 37-bp monomer element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 2). For all transfection experiments, examination of 50 additional clones obtained after subcloning of non-purified RT-PCR products generated with primers Pe and Pm failed to detect any other splice variants, thereby indicating that such species, if they indeed exist, are expressed at extremely low levels.</p><p>Altogether, these data show that the five IVS7 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites are potentially functional but do not compete for splicing with the IVS7 authentic donor splice site. They also reveal that when several adjacent pseudo-sites are inactivated, only the most upstream functional IVS7 5&#x02032; pseudo-site available is used, suggesting the existence of an accurate mechanism underlying the selection of the active 5&#x02032; splice site.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Selection of the 5&#x02032; Splice Site Follows a Scanning-Type Mechanism Precluding Competition with Other Most Upstream Functional 5&#x02032; Pseudo-Site Available on Immediate Sequence Context</title><p>To gain insights into the mechanism underlying selection of the donor splice site, we next generated <italic>F7</italic> minigenes containing functional 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites, separated by one or several inactivated 5&#x02032; splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

This model predicts that a mutation involving a 5&#x02032; splice site would prevent the recognition of the upstream exon, leading to skipping of this exon and/or activation of a cryptic site that lies in this exon.</p><p>To gain insight into the initiation step of the scanning process, we first looked for potential cryptic donor splice sites within exon 7 of the <italic>F7</italic> gene. As previously reported, a strong exonic cryptic site is located at IVS7&#x02013;115, with a CV of 72, close to the CV of the authentic IVS7 5&#x02032; splice site sequence (CV of 74) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We subsequently generated two constructs, derived from p<italic>F7</italic>wt and p<italic>F7</italic>m, in which this exonic cryptic site TTG/GTGAAT (CV of 72) was mutated toward TAG/GTGAAT (CV of 85), so that its resulting CV is above that of the 5&#x02032; authentic splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g009">Figure 9</xref>A, top and middle), and tested whether this improved cryptic site could be selected for splicing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g009">Figure 9</xref>A (bottom), this point mutation did not modify the splicing patterns, as compared with those associated with p<italic>F7</italic>wt and p<italic>F7</italic>m, a result that was confirmed by sequence analysis of the corresponding RT-PCR products. These results, therefore, support the hypothesis that, in these experimental conditions, the search for the active 5&#x02032; site initiates downstream of this exonic cryptic site<italic>.</italic></p><p>However, an alternative explanation is the decreased splicing efficiency of unusually small exons: indeed, a 5&#x02032; splice site located too close to the 3&#x02032; splice site may have been ignored due to the excessively small size of the potential exon &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. To test this hypothesis, we chose to work on another sequence located in exon 7 (CCGCGGC, with a CV of 28&#x00025;) that, if selected for splicing, would yield an exon of 70 nucleotides (versus 124 nucleotides in the normal situation). This size seemed reasonable, since, as demonstrated recently, the length of abnormal exons that result from cryptic 5&#x02032; splice site usage is comprised of between 50 and 250 nucleotides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. We modified this sequence in order to generate two additional mutants harbouring the following potential splice sequences: CCGGTCGGC, with a CV of 72, very close to the CV of the authentic splice site (74), and CAGGTAGGC with a CV of 89, above that of the authentic 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g009">Figure 9</xref>B, top and middle). Again, the PCR products generated from all the constructs and subsequent sequencing demonstrated the exclusive use of the authentic 5&#x02032; site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g009">Figure 9</xref>B, bottom). These data strongly argue against an excessively small size of the potential exon as a structural feature precluding the use of an exonic cryptic donor splice site. Taken together, these results further strengthen the hypothesis that the scanning process initiates downstream of exonic cryptic sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The human <italic>F7</italic> gene, which encodes an essential coagulation factor, provides a remarkable model to decipher the mechanism underlying 5&#x02032; splice site selection in mammals. The first 37-bp monomer element of the polymorphic minisatellite located in IVS7 contains the exon7&#x02013;IVS7 junction. As a consequence, in the primary transcripts, several IVS7 5&#x02032; splice sites (ranging from five to nine), identical in sequence, compete to join a single 3&#x02032; acceptor site. It is, however, noteworthy that physiologically, only the most upstream 5&#x02032; splice site is used, the unused 5&#x02032; splice sites being referred to as pseudo-sites. Therefore, IVS7 of the human <italic>F7</italic> gene must rely upon peculiar mechanisms to accurately control splice site selection. We have previously proposed a model imparting a strong preference for use of the most upstream 5&#x02032; pseudo-site, rather than some repression of the downstream following ones &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. The results of the present study lend strong support to this model. They also provide several lines of evidence that favour an unbending scanning model that, in the context of several functional 5&#x02032; splice sites, would always select the most upstream 5&#x02032; splice site through a mechanism that precludes competition with other functional 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites<italic>.</italic></p><p>This study was initiated to test whether the different 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites located in IVS7 of the <italic>F7</italic> gene are functional. Indeed, although all these sites are identical in sequence to the authentic one, one cannot exclude the possibility that they are unused because of a particular sequence context that could act through different means&#x02014;such as, for instance, a secondary structure-dependent mechanism that would mask these pseudo-sites. We examined the possible secondary structure elements using different prediction of secondary structure tools, such as those at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genebee.msu.su/services/rna2_reduced.html">http://www.genebee.msu.su/services/rna2&#x0005f;reduced.html</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/rna/form1.cgi">http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/rna/form1.cgi</ext-link>.</p><p>However, we did not show any arrangement specific to the sequence surrounding the pseudo-sites, which could explain the splicing phenotype observed in our study. Previous studies suggested that the 5&#x02032; splice sites whose activation would lead to a premature stop codon are not used so that an open reading frame is maintained &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, in our system, such a mechanism would predict the alternative use, in addition to the authentic 5&#x02032; splice site, of the fifth and sixth 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites that do not lead to a premature stop codon (unpublished data); as shown here, however, this is not the case. An alternative explanation accounting for the non-utilisation of the 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites is that, as suggested by others &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, they reside in a sequence context that hampers their utilisation. We could, however, exclude the involvement of intronic cis-acting auxiliary sequences in the splice site selection. Our data, which demonstrate that all 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites can be efficiently activated, argue against this hypothesis and rather suggest that these sites, though functional, are physiologically unused because of a competition-based mechanism. As shown here, the major determinant of this mechanism would be the location of these sites relative to each other: the more upstream intronic functional donor splice site is much more competitive and is actually the only one to be selected for splicing. These results strongly suggest a mechanism of oriented linear search for the selection of the 5&#x02032; splice site, starting upstream of the intervening sequence. Indeed, alternative modes of scanning processes would predict the use of other 5&#x02032; splice sites downstream.</p><p>The strength of this model is attested to by the fact that 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites with a CV as high as 91 still do not compete with the most upstream functional site, since they are not used for splicing, even at low efficiency. And only 5&#x02032; pseudo-sites with a CV of 100, hence perfectly matching the consensus sequence, can shift splicing toward their use, even though they still do not preclude the use of the most upstream functional site with a much lower CV. In this regard, it is important to underline that the optimal splice sequences are extremely rare in human genes. A compilation of authentic and cryptic donor splice sequences revealed that the average CV of authentic splice sites was 82.96 &#x000b1; 6&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, which is not only far below the optimal homology (CV of 100&#x00025;), but also below the CV of pseudo-sites that we showed to be unable to compete with the most upstream 5&#x02032; splice. Moreover, a recent comparative analysis of human donor splice sequences showed that of 45,519 genes, only 2,360 contained a CV of 90&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The low frequency of donor splice sequences perfectly matching the consensus could be explained by the fact that, as shown in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, hyperstabilization of the spliceosome (with more than seven potential Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs to U1snRNA) would inhibit the splicing process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our observations raise the larger question of the mechanism by which the most upstream functional site is recognised by the splicing machinery. In other words, what are the determinants involved in the initial step of such an oriented scanning process? This question is still open, although, in the case of <italic>F7</italic>, we could show that the increase of the CV of the exonic cryptic sites failed to induce their activation, thereby implying that scanning initiates downstream of these sites<italic>.</italic> Other data presented here, however, indicate that the extent to which the orientated scanning process is activated is distance-dependent: the further away the most upstream functional 5&#x02032; pseudo-site is from the authentic splice site, the more the IVS6 donor splice site is activated, leading to exon 7 skipping. These data, therefore, suggest that the identified oriented scanning process, even if predominant, is not exclusive. In this regard, other mechanisms such as those underlying exon definition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, or those showing a decreased splicing efficiency of exons that are unusually large &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; or small &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, may also be involved in a balance that, in turn, favors one or the other 5&#x02032; splice site that flanks the defined exon, according to the distance in between these two sites.</p><p>Although a scanning process is widely accepted as an important mechanism for the selection of 3&#x02032; splice sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b034">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, none has gained general acceptance for the selection of the 5&#x02032; splice sites. Pioneering studies were performed using a model in which tandem duplications of the donor or acceptor RNA splice sites of the second intervening sequence were introduced in the human G gamma-globin gene. The transcript analysis demonstrated that splicing occurred only at the proximal copy of the duplicated splice sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. From these results, in the presence of only two competing splice sites, a scanning model for splice site selection was proposed, but this model was still a matter of debate because a similar study performed by another group yielded opposite results &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. The exon definition model also involves a scanning process; however, this one starts at the 3&#x02032; end of the upstream intron &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, and elements of the splicing complex then progressively scan the sequence downstream through the adjacent exon to locate a suitable 5&#x02032; splice consensus sequence. This model, therefore, predicts that a 5&#x02032; splice site mutation will lead either to the skipping of the exon upstream of the mutated 5&#x02032; splice site, or to activation of an exonic cryptic splice site that corresponds to the first suitable 5&#x02032; consensus sequence encountered by the spliceosome. Our data partly integrate the splicing patterns predicted by the exon definition model: as predicted by this model, we observed the skipping of exon 7 at different efficiencies for the constructs carrying consecutive inactivations of the more upstream pseudo-sites. However, they also diverge from this model in that activation of the strongest exonic cryptic donor splice site&#x02014;as predicted by the exon definition model&#x02014;was never observed, even when the CV of this cryptic site was increased, bringing further complexity to the characteristics of this mechanism. Finally, similar experiments performed in cells originating from different types and species, such as CHO, COS-7, and HeLa cells, gave rise to the same splicing patterns, providing evidence that the herein identified oriented scanning mechanism that occurs within this unusually arranged region does not require any cell-specific factor, but rather relies on the constitutive splicing machinery.</p><p>In summary, our results strongly suggest that, in the presence of consecutive potential splice sites in the neighbouring sequence, unbending scanning will rule the selection of the activated 5&#x02032; splice site. In the absence of such sequences, according to the above-mentioned studies, the selection of the activated splice site seems to rely upon its strength&#x02014;i.e., its complementarity to U1snRNA. Taken together, our data reconciliate apparently contradictory observations in the mechanisms of 5&#x02032; splice site recognition in mammals by establishing a hierarchy of competitiveness among the determinants involved in this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid constructs.</title><p>A 3.5-kb <italic>F7</italic> genomic region spanning intron 4 to exon 8 (nt7688&#x02013;11188) was amplified from a normal individual and from the FVII-deficient patient identified previously who carried a homozygous mutation (<italic>9726T&#x0003e;G)</italic> in IVS7 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020138-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; The PCR amplification was performed with primers Pa and Pm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020138-g001">Figure 1</xref>) using the Expand high-fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed from 5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA, with random hexamers as primers (Pharmacia) and Superscript II (Invitrogen).

Briefly, these scores reflect the degree of conservation in different positions resulting from the alignment of 1,446 5&#x02032; splice sites of other genes. The consensus 5&#x02032; splice site sequence is MAG/guragu and spans from the position &#x02212;3 (the third nucleotide from the 3&#x02032; end of the upstream exon) to &#x0002b;6 (the sixth nucleotide in the intron). A score of 100 represents the best match to the consensus, whereas 0 is the worst.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html</ext-link>) accession number for the <italic>F7</italic> gene is NM&#x0005f;000131.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr C.
