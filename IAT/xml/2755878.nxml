MutL&#x003b1; is not essential for this reaction but enhances excision termination, although the basis of this effect has been uncertain. One model attributes the primary termination function in this system to RPA, with MutL&#x003b1; functioning in a secondary capacity by suppressing Exo1 hydrolysis of mismatch-free DNA (Genschel, J., and Modrich, P. (2003) <italic>Mol. Cell</italic> 12, 1077&#x02013;1086). A second invokes MutL&#x003b1; as the primary effector of excision termination (Zhang, Y., Yuan, F., Presnell, S. R., Tian, K., Gao, Y., Tomkinson, A. E., Gu, L., and Li, G. M. (2005) <italic>Cell</italic> 122, 693&#x02013;705). In the latter model, RPA provides a secondary termination function, but together with HMGB1, also participates in earlier steps of the reaction. To distinguish between these models, we have reanalyzed the functions of MutL&#x003b1;, RPA, and HMGB1 in 5&#x02032;-directed mismatch-provoked excision using purified components as well as mammalian cell extracts. Analysis of extracts derived from A2780/AD cells, which are devoid of MutL&#x003b1; but nevertheless support 5&#x02032;-directed mismatch repair, has demonstrated that 5&#x02032;-directed excision terminates normally in the absence of MutL&#x003b1;. Experiments using purified components confirm a primary role for RPA in terminating excision by MutS&#x003b1;-activated Exo1 but are inconsistent with direct participation of MutL&#x003b1; in this process. While HMGB1 attenuates excision by activated Exo1, this effect is distinct from that mediated by RPA.

When triggered by a mismatched base pair, removal of a DNA biosynthetic error by this system is targeted to the newly synthesized strand by secondary signals within the helix. Although the strand signals that direct eukaryotic mismatch repair have not been identified, a strand break in the form of a nick or gap is sufficient to direct repair to the discontinuous strand in cell extracts, and there is evidence that similar signals may function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Analysis of the cell extract reaction has shown that the mammalian repair system possesses a bidirectional capability in the sense that the strand break that directs repair can be located either 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; to the mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Several purified mammalian systems have been described that support 3&#x02032; and/or 5&#x02032;-directed mismatch-provoked excision or repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The simplest of these depends on the mismatch recognition activities MutS&#x003b1; (MSH2&#x000b7;MSH6 heterodimer) or MutS&#x003b2; (MSH2&#x000b7;MSH3 heterodimer), MutL&#x003b1; (MLH1&#x000b7;PMS2 heterodimer), the single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> and the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; double-strand hydrolytic activity Exo1 (exonuclease 1). These four activities support a mismatch-provoked excision reaction directed by a 5&#x02032; strand break, and excision terminates upon mismatch removal. MutL&#x003b1; is not essential for this excision reaction, but together with RPA has been implicated in excision termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In addition, the non-histone protein HMGB1 has been found to be required for mismatch repair in partially fractionated mammalian nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This small DNA binding protein has been postulated to functionally complement RPA in this 5&#x02032;-directed system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Supplementation of MutS&#x003b1;, MutL&#x003b1;, RPA, and Exo1 with the replication clamp PCNA proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the clamp loader replication factor C (RFC) yields a system that supports mismatch-provoked excision directed by a 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The basis of the bidirectional excision capability of this system was clarified with the demonstration that MutL&#x003b1; is a latent endonuclease that is activated in a mismatch-, MutS&#x003b1;-, RFC-, and ATP-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Incision by activated MutL&#x003b1; is restricted to the discontinuous strand of a nicked heteroduplex and tends to occur on the distal side of the mismatch. Thus, for a nicked heteroduplex in which the strand break resides 3&#x02032; to the mismatch, activated MutL&#x003b1; introduces an additional strand break 5&#x02032; to the mispair. This 5&#x02032; strand discontinuity provides the loading site for the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; excision system described above, which removes the mismatch.</p><p>MutS&#x003b1; has been shown to activate the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; hydrolytic function of Exo1 on heteroduplex DNA, rendering the exonuclease highly processive, an effect attributed to physical interaction of the two activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, there are differences in the literature with respect to the roles of RPA and MutL&#x003b1; in the control of this processive activity that leads to termination of 5&#x02032;-directed excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). One study has ascribed the primary excision termination function to RPA, which was shown to reduce the processive hydrolytic tracts of the MutS&#x003b1;&#x000b7;Exo1 complex from &#x02248;2,000 to &#x02248;250 nucleotides and by binding to gaps, to restrict Exo1 access to 5&#x02032; termini in excision intermediates and products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Analysis of excision intermediates as a function of nick-mismatch separation distance led to the conclusion that MutS&#x003b1; is able to reload Exo1 at an RPA-filled gap provided that a mismatch remains in the molecule; however, excision is attenuated upon mismatch removal because MutS&#x003b1; is no longer able to assist in this regard. In this mechanism MutL&#x003b1; functions in excision termination by suppressing nonspecific hydrolysis of the mismatch-free product, an effect attributed to its function as a general negative regulator of Exo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). By contrast, a second study has attributed the primary termination function in this 5&#x02032;-directed excision system to MutL&#x003b1;, with RPA playing a secondary role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In this mechanism RPA has several proposed functions. It is postulated to bind to the 5&#x02032; strand break where MutS&#x003b1; recruits HMGB1. RPA and HGB1 then partially melt the helix in the vicinity of the strand break leading to recruitment of Exo1, which initiates processive 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; hydrolysis. Binding of RPA to the ensuing gap results in displacement of MutS&#x003b1; and HMGB1 from the DNA and promotes physical interaction of the exonuclease with MutL&#x003b1;. This results in Exo1 inactivation and dissociation of the MutL&#x003b1;&#x000b7;Exo1 complex from the substrate. As in the other mechanism described above, Exo1 is reloaded if a mismatch remains within the DNA.</p><p>To distinguish between these models, we have reassessed the roles of MutL&#x003b1;, RPA, and HMGB1 in mammalian mismatch repair. We demonstrate that 5&#x02032;-directed excision terminates normally in extracts of A2780/AD cells, which support 5&#x02032;-directed mismatch repair despite deficiency of MLH1 and PMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Reanalysis of 5&#x02032;-directed mismatch-provoked excision in the purified system described above has confirmed a direct role for RPA in terminating processive excision by MutS&#x003b1;-activated Exo1 but is inconsistent with direct participation of MutL&#x003b1; in this process. These experiments also indicate that while HMGB1 can attenuate Exo1 excision, this effect is distinct from that mediated by RPA.

In one method, DNA recovered from an excision reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) was digested with NheI and ClaI (2 units each) and digestion products quantified after agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium staining as described above. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, this assay scores conversion of an NheI site located 5 bp from the mismatch to an endonuclease-resistant form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The second method is based on localization of excision tract end points by indirect end-labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In these experiments, DNA isolated from reactions using purified proteins was digested with AseI (5 units) or ClaI (2 units). For assays performed using nuclear extracts and the G-T heteroduplex with a 128-bp mismatch strand break separation distance, reaction products were digested with AseI (5 units) and Sau96I (0.5 units). Double digestion in this manner restores the original strand break in the substrate, which is subject to partial ligation in extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

The concentrations of the protein components used in this system are similar to those present in 50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g of nuclear extract, extract levels routinely used to study cell-free mismatch repair. Efficient excision in this system depends strongly on Exo1, MutS&#x003b1;, and RPA. HMGB1 can partially substitute for RPA in the reconstituted reaction, but MutL&#x003b1; is not required for mismatch-provoked hydrolysis. As discussed above, previous work with this model system has led to the suggestion that together with RPA, MutL&#x003b1; functions in excision termination. One study has attributed the primary termination function to RPA, with MutL&#x003b1; acting after the fact to stabilize excision products by suppressing Exo1 hydrolysis of the now mismatch-free DNA, an effect that also enhances the mismatch dependence of the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). A second study ascribes to MutL&#x003b1; an active role as the primary factor that terminates excision by MutS&#x003b1;-activated Exo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>To distinguish these possibilities, we have evaluated the kinetics of heteroduplex hydrolysis supported by MutS&#x003b1;, Exo1, and RPA as a function of nick-mismatch separation distance (128, 494, or 808 bp), and the absence or presence of MutL&#x003b1;. Previous experiments have demonstrated that 280 fmol of MutL&#x003b1; (&#x0223c;3 times that present in 50 &#x003bc;g of HeLa nuclear extract; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>inset</italic>) is optimal for 5&#x02032;-directed excision in the purified system used here. Two major zones of excision termination were observed with all heteroduplexes, corresponding to progression of hydrolysis to about 40&#x02013;100 or 220&#x02013;350 nucleotides beyond the mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). These species were observed in the absence or presence of 280 fmol of MutL&#x003b1;, indicating that MutL&#x003b1; is not required for their production. Both species were metastable and subject to additional hydrolysis, particularly at long incubation times in the absence of MutL&#x003b1;. Supplementation of the reactions with 280 fmol of the MHL1&#x000b7;PMS2 heterodimer increased the lifetime of both species, rendering them less susceptible to further hydrolysis, an effect that is particularly apparent for the heteroduplexes in which the nick and mismatch are separated by 128 or 494 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of MutL&#x003b1; on 5&#x02032;-directed excision in a purified system.</bold> Excision reactions (&#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;) contained per time sample 24 fmol of 5&#x02032; G-T heteroduplex DNA, 400 fmol of MutS&#x003b1;, 900 fmol of RPA, 21 fmol of Exo1, and MutL&#x003b1; as indicated.

As discussed in the text, stability of these zones was modulated by the presence of MutL&#x003b1;.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0360984550003"/></fig><p>Because some experiments with this reconstituted 5&#x02032;-excision system have utilized as much as 1100 fmol of MutL&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), about 12 times that present in 50 &#x003bc;g of nuclear extract, we have also evaluated effects of high levels of the protein on excision with the three heteroduplexes. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, the primary excision product produced in the presence of 1100 fmol of MutL&#x003b1; corresponds to the species located 40&#x02013;100 nucleotides beyond the mismatch, with only low levels of the smaller product observed. However, this is accompanied by a general inhibition of mismatch-provoked hydrolysis, an effect that is particularly evident in the accumulation of excision intermediates that fail to reach the mismatch within the incubation times employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that MutL&#x003b1; does not play an active role in excision termination in this system, but rather functions to stabilize excision products produced during the course of the MutS&#x003b1;-, Exo1-, and RPA-dependent reaction.</p><p>MutL&#x003b1; and MutS&#x003b1; have previously been shown to suppress Exo1 hydrolysis of DNA that lacks a mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). For purposes of comparison with the heteroduplex results described above, we have used the indirect end-labeling assay employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> to monitor the effect of MutL&#x003b1; on Exo1 hydrolysis of nicked homoduplex DNA in the presence of MutS&#x003b1; and RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Results with the mismatch-free DNA differ dramatically from those obtained with heteroduplex substrates. As can be seen, incubation with MutS&#x003b1;, RPA, and Exo1 resulted in very slow 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; hydrolysis from the strand break at an average rate of about 10 nucleotides min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Furthermore, digestion in this manner was largely suppressed by the presence of MutL&#x003b1;, with 280 fmol of the protein being largely sufficient in this regard. These results confirm previous conclusions concerning the negative regulatory effect of MutL&#x003b1; on Exo1 hydrolysis of homoduplex DNA and substantiate the idea that the role of this activity in terminating Exo1 hydrolysis is the stabilization of primary excision products.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Excision on homoduplex DNA in the purified system.</bold> Excision reactions were performed as described in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic> except that the substrate contained an A&#x000b7;T base pair instead of a G-T mismatch.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0360984550004"/></fig></sec><sec><title>HMGB1 Effects on 5&#x02032;-Directed Excision in the Purified System</title><p>The nonhistone chromatin protein HMGB1 interacts with MutS&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and has been postulated to provide an RPA-like function in the reconstituted 5&#x02032;-directed excision system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

Supplementation with both RPA and HMGB1 resulted in hydrolytic patterns similar, but not identical to those observed with RPA alone. The presence of HMGB1 kinetically stabilized the primary termination products produced in the presence of MutS&#x003b1;, MutL&#x003b1;, Exo1, and RPA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>left panels</italic> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>center panels</italic>), an effect that is particularly apparent for the heteroduplexes in which the nick-mismatch separation distance was 128 or 494 bp. However, it can also be seen that HMGB1 supplementation of MutS&#x003b1;, MutL&#x003b1;, Exo1, and RPA resulted in a general inhibition of hydrolysis. In the case of the G-T heteroduplex with an 808-bp nick-mismatch separation distance, the consequence of this effect was failure of a substantial fraction of the excision tracts to reach the mismatch within the 15-min time course of the experiment. Thus, as in the case of MutL&#x003b1;, the primary effect of HMGB1 on excision in this system appears to be the stabilization of primary termination products that are produced naturally as a consequence of hydrolysis by MutS&#x003b1;-activated Exo1 in the presence of RPA.</p></sec><sec><title>Termination of Hydrolysis by MutS&#x003b1;-activated Exo1 Is Independent of MutL&#x003b1; or HMGB1</title><p>We have previously shown that MutS&#x003b1; activates Exo1 on gapped homoduplex DNA to form a highly processive hydrolytic complex that is regulated by RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

While essentially all 3&#x02032;-directed excision events that occur in HeLa extracts are PCNA-dependent, both PCNA-dependent and -independent modes of 5&#x02032;-directed excision have been documented in this system (supplemental data in Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>We have also found that 5&#x02032;-directed excision tracts that occur A2780/AD extracts terminate within the same region as do those that occur in extracts derived from MutL&#x003b1;-proficient HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and supplemental <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.021287/DC1">S1</ext-link>). Thus, the postulated requirement for MutL&#x003b1; in the termination of mismatch-provoked excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) can be ruled out for the extract system. Analysis of MutL&#x003b1; effects on the termination of hydrolysis by MutS&#x003b1;-activated Exo1 in a purified system is also consistent with this view. We have demonstrated previously in the presence of MutL&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and confirm here in the absence or presence of MutL&#x003b1;, the dramatic effects of RPA on mismatch-provoked excision by MutS&#x003b1;-activated Exo1. Surprisingly, RPA has both positive and negative effector roles in this reaction. The single-strand-binding protein not only stimulates substrate turnover but also functions to stabilize reaction products after mismatch removal (compare <italic>right panels</italic> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> with the <italic>center panels</italic> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, the reaction products produced in the presence of RPA and MutL&#x003b1; are similar to those produced in the presence of RPA alone, although it is clear that MutL&#x003b1; does enhance their lifetime (compare <italic>right</italic> and <italic>center panels</italic> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This substantiates the previous conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) that RPA functions as the primary termination activity in this system, with MutL&#x003b1; functioning after the fact to stabilize primary hydrolytic products against further Exo1 degradation.</p><p>We have also confirmed here the previous finding that RPA functions as a negative regulator of the MutS&#x003b1;&#x000b7;Exo1 complex, reducing its processivity from about 2,000 to about 200 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6</xref> and supplemental <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.021287/DC1">S2</ext-link>). By contrast, MutL&#x003b1; is without significant effect on the processive behavior of activated Exo1. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), we attribute the activating effect of RPA on mismatch-provoked excision to its ability to regulate processive behavior of the MutSa&#x000b7;Exo1 complex. In particular, we suggest that RPA-mediated displacement of MutS&#x003b1; and/or Exo1 excision intermediates and products permits the system to turn over.</p><p>We have also confirmed the ability of the nonhistone protein HMGB1 to stimulate excision by MutS&#x003b1;-activated Exo1 and have evaluated its effects on the processive behavior of this complex. In both cases HMGB1 behaved in a manner distinct from RPA. In amounts comparable to that present in 100 &#x003bc;g of nuclear extract (&#x02248;120 ng as judged by quantitative Western blot, data not shown), HMGB1 significantly stimulated mismatch-provoked excision (compare <italic>center</italic> and <italic>right panels</italic> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), but less effectively than RPA. As in the case of RPA, this effect may be due to the ability of HMGB1 to interfere with progression of the processive hydrolysis, forcing turnover of the hydrolytic complex. However, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, HMGB1 was less effective than RPA with respect to its ability to disrupt processive excision.</p><p>As noted above, the most compelling evidence for an HMGB1 requirement in mammalian mismatch repair has derived from analysis of partially fractionated HeLa cell extracts, a system in which repair was shown to be strongly dependent on HMGB1 addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Inasmuch as HMGB1-proficient and -null cell lines are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), we have evaluated the mismatch repair requirement for this protein in whole cell extracts. In contrast to results obtained with partially fractionated extracts, we have found that unfractionated HMGB1-deficient extracts support robust mismatch repair that can be directed by either a 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; strand break. There are several possible explanations for these different findings. For example, mammalian cell extracts may possess a second activity, which provides a mismatch repair function that is redundant with respect to HMGB1; in this case, the fractionation method employed by Yuan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) may have resolved these two activities. An alternate possibility is that the fractionation method employed by Yuan <italic>et al.</italic> enriched for an inhibitor of the reaction, the action of which is reversed by HMGB1. Distinction between these and other possibilities must await further studies, but we note that as in the case of the unfractionated extracts used here, several purified systems have been described that support highly efficient mismatch repair in the absence of HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of results obtained with the extract and purified systems described here has revealed significant differences in termination zones in the two cases. Excision occurring in extracts is characterized with a single primary termination zone centered about 130&#x02013;140 nucleotides beyond the mispair. By contrast, two major termination zones occur in the purified system, located about 40&#x02013;100 nucleotides or 220&#x02013;350 nucleotides beyond the mismatch, with the former appearing to be a precursor to the latter. As described previously, we regard the reconstituted mismatch repair systems that have been described to date as minimal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and attribute the sort of difference noted above to as yet unidentified extract components that significantly modulate various steps of the reaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_32_21536_v2_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.021287_Genschel_~_Modrich_Supplemental.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This study was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grant R01 GM45190 from the NIGMS.</p></fn><fn id="FN2" fn-type="supplementary-material"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains supplemental Figs. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.021287/DC1">S1 and S2</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="FN4" fn-type="other"><label>3</label><p>R.
