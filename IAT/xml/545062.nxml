Besides their co-regulated imprinted expression, two observations suggest that the spatio-temporal expression of these genes could also be co-regulated.

To date, approximately 70 mammalian imprinted genes have been identified which map to at least 11 regions of the mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Most imprinted genes are therefore located in clusters, which are generally conserved between human and mouse. For some of these clusters, coordinate imprinted gene regulation has been shown to be controlled by imprinting centers (IC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Imprinted genomic regions from the two parents are differentially marked by heritable epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation and histone acetylation and/or methylation. These epigenetic modifications or imprints are established at least for some of them in the germ line of either parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) domain on human chromosome 15q11-q13 and its ortholog on mouse chromosome 7C-D1 are large chromosomal domains containing paternally expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. PWS results from the loss of expression of several of them including <italic>SNURF</italic>-<italic>SNRPN</italic>, <italic>NDN</italic>, <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, <italic>MKRN3 </italic>and the C/D-box small nucleolar RNAs(snoRNAs). In humans, mini-deletions, upstream the <italic>SNURF</italic>-<italic>SNRPN </italic>transcriptional unit, have led to the characterization of an IC which coordinates their imprinted expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. One sub-region of this IC defined as the shortest region of deletion overlap in PWS patients (PWS-SRO) and encompassing the <italic>SNURF</italic>-<italic>SNRPN </italic>promoter, has been shown to be required for maintaining the paternal imprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Its deletion in the germ line or post-zygotically on the paternal chromosome leads to silencing of all paternally expressed genes of the PWS domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In mice, although the <italic>Snrpn </italic>promoter is not required for genomic imprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], deletion of a 35 kb region including 16 kb of sequences upstream <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn </italic>exon 1 to <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn </italic>exon 7 unit also leads to silencing of the paternally expressed genes, indicating that both the position of the IC and its role in the coordinate imprinted expression of genes is conserved between human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Recently, examination of tissue-specific pattern of mRNA expression at a genomic scale allowed the identification of several chromosomal regions harbouring tissue-specific co-regulated genes defined as regions of correlated transcription (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Noticeable, some of these RCTs overlap with known imprinted loci and it suggests that transcriptional regulatory elements controlling imprinted expression might also regulate tissue-specific expression. Therefore, one might hypothesize that this type of regulation is applied at the PWS domain. Two arguments support this hypothesis. First, all the murine orthologues of the PWS genes have been reported to be expressed in the developing nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Second, Nicholls proposed an evolutionary model for the origin of the human and mouse PWS domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this model, the <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn </italic>locus and its associated IC would be the ancestral imprinted transcriptional unit of the domain. The other genes, which are intronless, would have later and sequentially been acquired by retrotransposition and adopted the same imprinted regulation. Altogether, these data suggest that a spatio-temporal co-regulation of PWS genes could exist and have been acquired through the evolution of the domain. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element(s) initially involved in the spatio-temporal regulation of the <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn </italic>locus might influence the spatio-temporal regulation of retrotransposed genes in the PWS region. The IC could be a good candidate to play this role.</p><p>In this study, we investigate this hypothesis. First, we compared the expression pattern of the <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn</italic>, <italic>MBII</italic>-<italic>85</italic>, <italic>MBII</italic>-<italic>52</italic>, <italic>Ndn </italic>and <italic>Magel2 </italic>in the developing mouse embryo. We show that their expression in the embryo is restricted to neural tissues and that these genes display strikingly similar expression patterns in the central nervous system. Second, we created transgenic mice with a BAC containing the <italic>Ndn </italic>and <italic>Magel2 </italic>genes. We showed that the <italic>Ndn </italic>transgene is not imprinted but is correctly expressed in the developing embryo. These results demonstrate that if the IC is required for imprinted regulation, it is not involved in the <italic>Ndn </italic>spatio-temporal regulation. Finally, since we have shown an almost identical spatio-temporal expression profile of <italic>Ndn </italic>and <italic>Magel</italic>2 in the developing embryo, it suggests that these two genes might share common <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements which should be present in the BAC transgene. We therefore searched for DNaseI hypersensitive sites in the <italic>Ndn</italic>-<italic>Magel2 </italic>genomic region and performed comparative genomic analyses in order to identify potential transcriptional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Nervous system tissue-specific expression of mouse PWS genes in the embryo</title><p>In order to determine if mouse PWS genes might be transcriptionally co-regulated, we compared the expression profiles of <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn</italic>, <italic>MBII</italic>-85, <italic>MBII</italic>-52, <italic>Ndn </italic>and <italic>Magel2 </italic>by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in the developing mouse embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

As previously reported for <italic>Ndn </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], they are predominantly expressed in all the ventral parts of the neural tube, mostly or even exclusively in marginal areas where differentiating neurons reside.

Since <italic>Ndn </italic>and <italic>Magel2 </italic>are co-regulated and the intergenic region between these two genes is around 30 kb only, we chose a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC 109) containing both genes to generate transgenic mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Three transgenic male founders were obtained and crossed with C57BL/6 females. Only one male transmitted the BAC109 transgene to its progeny and gave rise to the transgenic line 92 (Tg92) described in this study. The presence of BAC vector sequences allowed us to discriminate the transgenic from the wild type DNA. Genomic DNA from Tg92 mice was thoroughly analyzed by PFGE, Southern blot and PCR, to precisely determine the structure and the number of copy of the integrated transgene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, data not shown).

However, since the whole human and mouse PWS domains are rather highly conserved which might render difficult to discriminate between functional and non functional CNS, we first undertook an experimental approach.

Hybridization with probe 2 revealed two additional but weaker DNase I hypersensitivity sites on the paternal allele (HS3 and HS4), localized in the <italic>Ndn </italic>5'UTR and at the beginning of the coding region, respectively. In contrast to the paternal allele, the maternal allele was highly resistant to DNase I digestion. In the adult kidney, a tissue in which <italic>Ndn </italic>is not expressed, the two parental alleles were highly and almost equally resistant to DNase I digestion (data not shown).

HS5 was present on both maternal and paternal alleles and in tissues in which <italic>Magel2 </italic>and/or <italic>Ndn </italic>are not expressed such as the adult kidney (data not shown) which suggests that this DNase I hypersensitive site is not linked to the transcriptional activity of these two genes.</p><p>No prominent DNase I hypersensitive site were detected in the <italic>Ndn</italic>-<italic>Magel2 </italic>intergenic region (excepted HS5).

Finally, hybridization of probe 10 on brain <italic>BamH</italic>1-cut DNA allowed the detection of a lower hybridization band, revealing one or potentially two DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS6a or/and HS6b). We were not able to precisely localise the HS6 site(s) as well as its (their) parental origin.</p><p>We next mapped HS1 to 6 DNase I hypersensitive sites on a mouse/human sequence alignment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6-C</xref>). The available mouse sequences used for this comparison start from -17.5 kb upstream the <italic>Ndn </italic>gene to the <italic>Magel2 </italic>extremity of BAC109. Several CNS defined as orthologous sequences greater than 100 bp and greater than 70% identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] were found and mainly gathered into three regions: upstream the <italic>Ndn </italic>gene (region A), in the intergenic <italic>Ndn</italic>-<italic>Magel2 </italic>region (region B) and in a 2.8 kb upstream the <italic>Magel2 </italic>gene (region C). None of the hypersensitive sites identified in this study mapped to region A, B or C. HS1/2 which are closely linked to the transcriptional activity of the <italic>Ndn </italic>gene are localized in a CNS immediately upstream the <italic>Ndn </italic>gene. HS5 co-localized to an isolated CNS localized 0.7 kb upstream the highly conserved C region and around 1 kb upstream the newly described full length <italic>Magel2 </italic>ESTs. However, the functional significance of HS5 in the <italic>Magel2 </italic>and/or <italic>Ndn </italic>gene transcriptional regulation remains to be determined since this site was neither allele nor tissue-specific. It should be noted that there was almost no conservation of sequence in the region downstream the <italic>Magel2 </italic>gene.

Particularly striking was their identical pattern of expression in the E10.5 embryo. At later developmental stages, <italic>Magel2 </italic>expression domain became more restricted but remained included in <italic>Ndn </italic>expression domain. <italic>Magel2 </italic>transcripts were however detected at very low levels in almost all the structures in which <italic>Ndn </italic>was expressed, including non neuronal structures such as the mandibular component of the first branchial arch, the tongue and the muscles. <italic>Magel2 </italic>transcripts have been reported to be particularly instable due to the presence of AU-rich elements (ARE) in their 3' untranslated region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and this could explain why they were detected at such low levels.</p><p>Our expression analysis in the mouse embryo indeed suggests the existence of a central nervous system-specific neural regulatory element coordinating the PWS genes expression. <italic>Ndn </italic>and <italic>Magel2</italic>, specifically, could share additional regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-expression of PWS genes and the IC</title><p>We further emitted the hypothesis that the central nervous system-specific regulatory element could be physically associated to the PWS IC because of the proposed evolutionary history of the PWS domain and because the IC is involved in coordinating long range chromatin modifications leading to imprinted expression of genes in the whole domain. The <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn </italic>locus with its associated IC has been proposed to be the most ancestral transcriptional unit of the domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other PWS genes (<italic>Ndn</italic>, <italic>Magel2</italic>, <italic>Mkrn3 </italic>and <italic>Frat3</italic>) would have later been acquired by retroposition and/or local <italic>cis</italic>-duplication of retroposed genes and would have adopted the same transcriptional regulation as the <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn </italic>transcriptional unit. Unless retroposons arise from reverse-transcriptase-mediated processing of aberrant or alternative transcripts including endogenous promoter elements, their functionality is dependent upon regulatory elements present at their site of insertion. Retroposons in the PWS region could have therefore adopted the <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn </italic>regulation both for imprinted and spatio-temporal expression. Finally, the fact that paternal deletions of the IC abolish the expression of all the PWS genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] also suggests a possible intertwining between regulatory elements controlling both imprinting and spatio-temporal expression.</p><p>Our study did not however confirm that the IC might coordinate the spatio-temporal expression of PWS genes.

These results demonstrate that the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences involved in both the developmental and tissue-specific expression of <italic>Ndn </italic>were present in the transgene and were not associated to the IC. The fact that the IC was not involved in the spatio-temporal regulation of the <italic>Ndn </italic>gene does not however exclude its putative involvement in the spatio-temporal regulation of the <italic>Snurf</italic>-<italic>Snrpn </italic>transcriptional unit.

Phylogenetic studies could not predict whether these two genes arose from two distinct retroposition events or whether they arose from the initial retroposition of one of these two genes followed by a <italic>cis</italic>-duplication event (Blanc M., unpublished observations). Their close genomic localisation, within 30 kb in the mouse genome, would however be in favour of this second hypothesis. The co-expression of <italic>Ndn </italic>and <italic>Magel2 </italic>could therefore result from regulatory elements sharing and/or duplication. Intraspecies genomic comparisons of mouse or human <italic>Ndn </italic>and <italic>Magel2 </italic>upstream sequences did not reveal any significant homology which does not exclude the possibility that one of these two genes arose by a <italic>cis</italic>- duplication. Our experimental search for regulatory elements elements in the <italic>Ndn</italic>/<italic>Magel2 </italic>genomic sequences was limited to sequences available in the databases and was therefore not exhaustive. However, we found several DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS1/2, HS3 and 4) linked to <italic>Ndn </italic>transcriptional activity and associated to the <italic>Ndn </italic>promoter. Previous transgenic studies in the zebrafish using a series of hybrid transgenes containing various mouse <italic>Ndn </italic>promoter sequences associated to the reporter LacZ gene suggested that the mouse <italic>Ndn </italic>promoter from -845 bp to +63 bp functioned in the zebrafish embryo in a temporal, spatial and tissue-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In particular, a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element driving the neuronal-specific expression was located into an 87 bp sequence from -173 to -87 bp of the <italic>Ndn </italic>gene which exactly co-localizes with HS1/2. No identified transcriptional factor brain-specific binding site could however be identified in this sequence. Deletion of promoter sequences in <italic>Ndn</italic>-KO mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] did not affect <italic>Magel2 </italic>transcriptional regulation (Watrin F., data not shown) which suggests that if the coordinated <italic>Magel2 </italic>and <italic>Ndn </italic>expression results from the sharing of a putative enhancer, this enhancer is not associated to <italic>Ndn </italic>promoter sequences.</p><p>The human <italic>NDN </italic>gene has been shown to be expressed in a larger panel of tissues than the mouse <italic>Ndn </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] but our data suggest that these two genes might have similar expression profiles in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (data not shown). An interspecific (mouse/human) comparison of available genomic sequences was therefore performed in order to identify genomic sequences involved in central nervous system expression. This comparison did not allow the identification of such sequences but nevertheless brought some new information on the <italic>Magel2 </italic>transcriptional unit, showing the existence of a 2.5 kb highly conserved region upstream the described <italic>Magel2 </italic>gene.

It should be noted that the <italic>Ndn</italic>/<italic>Magel2 </italic>intergenic region was rather well conserved and harbored several regions of low DNase I hypersensitivity which might deserve further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>The transgene is not imprinted</title><p>As expected, our transgene which was physically separated from the IC was not imprinted.

The BAC transgene therefore contained the regulatory elements needed for the spatio-temporal expression of <italic>Ndn </italic>(and most likely <italic>Magel2</italic>) in the developing nervous system. Three hypotheses can be made: 1) the PWS genes co-expression that we observed is incidental, 2) the element(s) localised in genomic sequences surrounding the <italic>Ndn</italic>/<italic>Magel2 </italic>and which regulate(s) <italic>Ndn </italic>(and <italic>Magel2</italic>) expression could also regulate other PWS genes, 3) several central nervous system-specific regulatory elements resulting from duplication events might be present in the PWS domain.
