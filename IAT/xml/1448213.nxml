This applies also to trigeminal ganglion neurons that convey pain inputs from head tissues. Little is, however, known about the plasticity of these receptors on trigeminal neurons in culture, grown without adding the neurotrophin NGF which <italic>per se </italic>is a powerful algogen. The characteristics of such receptors after short-term culture were compared with those of ganglia. Furthermore, their modulation by chronically-applied serotonin or NGF was investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Rat or mouse neurons in culture mainly belonged to small and medium diameter neurons as observed in sections of trigeminal ganglia. Real time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry showed upregulation of P2X<sub>3 </sub>and TRPV1 receptors after 1&#x02013;4 days in culture (together with their more frequent co-localization), while P2X<sub>2 </sub>ones were unchanged. TRPV1 immunoreactivity was, however, lower in mouse ganglia and cultures. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>imaging and whole-cell patch clamping showed functional P2X and TRPV1 receptors. Neurons exhibited a range of responses to the P2X agonist &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-methylene-adenosine-5'-triphosphate indicating the presence of homomeric P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors (selectively antagonized by A-317491) and heteromeric P2X<sub>2/3 </sub>receptors. The latter were observed in 16 % mouse neurons only. Despite upregulation of receptors in culture, neurons retained the potential for further enhancement of P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors by 24 h NGF treatment. At this time point TRPV1 receptors had lost the facilitation observed after acute NGF application. Conversely, chronically-applied serotonin selectively upregulated TRPV1 receptors rather than P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Comparing ganglia and cultures offered the advantage of understanding early adaptive changes of nociception-transducing receptors of trigeminal neurons. Culturing did not prevent differential receptor upregulation by algogenic substances like NGF or serotonin, indicating that chronic application led to distinct plastic changes in the molecular mechanisms mediating pain on trigeminal nociceptors.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons convey sensory inputs including painful stimuli from head tissues like skin and mucosal surfaces, tooth pulp and meninges. The characterization of nociception-transducing receptors on TG neurons thus becomes important to understand certain forms of acute and chronic pain.</p><p>Important pain transducers of noxious stimuli are small and medium size neurons (nociceptors) that can express ATP-activated P2X<sub>3 </sub>subunit-containing receptors and/or capsaicin (and heat) sensitive TRPV1 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Activation of TRPV1 receptors is associated with a slow inward current [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] while ionotropic ATP receptors generate fast currents mediated by P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors, and slow ones mediated by P2X<sub>2 </sub>subunit-containing receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Over-expression of heteromeric P2X<sub>2/3 </sub>receptors is suggested to be associated with chronic pain states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>To understand the molecular basis of chronic pain, it would be helpful to use TG neurons in culture as models to study slow changes in the structure and function of P2X or TRPV1 receptors after exposure to mediators such as serotonin or NGF to mimic certain forms of chronic headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>TG nociceptive neurons are modulated by serotonin (5-HT) in a complex fashion. In fact, 5-HT can excite them through 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] as well as depress their pain signaling via multiple subtypes of the 5-HT<sub>1 </sub>receptor group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], an action which had led to the clinical use of 5-HT<sub>1 </sub>receptor agonists to treat migraine. Furthermore, acute application of 5-HT can strongly potentiate responses mediated by TRPV1 receptors, indicating rapid nociceptive sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, headache is usually a sustained form of pain and its molecular mechanisms including the modulatory action of 5-HT on pain signaling by TG neurons should be studied with long-term experimental models.</p><p>NGF may be an additional contributor to headache because of its increased levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients during headache attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Application of NGF sensitizes spike firing and TRPV1 receptor activity of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and facilitates release of algogenic substances like CGRP from TG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no information on the evolution of TG pain receptors (ATP P2X or TRPV1 ones) during culture since previous studies have simply investigated nociceptors <italic>after </italic>they had been plated for culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, the current study characterized the expression, distribution and function of ATP P2X and TRPV1 receptors in cultured trigeminal neurons in comparison with ganglia. We chose to study rat and mouse neurons because the former had been used in other studies of pain and the latter can provide fundamental new data concerning genetic models of chronic pain. While information concerning P2X receptors in TG is less abundant than those for DRG, it is clear that extrapolating data from DRG to TG is inadvisable in view of the very different distribution, expression and modulation of P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors between these ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Using TG preparations, we addressed the following questions: 1. How do P2X and TRPV1 receptors of rat or mouse TG neurons grown in culture compare with those of ganglia? 2. Are these markers stable in culture and are they functional? 3. Are these pain receptors similar in rat and mouse TGs? 4. Can 5-HT or NGF modulate the function of P2X and TRPV1 receptors on cultured TG neurons? We report significant differences in the expression and pharmacological modulation of P2X and TRPV1 receptors of nociceptive neurons cultured from rat or mouse TGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Rat and mouse neurons are stable in culture without adding NGF</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate if the surface ultrastructure of rat or mouse TG neurons had changed after 24 h in culture. After enzymatic dissection of the ganglion at one d in culture, rat or mouse TG neurons retained their spherical shape with somewhat irregular contour probably resulting from the detachment of satellite cells. The surface of TG neurons in culture was characterized by the presence of small microvilli of different length (200&#x02013;500 nm) emerging from cell body as well as by filamentous structures (2&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;m long, with a cross-section of 120 nm) that remained in contact with the neuron surface for their entire length. These morphological features of TG neurons are typical of rat sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], confirming that culturing conditions without exogenous NGF did not change neuronal phenotype.</p><p>Rat &#x003b2;-tubulinIII positive cells demonstrated good viability <italic>in vitro </italic>(&#x0003c;30 % loss at 4 d; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, left, in which data expressed as neuronal density per unit area are normalized with respect to the number of neurons found at 24 h in culture). Mouse neurons were more labile as their number was more consistently reduced after the second d in culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, right). Nevertheless, at each one of the four days in culture, only 3&#x02013;10 % of total mouse neurons was labeled with antibodies against early markers of apoptosis as JNK or activated caspase3 (not shown). Apoptotic nuclei were also rarely detected.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Survival of neurons in TG ganglia or in culture</bold>.

To quantify changes in neuron specific mRNA neosynthesis for P2X and TRPV1 receptors in culture with respect to the ganglion, we performed real time RT-PCR experiments as a sensitive method to detect changes in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows that, when comparing samples containing an equal amount of the housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA, there was significant upregulation of P2X<sub>3 </sub>and TRPV1 transcripts for rat and mouse neurons <italic>in vitro </italic>with respect to the ganglion after normalization for the neuronal-specific &#x003b2;-tubulinIII marker. In particular, P2X<sub>3 </sub>mRNA showed a peak at 24 h (1.29 fold, P &#x0003c; 0.05, and 1.39 fold, P &#x0003c; 0.01, for rat and mouse, respectively). Rat TRPV1 mRNA analysis showed a peak at 48 h (1.4 fold, P &#x0003c; 0.01), while in the mouse TRPV1 mRNA increased more substantially (1.9 fold, P &#x0003c; 0.001) already at the first d and remained elevated for the following two days. P2X<sub>2 </sub>mRNA signals did not show any significant change.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Real time RT-PCR and western immunoblot of ganglia and cultures</bold>.

Real time amplification experiments showed that equivalent amount of samples (measured as GAPDH mRNA amplification levels) gave undetectable amplification of P2X<sub>2</sub>, P2X<sub>3 </sub>and TRPV1 mRNAs, indicating that the contribution of non-neuronal mRNAs to PCR experiments was minimal.</p><p>Western immunoblotting experiments were performed to investigate protein expression levels for P2X<sub>3</sub>, P2X<sub>2 </sub>and TRPV1 receptors in rat and mouse ganglia as well in culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To study the time course of the protein expression profiles in culture and in the ganglion, we investigated differences in the mature form of rat P2X<sub>3</sub>, P2X<sub>2 </sub>and TRPV1 receptors (bands at 57, 65, 120 kDa) under equal protein loading conditions assessed with &#x003b2;-tubulinIII staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, a and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). While in the case of the TRPV1 receptor there was a significant increment already at 24 h in culture (1.5 fold, P &#x0003c; 0.05), this was not paralleled by P2X<sub>2 </sub>and P2X<sub>3 </sub>expression that showed no substantial change in culture with respect to ganglion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Note that the 120 kDa TRPV1 protein was more prominent in culture than in the ganglion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> a). Moreover, in the case of the P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptor, intermediate bands (45&#x02013;55 kDa) were observed in culture but not in the ganglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> b), indicating that, despite a constant amount of the mature 57 kDa protein, there was a significant increment of P2X<sub>3 </sub>protein expression occurring in culture (2.0 fold, P &#x0003c; 0.05). Analysis of mouse 1&#x02013;3 d cultures revealed similar protein expression behaviour (not shown). The different time profile of data related to TRPV1 expression obtained with real time RT-PCR and western blotting might have been due to a rapid increase in protein translation rate dependent on already present mRNA as reported for the same protein in DRG neurons <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Immunocytochemical analysis was then carried out to further investigate changes in receptor protein expression in culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoreactivity of TG neurons</title><p>The distribution among rat and mouse neurons of P2X<sub>3</sub>, P2X<sub>2 </sub>and TRPV1 receptors in freshly excised ganglia and TG cultures was studied as shown by the example of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> in which rat ganglion immunoreactivity for P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors is compared with 1 d cultured neurons. Neurons labeled by the P2X<sub>3 </sub>antibody were clearly detected, as much as neurons immunoreactive for TRPV1 receptors (right panel).

The number of rat and mouse P2X<sub>3 </sub>or TRPV1 immunoreactive neurons grew by about 20% with respect to the ganglion (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> shows that the considerable difference between mouse and rat neurons expressing TRPV1 receptors in culture was not simply due to the <italic>in vitro </italic>condition: in fact, TRPV1 expressing neurons were clearly more abundant in rat ganglia than in mouse ones as quantified by comparing histograms in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>P2X and TRPV1 immunoreactivity in ganglia and cultures</bold>.

One index for the presence of heteromeric P2X<sub>2/3 </sub>receptors on TG neurons was considered the presence of a residual current (I<sub>residual </sub>in inset to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) at the end of a 2 s-long &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP application (10 &#x003bc;M).

It was interesting to examine how many neurons would express responses indicative of heteromeric receptors. This issue is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> with the distribution of I<sub>residual </sub>(as % of the initial peak, I<sub>peak</sub>) for rat (filled bars) and mouse (grey bars) neurons. We assumed that currents comprising I<sub>residual </sub>at least 5 % of I<sub>peak </sub>were suggestive of heteromeric P2X<sub>2/3 </sub>receptors (vertical dashed line in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) because, under the present conditions, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP was a selective agonist for P2X<sub>3 </sub>subunit-containing receptors. Using this criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], 54 % of rat neurons generated mixed currents, while only 16 % of mouse neurons did so.

Comparing TG ganglia and cultures had not been done before and allowed us to discern distinctive changes in key pain transducing molecules in a species-dependent fashion and to monitor their early adaptive changes <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus demonstrating limits as well as usefulness of the model. Furthermore, the differential upregulation of P2X<sub>3 </sub>and TRPV1 receptors observed after chronically applying either NGF or 5-HT suggested diversity in adapting pain signaling systems to algogenic substances.</p><sec><title>Expression of P2X and TRPV1 receptors in ganglia and culture</title><p>Our culture conditions ensured that small and medium size neurons, normally associated with pain transducing function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], were the largest population, in analogy with observations on sections of trigeminal ganglia. One important question was whether cultured TG neurons expressed P2X and TRPV1 receptors like those found in tissue sections of the TG. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not been investigated before by directly comparing these markers in ganglion sections and in TG cultures.</p><p>Real time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that there was a significant increase in TRPV1 and P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors in culture with little change for P2X<sub>2 </sub>receptors. In addition, the emergence of immature forms of P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors may suggest neosynthesis and trafficking of these proteins to reflect ongoing plasticity. Although both RT-PCR and Western blot yielded unidirectional results, we observed a mismatch in the timecourse of RT-PCR and Western blot signals for TRPV1 receptors. A discrepancy between transcription and translation is not an uncommon phenomenon, as amply discussed in a recent review, because of the complex relationship between mRNA and protein as transcription and translation are governed by independent mechanisms and separate time constants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>While mouse ganglion P2X immunoreactivity data were comparable to those by Ruan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], immunostaining of cultured neurons showed that, in rat and mouse cultures, the number of cells containing P2X<sub>3 </sub>and TRPV1 subunits was significantly increased already at 24 h in culture and remained stable for the following 3 d. Increased immunoreactivity was, however, absent in the case of P2X<sub>2 </sub>receptors.</p><p>Co-expression of P2X and TRPV1 receptors was present in a large number of rat TG neurons, suggesting potential bimodal signaling to pain stimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the small number of neurons immunoreactive for the P2X<sub>2 </sub>receptors acquired significant P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptor immunoreactivity in culture. This change in expression profile might provide the substrate for heteromeric assembly of P2X<sub>2/3 </sub>receptors, typically signaling chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Overall, data from real time RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry suggest upregulation of P2X<sub>3 </sub>and TRPV1 receptors in culture with respect to the ganglion.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular calcium imaging</title><p>Measuring responses only from excitable cells which generated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients to a depolarizing pulse of KCl, we found the proportion of neurons responsive to &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP and the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin similar to the one obtained with immunocytochemistry data. Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients induced by &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP comprised Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx partly via open P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors and mainly via depolarization activated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The complex nature of this Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signal thus accounts for the slow decline of the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP-evoked transients in comparison with the faster decay of membrane currents generated by the same agent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Our present imaging data thus show that functional receptors were expressed at membrane level on the majority of TG neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Membrane currents induced by &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP or capsaicin</title><p>Fast inward currents evoked by &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP were mediated by P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors because of their block by the selective P2X<sub>3 </sub>blocker A-317491, and accord with knockout mouse model data indicating that sensory neurons almost exclusively express P2X<sub>3 </sub>and &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP-insensitive P2X<sub>2 </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. On a significant number of rat TG neurons, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-meATP produced mixed-type currents suggestive of co-expression of P2X<sub>3 </sub>and P2X<sub>2/3 </sub>receptors (the latter responsible for the residual current component). By using ATP it was possible to assess the functional role of P2X<sub>2 </sub>receptors. The amplitude of current responses evoked by ATP was somewhat larger and more frequently followed by a slow residual current, suggesting that P2X<sub>2 </sub>receptors demonstrated with molecular biology or immunocytochemistry could be functional, although their contribution to purinergic signaling was quite limited, in comparison to P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors, in terms of response amplitude and percent of neurons expressing them.</p><p>Capsaicin-mediated responses were more rarely observed on mouse neurons than rat ones in accordance with the low expression level of TRPV1 receptors. Low TRPV1 immunoreactivity is reported also for other murine ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] while high expression is typical of the rat TG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is likely that, in the mouse, thermal nociception (which is normally mediated by TRPV1 receptors in the rat) is transduced, at least in part, by other nociceptive sensor proteins, in addition to TRPV1 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>NGF-induced modulation of P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptor function</title><p>Cultures of sensory neurons are often grown in the presence of high concentrations of NGF, known to be a strong algogen operating via multiple metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our study demonstrated that TG neurons could be grown in culture without exogenous NGF probably because the standard medium contained a small concentration of NGF synthesized by cultured cells as shown by the presence of NGF in homogenates of ganglia and cell cultures. Since the high-affinity binding of NGF to neuronal membranes has a 0.6 nM dissociation constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], it is probable that, in standard culture conditions, there was adequate production of NGF to preserve neuronal viability. It is likely that other endogenously-produced neurotrophins (like for example NT-3, BDNF and GDNF; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] could also play a role in shaping the activity of these receptors.</p><p>Chronically-applied NGF upregulated the function of P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors without changing TRPV1 receptor activity. This observation suggests a model system to test how an excess of NGF expected to occur during certain chronic pain states can bias the pain transducing properties of nociceptors towards purinergic rather than vanilloid function. Such effects by chronic NGF are distinct from the consequence of acute, brief application of this substance that enhanced TRPV1 receptor function as previously reported for DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>5-HT-evoked modulation of TRPV1 receptors</title><p>While TG neurons express several types of 5-HT receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] that can mediate acute nociception via rapid sensitization of TRPV1 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], much less is known about long-term consequences of 24 h exposure to this monoamine. This is an interesting issue because plasma levels (in the micromolar range) of 5-HT remain elevated for many hours during headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Chronic application of 5-HT to TG neurons in culture was followed by a large upregulation of TRPV1 receptor function without affecting P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors. Because 5-HT induces a large, long-lasting increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], it is likely that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dependent changes in second messenger systems triggered such a plasticity of TRPV1 receptor function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Primary cultures of TG neurons could be maintained for a few days without the need of exogenous NGF. This approach provided a useful preparation to explore how chronically-applied algogens, implicated in headache pathophysiology, could generate heightened pain sensitivity. When NGF or 5-HT was tested on such a system, there was differential modulation of purinergic and vanilloid receptors, indicating distinct types of plasticity of nociceptors depending on the type of algogenic substance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture preparation of TG neurons</title><p>Primary cultures of TG ganglion sensory neurons were obtained from C57-Black/6Jico mice or Wistar rats (P10&#x02013;14; an age reported to show a quasi-adult phenotype for P2X receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]). Animals were anesthetized by diethyl ether and decapitated (in accordance with the Italian Animal Welfare Act and approved by the Local Authority Veterinary Service). TG were rapidly excised and enzymatically dissociated in F12 medium (Invitrogen Corp, S.Giuliano Milanese, Italy) containing 0.25 mg/ml trypsin, 1 mg/ml collagenase and 0.2 mg/ml DNAse (Sigma) at 37&#x000b0;C.

For molecular biology or Ca<sup>2+ </sup>imaging experiments, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells were plated. For patch clamp experiments, mouse and rat cells were diluted twice.

In preliminary experiments, analogous amplification of the samples was obtained also with 18S RNA probes. Nevertheless, to normalize the real time PCR results only with respect to neuronal mRNA, amplification of the neuronal specific &#x003b2;-tubulinIII housekeeping gene was chosen.</p><p>Specific TaqMan assays for mouse and rat target mRNA encoding P2X<sub>3</sub>, P2X<sub>2 </sub>and TRPV1, neuronal specific &#x003b2;-tubulinIII, GAPDH mRNA and 18S RNA (respective Applied Biosystems catalogue numbers: Mm00523699_m1, Mm00462952_m1, Mm01246282_m1, Rn01460299_m1, Mm00727586_s1, 4352339E FG, 4308329; www.appliedbiosystems.com) were chosen. All assays were validated for linearity of amplification efficiency and quantitative standard curves were obtained using serial dilutions of ganglia rat or mouse TG cDNA. To ensure absence of amplification artifacts, end point PCR products were initially assessed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels that gave a single band of the expected size for each assay. Negative controls containing no template cDNA were run in each condition and gave no results. The reactions were quantified when the PCR product of interest was first detected (cycle threshold). Calculations for relative mRNA transcript levels were performed using the comparative C<sub>T </sub>method (&#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T</sub>) between cycle thresholds of different reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In particular, the parameter C<sub>T </sub>(threshold cycle) is defined as the cycle number at which the fluorescence emission exceeds the fixed threshold.

Immunofluorescence reactions were visualized using the secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488 or AlexaFluor 594 (1:500 dilution; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The P2X<sub>3 </sub>antibody used for double immunofluorescence experiments was obtained by immunizing a guinea-pig with the peptide CVEKQSTDSGAYSIGH. The specificity of the guinea-pig anti-P2X<sub>3 </sub>antibody was evaluated by western immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments (dilution 1:500 and 1:200, respectively) of HEK-293 cells transfected with pCDNA-P2X<sub>3 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Tissue or cells stained with the secondary antibody only showed no immunostaining. To minimize tissue autofluorescence, TG ganglia were treated with Sudan Black. All images were captured under the same brightness and contrast settings. Control experiments using pre-immune guinea-pig serum gave no signal. In each experiment the number of positive neurons for a given antibody was normalized by dividing the number of positive cells by the number of &#x003b2;-tubulinIII-stained cells (equal to 100 %). For double immunofluorescence experiments the number of neurons stained with a certain antibody was referred as a percent of the total number of cells stained with the other antibody. An average of 500 cells in culture or 1,000 cells in the tissue were counted for each condition. Each data is the mean of at least 3 independent experiments.

Furthermore, mouse or rat ganglia or cell cultures were homogenated in 200 &#x003bc;l of a buffer containing 137 mM NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 8), 1% NP40, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors (Roche). Samples were diluted (1:6) in the same buffer and processed for ELISA assay. Results were corrected for blank and normalized. In the case of ganglia or cells, quantification was normalized with respect to the genomic DNA content (purified using GenElute mammalian genomic DNA kit, Sigma). The recovery of exogenously added NGF (100 ng/ml) was 63 &#x000b1; 11 % (n = 3); data were not corrected for recovery.
