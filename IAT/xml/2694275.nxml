Although the exact cellular function of LRRK2 remains unknown, most PD-linked mutations appear to be toxic to cells in culture via mechanisms that depend on the kinase activity of LRRK2 or on the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP physically associates with LRRK2 and regulates the cellular abundance of LRRK2. We further show that LRRK2 forms a complex with overexpressed and endogenous CHIP and Hsp90. Our data indicates that the destabilization of LRRK2 by CHIP is due to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Hsp90 can attenuate CHIP-mediated degradation and this can be blocked by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. These findings provide important insight into the cellular regulation of LRRK2 stability and may lead to the development of therapeutics to treat PD based on controlling LRRK2 stability.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and affects 1&#x02013;2&#x00025; of the population over 60 years old. The primary clinical symptoms have classically been defined as bradykinesia, resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity and abnormal gait. Despite intensive research, the cause of PD remains unknown.

The molecular mechanisms by which these mutations cause PD remain uncertain. The prevailing hypothesis is that these mutations either directly or indirectly lead to increased LRRK2 kinase activity and promote inclusion formation, which can be neurotoxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Moore1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Because point mutations have been identified throughout the sequence of LRRK2, not just in the kinase domain, it is likely that intra- and intermolecular protein-protein interactions both inside and outside the kinase domain are important for the normal function of LRRK2. Alterations in protein-protein interactions may be the mechanism by which some LRRK2 mutations cause disease. Identifying proteins that interact with LRRK2 is therefore crucial for filling the current gap in our understanding of the normal function of LRRK2 and for determining how disease-linked mutations lead to aberrant LRRK2 function and neurodegeneration.</p><p>In an effort to better define the cellular function of LRRK2, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screens to identify potential LRRK2 interacting proteins. We identified a robust protein-protein interaction between LRRK2 and CHIP (C-terminus of Hsp70-Interacting Protein), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase crucial for the ubiquitination of several heat shock protein (HSP)70/90 client proteins that are involved in neurodegenerative disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Dickey1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Our screen also identified a robust protein-protein interaction between LRRK2 and Hsp90, which has previously been identified as a LRRK2 binding protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Gloeckner1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Dachsel1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Wang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We confirmed both these interactions by different reporter assays in yeast cells and by co-immunoprecipation assays in mammalian cells. We further found that LRRK2 is destabilized by CHIP. The destabilization of LRRK2 by CHIP is due to CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Hsp90 can block CHIP-mediated degradation and inhibition of Hsp90 restores CHIP-mediated degradation of LRRK2. These findings reveal potential cellular mechanisms that regulate LRRK2 abundance, which may provide therapeutic targets for familial and sporadic PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plasmid Constructs</title><p>Full-length mouse LRRK2 cDNA was cloned by PCR from mouse brain cDNA prepared in our lab.

In contrast to the robust co-immunoprecipitation in the absence of geldanamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), full-length CHIP did not co-immunoprecipitate with the myc-tagged ARM-ANK-LRR domains of LRRK2 in the presence of geldanamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g002">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that Hsp90 function is required for CHIP to bind to the N-terminal portion of LRRK2.

Our data reveal which domains of CHIP and LRRK2 are required or dispensable for this interaction. Surprisingly, we found that CHIP can bind to LRRK2 at least two independent ways. The combined data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g002">Figure 2</xref> indicate that the charged domain of CHIP binds to the ROC domain of LRRK2 and that the TPR domain of CHIP is required for binding to the N-terminal region of LRRK2 that includes the armadillo, ankyrin and leucine-rich repeats. This is the first demonstration that the charged domain of CHIP directly binds to another protein. The TPR domain of CHIP apparently binds to the N-terminal region of LRRK2 indirectly via Hsp90, which is known to bind to the TPR domain of CHIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Connell1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, because blocking Hsp90 function with geldanamycin completely prevented the binding of full-length CHIP to the N-terminal region of LRRK2. By contrast, geldanamycin did not prevent the binding of full-length CHIP to the C-terminal half of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g002">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that the interaction between the charged domain of CHIP and the ROC domain of LRRK2 does not require Hsp90 function. We further show that the isolated TPR domain of CHIP is sufficient for binding to the N-terminal half of LRRK2, but not to the C-terminal half of LRRK2 (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005949.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Consistent with the geldanamycin data, the K30A point mutation within the TPR domain that blocks CHIP binding to Hsp90, also blocks binding to the N-terminal half of LRRK2 (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005949.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>We propose a model in which the charged domain of CHIP binds to the ROC domain of LRRK2 either directly or indirectly, but independent of Hsp90, while the TPR domain of CHIP binds to the N-terminus of LRRK2 indirectly, via Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Surprisingly, the U-box domain of CHIP, which is structurally related to RING finger ubiquitin ligase domains, is apparently dispensable for CHIP binding to LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g002">Figure 2C, D</xref>). This mode of binding differs from the previous finding that LRRK2 binds to the second RING finger domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Smith2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. LRRK2 reportedly enhances the auto-ubiquitination activity of Parkin, however, Parkin does not ubiquitinate LRRK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Smith2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, our data indicates that CHIP ubiquitinates LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Because CHIP has also been reported to form a complex with Parkin and to enhance the ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Imai1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that the reported interaction between LRRK2 and Parkin is mediated by CHIP.</p><p>Our most striking finding is that CHIP decreased the stability of LRRK2 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Because we found that CHIP can bind directly to LRRK2 and cause the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of LRRK2, this is a likely mechanism by which CHIP destabilizes LRRK2. CHIP-mediated degradation of LRRK2 appears to require the chaperone interaction function of CHIP because we did not observe any LRRK2 destabilization by a TPR domain point mutant of CHIP (K30A) or by a TPR domain deletion mutant of CHIP (CHIP&#x00394;T), both of which are unable to interact with Hsp/Hsc70 or Hsp90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Xu1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. CHIP-mediated degradation of LRRK2 appears to also require the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP because we did not observe any LRRK2 destabilization by a U-box domain point mutant of CHIP (H260Q) or by a U-box domain deletion mutant of CHIP (CHIP&#x00394;U), both of which are unable to catalyze protein ubiquitin conjugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Xu1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our studies showed similar CHIP-mediated degradation of wild-type LRRK2 and LRRK2 with disease-linked point mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), therefore the pathogenic mechanisms of the mutations we tested do not likely involve diminished CHIP-mediated degradation. These findings are consistent with previous studies that found no effect of LRRK2 mutations on ubiquitination, proteasomal degradation, steady-state levels or turnover of LRRK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-West1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Wang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we found that the kinase activity of LRRK2 is important for stabilizing cellular levels of LRRK2 because an artificial variant of LRRK2 lacking kinase activity was markedly and consistently destabilized even in the absence of exogenous CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The diminished abundance of R1441C and D1994A LRRK2 in the absence of exogenous CHIP could be due to degradation mediated by endogenous CHIP, other degradation mechanisms or to other possible effects such as altered expression. LRRK2 kinase activity does not appear to be required for CHIP mediated-degradation because CHIP decreased the abundance of the artificial kinase-inactive mutant (D1994A) LRRK2 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), although this experiment cannot rule out the possibility that CHIP affects expression rather than degradation.</p><p>CHIP has previously been shown to promote the proteasomal degradation of other proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as tau, A&#x003b2;, &#x003b1;-synuclein oligomers and proteins with expanded polyglutamine repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Dickey2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Petrucelli1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Shimura1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Kumar1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Tetzlaff1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Jana1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Miller1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-AlRamahi1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Adachi1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here we propose a model in which the ARM domain stabilizes LRRK2 in part by binding to Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Because the TPR domain of CHIP is well-known to bind to Hsp90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Connell1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, it is likely that a portion of the LRRK2-Hsp90 complex will also be associated with CHIP. LRRK2 apparently forms a stable complex with Hsp90 and CHIP because we successfully immunoprecipitated endogenous CHIP and endogenous Hsp90 together with LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g006">Figure 6</xref>) confirm that overexpression of Hsp90 stabilizes LRRK2 and that inhibition of endogenous Hsp90 by geldanamycin destabilizes LRRK2, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Wang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, we show for the first time that Hsp90 overexpression impairs CHIP-mediated degradation of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) and that inhibition of endogenous Hsp90 by geldanamycin enhances CHIP-mediated degradation of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). According to our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), inhibition of endogenous Hsp90 by geldanamycin prevents CHIP binding to the N-terminal half of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005949-g002">Figure 2G</xref>) but does not inhibit the Hsp90-independent binding of CHIP to the C-terminal half of LRRK2 (including the ROC domain), which promotes the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of LRRK2. In the presence of excess CHIP, Hsp90-dependent binding of CHIP to the ARM domain of LRRK2 can also destabilize LRRK2. We hypothesize that the stability of LRRK2 depends on the ratio of the cellular abundance and binding availability of Hsp90 and CHIP.</p><p>The fact that LRRK2 mutations cause both familial and apparently sporadic forms of PD with typical clinical symptoms and late age-at-onset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005949-Lesage2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> highlights the significance of age as a causative factor for both familial and idiopathic PD. An important question is whether the cellular abundance and binding availability of Hsp90 and CHIP change with age and whether this contributes to PD risk, perhaps by increasing LRRK2 abundance, aggregation or neurotoxicity.
