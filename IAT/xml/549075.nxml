Microtubules are tubulin polymers that are essential for cell structure and division. Molecules that target microtubules induce apoptosis and are potent anti-cancer drugs. We studied the effect on tubulin polymerization of three Tat variants: Tat HxB2 and Tat Eli from patients who are rapid progressors (RP) and Tat Oyi from highly exposed but persistently seronegative (HEPS) patients. We compared the effect on tubulin polymerization of these Tat variants and peptides corresponding to different parts of the Tat sequence, with paclitaxel, an anti-cancer drug that targets microtubules.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that Tat, and specifically, residues 38&#x02013;72, directly enhance tubulin polymerization. We demonstrate that Tat could also directly trigger the mitochondrial pathway to induce T cell apoptosis, as shown in vitro by the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results show that Tat directly acts on microtubule polymerization and provide insights into the mechanism of T cell apoptosis mediated by extra-cellular Tat.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>AIDS is due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection of CD4 T cells and is characterized by the cell death of HIV-infected lymphocytes and uninfected bystander cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recent discoveries have shown that this could be related to the extra-cellular effects of Tat, which is a toxic protein secreted early by HIV-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Tat was first identified as a regulatory protein essential in the HIV viral cycle due to its ability to dramatically increase HIV gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The size of Tat varies and exists in forms between 86 and 101 residues. Yet 101 residues now appear to be the dominant size in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Interest in this protein was raised with the discovery that Tat was secreted from HIV-infected cells and that it could have extra-cellular functions related to AIDS pathogenesis such as Kaposi's sarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The extra-cellular roles of Tat are suspected to be the major reason for the maintenance of HIV-infected cells (or reservoir cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and could explain the failure of current antiviral therapies to eradicate HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Tat induces apoptosis in different cell lines such as macrophages and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which are essential for the cellular response of the immune system to eliminate virus-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Different mechanisms by which Tat induces apoptosis in T cells were proposed: (i) The up-regulation of Fas ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; (ii) The up or down regulation of cellular genes encoding for cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], for cell survival factors such as Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], for superoxide-dismutase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and for p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; (iii) The inhibition of the expression of manganese-dependant superoxide dismutase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; (iv) The activation of cyclin dependant kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Another mechanism was proposed that involves microtubules to induce Tat-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We showed recently, using two short Tat variants of 86 residues, that Tat is able to form a complex with tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Microtubules are tubulin polymers necessary for the change and preservation of cellular morphology, intracellular organelle distribution, chromosome migration during mitosis, cell differentiation, as well as intracellular transport and signalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Microtubule damaging agents (MDAs) are classified in microtubule-stabilizing agents such as Taxanes and microtubule depolymerizing agents such as <italic>Vinca</italic>.alkaloids. The MDAs inhibit microtubule dynamics in living cells and lead to apoptosis after cell cycle disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. They activate the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as shown by the mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and the opening of the permeability transition pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The subsequent release of pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, leads to the caspase cascade activation and thus to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, MDAs can also directly affect mitochondria, as shown <italic>in vitro </italic>by the release of cytochrome <italic>c </italic>from isolated mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequence of Tat binding to microtubules and the correlation with the mitochondria-mediated T cell apoptosis. We used three Tat variants with sequences from 99 to 101 that have the size of the main Tat variants found in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The HIV-1 HxB2 and HIV-1 Eli are representative of rapid progressor (RP) patients in respectively Euro-American strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and African strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. HIV-1 Oyi strain was isolated from a highly exposed persistently sero-negative (HEPS) individual during an epidemiological study in Gabon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In order to identify the regions of Tat essential for the interaction with microtubules, we used peptides corresponding to different part of the Tat sequence. We compared the effect of these Tat variants and Tat peptides with paclitaxel, a well-known anti-cancer drug agent that strongly increases tubulin polymerization and stabilizes microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tat acts on tubulin <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The minimal concentration of tubulin (Cr) necessary to obtain tubulin polymerization without drug was 7 &#x003bc;M in our buffer conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We measured the polymerization effect of various concentrations of Tat and paclitaxel with 15 &#x003bc;M tubulin. We did observe the enhancement of tubulin into microtubules in the presence of Tat and paclitaxel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In comparison with tubulin alone (line 1), the rate of assembly as well as the final extent of assembly was enhanced by Tat. Furthermore, the lag time to start polymerization is shorter with Tat (lines 2 and 4) as compared with tubulin alone (line 1). With 4 &#x003bc;M (line 2) and 8 &#x003bc;M Tat (line 4), turbidity reached a plateau at 0.55 and 1.20 respectively, which corresponds to a 1.7 and 3.7 fold increase compared with the control plateau at 0.32 obtained with tubulin alone (line 1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). With higher concentrations of Tat (16 &#x003bc;M and 20 &#x003bc;M) the turbidity plateaus were superior to 5. The lowest effective concentration of Tat that induced an increase in polymerization was 0.5 &#x003bc;M (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Turbidity time course of the in vitro microtubule assembly.

The mass of tubulin (Tub 55 kDa) and Tat (Tat 10 kDa) are indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-2-5-1"/></fig><p>When the temperature of the samples was decreased to 10&#x000b0;C, we observed a complete depolymerization for tubulin alone (line 1) and tubulin with 4 &#x003bc;M and 8 &#x003bc;M Tat (lines 2 and 4 respectively). Even at the highest concentrations of Tat (16 &#x003bc;M and 20 &#x003bc;M), at 10&#x000b0;C the turbidity decreased to the original values (data not shown). By contrast, in the same conditions, we did not observe any depolymerization in the presence of paclitaxel (line 3). However, full depolymerization in the presence of paclitaxel was obtained with a longer incubation at 4&#x000b0;C (data not shown). The reversibility of following an incubation at 10&#x000b0;C or 4&#x000b0;C strongly suggests that turbidity enhancement is not related to precipitation or aggregation but to microtubule formation.</p><p>We also observed that when Tat concentration is increased to stoichiometric quantities with tubulin, the turbidity values increased dramatically to an absorbance greater than 2.</p><p>These values are superior to the absorbance obtained in the same conditions using the stoichiometric quantity (15 &#x003bc;M) of paclitaxel, which induces effective tubulin polymerization. Turbidity is known to be a function of the total weight concentration of scattering particles only when the particles have small diameters compared with the wavelengths of the incident light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, it seemed Tat would be able to act quantitatively and qualitatively on tubulin polymerization. In order to address these possibilities, our first control was to verify the shape of microtubules formed in the presence of Tat. Examination with electron microscopy confirmed the formation of microtubules in the presence of Tat, that were similar in shape to the controls without Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, microtubules in the presence of Tat and paclitaxel were slightly packed and shorter than non-treated microtubules. These phenomena were in part responsible for the variation in turbidity. To determine whether a part of the enhancement of turbidity was due to an increase in tubulin polymerization, we did evaluate the amount of polymerized tubulin on gel after ultra-centrifugation. Results in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> show that with Tat or paclitaxel the band intensity of pellets (P) are enhanced and the band intensity of supernatants (S) are decreased compared with the control tubulin alone. Increasing the concentration of Tat to 8 &#x003bc;M (Tat 8) and 16 &#x003bc;M (Tat 16) indeed enhanced the proportion of tubulin in the pellets (P) and decreased the proportion of tubulin in the supernatant (S) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Thus, although the enhanced turbidity is due in part to microtubule aggregation, these results show that the increase expansion in the turbidity plateau is also due to an increasing amount of microtubules. Interestingly, analysis of the samples by gel electrophoresis, using a five-fold amount of the tubulin samples loaded on gels showed that Tat was only detectable in the pellet fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). To eliminate non-specific binding, we used a glycerol cushion during the ultra-centrifugation step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This confirmed that Tat was associated with the microtubules.</p><p>We evaluated the ability of different Tat variants to modify tubulin polymerization. In our conditions, when 15 &#x003bc;M of tubulin are incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 8 &#x003bc;M Tat HxB2, Eli or Oyi, the turbidity plateau values at 350 nm are 1.01, 1.61 and 0.80 respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These values are higher than the turbidity value of 0.30 obtained with 15 &#x003bc;M tubulin alone (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus Tat from different HIV subtypes are able to enhance tubulin polymerization. However, Tat Eli and Tat HxB2 are more effective in this enhancement than Tat Oyi (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, column O.D. ratio).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Enhancement of tubulin polymerization by different Tat and derived peptides</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Compounds</td><td align="center">Concentration</td><td align="center">&#x00394;OD<sub>350 nm</sub></td><td align="center">&#x00394;OD ratio</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">none</td><td></td><td align="center">0.31</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Tat HxB2</td><td align="center">8 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">1.01</td><td align="center">3.31</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Tat OYI</td><td align="center">8 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">0.80</td><td align="center">2.63</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Tat ELI</td><td align="center">8 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">1.61</td><td align="center">5.27</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Paclitaxel</td><td align="center">15 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">0.55</td><td align="center">1.79</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Pep38&#x02013;72 OYI</td><td align="center">8 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">0.78</td><td align="center">2.56</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Pep38&#x02013;72 ELI</td><td align="center">8 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">1.59</td><td align="center">5.20</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Pep73&#x02013;101 OYI</td><td align="center">8 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">0.31</td><td align="center">1.01</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Pep73&#x02013;99 ELI</td><td align="center">8 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">0.30</td><td align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>15 &#x003bc;M tubulin is incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in buffer, the increase of &#x00394;OD<sub>350 nm </sub>is followed and the value of the plateau is indicated in the column &#x00394;OD<sub>350 nm</sub>.

We first evaluated the toxicity of the different Tat variants on Jurkat lymphocyte cells, using 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. This method allows the quantification of apoptotic cells by the observation of the characteristic nuclear fragmentation. After 20 hours treatment, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M Tat HxB2 (11 %) and 10 &#x003bc;M Tat Eli (12.5 %) were higher than those obtained with 10 &#x003bc;M Tat Oyi (3.5 %) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These differences in apoptosis were significant (<italic>p </italic>= 0.037) using one-sided ANOVA. The percentages of apoptotic cells in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;M Tat Oyi were similar to the control cells (0.1 %) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The percentages of apoptotic cells in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;M Tat HxB2 (2.7 %), 1 &#x003bc;M Tat Eli (2 %) and 10 &#x003bc;M Tat Oyi (3.5 %) was weak and comparable to the basal level of the non-treated control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Thus, at 10 &#x003bc;M Tat HxB2 and Tat Eli induced apoptosis inversely to 10 &#x003bc;M Tat Oyi. These results indicate that Tat-mediated apoptosis in T-cells could be correlate with the effect on microtubules since the differences in toxicity between the different Tat variants correspond to the same differences in tubulin polymerization. These differences were also observed using trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Tat toxicity was then confirmed by flow cytometry analysis after propidium iodide (Pi) staining.

Considering that Tat increased microtubule polymerization, we investigated if Tat was able to induce bundle formation or another disturbance in the microtubule network organization in the treated cells. The effects of Tat and paclitaxel cytotoxic concentrations (10 &#x003bc;M and 1 &#x003bc;M respectively) were evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy on Jurkat cells. After 6 hours treatment with paclitaxel, strong modifications of the microtubule network (that form bundles) were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). However, in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M Tat, we did not observe bundles or any other modification of the microtubule network.</p><p>By disturbing microtubule functions, MDAs generally lead to a mitotic block of treated cells. Although study have implicated the transactivation effect of Tat on cyclin and other gene implicated in cell cycle progression, we examined if Tat induced a mitotic block that could be due in part to the tubulin polymerization of Tat. Following treatment, the percentage of cells in various phases was obtained by flow cytometry analysis after propidium iodide incorporation. After 20 hours treatment, 1 &#x003bc;M paclitaxel blocks almost 50 % of the cells in the G2/M phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, G2/M values). This strong blockage in G2/M with paclitaxel attests that we were in the appropriate time conditions to evaluate the effects of Tat on cell cycle regulation in these Jurkat cells. A longer incubation time (<italic>i.e. </italic>48 h) in the presence of paclitaxel leads to 90 % of cell death (data not shown). After 20 hours treatment, the percentage of the G2/M cells in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;M Tat HxB2 or 10 &#x003bc;M Tat Oyi were 28 % and 32 % respectively and similar to the 33 % observed in the untreated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M Tat HxB2 or 10 &#x003bc;M Tat Eli the percentage of G2/M cells (22 % and 24 % respectively), were lower than the control cells (33 %). This decrease of the G2/M is not correlated with an increase in G1, and seems to be related to the strong cell death (30 %) rather than to a specific block in another cell cycle phase. In parallel, DAPI results confirmed that the percentages of metaphasic cells were similar between untreated cells and Tat-treated cells (1 %), in contrast to paclitaxel-treated cells that were blocked in metaphase (50 %). Thus, contrary to paclitaxel, the different Tat variants did not lead to a G2/M block before inducing apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Tat induces the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria</title><p>MDAs induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Our previous work on paclitaxel showed that this agent is able to induce cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release from purified mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To investigate whether Tat could directly target mitochondria, we isolated these organelles and incubated them with growing concentrations of Tat Eli (0.2 &#x003bc;M, 2 &#x003bc;M and 10 &#x003bc;M).

Turbidimetry tests showed that Tat strongly enhanced pure tubulin polymerization. The Tat concentration inducing tubulin polymerization is higher compared to the concentration of Tat in the plasma and it is possible that Tat concentration increases in the cell due to an active uptake similar to what is observed with paclitaxel. Furthermore, it is also possible that Tat concentration in the plasma is higher nearby HIV infected cells. We found that Tat acts qualitatively on microtubules making them shorter, such as paclitaxel, and also induces microtubule packing. These effects on microtubule formation are more pronounced than with paclitaxel as observed by turbidimetry and electron microscopy. The high effect of Tat on the self-association of tubulin is of interest for studies on the mechanism of microtubule formation and could be used in the design of new agents targeting microtubules.</p><p>We also showed that the full-length Tat protein is not necessary to obtain tubulin polymerization enhancement as peptides derived from its central region harbored the same properties as the full-length protein. These peptides contain the glutamine-rich region of Tat and confirms that the glutamine-rich region of Tat is involved in Tat mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It also contains the basic region (sequence 49&#x02013;60) that is essential for Tat to cross membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and the adjacent region (sequence 38&#x02013;48) that has been previously shown to be involved in the Tat-tubulin interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate that the N-terminus and the C-terminus of Tat are not necessary for the interaction with tubulin.</p><p>We showed that the more toxic Tat variants were also those that were more active in the polymerization of tubulin <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the toxicity of extra-cellular Tat is mediated by a mechanism involving microtubules. MDAs such as paclitaxel, which affect tubulin polymerization, generally disturb the microtubule network functions and inhibit cell proliferation. Contrary to paclitaxel, in the presence of high concentrations of Tat, we did not observe cell cycle arrest in G2/M. Moreover, by immunofluorescence microscopy, we did not detect any early modification of the microtubule network organization, even with high Tat concentrations. MDAs are able to induce apoptosis at lower doses than those required to induce bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, low concentrations of MDAs can suppress microtubule dynamics and disturb their functions, without modifying microtubule network morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, low cytoplasmic concentrations of Tat could modulate microtubule dynamics participating in the apoptotic signaling pathway induction in lymphocytes. The effect of Tat on microtubule dynamic needs to take in account that Tat could also modify the activity of proteins acting on microtubule dynamic such as LIS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesize that Tat is able to induce the release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria as we have previously shown this property for microtubule damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We show here for the first time that Tat is able to directly affect isolated mitochondria and trigger cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release, a key event in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation. This result is in agreement with those from Macho <italic>et al. </italic>that show that, in lymphocyte cultures under low serum conditions, Tat accumulates at the mitochondria. Moreover, this localization correlated with disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], a process that leads to the release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. Thus, we show in this study that secreted Tat can both act on tubulin polymerization and on the mitochondria <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Interestingly, although our study involves only three Tat variants, our results show that, in comparison with Tat Oyi, the Tat HxB2 and Tat Eli derived from RP are more potent in tubulin polymerization and apoptosis induction in T-cell. This open the possibility that these properties of Tat could be associated with more severe disease phenotype.</p><p>Apoptosis of bystander cells has been demonstrated to be very important in AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and the rate of lymphocyte apoptosis has been correlated with progression rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It now appears that extra-cellular Tat secreted from HIV-infected cells is involved in the apoptosis of non-infected T cells. The elucidation of the mechanism responsible for Tat-mediated inhibition of the immune response therefore should have a tremendous impact for AIDS therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Protein synthesis, Purification and Biochemical Characterization</title><p>Tat variants and their derived peptides were synthesized with an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystem Inc.) with FASTMoc chemistry according to the method of Barany and Merrifield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] on 4-hydroxymethyl-phenoxy-methyl-copolystyrene-1% divinylbenzene preloaded resin (HMP; 0.50&#x02013;0.65 mmol; Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, CA), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].
