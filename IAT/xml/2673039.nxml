The molecular basis of SV release and consequent recycling of membrane in hair cells has not been fully explored. Here, we report that <italic>comet</italic>, a gene identified in an ENU mutagenesis screen for zebrafish larvae with vestibular defects, encodes the lipid phosphatase Synaptojanin 1 (Synj1). Examination of mutant <italic>synj1</italic> hair cells revealed basal blebbing near ribbons that was dependent on Cav1.3 calcium channel activity but not mechanotransduction. Synaptojanin has been previously implicated in SV recycling; therefore, we tested synaptic transmission at hair-cell synapses. Recordings of post-synaptic activity in <italic>synj1</italic> mutants showed relatively normal spike rates when hair cells were mechanically stimulated for a short period of time at 20 Hz. In contrast, a sharp decline in the rate of firing occurred during prolonged stimulation at 20 Hz or stimulation at a higher frequency of 60 Hz. The decline in spike rate suggested that fewer vesicles were available for release. Consistent with this result, we observed that stimulated mutant hair cells had decreased numbers of tethered and reserve-pool vesicles in comparison to wild-type hair cells. Furthermore, stimulation at 60 Hz impaired phase locking of the postsynaptic activity to the mechanical stimulus. Following prolonged stimulation at 60 Hz, we also found that mutant <italic>synj1</italic> hair cells displayed a striking delay in the recovery of spontaneous activity. Collectively, the data suggest that Synj1 is critical for retrieval of membrane in order to maintain the quantity, timing of fusion, and spontaneous release properties of SVs at hair-cell ribbon synapses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Ribbon synapses are found in the ear and eye and facilitate the transmission of sensory information to the brain. In hair cells of the ear, the molecules required for ribbon function have not been fully explored. Zebrafish are ideal for investigating molecular components of these specialized synapses because of the ability to study ribbon function using genetic, cellular, and physiological methods. Here, we explore the role of the lipid phosphatase Synaptojanin at the hair cell synapse. Synaptojanin has been previously implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling in conventional synapses, and we also find that the number of synaptic vesicles are reduced in mutant <italic>synaptojanin</italic> hair cells. Mutant <italic>synaptojanin</italic> larvae have obvious equilibrium defects, and our electrophysiological recordings revealed that synaptic transmission from hair cells to neurons projecting to the brain is impaired in terms of both rate and accuracy.

Perhaps specialized, ribbon-associated proteins are required for accurate timing of release. Additionally, the availability of vesicles at hair-cell ribbons may be necessary and sufficient for both release rate and timing.

Synj1 is a multidomain lipid-phosphatase that contains a sac1-like phosphatase domain, a 5-phosphatase domain, and a proline-rich domain (PRD).

Nevertheless, this rate of stimulation falls into the physiological range of lateral line hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000480-Bleckmann1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Our experiments measuring the onset of spontaneous activity after prolonged stimulation suggest that spontaneous transmission in <italic>synj1<sup>Q296X</sup></italic> mutants is fatigable and requires several minutes to fully recover. This lengthy delay in the return of spontaneous release may reflect a preference to restock the reserve pool before un-evoked SV release is allowed to resume.</p><p>Our recordings of evoked action currents in post-synaptic neurons revealed that the mutant hair-cell synaptic properties were relatively normal during short periods of low frequency (20 Hz) stimulation. The requirement for Synj1 became apparent only when high demands on transmission were made. A decrease in the rate of transmission emerged after tens of minutes of stimulation at 20 Hz and occurred without delay at a three-fold higher frequency (60 Hz). Under these conditions, we saw a 50&#x00025; or greater reduction in the number of spikes. Furthermore, at the higher frequency of 60 Hz, we observed two additional phenotypes - a delay in the spike timing and an impairment of phase locking to the stimulus. Following prolonged periods of stimulation, wild-type hair cells displayed both tight phase locking and no change in the average spike response time to stimulation. In contrast, a clear delay of spiking occurred in mutant synapses with some spikes delayed by as much as 8 ms within a 60 Hz cycle. When quantified for the degree of synchrony between the response and stimulus, mutants also displayed a significant reduction in the quality of phase locking.</p><p>The defect in phase locking, combined with the decrease in tethered vesicles and reserve pool vesicles, suggests that refilling of the ribbon or formation of SVs from endocytic compartments was rate limiting in mutant hair cells. Our results support the idea that vesicle numbers are critical for temporal fidelity of SV release at ribbon synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000480-Wittig1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Other possibilities may also explain the loss of phase locking, such as an indirect effect on the exocytic machinery. For example, prolonged stimulation could lead to diffusion or mislocalization of active zone proteins such as Cav1.3a channels, which mediate the calcium influx required for SV fusion. In our hands, labeling of hair cells stimulated for 15 minutes at 60 Hz with antibodies against Cav1.3a and Ribeye did not reveal any differences between wild type and mutant hair-cells (Sheets, L. and Nicolson, T., unpublished observations). Another possibility is a more subtle disruption of the attachment of the ribbon to the plasma membrane. While a slight displacement of the ribbon would likely delay vesicle fusion, it isn't clear how it would disrupt phase-locking fidelity. Furthermore, ribbon mislocalization was not apparent in our immunofluorescence images or TEM micrographs. Another possibility is that the third or so hair cells with basal blebs near ribbons may account for the loss of phase locking. Perhaps the destabilization of the plasma membrane in these cells leads to abnormal fusion of SVs. A further possibility is the presence of an endocytic defect on the post-synaptic side of mutant ribbon synapses. A recent study describes the failure to endocytose pHluorin-tagged &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptors in cultured <italic>synaptojanin</italic>-KO hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000480-Gong1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, an increase of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) is attributed to an increase in surface exposure of AMPA receptors. An increase in exposed AMPA receptors would likely lead to an increase in spike rates. A recycling defect of AMPA receptors in <italic>synj1<sup>Q296X</sup></italic> PLLg neurons is possible, however, rather than observing increased spontaneous or stimulus-evoked spiking, we saw a decrease in post-synaptic activity.</p><p>In actively swimming larvae, <italic>synj1</italic> mutants suffer from an easily observable balance defect. If swirled continuously in a stream of water, the severity of the vestibular defect increases, suggesting fatigue of synaptic transmission. Such an effect on behavior is consistent with our recordings of afferent neuron activity where a decrease in synaptic ribbon function was seen during sustained stimulation. Similarly, the reduction of a robust response in the VOR test presumably resulted from fewer synaptic transmission events during stimulation of vestibular hair cells. Light tapping on a Petri dish of <italic>synj1</italic> mutants will elicit a response, which suggests that their acoustic startle reflex is intact (data not shown). Perhaps continuous stimulation of the auditory system in <italic>synj1</italic> mutants would also affect this acoustic startle reflex. Whether hearing is impaired in terms of sensitivity or frequency range in mutant <italic>synj1</italic> zebrafish awaits further study.</p><p>Our results suggest that maintenance of SV pools is critical for reliable and temporally precise transmission at the hair-cell ribbon synapse. Transduction in hair cells induces the release of thousands of vesicles during strong stimulation, which poses a particular challenge to endocytic retrieval mechanisms. Based on our data, we propose that Synj1 plays a critical role in facilitating vesicle recycling and if impaired, vesicle recycling not only affects the number of vesicles released at ribbon synapses, but also the timing of release.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fish Strains</title><p>Mutant alleles were maintained in T&#x000fc;bingen or Top Long Fin wild-type backgrounds.

In order to read platform position directly from video, a servo controller generated 100 ms pulse, timed 100 ms after the motor reached an edge, briefly shut down the illumination. Video was processed in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA), using functions in the Image Processing Toolbox. The ratio (R) of the long and short axes of the fish eye was extracted from each frame. For quantifying eye movement, the relative ratio change was calculated as (R &#x02013; mean(R))/mean(R). Since the eye movement represented a response to sinusoidal stimulation, the magnitude of eye movement was the power at the stimulation frequency (determined by discrete Fourier transformation).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Molecular Biology</title><p>Genomic DNA and mRNA were extracted from day 5 zebrafish larvae by standard methods.

Larvae were then rinsed and maintained in normal extracellular solution (in mM: 120 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3).

In short, we stimulated hair cells with a pressure clamp (HSPC-1, ALA Scientific, New York) attached to a glass micropipette (tip diameter &#x0223c;30 &#x000b5;M) filled with normal extracellular solution. In order to elicit activation of hair-cell transduction channels, the waterjet was oriented along the long body axis in order to deflect the cupula laterally. The pressure clamp was driven by a sinusoidal voltage command, which resulted in bidirectional deflection of the cupula. For a given experiment, the voltage command was driven concurrently by pClamp via a second analog output from the Digidata. During each experiment the quality and timing of the waterjet pressure was monitored via a feedback sensor located on the HSPC-1 headstage. For each experiment, this feedback pressure signal was collected in Clampex alongside the extracellular current recording and used for alignment of the apparent stimulus phase to recorded postsynaptic currents. Stimulus trains of 0, 20 and 60 Hz were delivered in 1-second episodes with minimum time between episodes.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Signal Analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed and plotted with Axograph X (Axograph Scientific) and Prism 5 (Graphpad) software.
