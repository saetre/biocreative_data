Heynh (Arabidopsis) flowers rapidly in the lengthening days of spring and summer (long days; LD 16h L/8 h dark) and shows delayed flowering in short day conditions (SD, 8 h L/16 h D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>(<italic>GI</italic>) is a key regulator of the photoperiodic response of Arabidopsis as plants carrying mutations in this gene no longer flower rapidly in response to LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Instead, the <italic>gi </italic>mutant develops a large rosette of leaves and thus is "gigantic" in size compared to wild type plants before finally flowering. The <italic>gi </italic>mutant flowers at a similarly delayed time as wild type plants in SD.</p><p>Since the role of GI in promoting flowering was first highlighted by mutant analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], GI has been shown to have other distinct functions. These include roles in photomorphogenesis and in regulation of the circadian clock, an internal oscillator that regulates daily rhythms of ~24 h in duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A molecular basis for some of the effects of GI on clock function was recently provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. GI was shown to interact with an F-box containing blue light receptor ZEITLUPE (ZTL) leading to the proteasome-dependant degradation of the central clock component TIMING OF CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN 1 (TOC1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>A module of genes acting in the order <italic>GI </italic>- <italic>CONSTANS </italic>(<italic>CO</italic>) - <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T </italic>(<italic>FT</italic>) were shown to promote flowering in LD [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]]. These are all rhythmically expressed and regulated by the circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>FT </italic>encodes a strong promoter of flowering which was recently shown to function as a mobile flowering hormone or "florigen" [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]]. After induction of <italic>FT </italic>transcription, FT protein was produced in the vasculature of the leaves, mobilized in the phloem and uploaded in the shoot apex where it interacted with a bZip transcription factor called FD [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]]. This led to activation of genes including the floral integrator <italic>SUPPRESSION OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1 </italic>(<italic>SOC1</italic>) in the shoot apex, then floral meristem identity genes such as <italic>APETALA 1 </italic>(<italic>AP1</italic>) and the transition from vegetative to floral development [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]]. The coincidence of <italic>CO </italic>expression with light in the late afternoon in LD stabilized the CO protein resulting in up-regulation of <italic>FT </italic>in the late afternoon and promotion of flowering [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]]. In SD, <italic>CO </italic>was expressed predominantly in the night and CO protein was degraded and thus flowering was not promoted [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]].</p><p><italic>GI </italic>was placed upstream of <italic>CO </italic>in the photoperiod pathway, as <italic>CO </italic>expression was reduced in <italic>gi </italic>mutants and up-regulated by over expression of <italic>GI </italic>from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (35S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As expected from the regulatory hierarchy just described, the <italic>gi </italic>mutant had very low transcript levels of <italic>FT </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. How GI might function at the molecular level to promote <italic>CO </italic>expression and flowering was not clear from its amino acid sequence which was predicted to form a large 1173 aa protein with no domains of known biochemical function such as DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>GI </italic>transcript cycled and accumulated to peak levels ~10 h after dawn with highest protein levels at ~12 h after lights on (Zeitgeber 12, ZT 12) in LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. <italic>CO </italic>transcript was biphasic with a peak in the late afternoon in LD and a second peak persisting through the night and at dawn then falling to trough levels during much of the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Recently, GI and a blue light receptor FKF1 (FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1), related to ZTL, were shown to interact in a light-stimulated fashion and target a repressor of <italic>CO </italic>transcription - CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 - for degradation by the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the FKF1 and GI proteins interacted in vivo with the <italic>CO </italic>gene promoter supporting a nuclear role for GI in flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Despite this remarkable progress, important questions remain about the molecular role of GI in promoting the transition to flowering and the other processes that it influences. For example, it is not clear if <italic>GI </italic>promotes flowering solely through GI-FKF1 interactions as <italic>35S::GI </italic>constructs accelerate flowering in <italic>fkf1 </italic>mutant plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and <italic>CO </italic>transcript levels are reduced in <italic>gi </italic>mutants at all time points in both LD and SD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], not only in the late afternoon in LD when GI and FKF1 interact in wild type plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Thus, our overall aim was to use an inducible GI system to ascertain if there were other previously unknown early targets (protein or transcript) of GI action that would cast light on the broader roles of GI. The approach chosen was to fuse the ligand binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to the C-terminus of GI. This would allow post-translational induction of GI activity by application of the steroid hormone Dexamethasone (DEX) [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]].</p><p>Previously, use of a similar post-translational steroid induction system was very productive in the search for early targets of the flowering time regulator CO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Plants carrying a <italic>35S::CO-GR </italic>transgene flowered earlier than wild type in the presence of DEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and 1 h of DEX treatment increased the expression of CO targets such as <italic>FT </italic>and <italic>TWIN SISTER OF FT </italic>(<italic>TSF</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the increased transcript accumulation occurred in the presence of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. This indicated that translation of other gene products was not needed once DEX had been applied and thus that <italic>FT </italic>and <italic>TSF </italic>were direct targets of CO.</p><p>Here we report on the characterisation of a steroid-inducible post-translational control system for GI in Arabidopsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>A steroid-inducible GI fusion protein promotes the transition to flowering</title><p>We constructed transgenic <italic>gi </italic>lines to investigate floral induction and gene expression using a post-translationally-inducible GI protein. The transgenic lines (TG lines) were designed to express a GI protein fusion protein composed of a 277 amino acid ligand binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) fused to the C-terminus of GI in a <italic>gi </italic>mutant background (ecotype Columbia, Col, carrying the strong <italic>gi-2 </italic>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). The fusion gene was expressed from the constitutive 35S promoter. The transcript and protein product of the <italic>35S::GI-GR </italic>construct were expected to be present throughout the day/night cycle in LD in the transgenic plants. Experiments with two other epitope tagged versions of 35S::GI supported this idea as immunoblotting with antibodies directed to these epitope tags showed there was only a slight variation in the steady state levels of those fusion proteins in total protein extracts in LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, the GI protein fusions to these epitope tags were functional in that they could rescue the late flowering phenotype of <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutants in LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The GI-GR fusion proteins described here would be expected to be non functional in the absence of added steroid and retained in the cytoplasm, while in the presence of DEX, the fusion protein would relocate to the nucleus and be activated [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]]. This would provide the opportunity to test the ability of the DEX activated GI-GR fusion protein to rescue the late flowering <italic>gi-2 </italic>phenotype and induce gene expression.</p><p>Four independent, homozygous, single-locus insertion lines of <italic>35S::GI-GR gi-2</italic>, named TG1 to TG4, were generated and used for further work. As expected from a transgene expressed from the 35S promoter, total <italic>GI </italic>transcript accumulated to higher levels in all four TG lines compared to Col plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). To test if the <italic>35S::GI-GR </italic>construct was functional, groups of TG, Col and <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant plants were grown in LD conditions and watered either with DEX (+DEX) or control solutions (-DEX). DEX application started at seed imbibition and was repeated every 3 to 4 days after that. Photographs of 41 day old plants showed that +DEX TG plants had well-developed inflorescences, but like <italic>gi-2 </italic>plants, the -DEX TG plants showed no sign of flowering (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). This indicated that DEX induction of the GI-GR fusion protein in the TG lines rescued the late flowering <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant phenotype.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>GI </italic>expression and flowering time phenotype in transgenic (TG) and control Arabidopsis plants under long day conditions in response to application of the steroid dexamethasone (DEX)</bold>. a) <italic>GI </italic>transcript accumulation was measured using qRT-PCR.

Following DEX application, all the TG plants flowered much earlier than non-treated plants. The +DEX TG plants flowered with an average of 20.2 leaves +/- SD 2.9 while the -DEX TG plants flowered much later with an average of 55 leaves +/- SD 7.8. This is comparable to Col wild type plants which flowered with 16.1 leaves +/- SD 2.9 and <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant plants which flowered at 67.3 +/- SD 6.4 leaves respectively.</p><p>One exception was the -DEX TG1 plant group which flowered with 44.9 +/- SD 5.5 leaves indicating some "leakiness" in the control of flowering by the <italic>35S::GI-GR </italic>construct in this transgenic line. This was unexpected as qRT-PCR of <italic>GI </italic>transcript levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) indicated that <italic>GI </italic>transcript accumulated to a similar level in TG1 and TG2. It is possible that this difference between the two TG lines might be due to a slight change in the GR portion of the fusion protein that occurred only in the TG1 transgenic plant. This may have led to it being retained less well in the cytoplasm in the absence of DEX in these plants. The sub-cellular location of the GI-GR fusions could be analysed using western blotting on plant sub-cellular fractions. Unfortunately, antibodies we raised to the GI protein did not detect GI in plant extracts and a commercial antibody could not be located that would detect the GR portion in immunoblotting.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> presents the results of the days-to-flowering measurement carried out on four TG lines and control plants. The earliest flowering group consisted of +/-DEX Col plants and more than 50% of these had flowered by 23 days. Shortly afterwards, the second group started to develop flowers. This group consisted of the TG plants treated with DEX; more than 50% of these plants had flowered by 27 days. The third group consisted of plants from the +/-DEX treatments of the <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant and of the -DEX TG lines; more than 50% of these had flowered at 50 days. These groupings are similar to those seen from the leaf counts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><p>In order to gain insight into when the TG lines first became responsive to DEX, groups of TG2 plants were grown in LD conditions and sprayed with DEX every 4 days starting with the first group where seeds were imbibed with DEX (day 0) and the last group treated from 12 days old (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Flowering time measurements showed that plants sprayed from day 12 onwards (flowering at an average of 22.2 leaves +/- t.se 1.2; p 0.05) were significantly later flowering than day 0 plants (18.8 leaves +/- t.se 1.9; p 0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). This indicated that the TG2 plants were responsive to DEX within the first 8-12 days of development. In another experiment with the TG2 line, we obtained similar results and found that plants remained sensitive to DEX even when it was first applied to much older plants - at 24 days-old, an age by which wild type Col plants would have flowered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). These +DEX TG plants flowered with an average of 39.3 leaves +/- SD 2.1 compared to the -DEX controls which flowered at 66.2 leaves +/- SD 18.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of flowering gene expression in the transgenic lines 28 h after DEX application</title><p>Since DEX treatments led to a dramatic reduction in flowering time of the <italic>35S::GI-GR gi-2 </italic>mutant plants, we expected that potent flowering time activators such as <italic>FT </italic>would be induced by DEX application. In order to begin to investigate the effect of DEX induction of GI activity on gene expression in floral inductive LD, we used quantitative Reverse Transcriptase RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure the effect on known <italic>GI </italic>downstream flowering-time genes, <italic>CO</italic>, <italic>FT </italic>and <italic>SOC1</italic>. Fifteen day-old plants from all four of the TG lines and controls grown in LD on agar plates were treated with DEX and then harvested 28 h later, 15 hours after lights on, during the late afternoon (ZT15) on Day 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of transcript abundance of flowering-time genes in transgenic (TG) and control Arabidopsis plants in long day conditions 28 h after DEX application</bold>. a) <italic>CO </italic>b) <italic>FT </italic>c) <italic>SOC1</italic>.

First, as we were interested in the promotive effects of GI on flowering, we carried out the experiments in LD. Second, previous work had shown that both <italic>FT </italic>and <italic>CO </italic>gene expression cycles with high points late in the light period of LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Third, plants constitutively over-expressing <italic>GI </italic>had higher <italic>CO </italic>transcript levels throughout the day/night cycle, while they retained cyclical <italic>FT </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, once the GI-GR fusion had been activated by DEX, it was expected that <italic>CO </italic>expression would be able to be analyzed at any time during the day/night cycle, and <italic>FT </italic>expression during the afternoon. By applying DEX at ZT11 on Day 1, when GI protein levels normally peak in wild type plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we reasoned that we would be exposing the plants to the effects of GI activation both on Days 1 and 2, thus maximizing the gene expression response by ZT15 on Day 2.</p><p>The response of <italic>FT </italic>expression to 28 h DEX application was the strongest of the three genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). The increase ranged from 2.9 to 10.1 fold. Two of the +DEX TG lines had <italic>FT </italic>levels as high as the -DEX Col plants. The <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant expressed <italic>FT </italic>at 0.14 and 0.03&#x000d7; the level of Col plants at ZT11 and ZT15 (-DEX) respectively. Levels of <italic>FT </italic>were higher in the -DEX TG lines than in the <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant (up to 14.2&#x000d7; higher), indicating some leakiness in the function of the gene construct, but still less than the levels observed in Col plants (0.15 to 0.5&#x000d7; Col levels at ZT15, -DEX). The good level of DEX induction of <italic>FT </italic>transcript accumulation was consistent with the acceleration of flowering in TG lines treated with DEX (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>In three of the +DEX TG lines, <italic>CO </italic>expression rose weakly (1.4&#x000d7; to 1.6&#x000d7;), while the fourth line showed a more dramatic boost with an increase of 7.5&#x000d7; over the -DEX controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). <italic>CO </italic>expression in the +DEX TG lines was higher than in Col plants at ZT15 in all cases. However, we observed high background <italic>CO </italic>gene expression in -DEX TG plants; the <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant expressed <italic>CO </italic>at 0.2 and 0.3&#x000d7; the level of Col plants at ZT11 and ZT15 (-DEX) respectively, but expression in the -DEX TG plants was higher at 0.4 to 0.9&#x000d7; the level of Col plants. This high level of <italic>CO </italic>expression, close to wild type Col levels, was not expected as it did not correlate with the late flowering observed in the -DEX TG plants.</p><p>Slight differences between +DEX TG and -DEX TG plants were also observed for <italic>SOC1 </italic>expression; but there was less than a two-fold increase in the +DEX lines (1.1 to 1.6&#x000d7;) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Background levels of <italic>SOC1 </italic>expression in the -DEX TG plants were high as they were similar to Col plants at ZT15. Even higher background levels were observed at ZT11. At this time point, all the -DEX TG lines had <italic>SOC1 </italic>expression that was higher than Col plants.

The induction of GI activity by DEX supports the idea that GI functions to promote flowering from within the nucleus as suggested by the work of Sawa <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and previously in transient assays when GI-reporter fusion proteins were observed in the nucleus and a nuclear-localisation region was defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consistent with induction of flowering by DEX, increased transcript accumulation of the GI downstream floral promoters <italic>CO </italic>and <italic>FT </italic>was observed in TG plants after 8 h of DEX application.</p><p>CO has been proposed to trigger expression of <italic>FT </italic>by interacting with the HAP protein trimeric complex which binds to promoter CCAAT boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>HAP3A </italic>transcript levels were observed to increase in <italic>GI</italic>-over expressing transgenic plants, suggesting that GI may regulate <italic>HAP3A </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, no induction of <italic>HAP3A </italic>was observed in our TG lines in the experimental time frame used here suggesting that transcript accumulation of <italic>HAP3A </italic>may not be directly regulated by GI.</p><p>Modeling and experimental testing of circadian clock function predicted that GI would fulfill part of a predicted "Y" function needed to stimulate <italic>TOC1 </italic>expression in the interlocking loop model of the circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Experiments with the TG lines show no induction of GI activity by DEX on <italic>TOC1 </italic>transcript levels and no reduction in <italic>TOC1 </italic>levels in the <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant, suggesting that this gene may not be directly regulated by GI. It is possible that we missed a transient increase in <italic>TOC1 </italic>expression. Some effects of <italic>gi </italic>mutations on <italic>TOC1 </italic>transcript accumulation were reported previously, but these experiments were carried out under very different light or temperature regimes from this work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The TG plants were responsive to DEX induction of GI within the first 8-12 days of development. However, floral buds were only visible when the plants were ~27 days-old, and the +DEX TG plants were slightly later flowering than wild type Col control plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The responses of the GI-GR TG plants to DEX application also were more modest that seen in <italic>35S::CO-GR </italic>plants. The latter responded to DEX from the time of seed imbibition and flowered significantly earlier than wild type plants in LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This suggests that there was some limitation on the activity of the GI-GR fusion protein. This contrasts with work in this laboratory with other epitope-tagged versions of GI that fully complemented the <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Unfortunately, we were not able to verify the effect of DEX on the cellular localization of the GI-GR fusion protein, as antibodies we raised to the GI protein did not detect GI in plant protein extracts, and a commercial antibody could not be located that would detect the GR portion in western blotting.</p><p>An intriguing problem encountered was that despite the -DEX TG plants being late flowering, there were often very high levels of expression of <italic>GI </italic>downstream genes such as <italic>CO </italic>in these TG lines compared with the <italic>gi-2 </italic>mutant. One explanation is that the leaky expression of genes such as <italic>CO </italic>was in tissues that were not competent to respond to it and thus <italic>FT </italic>expression and flowering was not strongly promoted. For example, expression of <italic>CO </italic>in the companion cells of the phloem using tissue specific promoters is highly floral promotive, whereas expression of <italic>CO </italic>in the shoot apex does not promote flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the GI-GR system described here was functional in promoting flowering and allowed tests of induction of putative GI downstream genes. However, given the leaky gene expression observed and that full activity of GI-GR was not achieved, development of systems that tightly regulate the temporal and spatial control of <italic>GI </italic>transcript rather than a post translational system may be preferable in future work. For example, constructs that lead to induction of <italic>GI </italic>transcription specifically in the phloem would be interesting for further study of the effect of GI on flowering time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material, growth and treatments</title><p>All plant material used in this work was derived from the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>L.
