CpG-ODN function as Th-1 adjuvants and are able to activate dendritic cells. In humans TLR9 has been described to be strongly expressed in B-lymphocytes, monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and at low levels in human respiratory cells. We determined whether a direct interaction of bacterial DNA with the tumor cells themselves is possible and investigated the expression and function of TLR9 in human malignant solid tumors and cell lines. TLR9 expression by malignant tumor cells, would affect treatment approaches using CpG-ODN on the one hand, and, on the other hand, provide additional novel information about the role of tumor cells in tumor-immunology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The expression of TLR9 in HOPE-fixed non-small lung cancer, non-malignant tissue and tumor cell lines was assessed using immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization, RT-PCR and DNA-sequencing. Apoptosis and chemokine expression was detected by FACS analysis and the Bio-Plex system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found high TLR9 signal intensities in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in the majority of lung cancer specimens as well as in all tested tumor cell lines. In contrast to this non-malignant lung tissues showed only sporadically weak expression. Stimulation of HeLa and A549 cells with CpG-ODN induced secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and reduction of spontaneous and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we show that TLR9 is expressed in a selection of human lung cancer tissues and various tumor cell lines. The expression of functionally active TLR9 in human malignant tumors might affect treatment approaches using CpG-ODN and shows that malignant cells can be regarded as active players in tumor-immunology.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The <italic>Toll </italic>gene, the expression of one of it's relatives we are reporting here concerning human malignant tumors, originally was characterized for its role in specifying dorsoventral polarity of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Since homologues of <italic>Toll </italic>are also present in plants, mammalian toll-like genes are products of an ancient evolutionary process beginning before the separation of animals and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Within the genome of <italic>Drosophila </italic>thus far nine toll-like genes were identified, ten different human toll-like genes are currently described. In contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the mechanisms taking place in mammalian embryogenesis concerning TLR are widely unknown. The discovery of immune function for <italic>Toll </italic>in <italic>Drosophila </italic>led to a new understanding of innate immunity mechanisms.</p><p>Human TLR recognize pathogen-derived products, also termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These are bacterial lipoproteins (sBLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], viral double stranded RNA/poly (I:C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], flagellin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and bacterial DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which engage TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9, respectively. All functionally characterized TLR signal via the cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain (TIR) leading to activation of transcription factors like activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. TLR9, in contrast to the other TLR, is not located at the cell surface, but intracellularily and, therefore, inhibition of endocytosis or endosome formation completely ablates the effects of CpG-ODN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Different studies show an immunostimulatory capacity of bacterial components which can mediate anti-tumor activity. The first reported use of such a therapy for a nonbacterial disease took place 1890, evaluating the anti-tumor activity of living streptococci directly injected into tumor masses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Shimada demonstrated that bacterial DNA itself can stimulate the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Over the past years there has been an enormous increase in the understanding of the molecular and cellular effects of CpG-ODN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which have been found to function as Th-1 adjuvants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and are able to activate dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This led to the idea to utilize CpG-ODN for induction of anti-tumor immune response as an adjuvant therapeutic strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In order to characterize possible interactions between malignant cells and CpG-ODN, we investigated whether TLR9 is present in malignant tumors. A variety of malignant solid tumors and cell lines were tested for TLR9 expression; in addition, we examined direct effects of CpG-ODN upon apoptosis and chemokine production of tumor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissues</title><p>Samples of human tumors and tumor-free tissues were obtained from lobectomies because of lung cancer.

The production was further enhanced when stimulated with a combination of CpG-ODN and TNF-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). There was no effect of CpG-ODN on TNF-&#x003b1; production (data not shown). To verify the induction of MCP-1 by CpG-ODN in cell lines we additionally analyzed human tumor tissues by RT-PCR; the results are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>. The relative amounts of RT-PCR-signals for MCP-1 in relation to GAPDH were higher in the specimens treated with CpG-ODN if compared with the controls confirming the results obtained in cell culture experiments on the tissue level.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>By application of a novel fixation technique we specify for the first time the expression of TLR9 protein and mRNA in a selection of human non small cell lung cancer tissues as well as cell lines. Stimulation of the TLR-9 expressing cell lines A549 and HeLa with CpG-ODN showed a marked antiapoptotic effect. In addition, there was substantially enhanced release of MCP-1 from the cell lines upon CpG-ODN stimulation which was also shown in <italic>ex vivo </italic>experiments. We conclude the expression of a functionally active TLR9 in human malignant tumors.</p><p>The presence of molecules involved in ontogenesis e.g. the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is frequently observed in malignant tumors suggesting a kind of "shift-back" towards earlier developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The significance and underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon are poorly understood; nevertheless, the detection of such molecules is used for diagnostic purposes in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The role of TLR in mammalian embryogenesis is unknown, and thus far there is no evidence for an endogenous TLR9 ligand homologous to <italic>Spaetzle</italic>. Such a ligand could play a role for the activation of human TLR9. Whether the expression of TLR9 in human malignant cells takes advantage of TLR9-function in embryogenesis therefore remains unclear.</p><p>On the other hand TLR9 in malignant cells could have similar functions as in cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. In humans TLR9 has been described to be mainly expressed in B-lymphocytes, monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition Platz et al. reported a weak expression in respiratory epithelial cell lines and primary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The CpG-ODN sequence M362 used in our study is known to potently activate TLR9-expressing immune cells in humans including plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells as shown by Hartmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] B cells are induced to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin in response to CpG-ODN, dendritic cells produce a wide array of cytokines and apoptosis is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>These mechanisms are both reflected in the results we obtained in our study after CpG-ODN stimulation of malignant cells:</p><p>Firstly, stimulation of the A549 and HeLa cells with CpG-ODN showed an antiapoptotic effect. This was demonstrated for spontaneous as well as induced apoptosis with TNF-&#x003b1; and CHX after 24 h. Our observation is consistent with previous evidence in other cell lines. Yi et al. demonstrated antiapoptotic effects of CpG-ODN in a mouse B lymphoma cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and similar changes were described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Previous data of systemic administration of bacterial DNA as a single agent <italic>in vivo </italic>showed anti-tumor effects. However, this anti-tumor effect appears to be effective indirectly and is related to enhanced NK cell activity. In a murine model of lymphoma the immunostimulatory effect of CpG-ODN was demonstrated to be responsible for the observed anti-tumor effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Carpentier <italic>et al. </italic>have shown that CpG-ODN <italic>in vivo </italic>induced rejection of neuroblastoma xenografts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast CpG-ODN had no effect on survival in mice inoculated with the 38C13 murine B cell lymphoma. However, a single injection of CpG-ODN enhanced the response to anti-tumor antibody therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To what extent the antiapoptotic effects of CpG-ODN on tumor cells demonstrated in our study affect the tumorbiology <italic>in vivo </italic>requires further investigation.</p><p>Secondly, tumor cell lines (A549 and HeLa) stimulated with CpG-ODN showed strong secretion of the CC chemokine MCP-1. Furthermore a similar effect was observed in the investigated tumor tissues. Immunostimulatory properties together with anti-tumor activity of bacterial DNA were initially reported for a DNA fraction derived from mycobacteria by Tokunaga and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It is known that such DNA induces enhanced production of various cytokines with anti-tumoral activity in NK cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12, and IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In our study a substantial costimulatory effect in addition to CpG-ODN was achieved using TNF-&#x003b1;. MCP-1 has various biological activities including the induction of increased cytotoxic activity of monocytes and NK cells. Transfection of MCP-1 into a human malignant glioma cell line tested on nude mice did not reduce the tumor mass but was associated with the infiltration of large numbers of NK cells and monocytes at the tumor site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A further study by Nokihara et al. performed with transfection of the MCP-1 gene into human lung adenocarcinoma cells showed reduced systemic spread of transfected cells inoculated i.v. in NK cell-intact severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. These findings suggest that locally produced MCP-1 suppresses tumor progression by a NK cell-mediated mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, apart from the direct activation of immune cells, the effect of CpG-ODN stimulation on the secretion of MCP1 by TLR9 expressing tumor cells could possibly lead to anti-tumoral effects due to an increase of local MCP1 production which then might lead to attraction of immune cells. The costimulatory effect of TNF-&#x003b1; as demonstrated <italic>in vitro </italic>in this study could further enhance this scenario.</p><p>Regarding TLR9 expression in nonmalignant lung tissue our data confirm the findings of low TLR9 expression in respiratory cells of Platz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], who have been working on single cell preparations. However TLR9 expression was only seen sporadically weak in nonmalignant lung tissue.</p><p>Biological explanations for the TLR9 expression in malignant cells require further investigations. Three possibilities are conceivable: Either this could represent a bystander phenomenon, a side effect of a pathway functional to a different purpose. Secondly the upregulation of TLR9 could be beneficial to the tumor, promoting tumor cell survival. Thirdly, it even might help immune control strategies of the organisms an element of a pathway directing defense mechanisms against malignantly transforming cells. While the first possibility seems unlikely in the light of our findings of a functionality of the receptor in various <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>ex vivo </italic>experiments, our data provide evidence for the second as well as the third possibility; the sum effect of these two counteracting mechanisms in an <italic>in vivo </italic>setting can not be estimated from these experiments and could even differ from tumor entity to tumor entity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we showed in a selection of samples that human malignant tumors express functionally active TLR9 and respond to CpG treatment with prolonged survival and chemokine release. This might influence the effects of CpG-ODN based anti-tumor therapies. Broad screening approaches will be worthwhile to further substantiate these initial results.</p><p>While recent strategies in tumor-immunology mainly target a strengthening of the host-defense, we provide evidence that the malignant cells themselves can be regarded active players in the complex struggle between tumor and host. In any case CpG-ODN based anti-tumor therapies should be reconsidered in the light of our findings since CpG-ODN products are currently in Phase I/II clinical trials both as a monotherapy and as part of multi-drug regimens.</p></sec><sec><title>Author's contributions</title><p>DD carried out the flow cytometry and cytokine assays and was involved in the design and coordination of the study and drafting the manuscript.
