However, the role of the inhibitory Fc&#x003b3;RIIb in the regulation of the synovial inflammation in RA is less known. Here we have investigated synovial tissue from RA patients using a novel monoclonal antibody (GB3) specific for the Fc&#x003b3;RIIb isoform. Fc&#x003b3;RIIb was abundantly expressed in synovia of RA patients, in sharp contrast to the absence or weak staining of Fc&#x003b3;RIIb in synovial biopsies from healthy volunteers. In addition, the expression of Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII was analyzed in synovia obtained from early and late stages of RA. Compared with healthy synovia, which expressed Fc&#x003b3;RII, Fc&#x003b3;RIII but not Fc&#x003b3;RI, all activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs were expressed and significantly up-regulated in RA, regardless of disease duration. Macrophages were one of the major cell types in the RA synovium expressing Fc&#x003b3;RIIb and the activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs. Anti-inflammatory treatment with glucocorticoids reduced Fc&#x003b3;R expression in arthritic joints, particularly that of Fc&#x003b3;RI. This study demonstrates for the first time that RA patients do not fail to up-regulate Fc&#x003b3;RIIb upon synovial inflammation, but suggests that the balance between expression of the inhibitory Fc&#x003b3;RIIb and activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs may be in favour of the latter throughout the disease course. Anti-inflammatory drugs that target activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs may represent valuable therapeutics in this disease.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><p>See related editorial by van Roon, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arthritis-research.com/content/9/4/106"/></p></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterised by autoantibody production and immune complex (IC) formation. Common autoantibodies are rheumatoid factor (RF) and those against citrullinated peptides (CCPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Approximately 70% of all RA patients display rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP antibodies, and the presence of anti-CCP antibodies can be detected in serum several years before disease debut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Most autoantibodies are of the IgG isotype, which have the potential to activate Fc gamma receptors (Fc&#x003b3;Rs) on leukocytes, such as macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells and B cells. Cross-linking of Fc&#x003b3;Rs by IgG-ICs leads to cellular effector functions such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular toxicity and release of inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Three different classes of Fc&#x003b3;Rs have been identified in humans so far; Fc&#x003b3;RI (CD64), Fc&#x003b3;RII (CD32) and Fc&#x003b3;RIII (CD16). Furthermore, Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII exist in two isoforms, a and b, which carry out divergent functions. Fc&#x003b3;RI is a high affinity receptor that binds monomeric IgG as well as IgG-ICs, while Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII are low affinity receptors that predominantly bind IgG-ICs. Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RIIa, Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa and Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb are activating receptors. Fc&#x003b3;RI and Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa consist of an &#x003b1;-chain with three and two Ig-domains respectively, which is connected with a cytoplasmic signalling subunit, the &#x003b3;-chain. The &#x003b3;-chain is responsible for intracellular signalling via its immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM). Fc&#x003b3;RIIa is a single chain receptor that contains an ITAM-motif in the cytoplasmic tail. Fc&#x003b3;RIIb is an inhibitory receptor that is structurally similar to Fc&#x003b3;RIIa, but has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic domain. Fc&#x003b3;RIIb has been shown to have an important negative regulatory function on Fc receptor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The involvement of Fc&#x003b3;Rs in experimental arthritis has been thoroughly investigated, and it is now clear that activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs are essential for the development of disease. Thus, mice lacking the common &#x003b3;-chain or Fc&#x003b3;RIII are protected from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) as well as other experimental models of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Consequently, Fc&#x003b3;RIIb deficiency in mice leads to increased susceptibility to CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These findings emphasize the importance of Fc&#x003b3;Rs in the pathogenesis of experimental arthritis, which may also be true for arthritis in humans. A reported gene polymorphism of Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa has been correlated with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as this polymorphism changes the receptor affinity for different IgG-subclasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The Fc&#x003b3;RIIIA 158 V/F allele variant has been especially associated with the risk of developing RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], although conflicting data exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Recently, it was also reported that there is an association between rheumatoid factor and the Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa 158 V/F allele in RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and that a functional variant of Fc&#x003b3;RIIb is associated with increased joint destruction in RA but not disease susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, several studies have shown that the percentage of Fc&#x003b3;RIII positive monocytes is increased in peripheral blood of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and that the expression levels of Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII on RA monocytes are increased compared to healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], while Fc&#x003b3;RIIb expression is unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>It has previously been hard to obtain knowledge about Fc&#x003b3;R expression in healthy synovial tissue for comparison with Fc&#x003b3;R expression in RA patients. Synovia from trauma patients or osteoarthritis patients has often been used as control material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and only limited studies have been done with healthy synovium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, we have in this study investigated the expression of the different Fc&#x003b3;Rs using synovial tissue from healthy volunteers in comparison with RA synovia. We were particularly interested in investigating expression of the inhibitory Fc&#x003b3;RIIb as this receptor has not previously been studied due to the lack of a specific antibody against it. Here, by using a novel Fc&#x003b3;RIIb specific antibody, GB3, we demonstrate a pronounced Fc&#x003b3;RIIb expression in the synovial inflammation in RA, which is in sharp contrast to the lack or weak staining of Fc&#x003b3;RIIb in healthy synovia. Additionally, we could detect Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII, but not Fc&#x003b3;RI, in healthy synovial tissue. In the RA synovia, the expression of all activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs was significantly increased, regardless of disease duration. The synovial Fc&#x003b3;RI expression could be reduced by intraarticular glucocorticoid treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Synovial tissues from 26 RA patients, 12 men and 14 women, were obtained through the rheumatology clinic at the Karolinska Hospital, Solna, Sweden.

All biopsies were stained with mAbs against Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII. The pan KB61 anti-Fc&#x003b3;RII antibody was used to analyse the combined expression of Fc&#x003b3;RIIa and IIb, as no truly specific anti-Fc&#x003b3;RIIa antibody is available. The previously described anti-Fc&#x003b3;RIIa antibody (IV.3) is not able to clearly distinguish between Fc&#x003b3;RIIa and IIb, as was demonstrated in our stainings of cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The staining of healthy synovia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) revealed a novel finding in that Fc&#x003b3;RI expression could not be detected in any of the biopsies studied.

Staining of healthy synovia with IgG1 isotype control antibody did not show any background staining. In contrast, RA synovium showed high expression of all Fc&#x003b3;Rs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).

Fc&#x003b3;RII and III positive cells were also observed within lymphocyte infiltrates. The IgG1 isotype control antibody was negative in most RA tissues but showed weak background staining in some of the RA patients, possibly due to Fc&#x003b3;R interactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Furthermore, as for Fc&#x003b3;RIIb, the percentages of Fc&#x003b3;RI, II or III positive cells were significantly greater in RA synovial tissue compared to healthy synovial tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>).

Biopsies stained with PE or alexa green-conjugated control antibodies were negative (data not shown). Moreover, consecutive DAB stained slides of CD163 positive macrophages and Fc&#x003b3;R positive cells showed that the amount of Fc&#x003b3;RI, II and III expression was significantly correlated with CD163 expression in the RA synovia (Fc&#x003b3;RI, r = 0.65, <italic>p </italic>= 0.012; Fc&#x003b3;RII, r = 0.85, <italic>p </italic>= 0.0001; Fc&#x003b3;RIII, r = 0.75, <italic>p </italic>= 0.002), which confirms the results of the immunofluorescence stainings.

Specific Fc&#x003b3;RIIb expression patterns in RA or healthy synovia have not previously been described; nor has the expression of activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs in healthy synovia been described fully. Synovium from trauma patients has been reported to express Fc&#x003b3;RI, II and III, and the Fc&#x003b3;RII and III expression has been shown to be significantly lower in these patients compared to RA patients, while their Fc&#x003b3;RI expression does not differ from that of RA synovia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This is in contrast to our findings where we could not identify any Fc&#x003b3;RI expression in healthy synovium. Thus, it appears that Fc&#x003b3;RI is expressed as a consequence of a general inflammation in the joint, as we also observed Fc&#x003b3;RI expression in synovial tissue from osteoarthritis patients (data not shown), although not to the same extent as seen in RA patients. The fact that Fc&#x003b3;RI is absent from healthy synovial tissue but present in RA synovium and significantly decreased by administration of glucocorticoids indicates that Fc&#x003b3;RI has a significant inflammatory role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. This is interesting and in line with experimental studies where Fc&#x003b3;RI deficiency in mice leads to a reduced uptake of IgG-ICs and to decreased IC-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It has also been reported that up-regulation of Fc&#x003b3;RI leads to increased cartilage destruction in arthritic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Similar to Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RIIb was absent from, or only weakly expressed in, healthy synovia, whereas RA synovium clearly expressed Fc&#x003b3;RIIb. This indicates a need for Fc&#x003b3;RIIb to control the stimulatory activity of the ITAM-containing receptors in the RA joint.</p><p>Although the majority of RA macrophages expressed Fc&#x003b3;RIIb, it was also evident that some macrophages did not. This may point towards a small subpopulation of Fc&#x003b3;RIIb negative macrophages that may have extraordinary inflammatory capacities. We also observed Fc&#x003b3;RIIb expression in lymphocyte infiltrates of RA synovium, which further suggests that infiltrating B cells may also be regulated by this receptor. In contrast to the near absence of Fc&#x003b3;RIIb expression in healthy synovia, we clearly observed positive Fc&#x003b3;RII staining with the pan anti-Fc&#x003b3;RII mAb, most likely as a result of the presence of the activating Fc&#x003b3;RIIa in healthy synovia. Fc&#x003b3;RIII is also expressed in healthy synovia, ready to bind ICs caught in the joint. In RA synovium both Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII expression was significantly increased, as has also previously been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, no association with disease duration and the degree of Fc&#x003b3;R expression in RA patients could be shown, as both early and late patient groups expressed similar amounts of Fc&#x003b3;Rs. This suggests that the Fc&#x003b3;Rs are important during the whole disease course and not only in the induction phase of RA.</p><p>The importance of Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII in arthritis has also been emphasized in animal models of RA. Transgenic mice expressing human Fc&#x003b3;RIIa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] develop CIA much earlier than wild-type mice and normally arthritis resistant mice become susceptible to arthritis when expressing Fc&#x003b3;RIIa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, the induction of CIA is dependent on Fc&#x003b3;RIII and, in particular, Fc&#x003b3;RIII positive macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Studies of RA monocytes/macrophages have also stressed the significance of Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII in disease pathogenesis. Thus, Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII are up-regulated on peripheral blood monocytes and Fc&#x003b3;RIII expression is also enhanced on synovial fluid macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The importance of Fc&#x003b3;RII in RA was also noted in this study by the decrease in Fc&#x003b3;RII expression (albeit not significant) after glucorticoid treatment. The decrease in Fc&#x003b3;RII as well as Fc&#x003b3;RI expression after local glucocorticoid injection was not due to a reduced number of macrophages in the tissue, as no significant difference in CD163 expression was found after treatment. In agreement, a previous study, where the same patient material was included, also found that the amount of CD163 and CD68 positive cells were not affected by intraarticular glucocorticoid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This indicates that Fc&#x003b3;Rs are down regulated from the cell surface by glucocorticoid treatment, which may help to explain some of the improvement seen in RA patients upon treatment with it, in addition to its reported suppressive effects on cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These results are in line with an earlier report that indirectly showed that Fc&#x003b3;R expression is decreased on peripheral blood monocytes from autoimmune hemolytic anemia patients after systemic administration of corticosteroid, measured by radiolabelled IgG-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In a more recent paper, Fc&#x003b3;RI and II were shown to be decreased on peripheral blood monocytes one month after systemic therapy with daily low glucocorticoid doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Recent studies with other anti-rheumatic drugs have demonstrated that methotrexate treatment could reduce the expression of Fc&#x003b3;RI and IIa on peripheral blood monocytes from RA patients, while the expression of Fc&#x003b3;RIII was unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We did not see a clear reduction in Fc&#x003b3;RIII expression after glucocorticoid treatment, which might indicate that Fc&#x003b3;RIII expression is hard to modify using anti-rheumatic drugs. It is difficult to speculate on how relevant the reduction of Fc&#x003b3;Rs is for the physiological outcome of glucocorticoid treatment, since patients receiving an intraarticular injection of glucocorticoids experience an almost instant effect, but positive anti-inflammatory effects in the joint are seen several weeks after treatment.</p><p>Macrophages are present in the synovial lining layer of healthy synovium and the amount of macrophages in joints of RA patients is correlated with disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We identified the presence of Fc&#x003b3;RI, II, IIb and III on RA synovial macrophages and, in addition, expression of Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII revealed by DAB staining was significantly correlated with the expression of the macrophage marker CD163. This indicates that macrophages are likely to be involved in the IC-mediated damage in RA via their Fc&#x003b3;R expression and they may also be responsible for antigen presentation to T cells, as macrophages were observed in close proximity to CD3 positive T cells in the RA synovium. The Fc&#x003b3;R-positive macrophages were often localised perivasculary together with CD3-positive T cells, most likely as a result of recent extravasation. It is possible that presentation of antigen taken up via Fc&#x003b3;Rs on the macrophages may activate T cells to secrete cytokines. This could, in turn, lead to further activation of the macrophages and, thus, production of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a continuous inflammatory state in RA joints.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that expression of the inhibitory Fc&#x003b3;RIIb, as well as of the activating Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RII and Fc&#x003b3;RIII, is increased in RA synovium, regardless of disease duration. The importance of Fc&#x003b3;RI and Fc&#x003b3;RIIb in the synovial inflammation of RA patients is further highlighted by the fact that healthy synovia lack Fc&#x003b3;RI expression and substantially lack Fc&#x003b3;RIIb expression. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory drugs, such as glucocorticoids, suppress Fc&#x003b3;RI expression after local administration in the joint. These results clearly point towards a central role for the Fc&#x003b3;Rs in the synovial inflammation of RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA = bovine serum albumin; CCP = citrullinated peptide; CIA = collagen-induced arthritis; DAB = diaminobenzidine; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Fc&#x003b3;R = Fc gamma receptor; IC = immune complex; ITAM = immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif; mAb = monoclonal antibody; PBS = phosphate buffered saline; PE = phycoerythrin; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; RT = room temperature; s = soluble; Sap = saponin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr Uwe Jacob declares a commercial interest in SuppreMol GmbH.
