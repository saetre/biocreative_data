Like many transmembrane proteins, GPCRs exist in a dynamic equilibrium between receptors expressed at the plasma membrane and those present within intracellular trafficking compartments. The characteristics of GPCR trafficking within astrocytes have not been investigated. We therefore monitored the trafficking of recombinant fluorescent protein chimeras of the CB1R (cannabinoid receptor 1) that is thought to be expressed natively in astrocytes. CB1R chimeras displayed a marked punctate intracellular localization when expressed in cultured rat visual cortex astrocytes, an expression pattern reminiscent of native CB1R expression in these cells. Based upon trafficking characteristics, we found the existence of two populations of vesicular CB1R puncta: (i) relatively immobile puncta with movement characteristic of diffusion and (ii) mobile puncta with movement characteristic of active transport along cytoskeletal elements. The predominant direction of active transport is oriented radially to/from the nuclear region, which can be abolished by disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton. CB1R puncta are localized within intracellular acidic organelles, mainly co-localizing with endocytic compartments. Constitutive trafficking of CB1R to and from the plasma membrane is an energetically costly endeavour whose function is at present unclear in astrocytes. However, given that intracellular CB1Rs can engage cell signalling pathways, it is likely that this process plays an important regulatory role.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>acutely isolated astrocyte</kwd><kwd>cannabinoid receptor</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>vesicular trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>ANP, atrial natriuetic peptide</kwd><kwd>CB1R, cannabinoid receptor 1</kwd><kwd>DIC, differential interference contrast</kwd><kwd>EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>HBSS, Hanks balanced salt solution</kwd><kwd>LSD, least significant difference</kwd><kwd>&#x003b1;-MEM, &#x003b1;-minimum essential medium</kwd><kwd>MSD, mean square displacement</kwd><kwd>NA, numerical aperture</kwd><kwd>P1 etc., postnatal day 1 etc</kwd><kwd>PEI, polyethyleneimine</kwd><kwd>PN-1, protease nexin-1</kwd><kwd>RT&#x02013;PCR, reverse transcription-PCR</kwd><kwd>SEP, superecliptic pHluorin</kwd><kwd>TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine &#x003b2;-isothiocyanate</kwd><kwd>VAMP8, vesicle-associated membrane protein 8</kwd><kwd>V-ATPase, vacuolar-type proton ATPase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Astrocytes are a diverse population of glial cells, with functions ranging from structural support to modulation of synaptic transmission. Astrocytes possess a multitude of receptors [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Verkhratsky, 2006</xref>)] for signalling molecules released by neurons and themselves, including the cannabinoid receptor 1, CB1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>), which is thought to mediate neuron&#x02013;astrocyte communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Navarrete and Araque, 2008</xref>). Protein trafficking plays an important role in regulating CB1R expression, with receptors changing localization between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. In certain cell types at rest, CB1R is constitutively endocytosed, leading to a predominantly intracellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Leterrier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">McDonald et al., 2007a</xref>). Thus endocytic trafficking can be an important regulator of CB1R availability at the plasma membrane.</p><p>Few studies on protein trafficking have been carried out in astrocytes. These have been limited to studies of the secreted ANP (atrial natriuetic peptide), the serpin PN-1 (protease nexin-1) and the synaptic-vesicle-associated protein synaptobrevin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Giau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Potokar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Crippa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Potokar et al., 2007</xref>). As these molecules all function within the exocytotic pathway, they are likely to have similar trafficking dynamics and may be found within common vesicle pools. As the picture of how proteins found within the exocytotic pathway traffic in astrocytes is being elucidated, there are no comparative data as to the trafficking of receptors, such as GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors), in astrocytes. The trafficking of GPCRs, such as CB1R and the &#x003b2;-2 adrenergic receptor, which are expressed by astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aoki et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>), is better understood in other cell types, particularly with regard to endocytic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Coutts et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Leterrier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Shumay et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have investigated CB1R expression and intracellular trafficking within cultured astrocytes isolated from rat visual cortex. Fluorescent CB1R chimeras were used in combination with pharmacological agents to examine CB1R trafficking dynamics. Our findings indicate that within cultured astrocytes at rest there is a pronounced vesicular pool of CB1Rs, which is trafficked both by microtubule- and actin-based mechanisms; microtubule-dependent radial shuttling towards and away from the cell centre is evident. In addition, a population of CB1R&#x02013;GFP (green fluorescent protein) was found to be relatively immobile, with movement characteristic of passive diffusion. Astrocytes expressing a SEP (superecliptic pHluorin)-tagged CB1R (SEP&#x02013;CB1R) and treated with bafilomycin A1 showed the presence of CB1R within low-pH endocytic intracellular compartments. We found that the punctate CB1R&#x02013;GFP label mainly co-localized with the endosomal marker endobrevin [also referred to as VAMP8 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 8)].</p><p>Trafficking of receptors to and from the astrocyte plasma membrane probably shapes astrocytic responses to signalling molecules, but the nature of receptor trafficking in astrocytes has yet to be investigated in detail. To our knowledge the present study of CB1R trafficking constitutes the first investigation of receptor protein trafficking in astrocytes. This should be of additional importance when one considers the previous demonstration of preferential localization of CB1R <italic>in situ</italic> to the astrocytic end-foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>). Future studies of CB1R trafficking in more intact systems may help to develop our understanding of how membrane proteins are preferentially localized to distinct domains of astrocytes and how they influence local cell signalling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>All animal procedures were in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p><p>Visual cortices were dissected from 0&#x02013;2-day-old Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats and treated with papain (20 i.u./ml; Sigma) in HBSS (Hanks balanced salt solution; Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The tissue was washed with HBSS and then incubated with trypsin inhibitor (type II-O, 10 mg/ml; Sigma) in HBSS for 5 min.

After 6&#x02013;15 days, the cells were submitted to a procedure for purification of astrocytes. At that time, flasks were shaken on a horizontal orbital shaker at 260 rev./min for 1.5 h, and after changing the medium twice, shaken again for 18 h. The cells that remained attached to the bottom of the flask were then returned to the incubator to be submitted to the transfection protocol (see below) or plated on coverslips as follows.

Briefly, visual cortices isolated from rats were subjected to papain treatment, followed by a trituration as described for cell cultures. After trituration, cells were applied to PEI-coated coverslips and allowed to adhere for 1 h. After washing, cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry. We co-labelled acutely isolated astrocytes using the rabbit antibody against CB1R and the mouse monoclonal antibody against the astrocytic marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; 1:500; MP Biomedicals). Following overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4&#x000b0;C, washed cells were incubated with FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) (for GFAP)- and TRITC (for CB1R)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, washed and mounted on to glass slides with 1% n-propyl gallate for image acquisition. Positive staining for CB1R and GFAP was defined by the average pixel intensity across the entire cell that was at least three S.D.s above background fluorescence of cells in which CB1R/GFAP primary antibody were omitted. All imaging data were background corrected by subtracting the fluorescence emission from a coverslip region containing no cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Imaging acquisition and processing</title><p>All experiments were performed at room temperature.

We used an inverted microscope (TE 300; Nikon) equipped with DIC (differential interference contrast) and wide-field epifluorescence illumination. Visualization of indirect immunocytochemistry was accomplished using a standard rhodamine/TRITC filter set (excitation 535 nm/emission 610 nm) and a fluorescein/FITC filter set (excitation 480 nm/emission 535 nm).

Visual cortex astrocytes have not been investigated for the presence of CB1R up to this point.

To assess the role of cytoskeletal elements in CB1R trafficking, astrocytes expressing CB1R&#x02013;GFP were subjected to incubation with pharmacological agents prior to acquiring time-lapse series.

When CB1R&#x02013;GFP was co-expressed in astrocytes with tubulin&#x02013;DsRed, which labelled microtubules with red fluorescent protein, CB1R&#x02013;GFP puncta could be seen travelling along the track of microtubules (data not shown). The dynamics of puncta seen moving along microtubules travelled at higher rates, consistent with microtubule-based trafficking, further suggesting microtubule-based mechanisms for the trafficking. Therefore a strategy was devised in an attempt to find any pattern or preferential movement of directional puncta. Since across cell types microtubules polymerize in a radial manner from the microtubule-organizing centre to the cell periphery, and our results suggest that directional CB1R trafficking relies on microtubules, we investigated whether there was a preference for radially patterned movement. A custom script was written to plot the path of each directional punctum (maximal displacement values greater than 1 &#x003bc;m) relative to the nucleus in which trajectory displacement angles away from the nucleus were assigned positive angles ranging from 0 to 90&#x000b0; with increasing angles more tangential, whereas those towards the nucleus were assigned by the same convention with negative angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Taken together, it appears that the disruption of microtubules leads to the reduction of the preferential radial traffic based on the analysis of angle trajectories of directional CB1R&#x02013;GFP puncta, which is consistent with the decrease of directionality index in colchicine-treated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular localization of CB1R in astrocytes</title><p>We used astrocytes expressing superecliptic pHluorin-tagged CB1R (SEP&#x02013;CB1R; McDonald et al., 2007b), rather than GFP&#x02013;CB1R, to initiate investigations into the subcellular localization of CB1R in astrocytes. Although GFP is pH-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Patterson et al., 1997</xref>), SEP has an enhanced pH sensitivity. Its fluorescence is nearly completely quenched at pH levels below 6 and quenching is relieved at higher pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>). Because the SEP is located on the N-terminus of CB1R, which could be located in the acidic (pH&#x0003c;6) lumen of vesicular structures or extracellular fluid (pH&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7.4) when on the plasma membrane, we can determine whether CB1R resides in acidic compartments. To this end we exposed cells expressing SEP&#x02013;CB1R to bafilomycin A1, a blocker of V-ATPase, to cause de-acidification of low pH compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>).

CB1R has been shown to be primarily endocytic in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Leterrier et al., 2004</xref>), and to undergo endocytosis through caveolae and clathrin-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Keren and Sarne, 2003</xref>). To test whether astrocytic CB1R is found within the endocytic pathway, we examined the co-localization of CB1R with endobrevin (VAMP8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) and with clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Astrocytes expressing CB1R&#x02013;GFP were either immunolabelled using an antibody against VAMP8 or they were co-transfected to co-express clathrin light-chain&#x02013;DsRed (CLC&#x02013;DsRed). CB1R&#x02013;GFP mainly co-localized with VAMP8 immunoreactivity, whereas there was very little co-localization with CLC&#x02013;DsRed. These results indicate the predominant localization of CB1R within endosomes containing VAMP8 over early endocytic structures containing clathrin. Moreover, astrocytes expressing CB1R&#x02013;GFP were also immunolabelled using an antibody against the exocytotic protein synaptobrevin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). CB1R&#x02013;GFP co-localized with some of the synaptobrevin 2, which was evident in the perinuclear region of the cell, whereas peripheral co-localization was not detected.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The presence of CB1R in cultured astrocytes has been found to vary between astrocyte cultures originating from different animal strains and between cultures originating from different brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Stella, 2004</xref>). This may be explained by the emerging picture that astrocytes are a diverse population of cells that may have different gene-expression profiles dependent upon the particular region of the CNS (central nervous system) in which they reside. Using cultured rat visual cortex astrocytes we found CB1R to be expressed at the transcript and protein levels; these receptors are functional since their activation with a CB1R agonist leads to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> excitability. In addition, we showed that CB1R is expressed in acutely isolated astrocytes of rat visual cortex, indicating that the expression of CB1R occurs in these astrocytes within the brain. Whether cultures of visual cortex astrocytes may therefore provide a suitable system to investigate the function of astrocytic CB1R as a distinct function of CB1R in astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be elucidated. Towards that end, there has been a recent demonstration that CB1R plays a role in neuron&#x02013;astrocyte signalling in hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Navarrete and Araque, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The characteristics of protein trafficking in astrocytes have recently begun to be investigated, with particular emphasis on trafficking of proteins in the exocytotic pathway. The present study of CB1R trafficking in astrocytes constitutes the first investigation of protein trafficking dynamics of a plasma membrane expressed receptor in astrocytes. Under resting conditions, a large proportion of recombinant CB1R is constitutively endocytosed and present within intracellular vesicles in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">McDonald et al., 2007a</xref>) or HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Leterrier et al., 2004</xref>). Since we observed a prominent perinuclear stain for native (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>) and exogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C&#x02013;6E</xref>) CB1R, it is possible that this represents some of the recycled CB1R, in addition to its synthesis, suggesting that in visual cortex astrocytes the receptor could undergo marked constitutive endocytosis. We found, similarly to ANP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Potokar et al., 2005</xref>) and synaptobrevin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Crippa et al., 2006</xref>), that the majority of CB1R puncta are immobile, as defined by maximum displacement values less than 1 &#x003bc;m. These results are in contrast with the finding that post-Golgi PN-1 vesicles are nearly all mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Giau et al., 2005</xref>). The fact that these authors selectively analysed vesicles that were newly budded from the Golgi network may account for some of the differences in the findings. To determine the underlying mechanism for movement of non-directional CB1R&#x02013;GFP puncta, we examined the relationship between MSD and time. A linear relationship was found for non-directional puncta, indicating that diffusion may govern movement of puncta within this class. An apparent diffusion coefficient of 1.6&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s was calculated from the linear fit of MSD against time for non-directional puncta. The apparent diffusion coefficient for CB1R&#x02013;GFP is less than that determined for ANP (6.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s) in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Potokar et al., 2005</xref>). Overall it was observed that CB1R&#x02013;GFP puncta trafficked at an instantaneous velocity of 0.11 &#x003bc;m/s, with directional puncta trafficking at an instantaneous velocity of 0.15 &#x003bc;m/s and non-directional puncta with an instantaneous velocity of 0.07 &#x003bc;m/s. In comparison with published data of velocities observed in astrocytes, CB1R&#x02013;GFP-positive structures move at a slower rate. Velocities of 0.65 &#x003bc;m/s and 0.4 &#x003bc;m/s were found for synaptobrevin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Crippa et al., 2006</xref>) and ANP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Potokar et al., 2005</xref>) respectively.</p><p>In general, movement at higher velocities, such as observed with directional CB1R puncta, is driven by motor proteins using microtubules or F-actin as tracks for directed movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Evans and Bridgman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Goldstein and Yang, 2000</xref>). We therefore sought to determine the extent to which microtubules and/or actin filaments are used for the movement of CB1R. Through pharmacological disruption of these cytoskeletal elements we found CB1R&#x02013;GFP trafficking to be dependent upon microtubules. In addition, an interaction was identified between CB1R&#x02013;GFP puncta and actin filaments, as stabilization of actin filaments resulted in an overall decrease in CB1R&#x02013;GFP mobility. Some evidence exists for actin-dependent trafficking within astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Stachelek et al., 2001</xref>); the hormone-activated trafficking of the enzyme type II deiodinase (D2) from the cell periphery to recycling endosomes is dependent upon myosin 5a, an actin-based motor protein. Although we found CB1R within the endocytic pathway in astrocytes and could therefore be trafficked to endosomes from the cell periphery similar to D2, our results suggest that this is not the case. Depolymerization of actin filaments resulted in no significant decrement of trafficking measures for CB1R&#x02013;GFP. If an actin-based transport were used for a component of CB1R trafficking, using perhaps myosin 5a, then depolymerizing actin filaments may reduce trafficking measures. Although it does not appear that long-range movement of CB1R occurs via actin-based mechanisms as observed with D2, since depolymerizing microtubules does not completely abolish active transport and since opposing pharmacological treatments to disrupt or stabilize actin caused significant differences in trafficking parameters, some actin-based trafficking of CB1R may occur. Cortical F-actin has been shown to regulate mobility of secretory granules and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and, as such, it may be that the interaction of CB1R&#x02013;GFP and actin is short-lived and occurs at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Merrifield et al., 2002</xref>). As would be expected by the arrangement of microtubules, we found directional CB1R&#x02013;GFP puncta to preferentially traffic in a radial pattern from/to the nucleus. Cargo vesicles carrying CB1R&#x02013;GFP to the cell periphery may, to some extent, underlie the radial traffic. Since it was found that a subpopulation of CB1R&#x02013;GFP reside in endosomes, and long-range tracks toward the nucleus were observed, endosomal traffic may also constitute a portion of the radial trafficking of CB1R&#x02013;GFP. Indeed there is evidence in the literature that could support a role for microtubules in CB1R endosomal trafficking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Leterrier et al. (2004)</xref> observed long-range movement of CB1R-positive endosomes. It should be noted that astrocytes express kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Crippa et al., 2006</xref>). Energetically, transport of CB1R&#x02013;GFP in astrocytes is costly, as microtubule-based motors and myosins expend one ATP molecule at each individual step. With a range of step-size for these motors from 8 to 30 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Howard et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Rock et al., 2007</xref>), the ATP expense of the transport of a single CB1R&#x02013;GFP punctum, at average instantaneous velocity, is between 5 and 19 ATP molecules used every second.</p><p>Classically, the relative amount of receptors expressed at the cell surface, which was beyond the scope of the present study, will shape the response to extrinsic signalling molecules. However, vesicular (intracellular) CB1Rs can still engage cell signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Gomes et al., 2009</xref>), which may be activated by lipophilic (membrane-permeant) cannabinoid ligands or via innate constitutive activity. Astrocytes play an active role in cell-to-cell communication in the brain, in part, reliant on neuroligand receptors. Investigations into the trafficking of receptors within astrocytes will provide important data as to astrocyte function. CB1R trafficking may be of particular interest within astrocytes; it was found that CB1R preferentially localizes to the astrocytic end-foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>). Preferential localization is governed by distinct sorting signals and pathways that effectively target proteins to their respective domain. Such signals and pathways governing targeting in astrocytes await identification. Astrocyte end-feet couple to each other along the vasculature through gap junctions formed by connexin 43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Simard et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly cannabinoid ligands have been demonstrated to block gap-junctional coupling in astrocytes, although CB1R was not directly implicated in this finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Venance et al., 1995</xref>). Local signalling occurring at astrocyte end-feet can modulate cerebrovascular blood flow, and can spread via gap junctions along the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Simard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Mulligan and MacVicar, 2004</xref>). As the constitutive trafficking of CB1R to and from the plasma membrane is an energetically costly endeavour for astrocytes, this process is likely to play a role in shaping the cellular response to endogenous cannabinoid ligands or constitutive signalling activity. Thus future studies might investigate the involvement of cannabinoid signalling at the astrocyte end-foot, and the role of constitutive CB1R trafficking in this.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We dedicate this work to the late Glenn I.
