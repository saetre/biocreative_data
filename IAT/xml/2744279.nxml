Recent reports suggested that blocking VEGFR1 activity or the interaction with its ligands (VEGF and PlGF) has anti-tumor effects. Moreover, several studies showed that VEGFR1 mediates tumor progression to distant metastasis. All these effects may be exerted indirectly by recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), such as myeloid cells. We investigated the role of VEGFR1 activity in BMDCs during the pre-metastatic phase, i.e., prior to metastatic nodule formation in mice after surgical removal of the primary tumor. Using pharmacologic blockade or genetic deletion of the tyrosine kinase domain of VEGFR1, we demonstrate that VEGFR1 activity is not required for the infiltration of <italic>de novo</italic> myeloid BMDCs in the pre-metastatic lungs in two tumor models and in two mouse models. Moreover, in line with emerging clinical observations, we show that blockade of VEGFR1 activity neither prevents nor changes the rate of spontaneous metastasis formation after primary tumor removal. Prevention of metastasis will require further identification and exploration of cellular and molecular pathways that mediate the priming of the metastatic soil.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>VEGF, and more recently, PlGF, have been shown to play important roles in tumor angiogenesis in preclinical studies. Moreover, VEGF is a clinically validated target for antiangiogeneic therapy for cancer, and agents that block PlGF or the tyrosine kinase activity of their cognate receptor VEGFR1 are currently approved for cancer treatment or in clinical trials (sunitinib, sorafenib, cediranib, axitinib, pazopanib, BIBF1120, etc.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006525-Fischer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006525-Ferrara1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006525-Jain1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, VEGFR1 blockade may differentially affect the recruitment of various BMDC populations in tumors. For example, cediranib, an agent that potently inhibits VEGFR1 activity, transiently reduced macrophage infiltration but increased the total number of myeloid (CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) cells and did not delay the growth rate of brain tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006525-Kamoun1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the benefit of targeting VEGFR1 activity remains unclear, and is likely to be highly tumor&#x02013;, BMDC type&#x02013; and context-dependent.</p><p>In addition to effects at the primary tumor site, blockade of VEGFR1 has been proposed as an anti-metastasis approach. Previous studies in <italic>flt1</italic>-tk deficient mice have shown that MMP-9 is induced by VEGFR1 signaling in lung cells and facilitates metastatic tumor growth in experimental metastasis models (i.e., after intravenous infusion of cancer cells). Moreover, it has been recently reported that BMDCs &#x02013; systemically mobilized in response to primary tumor growth &#x02013; home to the lungs and form &#x0201c;pre-metastatic niches&#x0201d; in lungs even prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006525-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here, we show that myeloid (CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) BMDCs (e.g., pulmonary alveolar macrophages), are present in normal lungs and that VEGFR1 blockade does not modulate their infiltration in the presence of primary tumors prior to metastasis formation. On the other hand, we show that BMDCs may be affected by VEGFR1 activity blockade at later time-points, i.e., during metastatic tumor growth. Thus, while VEGFR1 activity is not required for the formation of metastatic tumor nodules, its blockade may differentially modulate the BMDC infiltration and growth of primary tumors and metastatic nodules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL and Actb-GFP/C57BL mice (constitutively expressing GFP) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). <italic>Flt-1</italic><sup>TK&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>/C57BL mice were backcrossed to 99.9&#x00025; C57BL strain background (N10 equivalent) from <italic>flt-1</italic><sup>TK&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006525-Hiratsuka1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006525-Hiratsuka2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, kindly provided by Dr. M.

None of the cancer cell lines used in this study (LLC1 and B16) expressed detectable levels of VEGFR1. In these models, we measured the spontaneous formation of lung metastatic nodules. In addition, we studied formation of lung metastatic nodules in a genetic model of VEGFR1 deficiency (<italic>flt-1</italic><sup>TK&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>/C57BL mice, which lack tyrosine kinase domain of VEGFR1). Since these mice express the extracellular domain of VEGFR1, the ligands can bind to the extracellular portion of the receptor, unlike when the MF1 antibodies are used (which completely block both ligand-receptor interaction and downstream signaling). Consistent with published reports on blockade of the VEGFR1 ligand PlGF, we found a significantly decreased blood vessel density in primary LLC1 tumor after VEGFR1 blockade by MF1 treatment. However, MF1 treatment did not decrease the number of BMDCs recruited into primary LLC1 tumors, nor their growth rate. Moreover, despite continued VEGFR1 blockade with MF1, metastatic nodule formation rate was not affected in mice whose tumors were resected when they reached 1 cm in diameter.

BMDC infiltration in BMT-<italic>Actb-GFP</italic>/C57BL mice was similar the CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell infiltration in non-irradiated C57BL mice. Moreover, MF1 treatment did not significantly change the number of BMDCs in the pre-metastatic lungs of mice.

Nevertheless, after the onset of metastatic nodule growth, MF1 blockade of VEGFR1 led to a partial decrease in BMDC infiltration inside and around LLC1 metastatic nodules, which is consistent with modulation by VEGFR1 activity of BMDC accumulation in some tumors during their growth. Of note, despite the significant reduction, the BMDC accumulation was not completely blocked, and remained quite high, suggesting that BMDC accumulation in growing metastatic nodules is only partially controlled by VEGFR1 signaling.
