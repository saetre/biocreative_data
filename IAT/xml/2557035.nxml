However, recent studies suggested the crucial roles of monocarboxylates in diverse cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Halestrap and Meredith, 2004</xref>). The cellular transport of monocarboxlyates is facilitated by a family of transmembrane proteins, the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Enerson and Drewes, 2003</xref>). Although significant advances have been made in understanding the biochemical properties of MCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Galic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lecona et al., 2008</xref>), little is known about the signaling pathways that regulate their physiological functions.</p><p>LKB1, a unique tumor suppressor that harbors protein kinase activity, was originally identified as a causative gene for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease manifesting benign tumors in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hemminki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jenne et al., 1998</xref>). Previous studies established LKB1 as a master upstream kinase of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Par-1&#x02013;related kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lizcano et al., 2004</xref>), which regulates multiple cellular physiologies such as energy homeostasis, cell division, and epithelial polarization (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Williams and Brenman, 2008</xref>). Moreover, recent genetic studies showed decreased apoptosis in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Karuman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), implicating the vital function of LKB1 in regulating physiological cell death in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liang et al., 2007</xref>). However, the downstream executors mediating these physiological roles of LKB1 are poorly understood.</p><p>To find novel genes involved in the LKB1 signaling pathway, we performed a genetic modifier screen using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">St Johnston, 2002</xref>). Here, we identify an MCT, Silnoon (Sln), as a crucial downstream target of LKB1 in the control of cell death in polarized cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To identify genetic interactors for LKB1, we prepared &#x0223c;20,000 independent fly lines each possessing a randomly inserted EP element in their genome by mobilizing the transposable element with transposase expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We crossed these fly lines with LKB1-overexpressing flies and searched for the lines that modify the eye phenotype of LKB1 overexpression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Among several candidate lines, we identified an EP line that dramatically enhanced the small and rough eye phenotypes of LKB1 overexpression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We named a putative gene affected by this EP insertion as <italic>Sln</italic> (which means narrow eyes in Korean) and the EP insertion allele as <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic>. Interestingly, <italic>gmr</italic>-gal4&#x02013;driven <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> alone showed a normal eye phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), indicating that the <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic>-induced narrow eye phenotype completely depends on LKB1 coexpression. Remarkably, a kinase-dead form of LKB1 (<italic>LKB1<sup>KD</sup></italic>) did not exhibit any noticeable phenotype when expressed with <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), suggesting that the kinase activity of LKB1 is essential for its genetic interaction with <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A genetic modifier screen for <italic>Drosophila</italic> LKB1 identifies a novel LKB1-interacting gene, <italic>Sln</italic>.</bold> (A) A schematic illustration of a genetic modifier screen for LKB1.

As a result, <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> strongly enhanced the upwardly curved and small wing phenotypes of the wild-type LKB1 (<italic>LKB1<sup>WT</sup></italic>), whereas it alone showed no obvious wing phenotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). In contrast, <italic>LKB1<sup>KD</sup></italic> did not genetically interact with <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). These data suggest that the genetic relationship between LKB1 and Sln is conserved in various cell types.</p><p>We next performed inverse PCR analysis using genomic DNA carrying <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> to identify the gene affected by <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> and found that the EP element of <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> is inserted in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region of an uncharacterized gene, <italic>CG8271</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>).

However, the mRNA levels of other neighboring genes are not affected by <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> (unpublished data), implicating that <italic>CG8271</italic> is the gene specifically affected by <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic>. Consistently, a transgenic allele of <italic>CG8271</italic> (<italic>Sln<sup>6</sup></italic>) showed the same genetic interaction with LKB1 as <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807052/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807052/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, we annotated the novel gene <italic>CG8271</italic> as <italic>Sln</italic>. Interestingly, Northern blot and whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses revealed that <italic>Sln</italic> transcript is highly expressed in larval and adult stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>) and broadly expressed in diverse tissues, including larval eye and wing imaginal discs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref> and Fig. S1 B).</p><p>To predict the molecular function of Sln, we searched for its sequence homologues from National Center for Biotechnology Information databases. Unexpectedly, a BLAST search conducted with the amino acid sequence of Sln identified several MCT proteins. Alignments of Sln with human and mouse MCTs (Fig. S1 C) showed that 12 transmembrane domains, two sugar transporter domains, and a large intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains, which are the key features of the MCT family (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Enerson and Drewes, 2003</xref>), are all well conserved in Sln (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Sln transports butyrate and lactate in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues.</bold> (A) Amino acid sequence similarities (%) of Sln with human MCT1 (hMCT1).

We measured the amounts of [<sup>14</sup>C]butyrate and [<sup>14</sup>C]lactate uptake by larval wing discs expressing wild-type Sln (<italic>Sln<sup>6</sup></italic>) or a mutant form of Sln (<italic>Sln<sup>G366V</sup></italic>) that possesses a point mutation causing reduced transport activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Galic et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, <italic>Sln<sup>6</sup></italic>-expressing wing discs transported much higher amounts of butyrate and lactate than the control wing discs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). However, <italic>Sln<sup>G366V</sup>-</italic>expressing discs showed lower monocarboxylate uptake compared with <italic>Sln<sup>6</sup></italic>, despite similar expression levels of these proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and not depicted). Interestingly, coexpression of LKB1 enhanced Sln-mediated monocarboxylate transport (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>), which is consistent with the genetic interaction between LKB1 and Sln (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D</xref>). These results suggest that Sln possesses butyrate and lactate transport activities in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues.</p><p>Because LKB1 and Sln synergistically reduced the eye size of adult flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), we examined the larval eye discs to understand the cellular process responsible for these phenotypes. BrdU incorporation analysis and phosphohistone H3 immunostaining revealed that neither LKB1 nor Sln expression affects G1/S and G2/M cell cycle progression, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, top and middle). Furthermore, a neuronal-specific Elav immunostaining showed no differentiation defect in LKB1- and Sln-expressing eye discs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, bottom). We also generated flipped-out mosaic clones expressing LKB1 and Sln simultaneously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These mitotic clones marked by cytoplasmic GFP showed similar cell size to that of neighboring GFP-negative cells in larval fat body (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, top). However, the area of mitotic clones was gradually decreased 48 h after clonal induction, implicating that these clones were selectively eliminated by unknown cell death mechanisms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, bottom). To examine this, we performed TUNEL and acridine orange (AO) staining to detect cells undergoing apoptosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> strongly enhanced the apoptosis in LKB1-expressing eye discs, whereas it alone showed no significant apoptotic signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Furthermore, coexpression of either apoptosis blocker, <italic>Drosophila</italic> inhibitor of apoptosis or p35, considerably suppressed the apoptotic cell death induced by LKB1 and Sln coexpression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). These results indicate that Sln specifically augments LKB1-dependent apoptosis without affecting cell growth and proliferation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Sln enhances LKB1-dependent apoptosis without affecting cell cycle progression or cell size.</bold> (A) Immunostaining against BrdU (top), phosphohistone H3 (middle), or Elav (bottom) in larval eye discs from the indicated genotypes.

The mutant larvae halted food uptake a few hours after hatching and showed accumulation of blue dye&#x02013;mixed food mostly in the hindgut region (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807052/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807052/DC1</ext-link>). Moreover, they displayed smaller body size and severely reduced peristaltic movement compared with the control larvae (Fig. S2, A and B). These phenotypes were similarly observed in <italic>Sln<sup>D1</sup></italic> heterozygote combined with the deficiencies covering the <italic>Sln</italic> genomic region (<italic>Df(2R)BSC329</italic> and <italic>Df(2R)ED2247</italic>; unpublished data), supporting that <italic>Sln<sup>D1</sup></italic> is a loss-of-function allele of <italic>Sln</italic>. Together with the highest expression of <italic>Sln</italic> at the larval stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>), these results suggest that Sln is important for transporting metabolic monocarboxylates as energy sources for larval growth and development.</p><p>Because <italic>Sln<sup>D1</sup></italic> homozygous mutant showed early lethality, we used <italic>Sln<sup>D1</sup></italic> heterozygous mutant and the <italic>Sln<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> allele to investigate the signaling hierarchy between LKB1 and Sln. By epistatic analyses in adult wings, we found that LKB1-dependent reduced wing size was markedly restored in <italic>Sln<sup>D1</sup></italic> heterozygous genetic background (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Consistently, down-regulation of <italic>Sln</italic> using two copies of <italic>Sln<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> also restored the reduced wing size by LKB1 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). This <italic>Sln<sup>D1</sup></italic>- or <italic>Sln<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-mediated phenotypic rescue was caused by the decreased apoptosis in LKB1-expressing larval discs without changes in LKB1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref> and Fig. S2, C and D). These data suggest that Sln acts downstream of LKB1 to mediate the proapoptotic role of LKB1 in the control of tissue size.</p><p>The activity of MCT can be regulated by its expression level, membrane trafficking, and posttranslational modification (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Enerson and Drewes, 2003</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of interplay between LKB1 and Sln, we examined whether LKB1 regulates the expression level of Sln. However, neither endogenous mRNA nor exogenous protein level of Sln was altered in LKB1-overexressing or -deficient (<italic>LKB<sup>X5</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2006</xref>) larval wing discs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref> and not depicted). We also investigated whether LKB1 regulates the subcellular localization of Sln. Because we failed to generate antibodies detecting endogenous Sln, we alternatively examined the localization of transgenic Sln in larval wing discs. Confocal z-stack analysis of immunostaining against Sln and apical marker armadillo showed that Sln is localized both in the apical and basolateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Strikingly, LKB1 expression induced the asymmetrical localization of Sln predominantly in the apical side of the wing epithelium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>, top). In contrast, absence of LKB1 caused the localization of Sln largely in the basolateral side of the wing epithelium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>, bottom). These results suggest that LKB1 induces apical trafficking of Sln in epithelial cells. We also compared the effect of <italic>LKB1<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>LKB1<sup>KD</sup></italic> on Sln localization in the LKB1-null genetic background.

Because LKB1 induces apical trafficking of Sln (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>) and Sln mediates LKB1-dependent apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), we examined whether LKB1 promotes apical trafficking of Sln to induce apoptosis. Using TUNEL staining in ex vivo&#x02013;cultured wing discs, we examined the degree of apoptosis upon treatment with each Sln substrate, butyrate and lactate. Surprisingly, incubation of wing discs with butyrate caused massive apoptosis in the Sln-expressing regions by posterior-specific <italic>engrailed</italic> (<italic>en</italic>)-gal4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>, middle). However, lactate induced no significant death signals in Sln-expressing wing discs compared with control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>, left and middle). Remarkably, this Sln-mediated apoptosis upon butyrate treatment was considerably suppressed in LKB1-null genetic background (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>, right). In addition, LKB1-induced apoptosis was further enhanced by butyrate treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref> and Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807052/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807052/DC1</ext-link>). These data suggest that LKB1-dependent apical trafficking of Sln is critical in mediating the butyrate-induced apoptosis.</p><p>In this study, we show that Sln, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> MCT protein transporting butyrate and lactate, is a key executor of apoptosis as a downstream mediator of tumor suppressor LKB1. The kinase activity of LKB1 induces apical trafficking of Sln in polarized cells, and this may promote Sln to transport extracellular butyrate, which can provoke apoptosis.</p><p>Our ex vivo tissue culture data showed that endogenous Sln can enhance LKB1-induced apoptosis by &#x0003e;5 mM of butyrate treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). This amount is consistent with the concentration of monocarboxylates (0.5&#x02013;6 mM) in the insect hemolymph produced by resident bacterial flora in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kane and Breznak, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Santo Domingo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lemke et al., 2003</xref>). These monocarboxylates, including butyrate, might be delivered to various Sln-expressing organs through the <italic>Drosophila</italic> open circulatory system. It is well established that butyrate acts as an endogenous stimulator of epithelial cell death via diverse cellular mechanisms, such as inhibition of histone deacetylase and activation of p53- or Fas-dependent apoptosis (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, impaired butyrate uptake causes poor differentiation and defective cellular turnover, leading to various human cancers (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Paroder et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), our data also indicate that the kinase activity of LKB1 is crucial in its biological effects: the induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and the regulation of Sln localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). These results implicate that phosphorylation events are involved in the control of Sln by LKB1. In this scenario, the phosphorylation target could be Sln itself or other unknown binding partners of Sln. It is also possible that LKB1 directly phosphorylates the target protein or does so via its downstream kinases such as Par-1 and AMPK. Indeed, Par-1 was known to promote apical protein trafficking in polarized kidney cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cohen et al., 2004</xref>). Alternatively, AMPK could be another potential mediator of Sln trafficking because it regulates not only epithelial polarity but also energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2007</xref>) that possibly controls the transport of metabolic monocarboxylates. Further studies are necessary to disclose the mechanism of Sln localization regulated by the LKB1-dependent signaling cascade.</p><p>The proper control of programmed cell death is critical in maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing tumor formation (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Radtke and Clevers, 2005</xref>). Importantly, MCT also participates in these physiological processes by stimulating epithelial turnover via butyrate-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cuff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Natoni et al., 2005</xref>). Because trafficking and anchoring of MCT proteins to a specific cellular compartment are essential for their proper function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deora et al., 2005</xref>), the LKB1-dependent apical trafficking of Sln and subsequent induction of apoptosis might illustrate a potential control mechanism for MCT-mediated epithelial turnover in human tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Interestingly, LKB1 also stimulates physiological apoptosis as a master tumor suppressor in intestinal epithelium (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yoo et al., 2002</xref>). In these regards, our present study proposes a plausible link between the two previously unrelated players of apoptosis, LKB1 and MCT, and suggests a possible mechanism to relate epithelial polarization to cell death control by LKB1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p><italic>Sln<sup>D1</sup></italic> was generated by imprecise excision of <italic>Sln<sup>EP1</sup></italic> allele.
