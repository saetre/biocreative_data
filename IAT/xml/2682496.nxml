Since the discovery of the MEP pathway, possible metabolic cross-talk between these pathways has prompted intense research. Although many studies have shown the existence of such cross-talk using feeding experiments, it remains to be determined if native cross-talk, rather than exogenously applied metabolites, can compensate for complete blockage of the MVA pathway. Previously, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants for <italic>HMG1</italic> and <italic>HMG2</italic> encoding HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) were isolated. Although it was shown that HMGR1 is a functional HMGR, the enzyme activity of HMGR2 has not been confirmed. It is demonstrated here that <italic>HMG2</italic> encodes a functional reductase with similar activity to HMGR1, using enzyme assays and complementation experiments. To estimate the contribution of native cross-talk, an attempt was made to block the MVA pathway by making double mutants lacking both <italic>HMG1</italic> and <italic>HMG2</italic>, but no double homozygotes were detected in the progeny of self-pollinated <italic>HMG1/hmg1 hmg2/hmg2</italic> plants. <italic>hmg1 hmg2</italic> male gametophytes appeared to be lethal based on crossing experiments, and microscopy indicated that &#x0223c;50% of the microspores from the <italic>HMG1/hmg1 hmg2/hmg2</italic> plant appeared shrunken and exhibited poorly defined endoplasmic reticulum membranes. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization showed that <italic>HMG1</italic> transcripts were expressed in both the tapetum and microspores, while <italic>HMG2</italic> mRNA appeared only in microspores. It is concluded that native cross-talk from the plastid cannot compensate for complete blockage of the MVA pathway, at least during male gametophyte development, because either <italic>HMG1</italic> or <italic>HMG2</italic> is required for male gametophyte development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anther</kwd><kwd>cross-talk</kwd><kwd>HMG-CoA reductase</kwd><kwd>isoprenoid</kwd><kwd>male gametophyte</kwd><kwd>MEP pathway</kwd><kwd>MVA pathway</kwd><kwd>pollen</kwd><kwd>sterol</kwd><kwd>tapetum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants produce a wide variety of isoprenoids by the condensation of common five-carbon intermediates, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Over the course of evolution, plants have maintained the well-known eukaryotic mevalonate (MVA) pathway for cytosolic synthesis of IPP and DMAPP, and this pathway was considered to be the sole synthetic source of these compounds for several decades. However, plants have recently been discovered also to make use of the prokaryotic 2-<italic>C</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway from the endosymbiotic ancestral cyanobacteria in plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rohdich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Under normal physiological conditions, the two pathways are compartmentalized. Cytoplasmic isoprenoids (e.g. sterols and brassinosteroids) and mitochondrial isoprenoids (e.g. side chains of ubiquinone) are synthesized via the MVA pathway, while the MEP pathway is used to synthesize plastidic isoprenoids (e.g. carotenoids and the side chains of chlorophylls and plastoquinones) and some isoprenoid-type phytohormones (e.g. gibberellins, abscisic acid, and cytokinins).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Outline of the two isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways in an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell: the MVA and MEP pathways.

The biological importance of HMGR is further emphasized by the existence of highly specific natural inhibitors of the enzyme including mevinolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberts <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>), also known as lovastatin, and its analogues from various rhizopheric ascomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bach <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>), and their use as growth inhibitors and antibiotics. Earlier work revealed that mevinolin was an efficient plant growth regulator primarily through its inhibition of <italic>de novo</italic> phytosterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach and Lichtenthaler, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bach <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>).

Plant HMGRs are encoded by a small family of genes that are differentially expressed upon various internal and external stimuli, and the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of HMGRs have been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Learned, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newman and Chappell, 1997</xref>).

However, these feeding studies using exogenously applied metabolites were insufficient to determine whether mutual and native cross-talk can compensate for complete blockage of one of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways.</p><p>Mutants lacking one functional isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway are very useful to examine native cross-talk. The identification in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> of the isoprenoid biosynthesis mutant <italic>cla1-1</italic>, a null mutant for a DX synthase (<italic>DXS</italic>) gene, is one important example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Est&#x000e9;vez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Despite the albino phenotype of <italic>cla1-1</italic>, two <italic>DXS</italic> homologous genes exist in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome in addition to <italic>CLA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange and Ghassemian, 2003</xref>). It remains unclear whether a <italic>cla1</italic> mutation is sufficient for complete shutdown of the MEP pathway. Some MEP pathway mutants have been reported, including <italic>ispF-1</italic> for 2-<italic>C</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsieh and Goodman, 2006</xref>), <italic>clb4</italic> for hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(<italic>E</italic>)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guti&#x000e9;rrez-Nava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and <italic>clb6</italic> for 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (HDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guevara-Garc&#x000ed;a <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsieh and Goodman, 2005</xref>). These three enzymes are encoded by a single gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. When grown on sucrose-supplemented medium, even homozygous mutants completely lacking the MEP pathway are viable and capable of germinating.</p><p>The seven enzymatic reactions from acetyl-CoA to IPP and DMAPP are encoded by 12 genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suzuki and Muranaka, 2007</xref>). Among these 12 genes, <italic>HMG1</italic> and <italic>HMG2</italic>, encoding HMGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), as well as <italic>IPI1</italic> and <italic>IPI2</italic> (also refered to as <italic>IDI1</italic> and <italic>IDI2</italic>), encoding IPP isomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Phillips <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sapir-Mir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) have been analysed genetically. Whereas IPI1 has been found in multiple subcellular locations: the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), the plastid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Phillips <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) or the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sapir-Mir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), IPI2 appears in the three cases to be mainly localized in the mitochondria. Thus, it is still not well understood which IPI isoform is devoted to the MVA pathway. On the contrary, HMGR is a key enzyme of the MVA pathway. The isolation and characterization of <italic>hmg1</italic> and <italic>hmg2</italic> mutants for the two HMGR genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Although <italic>hmg1</italic> mutants show pleiotropic phenotypes (dwarfism, early senescence, and male sterility), <italic>hmg2</italic> mutants exhibit no morphological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). HMGR1 enzyme activity has been identified using yeast complementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Learned and Fink, 1989</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis using the catalytic domain of HMGR1 expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). The function of HMGR2 is thought to be almost equal to that of HMGR1 based on the findings that <italic>hmg2</italic> has slightly higher sensitivity to lovastatin than do wild-type (WT) plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and that the sterol and triterpenoid levels of <italic>hmg2</italic> are slightly lower than those of WT plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ohyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>); however, direct evidence that <italic>HMG2</italic> encodes a functional HMGR has not yet been presented. To examine the influence of complete blockage of the MVA pathway on the plant phenotype, the generation and characterization of an <italic>hmg1 hmg2</italic> double mutant is important. Prior to attempting to generate the double mutant, the biochemical and physiological functions of HMGR2 were examined by an enzyme assay and <italic>hmg1</italic> complementation test using <italic>HMG2</italic>. It was found that the <italic>hmg1 hmg2</italic> double mutant is lethal during male gametophyte development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants (ecotype Wassilewskija (WS), ecotype Columbia (Col), <italic>hmg1-1</italic> (WS background; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), <italic>hmg1-2</italic> (WS background; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), <italic>hmg2-1</italic> (Col background; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and <italic>qrt1-1</italic> (Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> background; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preuss <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>) were germinated on 1&#x000d7; Murashige-Skoog (MS) plates containing 3% sucrose and 0.8% agar.

Although all pollen grains were globular in <italic>HMG1/HMG1 hmg2-1/hmg2-1</italic> anthers, approximately half of the pollen grains were shrunken in <italic>HMG1/hmg1-1 hmg2-1/hmg2-1</italic> anthers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). The hypothesis that the shrunken pollen grains correspond to those of the <italic>hmg1 hmg2</italic> genotype is consistent with the crossing data. To confirm this, tetrad analysis was attempted using <italic>quartet1</italic> (<italic>qrt1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preuss <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). In microsporogenesis, a microsporocyte becomes a tetrad of four haploid cells after meiosis. The tetrad is then separated into four microspores, which develop into mature male gametophytes. In the <italic>qrt1</italic> mutant, the tetrad does not separate during male gametophyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preuss <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). If HMGR deficiency is sporophytically expressed, the numbers of normal and shrunken pollen might vary in a given quartet. By contrast, if the mutation is gametophytic, the ratio of normal to shrunken pollen in each quartet should be 2:2. To determine the genotype of these shrunken pollen grains, an <italic>HMG1/hmg1-1 hmg2-1/hmg2-1 qrt1-1/qrt1-1</italic> triple mutant was generated, and tetrad analysis using this triple mutant was performed.

However, the exine and pollen coat were normal in the shrunken male gametophyte. Magnified views of the shrunken male gametophyte showed that the vacuole was larger than normal, and the membraneous structures that seemed to originate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were hypertrophic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E, F, G</xref>), whereas symbiontic organelles (plastids and mitochondria) appeared nearly normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6G, H, I</xref>). The most remarkable aberration in shrunken male gametophytes is the poor condition of the membraneous element in the membrane traffic system.

Despite numerous endeavours, it has remained unclear whether native cross-talk, rather than exogenously applied metabolites, can compensate for the complete blockage of one of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways.</p><p>The biochemical and cellular functions of HMGR2 were analysed and the <italic>hmg1-1 hmg2-1</italic> double mutant was characterized to assess the contribution of the native metabolic flow from the MEP pathway. The <italic>hmg1-1</italic> plants have approximately 20% of the activity of WT plants, which is thought to correspond to HMGR2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). <italic>HMG2</italic> expression under an HMG1 promoter complemented the <italic>hmg1</italic> phenotype in terms of HMGR activity, sterol accumulation, gene expression, and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Although the physiological function(s) of <italic>HMG1</italic> and <italic>HMG2</italic> differ from each other (because of the difference in the phenotypes of <italic>hmg1</italic> and <italic>hmg2</italic>), it was demonstrated that <italic>HMG2</italic> encodes a functional HMGR. Although <italic>HMG1</italic> expression is not affected in <italic>hmg2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), the HMGR activity of <italic>hmg2-1</italic> plants was comparable to that of WT plants. HMGR activity of transgenic <italic>hmg1-1</italic> lines with <italic>HMG1</italic> or <italic>HMG2</italic> genes was not necessarily parallel to the expression level of <italic>HMG1</italic> or <italic>HMG2</italic> genes in these lines. These results suggest that HMGR activity is post-transcriptionally and post-translationally regulated. Post-transcriptional and post-translational feedback regulation of HMGR was suggested by the experiments using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> treated with lovastatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and with squalestatin and terbinafine, inhibitors of squalene synthase and of squalene epoxidase, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nieto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The feedback regulation was also suggested by the experiment using tobacco BY-2 cells treated with squalestatin and terbinafine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wentzinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Genetic studies have also demonstrated the regulatory mechanisms of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HMGR (Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Concepci&#x000f3;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Since the occurrence of multiple genes encoding HMGR is a general feature of higher plants, elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms is a complicated but challenging research area.</p><p>Because HMGR2 activity was confirmed, an attempt was made to generate an <italic>hmg1-1 hmg2-1</italic> double mutant. However, double homozygotes were not obtained, due to a defect in the male gametophyte of the <italic>hmg1 hmg2</italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). A tetrad analysis of <italic>HMG1/hmg1-1 hmg2-1/hmg2-1</italic> in a <italic>qrt1-1</italic> background demonstrated that the male gametophyte of the <italic>hmg1 hmg2</italic> genotype was shrunken and lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Ultrastructural observations revealed that these disrupted male gametophytes are hollow and that ER-derived membranes are in a poor condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). The deficiency in male gametophytes might be caused by a defect in the build-up of membrane systems that depend on essential components such as sterols, or on the presence of MVA-derived storage lipids like sterol esters. In contrast to the ER-derived membrane, plastids in shrunken gametophytes appeared normal, which may suggest that blockage of the MVA pathway does not affect plastid morphology. Furthermore, metabolic flow from the MEP pathway in the plastids cannot rescue deficiency of the male gametophyte in the blockage of the MVA pathway, although the plastid appeared normal.</p><p>Interestingly, the crossing experiment suggested that complete blockage of the MVA pathway does not affect female gametophyte development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). It is possible that a sufficient amount of MVA or MVA-derived metabolites is accumulated in the embryo-sac cell after meiosis during female gametophyte development. It is also possible that native cross-talk of isoprenoid compounds from the plastid might be able to compensate for the blockage of the MVA pathway in the embryo-sac cell. Recently, it was shown that complete deficiency of cycloartenol synthase 1 (CAS1) leads to male gametophyte lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babiychuk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Since the embryo-sac cell of the <italic>cas1-2</italic> mutant is viable, the viability of the <italic>hmg1 hmg2</italic> embryo-sac cell may not be derived from the native cross-talk from the plastid. Although important genes (e.g. housekeeping genes) are generally required for both male and female gametophyte development, it is interesting that HMGR, a key enzyme for cytosolic isoprenoid biosynthesis, is required only for male gametophyte development.</p><p>It is also interesting the <italic>HMG1</italic> deficiency in <italic>hmg1</italic> homozygous plants is a sporophytic mutation, while complete blockage of <italic>HMGR</italic> causes a gametophytic mutation. This may be caused by a difference in the expression pattern of <italic>HMG1</italic> and <italic>HMG2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). In male gametophyte development, both <italic>HMG1</italic> and <italic>HMG2</italic> are expressed, such that at least one HMGR isoenzyme is required. By contrast, diploid tapetum cells, which are essential for normal pollen formation, express only <italic>HMG1</italic>, so that <italic>hmg1</italic> homozygous plants may exhibit male sterility.</p><p>Since prenyl diphosphates are thought to flow between the cytosol and plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bick and Lange, 2003</xref>), HMGR is located upstream of the cross-talk in the MVA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Our data demonstrated that plants completely lacking the MVA pathway did not survive, even if they could biosynthesize small amounts of cytosolic isoprenoids using IPP and DMAPP from plastids. This indicates that the metabolic flow from the MEP pathway is insufficient, at least during male gametophyte development, to compensate for a non-functional MVA pathway. This may reflect the fact that the cytosol and plastid originated from different organisms, a primitive eukaryote and a cyanobacterium, respectively. Even if the contribution of native cross-talk is low, the regulatory mechanisms for isoprenoid biosynthesis in different organelles are interesting and challenging research areas.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Hikaru Seki (RIKEN, PSC) for helpful discussions, and Mizuki Magoshiro, Misaki Yano, Chiho Yamazaki, and Naomi Suzuki for technical assistance with <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and TEM.
