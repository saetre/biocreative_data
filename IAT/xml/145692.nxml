A nucleoside constituent of M r 258 (U*)which occurs at position 1915, within the highly modified oligonucleotide sequence 1911-psiAACU*Apsi-1917, was characterized as 3-methylpseudouridine (m3psi). The assignment was confirmed by chemical synthesis of m3psi and comparison with the natural nucleoside by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 3-Methylpseudouridine is previously unknown in nature and is the only known derivative of the common modified nucleoside pseudouridine thus far found in bacterial rRNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
