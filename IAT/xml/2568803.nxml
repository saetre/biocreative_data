MID1 is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and, in association with the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), &#x003b1;4, provides ubiquitin ligase activity for the ubiquitin-specific modification of PP2A. Using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technology, we show here that MID1 is actively and bi-directionally transported along the microtubules, and that this movement is directly linked to its MAP kinase and PP2A-mediated phosphorylation status. Intact transport depends on both kinesins and dyneins and is inhibited upon colcemide treatments. MID1 proteins carrying missense mutations in the &#x003b1;4 binding domain still bind the microtubules but cannot be actively transported. Likewise, knock-down of the &#x003b1;4 protein, inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid and fostriecin or the simulation of permanent phosphorylation at Ser96 in MID1 stop the migration of MID1-GFP, while preserving its microtubule-association. In summary, our data uncover an unexpected and novel function for PP2A, its regulatory subunit &#x003b1;4 and PP2A/&#x003b1;4/mTOR signaling in the active transport of the MID1 ubiquitin ligase complex along the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, a failure in the microtubule directed transport of this protein complex would be an attractive mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of OS in patients with B-box1 mutations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients with Opitz BBB/G syndrome (OS) are characterised by a diverse spectrum of ventral midline malformations.

In this protein complex, MID1 has ubiquitin ligase activity and thereby regulates the ubiquitin-specific modification and proteasomal degradation of the microtubule-associated catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac).

Its dephosphorylation is mediated by PP2A, which is targeted towards MID1 by &#x003b1;4. It has been suggested, that microtubule-association of MID1 is regulated by its mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PP2A dependent phosphorylation at position serine 96 (S96) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, which is located in the linker region between RING finger domain and B-Box1 domain.</p><p>Most mutations found in OS patients cluster in the C-terminus of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-So1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Quaderi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Cox1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Pinson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and lead to the loss of microtubule-association of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Schweiger2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, connection between the ubiquitin ligase MID1/&#x003b1;4 and microtubule-associated PP2Ac is disrupted, the enzyme accumulates and microtubule-associated proteins are hypophosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Trockenbacher1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations in the B-box1 domain disturb the interaction with &#x003b1;4 and accordingly with microtubule-associated PP2Ac (BA et al., unpublished data).</p><p>In this report, we show that GFP-tagged MID1 protein is bi-directionally transported along the microtubules, and that this movement depends on microtubule-integrity and on kinesin and dynein motor proteins. It is abolished when the MID1 protein carries mutations in the B-box1 domain, in cells with &#x003b1;4 loss-of-function, after inhibition of PP2A activity and after exchanging serine 96 into either glutamic (E) or aspartic acid (D), both simulating permanent protein phosphorylation. Interestingly, microtubule-association of MID1 is not influenced by any of these mutations or treatments. In conclusion, our data present a novel function of PP2A and its regulatory subunit &#x003b1;4 in the microtubule mediated transport of the MID1 protein complex. Furthermore, by showing interference of mutations in the B-Box1 domain of MID1 with its microtubule-associated transport, they suggest an attractive mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of OS in patients with such mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bi-directional transport of MID1-GFP along the microtubules</title><p>Many microtubule-associated proteins have been shown to move along the microtubules.

Therefore, its PP2A dependent dephosphorylation could be necessary for proper microtubule-associated transport along the microtubules. To test this hypothesis, we produced three different point mutations on serine 96. Two of them, S96D and S96E, brought negative charges and thereby simulated continuous phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003507-g007">Fig. 7b</xref>), whereas S96A completely inhibited phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003507-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>). As expected, while S96A showed recovery rates comparable to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003507-g007">Fig. 7a, c and d</xref>), neither S96D nor S96E were transported or showed fluorescent recovery even after 180 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003507-g007">Fig. 7b and d</xref>). In contrast to the wild-type, transport of the phosphorylation free S96A mutant along the microtubules was not inhibited by okadaic acid treatment prior to analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003507-g007">Fig. 7e</xref>). Also, cells overexpressing wild-type MID1-GFP that were pretreated with the MAPK inhibitor UO126 did not react on okadaic acid treatment, confirming a functional role of MAPK dependent phosphorylation in the regulation of the transport of the MID1-GFP protein along the microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003507-g007">Fig. 7f</xref>). Surprisingly, contrary to previously suggested data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, all S96 mutant proteins showed undisturbed microtubule-associated pattern.

Mutations in the microtubule-associated MID1 protein lead to defective establishment of these structures and the development of the ventral midline disorder OS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Quaderi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. We show here that, while wild-type MID1 is being transported bi-directionally along the microtubules, proteins carrying mutations in the B-box1, that have been found in OS patients still bind to the microtubules, but do not move anymore. Together with the OS phenotype and the specific structures involved, these data point at a MID1 function that is closely related with microtubule dependent polarisation and migration of neural crest cells.</p><p>Interestingly, we have seen a significantly slower transport of MID1 along axonal microtubules than in the cell body. This could reflect energy and motor protein supply gradients in the cell with high concentration in the cell body close to the mitochondria and at the microtubule-organizing centre and lower concentrations in the cell peripherie. However, we find an increase in transport speed after taxol treatment which suggests that MID1 transport speed is in direct proportion with the stability of the microtubules. Higher transport speeds close to the microtubule-assembly centre where most stable microtubules are found would be a logical consequence.</p><p>Continuous outward polymerisation of microtubules from the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) towards the cell periphery has been demonstrated in the polarised, migrating cell &#x0005b;reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-WehrleHaller1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;. This makes the transport of proteins supporting microtubule polymerisation to the tip of an outgrowing microtubule an important factor. MID1 has been shown to stabilize microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Schweiger2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and, as shown here, its transport along the microtubules depends on kinesin motor proteins. These observations would suggest functional similarities to Par-1 which, by also having microtubule stabilizing properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Cohen1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, is a key organizer of microtubule arrays important for the polarised transport of cell polarity &#x0005b;reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Munro1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, dysfunctional transport of MID1 in migrating neural crest cells in patients with OS would lead to a disequilibrium of stabilizing and destabilizing microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) at the tip of microtubules growing out towards the leading edge of the cell and could result in either a slow down of migration or in the misdirection of the cell.</p><p>Interestingly, we have observed not only kinesin but also dynein-dependent transport of MID1. Similarly, both kinesin and dynein dependent transport in neurons has been shown for Par-3, another member of the Par-protein family that are widely conserved regulators of cell polarity and asymmetry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Nishimura1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Shi1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Munro1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;. Reasons for the retrograde, dynein mediated transport of MID1 could either be a feedback regulation at the outgrowing tip in order to avoid an excess of microtubule-stabilizing factors which would perturb the delicate equilibrium of microtubule dynamics. Additionally it could allow rapid recycling of the MID1 protein for functions at the centrosome. However, it is striking that, while the dynein inhibitor EHNA completely stops retrograde MID1 transport, the kinesin inhibitor seems to decelerate both, kinesin-driven antegrade and dynein-related retrograde transport. This could reflect a lack of supply at the cell peripherie. When antegrade transport is blocked and only very limited possibilities are available to synthesize fresh protein in the cell peripherie, the density of molecules awaiting retrograde transport shrink, which would result in a slow down of retrograde transport.</p><p>Our data clearly show that by dephosphorylating S96, PP2A stimulates the transport of the MID1 ubiquitin ligase complex along the microtubules. For MID1, it has been demonstrated previously that it interacts with microtubules in a phosphorylation dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Treatment of cells with mitogene activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors led to a partial redistribution of MID1-GFP from the microtubules and co-expression of MID1-GFP with &#x003b1;4 resulted in a decrease of MID1 phosphorylation. It was further suggested that dephosphorylation of MID1 at S96 by &#x003b1;4-associated PP2A might reduce the association of MID1 with the microtubule network and result in cytoplasmic localisation. In this study, we have used three different S96 mutants, two of which simulate continuous phosphorylation at that position (S96D and S96E), while the third completely inhibits MID1 phosphorylation at S96 (S96A). Interestingly, all three MID1-GFP mutants showed similar microtubule-associated distribution as the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003507-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Also, the MAPK inhibitor UO126 did not interfere with microtubule-association of wild-type MID1-GFP in our hands. Instead of phosphorylation dependency of microtubule-association, we found that the microtubule-associated transport of MID1 heavily relies on the PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of its N-terminus. We further show that this dephosphorylation is closely linked to &#x003b1;4, the mammalian homologue of the yeast protein TAP42. TAP42, &#x003b1;4 and their association to PP2A is regulated by the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway and by rapamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Goldberg1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Murata1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, which has been related to microtubule-associated protein transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Jiang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003507-Kong1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> before. Our data therefore not only show a novel role of PP2A in microtubule-associated protein transport, but also bring up additional evidence that the TOR/mTOR pathways is involved in the regulation of intracellular protein transport, localized stabilisation of microtubules and cell migration.</p><p>In summary, our data provide evidence that dysfunctional microtubule directed and PP2A dependent transport of the microtubule stabilizer MID1 is an important pathomechanism underlying the ventral midline disorder Opitz BBB/G syndrome. They further show that association to the regulatory PP2A subunit &#x003b1;4 is essential for this transport and that point mutations in the &#x003b1;4 binding domain completely destroy the protein's cellular mobility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Constructs</title><p>Two novel mutations found in OS patients have been used: One patient presented with hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, strabismus, cleft lip and palate, hypospadias and small ears with a right pre-auricular pit.
