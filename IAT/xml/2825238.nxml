Hence, determinants of plant salt tolerance are intensively investigated to identify targets for plant breeding and to create salt tolerant varieties. Three cellular components of salt tolerance have been proposed in plants: (<italic>i</italic>) osmotic stress tolerance, (<italic>ii</italic>) Na<sup>+ </sup>exclusion capacity and (<italic>iii</italic>) tissue tolerance to Na<sup>+ </sup>accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Unlike halophytic species, the glycophytic plant-model <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>is sensitive to moderate levels of NaCl. This has raised the question of its relevance in salt tolerance studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, thanks to genetic and molecular tools developed around this species, several genes involved in plant salt tolerance have been highlighted. Thus, many mutants or transgenic lines of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana </italic>were shown to display differential levels of NaCl tolerance and this mostly concerned genes involved in ion transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], detoxication processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or metabolite biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Among stress-responsive metabolites, &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid is of special interest since the molecule accumulates in response to a wide range of environmental stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] although its function in plants is still a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. GABA is a widespread non protein amino acid, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. It has been first discovered in plants in the middle of the 20<sup>th </sup>century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] but rapidly attention shifted to its signaling function in mammals central nervous system as a neurotransmitter. In plants, speculative functions have been attributed to GABA metabolism such as osmoregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and glutamate homeostasis control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated to participate to pH regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and bypass of TCA cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. GABA has also been shown to act as a signaling molecule in plants as reported for nitrate uptake modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], <italic>14-3-3 </italic>genes regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and pollen tube growth and guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In plants and animals, GABA metabolism is sum up in a three-enzyme-pathway that takes place in two cellular compartments (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). GABA is mainly synthesized from L-glutamate owing to the activity of the cytosolic glutamate decarboxylase (GAD, EC 4.1.1.15). GABA is then transported into the mitochondrion to be catabolized by the GABA transaminase (GABA-T, EC 2.6.1.19) which converts GABA to succinic semialdehyde (SSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Subsequently, SSA is oxidized by the mitochondrial succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH, EC 1.2.1.16) to produce succinate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Alternatively, SSA can also be reduced in the cytosol <italic>via </italic>the activity of the &#x003b3;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (GHBDH, EC 1.1.1.61) that produces &#x003b3;-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the GABA metabolic pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></bold>.

On this basis, it has been hypothesized that GABA level could be mainly controlled by the rate of its synthesis. However, isolation and characterization of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>GABA-T deficient mutants demonstrated that GABA levels could also result from the rate of its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome contains only one GABA-T encoding gene (<italic>At3 g22200</italic>; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], subsequently termed <italic>POP2 </italic>(<italic>Pollen-Pistil Incompatibility 2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], whereas 5 genes putatively encode GAD (<italic>GAD1-5</italic>; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. POP2 uses pyruvate as GABA amino group acceptor (GABA-TP activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], while in mammals GABA-T exclusively uses 2-ketoglutarate as amino group acceptor (GABA-TK activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that POP2 can also uses glyoxylate as amino acceptor and thus produces glycine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. <italic>POP2 </italic>gene product is a 55.2 kDa polypeptide with a pyridoxal-5-phosphate binding domain and a mitochondrial peptide signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and shares little homology with non-plant <italic>GABA-T </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows that GABA readily accumulated during NaCl treatment in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>at the whole-plant level.

GAD activity showed surprising variations (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) in response to NaCl treatment. It was thus found to be significantly decreased in plantlets treated for 24 h with 150 mM NaCl while, after 4 days of treatment, it reached 1.5-fold higher level than in control plantlets (49.7 vs 33.9 nmoles.min<sup>-1</sup>.mg<sup>-1 </sup>protein; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> shows that GABA-TP activity increased rapidly in response to treatment with 150 mM NaCl. In plantlets treated for 4 days, GABA-TP activity was 2.1-fold higher than in control plantlets (20.0 vs 9.7 nmoles.min<sup>-1</sup>.mg<sup>-1 </sup>protein; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>) and was actually found to respond to NaCl in a dose-dependent manner (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>).</p><p>It was of interest to ascertain whether enzymes activities were correlated with changes in transcriptional activity of GABA metabolism genes. To achieve this objective, genes expression analysis was performed by qRT-PCR on total RNA isolated from entire WT plantlets treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of NaCl. Primers were designed in order to ensure specific amplification (see Methods section and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>, only the expression of 3 <italic>GAD </italic>genes was detectable under our experimental conditions. <italic>GAD1 </italic>and <italic>GAD2</italic>, the two most expressed paralogs, showed contrasted expression changes in response to NaCl treatments. <italic>GAD1 </italic>expression, which is root-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], was shown to be gradually restricted as far as NaCl concentration increased. On the opposite, <italic>GAD2 </italic>expression, which is present in all parts of plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], was significantly enhanced when the salt level exceeded 100 mM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). <italic>GAD4 </italic>expression was much lower than those of the two other GAD isoforms but it was found to be significantly enhanced in NaCl-treated plantlets (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). <italic>GAD4 </italic>expression was indeed 5.3-fold higher in plantlets treated for 24 h with 150 mM NaCl than in control plantlets. In such plantlets, <italic>POP2 </italic>expression was 2.3-fold higher than in control plantlets (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>) and was actually found to be the most expressed gene of the GABA metabolism suggesting a pivotal function in salt stress responses. Interestingly, <italic>SSADH </italic>expression was also enhanced at 100 mM and 150 mM NaCl concentrations (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>) indicating that whole GABA catabolism was transcriptionally up-regulated upon NaCl treatment.

In both case, NaCl treatment induced severe phenotype in the mutant, even death on agar medium supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, whereas no obvious difference occurred under control conditions between the mutant and its WT (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). NaCl sensitivity was more obvious at the root level since no clear symptoms appeared in aerial part of plants for NaCl concentrations below 150 mM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). As a convenient way to decipher <italic>pop2-1 </italic>oversensitivity to NaCl, we compared primary root growths of <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant and WT on agar media supplemented with various salts or osmoticum. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <italic>pop2-1 </italic>root growth was found to be oversensitive to NaCl. Unlike to WT, mutant root growth was indeed sharply reduced at 50 mM NaCl and decreased linearly as NaCl concentration increased in the medium (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). NaCl concentration that induced 50% inhibition of root growth (<italic>I</italic><sub>50</sub>) was close to 81 mM for <italic>pop2-1 </italic>and 138 mM for WT. Furthermore, this response was mainly due to Na<sup>+ </sup>because treatments with increasing concentration of KCl were less inhibitory for root growth of the mutant (<italic>I</italic><sub>50 </sub>= 137 mM; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The possibility of a pleiotropic sensitivity to toxic cations of <italic>pop2-1 </italic>was ruled out since the mutant did not display special phenotype in response to 1 mM spermidine and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). In this context, it was of interest to verify whether <italic>pop2-1 </italic>root growth was also affected by osmotic stress. For this purpose, we used osmotically active concentrations of mannitol and osmotically non-active concentrations of the highly toxic LiCl. Thus, <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant did not appear to be oversensitive to mannitol (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) while LiCl induced a strong inhibition of <italic>pop2-1 </italic>root growth (<italic>I</italic><sub>50 </sub>= 8.4 mM vs 15.2 mM for WT; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

Among the 41 metabolites determined, 31 were shown to be present in a significantly different amount in <italic>pop2-1 </italic>roots after NaCl treatment (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Interestingly, most of those that were more abundant in the mutant after NaCl treatment were amino acids while metabolites that were less abundant in the mutant were mostly carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, galactose, sucrose and trehalose; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Surprisingly, succinate was shown to be significantly more abundant in roots of <italic>pop2-1 </italic>after NaCl treatment (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) although this compound could partly result from GABA degradation (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Until today, the molecular and biochemical events at the origin of this accumulation were misunderstood. Here, we showed in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>that GABA level changes under salt conditions were accompanied with variations of <italic>in vitro </italic>enzymes activities and transcription of GABA metabolism genes. Overall, GABA metabolism was found to be activated by NaCl treatment since almost all genes of this metabolism and both <italic>in vitro </italic>GAD and GABA-T activities were up-regulated (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results basically implicate GABA metabolism in salt responses of <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and also suggest that metabolic flux through this metabolism is of importance under stressful conditions. However, the determination of <italic>in vitro </italic>GAD and GABA-T activities failed to explain GABA level changes during the first days of NaCl treatment. Indeed, within the 2 first days, GAD activity was not found to be significantly enhanced in salt-treated plantlets, even was decreased after 24 h of NaCl exposure, while in the same time GABA level and GABA-T activity were found to be significantly increased. In this context, attention should be paid to the catalytic properties of plants GADs that are known to be tightly regulated at the post-translational level by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Such post-translational regulation of GAD activity should be responsible for the rapid accumulation of GABA observed in response to cold and wounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and is likely to explain the discrepancy observed between <italic>in vitro </italic>GAD activity and GABA level evolutions given that NaCl treatments are known to trigger rapid elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Thus, GABA accumulation in the first time of NaCl exposure would mainly result from an activation of GAD activity by Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release in the cytosol; when stressful conditions are extended, GABA level control would implicate transcriptional regulation of GABA metabolism genes.</p><p>Transcriptional profiling of GABA metabolism genes demonstrated that almost all genes involved in GABA metabolism whose expression was detectable were up-regulated in response to NaCl (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). Among the three <italic>GAD </italic>genes whose expressions were detected, two paralogs were shown to be significantly up-regulated during NaCl treatment (<italic>GAD2 </italic>and <italic>GAD4</italic>; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). <italic>GAD2 </italic>expression has been shown to be ubiquitous in plant organs and to vary depending on nitrogen nutrition of plant suggesting involvement of this isoform in nitrogen metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, the increase of <italic>GAD2 </italic>expression at high NaCl concentration might be due to the necessity to adjust nitrogen metabolism under stressful conditions rather than to a specific response to NaCl. Unlike to <italic>GAD2</italic>, the putative <italic>GAD4 </italic>isoform seemed to be NaCl-specific since we showed that its expression increased in a dose-dependent manner (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). This isoform appears to be not only NaCl-responsive but is also involved in a variety of abiotic stresses since <italic>GAD4 </italic>was also shown to be induced in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>in response to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], cold treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In addition, <italic>GAD4 </italic>was found to be overexpressed in the ABA-deficient <italic>nc3-2 </italic>mutant in comparison to WT under drought stress indicating that ABA may be involved in the control of its expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Analysis of <italic>GAD4 </italic>expression pattern under stressful conditions may bring precious information on functions of the gene. In spite of the enhancement of two <italic>GAD </italic>expressions, GAD activity was shown to decrease after 24 h of treatment with 150 mM NaCl. These results could be explained by (i) a time-delay between <italic>GAD </italic>transcripts production and their translation, (ii) the decrease of <italic>GAD1 </italic>expression observed upon NaCl treatment (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). The two genes involved in GABA catabolism (i.e. <italic>POP2 </italic>and <italic>SSADH</italic>) were also found to be up-regulated at moderate and high NaCl concentrations (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). These data are consistent with a high importance of GABA catabolism upon NaCl treatment and also mean that GABA-T and SSADH steps would be coordinated, probably to prevent accumulation of the reactive succinic semialdehyde (SSA) since both enzymes are located into the mitochondrion in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We found that <italic>POP2 </italic>was the most highly expressed gene involved in GABA metabolism after 24 h of treatment with 150 mM NaCl (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>) and was induced both in shoots and some areas of roots upon NaCl (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Taking into account that <italic>POP2 </italic>coding sequence is thought to be present as a single copy in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], its prominent expression level suggests a pivotal function of GABA-T in GABA accumulation upon NaCl treatment. In parallel, a survey of public microarray databases reveals that <italic>POP2 </italic>is also responsive to osmotic stress (&#x000d7; 4.5), senescence (&#x000d7; 4.05) and ABA treatment (&#x000d7; 2.47) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] indicating an overall response of this step to environmental cues.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant is oversensitive to NaCl</title><p>To elucidate the contribution of the GABA-T to <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>NaCl responses, we performed a functional analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis POP2 </italic>gene. The first step of number of gene functional analysis is to check phenotype of the corresponding loss-of-function mutant. Hence, we used the <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant which was initially isolated and characterized for its quasi-sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recently, <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant has been reported to be resistant to <italic>E</italic>-2-hexenal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and to accumulate a lesser amount of alanine in roots under hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that root growth of <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant was oversensitive to ionic stress since both NaCl and LiCl induced severe phenotype in mutant whereas mannitol did not (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This oversensitivity was also monitored at the plant biomass level at a later developmental stage (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). It is noteworthy that <italic>POP2</italic>-overexpessing plants neither showed improved salt tolerance (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>), even fed with 10 mM GABA (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>), nor were found to exhibit special vegetative and reproductive phenotype (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>).</p><p>We can ask whether high GABA levels that occur in <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant under control and even more under NaCl conditions (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) could not be toxic. Indeed, some data suggest that GABA overproduction is deleterious for plant development as shown in tobacco plants overexpressing a truncated GAD that lacks auto-inhibitory calmodulin binding site (GAD&#x00394;C plants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, since the GABA accumulation observed in these transgenic plants was also associated with a huge decrease of glutamate pool, authors did not conclude to a possible deleterious effect of GABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Arguments in favour of a non-toxic effect of high GABA levels are found in the literature as reported by Mirabella et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] who associated high GABA levels to resistance to <italic>E</italic>-2-hexenal in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>either in wild-type plants fed with exogenous GABA or in the constitutively GABA accumulating <italic>pop2</italic>/<italic>her1 </italic>mutants. Moreover, Ludewig et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] also ruled out the hypothesis of a higher oxidative stress induced by high GABA level in <italic>pop2 </italic>mutants since GABA accumulation was not shown to be associated with high reactive oxygen intermediates content. These findings are consistent with our observations indicating non-deleterious effects of 10 mM exogenous GABA on WT plantlets both under control and NaCl conditions (data not shown).</p><p>Previous works showed that GABA seemed to have a tight link with Na<sup>+ </sup>transport as shown in mammals where GABA is cotransported with Na<sup>+ </sup>and Cl<sup>- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>which was found to overaccumulate Na<sup>+ </sup>when fed with GABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. These observations led us to hypothesize that <italic>pop2-1 </italic>oversensitivity to NaCl would be due to Na<sup>+ </sup>and/or Cl<sup>- </sup>overaccumulation. However, determination of Na<sup>+ </sup>and Cl<sup>- </sup>in plantlets subjected to NaCl treatment did not reveal any difference between <italic>pop2-1 </italic>and its WT (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), thus invalidating our hypothesis. In contrast, K<sup>+ </sup>was found to be present in a significantly lesser amount in mutant compared with its WT after NaCl treatment (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). This decrease may explain <italic>pop2-1 </italic>oversensitive phenotype in response to NaCl since a similar, but more severe, behaviour has been observed in the mutant of the <italic>Salt Overly Sensitive 1 </italic>locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, the <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant was found to be able to grow on low K<sup>+ </sup>medium (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), while <italic>sos1 </italic>mutant did not, and the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+ </sup>ratio in mutant was not shown to be different from that of WT (data not shown). All these data suggest that K<sup>+ </sup>homeostasis in the mutant would not be so far disturbed. Finally, Armengaud and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] showed that under low K<sup>+</sup>, <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>roots accumulated carbohydrates while organic acids content decreased. Such metabolites evolutions are not similar to those observed in <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) indicating that the mutant did not experiment K<sup>+ </sup>deficiency under NaCl treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>GABA-T links N and C metabolisms in roots upon NaCl treatment</title><p>Recently, a significant effort has been done to elucidate metabolic functions of GABA in higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Several evidences make sense with the idea that GABA metabolism in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>is highly active in roots, readily more than in shoots. First, we found that GABA was about 10-fold more abundant in roots than in shoots in WT plants under control conditions (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This observation corroborates findings of Miyashita and Good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] in hydroponically grown <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>plants. Besides, in accordance with previous results obtained by qRT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], <italic>POP2 </italic>was shown to be mostly expressed in roots under control conditions (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) suggesting that GABA degradation occurred at a high rate in this organ. Furthermore, GAD1, a root-specific GAD responsible for the maintenance of GABA level in roots, has been characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] whereas no shoot-specific isoform is to date identified. Overall, these data lead us to assert that GABA metabolism would be of prime importance in roots.</p><p>The great inhibition of primary root growth triggered by NaCl treatment in <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant was accompanied with substantial changes in roots metabolite profiles of mutant in comparison to WT, and these changes appeared to be more important in roots than in shoots as revealed by PCA (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). These results argue in favour of a prominent metabolic function of GABA-T in roots under NaCl conditions. This assertion is also consistent with the <italic>POP2 </italic>expression pattern which was found to be tightly reconfigured in NaCl-treated roots (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Metabolic changes in <italic>pop2-1 </italic>mutant roots included accumulation of amino acids and decrease in carbohydrates (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) strongly suggesting a function for GABA-T, and <italic>in extenso </italic>for GABA metabolism, in the central C/N metabolism. Several studies have reported the fluctuations of GABA content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] or the induction of GABA-TP encoding gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] along day or senescence also indicating a function for GABA metabolism in C/N control. Furthermore, Fait et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] found positive correlation of <italic>GAD </italic>and <italic>SSADH </italic>genes with several genes involved in central metabolism using the entire NASC0271 matrix. Overall, these findings give support to the fact that GABA plays a critical role in linking N and C metabolisms. Intriguingly, TCA cycle intermediates were not found to be present in a significant lesser amount in roots of <italic>pop2-1 </italic>(figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> for absolute values) although GABA metabolism has been thought to play an anaplerotic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Such a function is supported by recent studies that investigated plants impaired in TCA cycle enzymes. In these experiments, GABA was often present at a differential level in enzyme impaired-plants indicating that GABA metabolism was regulated depending on TCA cycle activity and/or integrity. These results concerned plants compromised in enzymes involved in steps both up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and down [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] to succinate production. The sharp decrease in carbohydrates content in <italic>pop2-1 </italic>roots upon NaCl treatment may be due to the necessity to compensate GABA metabolism impairment by providing increased amount of pyruvate to TCA cycle through glycolysis, which has been shown to be functionally associated with the mitochondrion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. We attempted to rescue <italic>pop2-1 </italic>phenotype by supplementing NaCl enriched medium with either 2% sucrose or with the combination of 10 mM alanine and 10 mM succinate, but attempts failed (data not shown) suggesting that metabolic impairment would not be the unique reason of <italic>pop2-1 </italic>phenotype.</p><p>In this context, we cannot exclude that a signaling effect of GABA would mediate <italic>pop2-1 </italic>oversensitivity. Indeed, GABA has been thought to act as a signaling factor in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. It has been shown to regulate nitrate uptake in <italic>Brassica napus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] suggesting a function in regulation of nitrogen metabolism.
