We showed previously that in addition to prolactin, signaling by laminin-111 was necessary to restore functional differentiation of mammary epithelia. Here, we elucidate two additional aspects of laminin-111 action. We show that in 2D cultures, the prolactin receptor is basolaterally localized and physically segregated from its apically placed ligand. Detachment of the cells exposes the receptor to ligation by prolactin leading to signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 5 (STAT5) activation, but only transiently and not sufficiently for induction of milk protein expression. We show that laminin-111 reorganizes mammary cells into polarized acini, allowing both the exposure of the prolactin receptor and sustained activation of STAT5. The use of constitutively active STAT5 constructs showed that the latter is necessary and sufficient for chromatin reorganization and &#x003b2;-casein transcription. These results underscore the crucial role of continuous laminin signaling and polarized tissue architecture in maintenance of transcription factor activation, chromatin organization, and tissue-specific gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: BM, basement membrane; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DG, dystroglycan; lrECM, laminin-rich ECM; polyHEMA, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); Prl, prolactin; PrlR, prolactin receptor; STAT5, signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 5.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The activity of several transcription factors is essential for mammary gland development and milk protein expression (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosen et al., 1999</xref>). One of these factors, signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 5 (STAT5), is a downstream target of the prolactin receptor (PrlR)&#x02013;JAK2 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gouilleux et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watson and Burdon, 1996</xref>). Binding of prolactin (Prl) to its receptor induces STAT5 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated STAT5 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it binds specific DNA motifs to induce gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gouilleux et al., 1994</xref>). However, treatment with Prl alone does not activate the JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 pathway in primary or immortalized mammary epithelial cells in 2D cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Streuli et al., 1995a</xref>); additional signals from ECM are required for Prl to induce STAT5 phosphorylation and DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Streuli et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). The data in vivo are consistent with these findings in that &#x003b2;1-integrin signaling contributes to nuclear translocation of STAT5 in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faraldo et al., 2002</xref>). However, despite considerable literature, much of it from our own laboratory, how cells in 2D cultures resist signaling by Prl has not been elucidated.</p><p>3D tissue architecture is essential for induction and maintenance of tissue-specific functions of epithelial organs. Both physical and biochemical signals from ECM are necessary for expression of specific cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roskelley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wipff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcaraz et al., 2008</xref>). Luminal mammary epithelial cells form relatively flat and polarized monolayers when cultured on 2D substrata, but fail to express milk proteins in response to treatment with lactogenic hormones. When cultured in 3D laminin-rich ECM (lrECM) gels, they form polarized acinar structures with a central lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barcellos-Hoff et al., 1989</xref>). Under these conditions and in the presence of the lactogenic hormones Prl and hydrocortisone, mammary cells functionally differentiate and express milk proteins, such as &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-caseins.</p><p>Laminin-111 (formerly laminin-1) is a major basement membrane (BM) component required for milk protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Streuli et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Streuli et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muschler et al., 1999</xref>). Previously, we identified two types of cellular response to laminin-111 in mammary epithelial cells that are necessary for inducing functional differentiation: (1) changes in cytostructure mediated by dystroglycan (DG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muschler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weir et al., 2006</xref>), which can be mimicked physically by plating cells on the nonadhesive substratum poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (polyHEMA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roskelley et al., 1994</xref>), and (2) transmission of biochemical signals mediated by &#x003b2;1-integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Streuli et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roskelley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muschler et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The plasma membrane of epithelial cells is separated by tight junctions into apical and basolateral surfaces with different protein and lipid components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson, 2003</xref>). In 2D culture of polarized cells, the basal membrane is adherent to the substrata, and basolaterally localized receptors in tight monolayers of epithelial cells may consequently be prevented from binding to their apically presented ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeer et al., 2003</xref>). We asked whether mammary epithelial cells fail to differentiate in response to Prl because of the limited accessibility of PrlR. We demonstrate here that this indeed is the case in 2D cultures. But we show also that Prl binding and transient STAT5 activation are not sufficient to activate tissue-specific functions. We show that ECM-dependent sustained activation of STAT5 is necessary for chromatin remodeling of mammary-specific gene loci, allowing tissue-specific gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transient STAT5 activation is insufficient to induce mammary-specific functions</title><p>Mammary epithelial cells in 2D cultures fail to undergo functional differentiation even in the presence of the lactogenic hormone Prl. When cells were placed on gels of type I collagen and allowed to float, they reorganized and were shown to contain some caseins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Emerman et al., 1977</xref>). We showed subsequently that caseins were induced de novo under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 1985</xref>) and that expression was dependent on the presence of laminin-111 and formation of a BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barcellos-Hoff et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Streuli et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muschler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, it was shown that STAT5 is not activated in 2D cultures and that activation in 3D cultures depends on signaling from laminin-111 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Streuli et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Streuli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we asked whether PrlR was present and, if so, whether Prl could bind its receptor in cells cultured in monolayers. We showed that the levels of PrlR were similar between cells on plastic and cells treated with lrECM (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807021/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807021/DC1</ext-link>). To show whether or not Prl can bind to its receptor, we conjugated Prl with Cy5.5 and found that indeed the receptor was not available for binding, explaining the failure to induce STAT5 phosphorylation under these conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). However, when cells were cultured either in 3D lrECM or on the nonadhesive and inert substratum polyHEMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roskelley et al., 1994</xref>), the labeled Prl bound to the receptor and induced rapid phosphorylation of STAT5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Surprisingly, however, only cells in 3D lrECM produced appreciable quantities of &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-casein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and not depicted) in response to Prl treatment. These results clearly indicate that the transient STAT5 activation does not require signals from laminin-111, and ligation of Prl by itself, or even the transient activation of STAT5, is not sufficient to induce tissue-specific functions. These findings led to two subsequent questions. (1) Why does Prl fail to bind to its receptor in 2D cultures? (2) What does laminin-111 signaling provide in addition to transient STAT5 phosphorylation to induce milk protein expression?</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A transient STAT5 activation is not sufficient to induce mammary-specific gene expression.</bold> (A) Confocal images of Cy5.5-labeled Prl incubated EpH4 cells.

We reasoned that PrlR was basolaterally localized in 2D cultures and therefore not accessible to its ligand. EpH4 cells were grown to confluence on permeable filters in Transwell plates and stained for both PrlR and the apical marker ZO-1. Confocal analysis showed that PrlR localized mainly to the basolateral membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Polarized EpH4 cells were treated with Prl in either the upper (apical) or lower (basal) chambers, and PrlR activation was examined by Western blot analysis with an antibody against phosphorylated STAT5. Whereas adding Prl to the basal chamber activated STAT5 phosphorylation dramatically, adding it to the apical chamber had little or no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In cells where tight junctions were disrupted by chelating Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with EGTA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), apical addition of Prl induced STAT5 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).

When EpH4 cells were treated with Prl in the presence or absence of lrECM on polyHEMA, an initial peak of STAT5 phosphorylation was induced immediately under both conditions, but subsided over the next 2 h irrespective of the presence or absence of lrECM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In the presence of lrECM, however, STAT5 phosphorylation was activated again after 8 h, reached a peak at 24 h and persisted at a relatively high level until at least 48 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Importantly, the expression of both &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-caseins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and not depicted) corresponded with the second wave of STAT5 activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Consistent with its increased phosphorylation, nuclear levels of STAT5 in lrECM-treated cells were also higher than in the control cultures at 24 and 48 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). We confirmed that in both primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells as well as in SCp2, another mammary epithelial cell line, sustained STAT5 reactivation occurs in a lrECM-dependent manner (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807021/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807021/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>&#x003b2;-Casein transcription corresponds with lrECM-induced sustained STAT5 activation.</bold> (A) EpH4 cells on polyHEMA were treated with Prl alone or Prl plus 2% lrECM for different intervals.

Not surprisingly, we find that it is the laminin component of lrECM that is responsible for sustained activation of STAT5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Laminin-111, but not collagen I, activated casein transcription (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). However, neither laminin-111 nor collagen I affected the transient phosphorylation of STAT5 in response to Prl treatment, confirming that the transient activation is independent of an ECM signal (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Laminin-111 regulates sustained STAT5 activation and casein transcription.</bold> (A) Immunofluorescence analysis of PrlR and ZO-1 in EpH4 cells on polyHEMA that were treated with Prl alone (pHEMA) or Prl plus 2% lrECM (3D lrECM) for 24 h.

These data indicate one important reason why transient activation of STAT5 is insufficient to induce milk protein expression: there has to be chromatin remodeling of casein genes by laminin-111 through sustained STAT5 activation.

Nonetheless, past studies of mammary epithelial cells in culture have mainly focused on the transient activation of STAT5. We show here that the transient activation is not sufficient for induction of milk protein expression and that sustained STAT5 activation is required for activation and maintenance of mammary-specific functions. But more importantly, our results provide a mechanism and a physiological rationale for why STAT5 activation appears to be sustained throughout lactation.</p><p>Our finding that there is no or limited accessibility of the basolaterally localized PrlR to its ligand in the apical space solves the puzzle of why Prl fails to induce STAT5 activation in mammary epithelial cells cultured on 2D surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Streuli et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). This phenomenon can likely be generalized to other epithelia and other tissue-specific genes. Segregation of receptor and ligand regulates several epithelial and lymphocyte functions, and asymmetrical localization of proteins in and out of the plasma membrane is important for tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwartz et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Porter et al., 2008</xref>). In polarized airway epithelium, erbB2 and erbB4 are basolaterally localized and are physically separated from their apical ligand, heregulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeer et al., 2003</xref>). This physical segregation prevents receptor activation except when epithelial integrity is disrupted, as is the case in injury and cancer; in the former case, the ligation would ensure rapid restoration of the epithelia and tissue polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeer et al., 2003</xref>), but, in the latter, the continuous disruption of architectural integrity prevents down-modulation of the receptor activity with dire consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muthuswamy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Converse examples also occur: ligands that are inhibitory must be kept segregated from their receptors in order for the target tissue-specific gene to be expressed, as we showed several years ago for whey acidic protein, another milk protein gene, and its inhibitor TGF-&#x003b1;. Unlike &#x003b2;-casein, whey acidic protein is not expressed even in cells treated with lrECM in 3D cultures until all the cells form complete acini with tight junctions, allowing separation of TGF-&#x003b1; from its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Bissell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>We show here that whereas physical changes in 3D cultures, such as cell rounding and clustering, lead to exposure of PrlR allowing binding to its ligand and induction of a transient STAT5 activation, milk protein genes are expressed only when laminin-111 is present to allow the sustained activation of STAT5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Introduction of constitutively activated STAT5A/B induces gene expression in the absence of laminin-111 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>), suggesting that sustained STAT5 activation is the key to induce and maintain mammary-specific function. In normal mammary gland, laminin-111 would be present in the BM around the acini at all times from puberty to lactation. What fluctuates is Prl, which is highly expressed and secreted into the interstitium and blood supply during late-pregnancy and lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Jonathan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goffin et al., 2002</xref>) and would have access to the basolaterally localized PrlR.</p><p>It is well established that BM integrity is necessary for tissue homeostasis and function. At involution, BM is degraded by a dramatic increase of MMPs, with concomitant loss of tissue inhibitors of MMPs and subsequent reduction in &#x003b2;-casein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Talhouk et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1992</xref>). Inhibition of MMPs in the involuting gland delays BM degradation and maintains milk protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Talhouk et al., 1992</xref>). Conversely, when BM is degraded by targeted expression of MMP3, milk proteins are no longer produced even during lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sympson et al., 1994</xref>). Our results here suggest that BM integrity is crucial for the duration of transcription factor activation, and this novel regulatory phenomenon is critical to maintaining tissue homeostasis during lactation.</p><p>Why would tissue-specific functions require sustained activation of transcription factors? ChIP analysis and photobleaching techniques have demonstrated that transcription factors on target promoters are exchanged rapidly, inducing dynamic and cyclical histone acetylation and RNA polymerase II recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McNally et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Metivier et al., 2003</xref>). STAT5 cooperates with other transcription factors to induce chromatin remodeling and activate Prl-induced transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kabotyanski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Here our ChIP data show that histone acetylation in the &#x003b2;-casein promoter depends on the sustained activation of STAT5. Therefore, it is most likely that sustained activation of transcription factors is the key to maintaining the dynamic interplay of ECM and chromatin organization necessary for gene expression.</p><p>Whereas transient STAT5 activation is not sufficient to permit casein expression, our preliminary data show that blocking transient activation partially inhibited transcription of &#x003b2;-casein gene (Fig. S3, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807021/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807021/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that the transient activation may contribute in some fashion to expression of mammary-specific genes. Indirect evidence also suggests that the transient activation of STAT5 may play a role in mammary gland development because Prl is released transiently in the form of two daily surges early in pregnancy and during estrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freeman et al., 1974</xref>). It has been reported that transient Prl secretion induces STAT5A activation during estrus, which parallels a small amount of milk production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, knocking out JAK2 in mammary gland impairs development of alveolar precursors in virgin mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>), implicating that STAT5 activation during estrus may be involved in mammary gland morphogenesis. However, none of these studies addressed how long the STAT5 activation persists at early pregnancy and estrus cycles. Therefore, the function of transient STAT5 activation, if indeed it may occur during mammary gland development in vivo, still needs further clarification.</p><p>The cooperative action between integrin- and growth factor&#x02013;dependent signals regulates a variety of biological processes, such as cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwartz and Baron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamada and Even-Ram, 2002</xref>). We have shown previously that the cross-modulation of &#x003b2;1-integrin and EGF receptor signaling regulates acinar morphogenesis through the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weaver et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). The cross talk between integrins and lactogenic hormone receptors is required for the activation of tissue-specific function in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Streuli et al., 1995b</xref>). Deletion of &#x003b2;1 integrins impairs STAT5 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in epithelial cells during lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Naylor et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that &#x003b2;1-integrin, which is important for laminin-111 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Streuli et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muschler et al., 1999</xref>), cooperates with PrlR to induce the biochemical signals necessary for sustained STAT5 activation. We find that phosphoinositide 3-kinase localization and activity is also regulated by laminin-111 signaling (unpublished data). Blocking phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibits Rac1 activation, sustained STAT5 phosphorylation, and milk protein expression (unpublished data). Rac1 has been demonstrated as a downstream target of &#x003b2;1-integrin to induce rapid (15 min) STAT5 phosphorylation in cells cultured on lrECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Streuli, 2006</xref>). However, laminin signaling is not required for transient STAT5 activation, suggesting that transient activation either does not depend on &#x003b2;1-integrin or that its involvement in this process is also transient.</p><p>An important further finding here is that one of the laminin-111 receptors, DG, is a mediator in sustained STAT5 activation and induction of milk protein expression. Deletion of DG in mammary epithelial cells inhibits laminin-regulated polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weir et al., 2006</xref>), STAT5 activation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>), and casein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weir et al., 2006</xref>). Deleting its cytoplasmic domain has no effect on polarization or casein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weir et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the casein expression data, we found that the cytoplasmic domain of DG was not required for the sustained STAT5 activation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>). Therefore, the binding of laminin-111 to DG does not appear to induce the canonical &#x0201c;outside-in signaling&#x0201d; directly; rather, DG assists in assembling laminin-111 into the BM around the acini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weir et al., 2006</xref>), allowing further canonical signaling by laminin to integrin, which regulates sustained STAT5 activation.</p><p>These results provide an important link between ECM-dependent signaling, transcription factor activation, and chromatin organization.
