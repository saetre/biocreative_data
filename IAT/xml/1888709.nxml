Increasing evidence correlates alterations in the TK system with urinary tract diseases such as neurogenic bladders, outflow obstruction, idiopathic detrusor instability, and interstitial cystitis. However, despite promising effects in animal models, there seems to be no published clinical study showing that NK-receptor antagonists are an effective treatment of pain in general or urinary tract disorders, such as detrusor overactivity. In order to search for therapeutic targets that could block the tachykinin system, we set forth to determine the regulatory network downstream of NK<sub>1 </sub>receptor activation. First, NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent transcripts were determined and used to query known databases for their respective transcription regulatory elements (TREs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>An expression analysis was performed using urinary bladders isolated from sensitized wild type (WT) and NK<sub>1</sub>R<sup>-/- </sup>mice that were stimulated with saline, LPS, or antigen to provoke inflammation. Based on cDNA array results, NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent genes were selected. PAINT software was used to query TRANSFAC database and to retrieve upstream TREs that were confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The regulatory network of TREs driving NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent genes presented cRel in a central position driving 22% of all genes, followed by AP-1, NF-kappaB, v-Myb, CRE-BP1/c-Jun, USF, Pax-6, Efr-1, Egr-3, and AREB6. A comparison between NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent and NK<sub>1</sub>R-independent genes revealed Nkx-2.5 as a unique discriminator. In the presence of NK<sub>1</sub>R, Nkx2-5 _01 was significantly correlated with 36 transcripts which included several candidates for mediating bladder development (FGF) and inflammation (PAR-3, IL-1R, IL-6, &#x003b1;-NGF, TSP2). In the absence of NK<sub>1</sub>R, the matrix Nkx2-5_02 had a predominant participation driving 8 transcripts, which includes those involved in cancer (EYA1, Trail, HSF1, and ELK-1), smooth-to-skeletal muscle trans-differentiation, and Z01, a tight-junction protein, expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that, in the mouse urinary bladder, activation of NK<sub>1</sub>R by substance P (SP) induces both NKx-2.5 and NF-kappaB translocations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first report describing a role for Nkx2.5 in the urinary tract. As Nkx2.5 is the unique discriminator of NK1R-modulated inflammation, it can be imagined that in the near future, new based therapies selective for controlling Nkx2.5 activity in the urinary tract may be used in the treatment in a number of bladder disorders.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Substance P belongs to the tachykinins (TKs) family of peptides involved in the peripheral and central regulation of urinary functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] through the stimulation of neurokinin (NK) NK<sub>1</sub>, NK<sub>2</sub>, and NK<sub>3 </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. At the urinary system level, TKs stimulate smooth muscle tone, ureteric peristalsis and bladder contractions, initiate neurogenic inflammation, and trigger local and spinal reflexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] aimed to maintain organ functions in emergency conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The most studied effects produced by TKs in these systems are smooth muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], modulation of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], mucus secretion, and recruitment/activation of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. At least in the mouse bladder, TKs are spontaneously released and their levels maintained low by the activity of neutral-endopeptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Indeed, null deletion of NEP in mice leads to spontaneous plasma extravasation in the urinary bladder that was reversed by a recombinant of NK<sub>1 </sub>and bradykinin B<sub>2 </sub>receptors antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the urinary tract, the major recognized sources of TKs are the primary afferent neurons expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptors, which have the unique property of releasing transmitters both in the periphery (efferent function) and the spinal cord (afferent function) upon stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>NK<sub>1</sub>R are the predominant subtype involved in inflammation in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and may underlie persistent pain, such as that observed during chronic bladder inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. SP activation of NK<sub>1</sub>R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] induces a sequential activation of signaling pathways leading to the production of pro-inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) that plays a major role in bladder inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The use of NK<sub>1</sub>R<sup>-/- </sup>mice confirmed a central role for SP in models of bladder inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Indeed, NK<sub>1</sub>R<sup>-/- </sup>mice do not mount bladder inflammatory response to antigen-complex stimulation and that NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are required in cystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this context, an up-regulation of NK<sub>1</sub>R was found in bladder inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and bladder biopsies from cystitis patients present an increase in NK<sub>1</sub>R density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and SP-containing fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the finding that sensory C fibers desensitization decreases urinary bladder hyperreflexia further supports a role for sensory peptides in this disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In fact, NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists reduce detrusor hyperreflexia caused by chemical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and bacterial cystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and decrease cyclophosphamide-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition, changes in SP expression following cystitis may contribute to the altered visceral sensation (allodynia) and/or urinary bladder hyperreflexia in the clinical syndrome, interstitial cystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The bulk of data obtained in experimental animal models suggests that TKs could contribute to the genesis of symptoms accompanying various diseases of the urinary tract, which includes cystitis and incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Indeed, a significant increase in the density of suburothelial, SP-containing nerves was found in patients with idiopathic detrusor overactivity, compared with stable controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that peripheral tachykinins may be involved in pathophysiologic afferent signaling associated with detrusor overactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, despite promising effects in animal models, there seems to be no published clinical study showing that NK-receptor antagonists are an effective treatment of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or overactive bladder disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, despite the known existence of NK<sub>2 </sub>receptors in the human detrusor, NK<sub>2 </sub>receptor antagonist does not block the non-cholinergic contraction in unstable human bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, in order to search for putative therapeutic targets that could be manipulated to reduce the influence of the tachykinin system, we set forth to determine the regulatory network downstream of NK<sub>1</sub>R activation. This network is composed of genes and the transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs) that are putative binding sites for the transcription factors. In this way, we could define not only genes downstream of NK<sub>1</sub>R activation but also the regulators of their expression. This is based on the fact that when active transcription factors associate with TREs of their target genes, they can function to specifically repress (down-regulate) or induce (up-regulate) synthesis of the corresponding RNA. The overall hypothesis is that genes sharing the same TREs can be associated in a molecular network that would represent key pharmacological targets for modulating the influence of tachykinins in bladder diseases.</p><p>For this purpose, we used a combination of cDNA array and in silico analysis of TREs, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. cDNA array analysis defined the interactome of NK<sub>1</sub>-dependent genes by querying a web-based entry tool developed by Ingenuity Systems Inc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Next, we uploaded the sequence of NK<sub>1</sub>-dependent genes into PAINT software and the respective TREs were identified using MATCH<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>tool in the TRANSFAC Professional database. Genes and TREs were assembled in regulatory networks and selected TREs were confirmed by EMSA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experimentation described here was performed in conformity with the "Guiding Principles for Research Involving Animals and Human Beings (OUHSC Animal Care &#x00026; Use Committee protocol #00-109 and #00-108). Groups of ten to twelve-week old female mice were used in these experiments. NK<sub>1</sub>R<sup>-/- </sup>and wild type (WT, C57BL6) littermate control mice were generated by Dr. Norma P. Gerard. The colonies at OUHSC were genotyped as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Antigen sensitization protocol</title><p>All mice in this study were sensitized with 1 &#x003bc;g DNP<sub>4</sub>-human serum albumin (HSA) in 1 mg alum on days 0, 7, 14, and 21, intraperitoneally (i.p.). In normal mice, this protocol induces sustained levels of IgE antibodies up to 56 days post-sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. One week after the last sensitization, cystitis was induced. Briefly, sensitized WT and NK<sub>1</sub>R<sup>-/- </sup>mice were anesthetized (ketamine 40 mg/kg and xylazine 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), then transurethrally catheterized (24 Ga.; 3/4 in; Angiocath, Becton Dickson, Sandy, Utah), and the urine was drained by applying slight digital pressure to the lower abdomen. The urinary bladders were instilled with 200 &#x003bc;l of pyrogen-free saline or DNP<sub>4</sub>-OVA (1 &#x003bc;g/ml). One, four, and twenty-four hours after instillation, mice were sacrificed with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and bladders were removed rapidly.</p></sec><sec><title>Alterations at histological level</title><p>Previous results from our laboratory demonstrated a mandatory role of NK<sub>1</sub>R on antigen-induced cystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In the present work, we also investigated whether NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are important for both SP- and LPS-induced cystitis. For this purpose, an additional group of NK<sub>1</sub>R<sup>-/- </sup>and wild type (WT, C57BL6) were anesthetized as described above and challenged intravesically with 200 &#x003bc;l of pyrogen-free saline, SP (10 &#x003bc;M), or Escherichia coli LPS strain 055:B5 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 100 &#x003bc;g/ml). Twenty-four hours after instillation, mice were euthanized with pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, i.p.), and the bladders were removed rapidly for evaluation of inflammatory cell infiltrates and the presence of interstitial edema. A semi-quantitative score using defined criteria of inflammation severity was used to evaluate cystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A cross-section of bladder wall was fixed in formalin, dehydrated in graded alcohol and xylene, embedded in paraffin, and cut serially into four 5-&#x003bc;m sections (8 &#x003bc;m apart) to be stained with hematoxylinand eosin (H&#x00026;E) and Giemsa. H&#x00026;E stained sections were visualized under microscope (Eclipse E600, Nikon, Lewisville, TX). All tissues were photographed at room temperature by a digital camera (DXM1200; Nikon). Exposure times were held constant when acquiring images from different groups. Images were analyzed with Image-Pro Analyzer<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Media Cybernetics Inc.; Silver Spring, MD 20910). The severity of lesions in the urinary bladder was graded as follows: 1+, mild (infiltration of 0&#x02013;10 neutrophils/cross-section in the lamina propria, and little or no interstitial edema); 2+, moderate(infiltration of 10&#x02013;20 neutrophils/cross-section in the lamina propria, and moderate interstitial edema); 3+, severe (diffuse infiltration of &#x0003e;20 neutrophils/cross-section in the lamina propria and severe interstitial edema) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Sample preparation for cDNA expression arrays</title><p>Three bladders from each group were homogenized together in Ultraspec RNA solution (Biotecx Laboratories Inc. Houston, TX) for isolation and purification of total RNA. Mouse bladders were pooled to ensure enough RNA for gene array analysis. The justification for this approach is that there is not enough RNA in a single mouse bladder for performing cDNA array experiments, and the step of purification reduces the amount of total RNA.

PAINT 3.3 was employed to examine 2000 base pairs of regulatory regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of each differentially expressed gene detected with the microarray. PAINT is a suite of bioinformatics and computational tools that integrate functional genomics information, as is the case of our microarray-based gene expression data, with genomic sequence and TRE data to derive hypotheses on the TREs relevant to the biological function under study.</p><p>Genbank accession numbers were used as the gene identifiers in PAINT test files.

Employing the microarray accounts for any 'bias' present in the genes on the microarray relative to entire genome, nd guards from incorrectly concluding that certain TREs are relevant to the current experiment. The TRE hypotheses were generated from statistical enrichment analysis and were defined as those TREs that are significantly enriched such as NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent and -independent genes, over random occurrence in the gene groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)</title><p>Anesthetized C57BL6 female mice were instilled with 200 &#x003bc;l of saline or SP (10 &#x003bc;M) and bladders were removed 2, 6, and 24 hours after instillation.

In the present work we also investigated whether NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are important for both SP- and LPS-induced cystitis.

In contrast, the urinary bladders of NK<sub>1</sub>R-knockout mice failed to mount an inflammatory response to LPS (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) despite the capacity of LPS to induce urothelial cell injury, as indicated by intra-cytoplasmatic vacuolization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>; black circles).

The enrichment in this case was obtained by using the interaction matrix for the combined gene list as a reference. This enabled us to contrast the two gene groups relative to each other and characterize those regulatory elements that are specific to one group or the other. We observed differential enrichment of several regulatory elements including over-expression of AP1 specific in the NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent genes, as we previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).

Indeed, the major question being answered by this work is what TREs can be therapeutically targeted for reducing the influence of tachykinins in bladder disorders? The method introduced here, supplements the standard procedure of multiple paired comparisons used in microarray analysis by associating the expression level of each gene in the experimental group with a family transcription regulatory elements[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and to compare with the occurrence of each TRE in a reference file (all genes in the array). This bottom-up approach builds mechanistic models for each individual case, e.g., identifying the binding sites for selected genes and their respective TREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], then specifies the role of each TRE in the network generating a testable hypothesis for the network downstream of NK<sub>1</sub>R activation. Next, we used EMSA to confirm that selected TREs (NF-kappaB and NKx-2.5) are indeed part of the molecular network downstream of NK<sub>1</sub>R activation.</p><p>An extended family of TREs was significantly correlated with NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent genes. Those included c-Rel, NF-kappaB_Q6, PAX-6, CREB_01, CRE-BP1/c-Jun, and v-Myb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, most of the studies on transcription regulatory elements in urology are related to oncology, which makes it difficult to further illustrate the clinical relevance of our findings. Therefore, we are discussing only the most relevant TREs that modulate bladder inflammatory responses to SP.</p><p>AP1 was among the NK1R-dependent TREs. We have provided evidence for a predominant role for AP1 controlling highly expressed NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In the present work, we confirmed the regulatory relationships between AP1 (AP1_Q2 and AP1_C) and NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent genes. It is known that the activation of MAPK (JNK, p38) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways leads to the activation of AP-1 and, consequently, the inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The present results extend these findings to the urinary bladder where these pathways can be explored as potential therapeutic targets to decrease the symptoms of cystitis.</p><p>NF-kappaB is believed to trigger both the onset and the resolution of inflammation. NF-kappaB activity is correlated with bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and bladder urothelial cells respond to insults with a translocation of NF-kappaB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] leading ultimately to an increased NK<sub>1</sub>R expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Our present work confirms previous indication that Tachykinins, such as SP, activate NF-kappaB translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Indeed, in the urinary bladder, activation of NK<sub>1</sub>R by SP induces NF-kappaB translocation, as seen by EMSA results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, such as the encoding prostaglandin I<sub>2 </sub>receptor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Another TRE over-expressed in the NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent cluster was the upstream stimulatory factor (USF). Although widely expressed, USF can mediate tissue-specific transcripts. USF is stimulated by glucose in murine mesangial cells, binds to TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter, contributes to TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression, and may play a role in diabetes-related gene regulation in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>However, the most impressive switch between NK<sub>1</sub>R-dependent and independent transcripts was the one observed with two different matrixes of Nkx-2.5 (_01 and _02). Both Nkx-2.5_01 and _02 are binding sites derived from mouse sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Nkx-2.5 is a murine homeobox named tinman homeodomain factor and is considered to be a new member of the sub-family of homeobox genes related to the Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Nkx-2.5 is proposed as a valuable marker in the analysis of mesoderm development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. It was first described as an essential transcription factor for normal heart morphogenesis, myogenesis, and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. However, more recently it was shown that Nkx-2.5 is required for the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] and, along with NF-kappaB, is part of the brain natriuretic peptide promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Outside of the heart, this element is important in vessel remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], skeletal myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and pyloric sphincter development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Other sites of Nkx-2.5 expression include pharyngeal endoderm and its derivatives, branchial arch epithelium, stomach, spleen, pancreas and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a role for Nkx-2.5 in the urinary tract. In the presence of NK<sub>1</sub>R, Nkx-2.5 _01 was significantly correlated with 36 transcripts which included several candidates for mediating bladder development (FGF) and inflammation (PAR-3, IL-1R, IL-6, NGF, TSP2) (Table 3, [additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]). In the absence of NK<sub>1</sub>R, the matrix _02 had a predominant participation driving 8 transcripts, which includes those involved in cancer (EYA1, Trail, HSF, and ELK-1), smooth-to-skeletal muscle trans-differentiation, and Z01, a tight-junction protein, expression (Table 3, [additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]).</p><p>An interesting finding was the constitutive translocation of NKx-2.5 and NF-kappaB in the bladder mucosa. One possible explanation was that mechanical stimulation caused by instillation of saline caused the shift. Therefore, an additional control group was added in which the bladder was removed without instillation. This group (0 hours) also presented a certain amount of shifted NKx-2.5 and NF-kappaB probes. An alternative explanation for these results is that mechanical isolation of the bladder mucosa caused the translocation of both transcription factors. We, therefore, generated preliminary results using an urothelial cell line (J82) which indicated a constitutive activation of both NF-kappaB and NKx-2.5 in the absence of overt stimulation (data not shown). Therefore, we suggest that the bladder mucosa/urothelium might present a constitutive activation of both transcription factors. The similarity of basal translocation of NKx-2.5 and NF-kappaB translocation in the urinary bladder may be related to an overlap of binding motifs in some genes. Indeed, others have shown an overlap of conserved DNA binding motifs including AP-1 sites, NF-kappaB, GATA, and Nkx-2.5 in promoter regions of genes, such as MMP13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work indicates an overriding participation of NK<sub>1</sub>R in bladder inflammation, provides a working model for the involvement of transcription regulators such as NF-kappaB, and Nkx-2.5, and evokes testable hypotheses regarding a role for tachykinins in the urinary tract pathology.
