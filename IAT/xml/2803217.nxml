So far, only AtPMT5 [formerly named AtPLT5 (At3g18830)] has been characterized and was shown to be a plasma membrane-localized H<sup>+</sup>-symporter with broad substrate specificity. The characterization of AtPMT1 (At2g16120) and AtPMT2 (At2g16130), two other, almost identical, members of this transporter subfamily, are presented here. Expression of the <italic>AtPMT1</italic> and <italic>AtPMT2</italic> cDNAs in baker's yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) revealed that these proteins catalyse the energy-dependent, high-capacity transport of fructose and xylitol, and the transport of several other compounds with lower rates. Expression of their cRNAs in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes showed that both proteins are voltage-dependent and catalyse the symport of their substrates with protons. Fusions of AtPMT1 or AtPMT2 with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) localized to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plasma membranes. Analyses of reporter genes performed with <italic>AtPMT1</italic> or <italic>AtPMT2</italic> promoter sequences showed expression in mature (<italic>AtPMT2</italic>) or germinating (<italic>AtPMT1</italic>) pollen grains, as well as in growing pollen tubes, hydathodes, and young xylem cells (both genes). The expression was confirmed with an anti-AtPMT1/AtPMT2 antiserum (&#x003b1;AtPMT1/2) raised against peptides conserved in AtPMT1 and AtPMT2. The physiological roles of the proteins are discussed and related to plant cell wall modifications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AtPLT</kwd><kwd>AtPMT</kwd><kwd>fructose</kwd><kwd>monosaccharide transport</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>polyol transport</kwd><kwd>xylem</kwd><kwd>xylitol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2001, the first higher plant polyol transporter was characterized from <italic>Apium graveolens</italic> (celery; AgMAT1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noiraud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and it was suggested that this transporter is involved in the loading of mannitol into the phloem of this polyol translocating plant (family Apiaceae). In the following years, additional polyol transporters were cloned and characterized from species of other plant families known to represent sorbitol or mannitol-translocating plants, such as <italic>Prunus cerasus</italic> (sour cherry, <italic>PsSOT1</italic> and <italic>PsSOT2</italic>; Rosaceae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), <italic>Plantago major</italic> (common plantain; <italic>PmPLT1</italic> and <italic>PmPLT2</italic>; Plantaginaceae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramsperger-Gleixner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), <italic>Malus domestica</italic> (apple; <italic>MdSOT3</italic>&#x02013;<italic>MdSOT5</italic>; Rosaceae; Watari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004), <italic>Olea europaea</italic> (olive, <italic>OeMAT1</italic>; Oleaceae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and again from celery (<italic>AgMAT2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juchaux-Cachau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). All of these transporters were shown or discussed to be responsible for the loading of the acyclic polyols sorbitol or mannitol into the phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noiraud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramsperger-Gleixner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) or for the transfer of these compounds from the phloem to different sinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juchaux-Cachau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Immunohistochemical analyses performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramsperger-Gleixner <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> localized PmPLT1 and PmPLT2 to the companion cells of the <italic>Plantago</italic> phloem, the cell type mediating phloem loading with the disaccharide sucrose in most species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stadler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stadler and Sauer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Moreover, these authors demonstrated that <italic>PmPLT1</italic> and <italic>PmPLT2</italic> expression was confined to mature companion cells, whereas the gene of the sucrose transporter, <italic>PmSUC2</italic>, was already expressed in young companion cells. This observation fitted in with earlier data showing that the onset of sucrose export or mannitol export from celery source leaves is differentially regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). A quite different cell-specificity was published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juchaux-Cachau <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> for the celery AgMAT2 protein, which was identified in all phloem cell types of celery leaf petioles, i.e. in companion cells, sieve elements, and phloem parenchyma cells. This localization was interpreted as being related to the complex sugar fluxes in an organ involved in both mannitol accumulation and in mannitol transfer from source to sink.</p><p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinders <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> published the characterization of the first polyol transporter from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a different physiological role was expected for this protein, as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> translocates sucrose and minor amounts of raffinose but no polyols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haritatos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, highly variable and often strong expression of <italic>AtPLT5</italic> was observed in the leaf vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), but due to the lack of phenotypic differences between <italic>AtPLT5</italic> wild-type plants (WT) and an <italic>Atplt5</italic> T-DNA insertion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) the physiological role of this transporter is still elusive and will need further investigation. After these first publications on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> polyol transporters in 2005, it was found that, in 2004, the abbreviation <italic>PLT</italic> had already been used for the <italic>PLETHORA1</italic> (<italic>PLT1</italic>) and <italic>PLETHORA2</italic> (<italic>PLT2</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). To avoid confusion, the <italic>Arabidopsis POLYOL TRANSPORTER</italic> (<italic>PLT</italic>) gene family has been renamed as <italic>POLYOL/MONOSACCHARIDE TRANSPORTER</italic> (<italic>PMT</italic>). The abbreviations <italic>AtPMT1</italic> to <italic>AtPMT6</italic> will, therefore, be used in the rest of this publication.</p><p>Functional analyses characterized AtPMT5 as a low-specificity H<sup>+</sup>-symporter that mediates the energy-dependent uptake of hexoses, pentoses, linear polyols of various chain lengths (3&#x02013;6 carbons), and of inositol across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In fact, detailed analyses of all functional data on plant polyol transporters revealed that the related proteins of the above-mentioned sorbitol or mannitol translocating species have similarly low substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noiraud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; Watari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juchaux-Cachau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, based on their predicted roles in the long-distance transport of these compounds these proteins could be characterized as sorbitol or mannitol transporters.</p><p>To identify the physiologically relevant substrate(s) of AtPMT5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinders <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> used the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> expression system to compare the proton currents associated with a large number of potential substrates. By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> performed competition analyses in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (baker's yeast). In both analyses AtPMT5 was found to transport sorbitol and glucose with similar rates and comparable <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>-values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, it seems quite unlikely that sorbitol or glucose represent physiological substrates of AtPMT5 for the following reasons: (i) noteworthy concentrations of sorbitol have never been reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and (ii) glucose is likely to be transported by one of the 14 members of the much more specific, plasma membrane-localized hexose transporters of the AtSTP subfamily. The latter are found in most <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells and tissues and have 50&#x02013;100-fold lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>-values for glucose than AtPMT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">B&#x000fc;ttner and Sauer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">B&#x000fc;ttner, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The situation is similar for inositol, another molecule transported by AtPMT5 in both heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). <italic>In planta</italic>, highly specific inositol transporters have been identified (AtINT2 and AtINT4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>) that might catalyse the uptake of inositol more efficiently than AtPMT5. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, despite a very intense characterization of the AtPMT5 transporter, the physiology of PMT-type proteins is much more complex in non-polyol-translocating species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> than in sorbitol- and mannitol-translocating plants.</p><p>The characterization of two new members of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtPMT family is reported here. AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 share 93.6% identity on the amino acid level, are encoded by neighbouring genes that run in opposite directions on chromosome 2, and reporter gene analyses performed with the <italic>AtPMT1</italic> and <italic>AtPMT2</italic> promoters showed (i) that both genes are expressed and (ii) that they have quite similar and largely overlapping expression patterns. Functional characterizations of the proteins encoded by the individual cDNAs in bakers&#x02019; yeast or of cRNAs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were performed. Thereby, the substrate specificities and the energy dependence of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2-driven transport were characterized, and the symported ion was identified. The subcellular localization of the proteins was studied with AtPMT1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) and AtPMT2-GFP fusions. Finally, an <italic>Atpmt1</italic> T-DNA insertion line and an RNAi-line were characterized. The data presented suggest that, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 might represent xylitol and fructose transporters in pollen and young xylem.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants (Col-0 and SALK_035269) were grown in growth chambers on potting soil under a 16/8 h light/dark regime at 22 &#x000b0;C and 60% relative humidity or in the greenhouse under ambient conditions.

These peptides corresponded to the regions 223&#x02013;238 (central cytoplasmatic loop) and 491&#x02013;507 (<italic>C</italic>-terminus) of AtPMT1. The respective regions of AtPMT2 are either identical (peptide 1) or very similar (peptide 2: NH2-YSANKKNNVMSKGKQV-COOH), and resulting antibodies were, therefore, not expected to discriminate between these proteins.

AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 belong to one of seven subfamilies of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MST-like superfamily. PMT-type proteins are found in all higher plants. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PMT subfamily has six members, of which only one, AtPMT5, has been characterized to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). All other PMT-type proteins were characterized mainly from polyol-translocating species, and the respective proteins were characterized as sorbitol or mannitol transporters. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the transmembrane transport of sorbitol and mannitol plays no or only a minor role, and the physiology of AtPMT proteins thus remained unclear. A detailed functional characterization of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 proteins after expression of their cDNAs in baker's yeast and <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes is presented here. The proteins were characterized as voltage-dependent, plasma membrane-localized H<sup>+</sup>-symporters for polyols, cyclitols, and monosaccharides with a clear preference for xylitol and fructose. Promoter/reporter gene analyses and immunolocalization studies demonstrate that these AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 transport activities occur in mature or germinating pollen grains and in young xylem cells.</p><p>Interestingly, in heterologous expression systems both proteins also transport sorbitol with <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>-values quite similar to those of SOT proteins from sorbitol-translocating species. This demonstrates that PMT-type transporters from polyol-translocating species and from non-polyol-translocating species have almost identical functional properties. Moreover, this suggests that polyol-translocating species are very likely to have PMT-type proteins with physiological functions similar to those of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PMT proteins, i.e. PMT-type proteins that are not involved in phloem translocation.</p><sec><title>AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 are plasma membrane-localized transporters for xylitol and fructose</title><p>AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 were functionally characterized as electrogenic H<sup>+</sup>-symporters by expression of their cDNAs or cRNAs in baker's yeast or <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figs 2, 3, 4</xref>).

In contrast, the list of substrates symported by AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 is complex. It contains structurally quite different molecules, such as linear polyols with 4 (erythriol), 5 (xylitol), or 6 (sorbitol) carbon atoms, the cyclic hexitol inositol, plus pentoses (ribose, arabinose, xylose) and hexoses (fructose, glucose, mannose; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A&#x02013;C</xref>). One may speculate that this spectrum does not reflect the list of physiological substrates that are transported by AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 <italic>in planta</italic>. Aldohexoses and inositols, for example, might be taken up by the aldohexose-specific and inositol-specific AtSTP and AtINT proteins that, in addition, have higher affinities for their substrates, and that are present in the plasma membranes of the very same cells as AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scholz-Starke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneidereit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>).</p><p>This leaves polyols, pentoses, and the ketohexose fructose as potential physiological substrates. In fact, competition analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) revealed that xylitol, fructose, and pentoses are the best competitors of sorbitol uptake. Direct transport analyses with radiolabelled substrates revealed that, at substrate concentrations of 0.1 mM, xylitol transport is about 5-fold (AtPMT1) or 9-fold (AtPMT2) faster than the transport of xylose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>, C). In agreement with the very good competition data, fructose seems to represent the second best substrate for both carriers. Interestingly, a comparison of this result with competition data published for the celery AgMAT2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juchaux-Cachau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) shows that uptake of radiolabelled mannitol by AgMAT2 is also inhibited significantly by fructose and xylitol than by unlabelled mannitol, suggesting that xylitol and fructose might be better substrates for this protein.</p><p>Finally, <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> measurements yielded quite similar values of 0.14 mM (AtPMT1) and 0.18 mM (AtPMT2) for xylitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). These are the lowest <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values found for a PMT-type transporter so far. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for sorbitol or mannitol in most SOT and MAT proteins from polyol translocating species are between 0.65 mM (AgMAT2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juchaux-Cachau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and 3 mM (MdSOT5; Watari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004), and in <italic>Plantago</italic>, PmPLT1 and PmPLT2 proteins have even higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for sorbitol (12 and 20 mM, respectively). Interestingly, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for sorbitol determined for AtPMT1 (0.77 mM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) or AtPMT5 [0.5 mM in yeast; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klepek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; 0.86&#x02013;2.6 mM (voltage-dependent) in <italic>Xenopus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>] are in the same range as those of the related proteins from polyol translocating plants.</p><p>In summary, these data demonstrate that PMT-type proteins from polyol-translocating species (MATs, SOTs, PLTs) and from non-polyol translocating species do not just share sequence homologies, but also functional properties: (i) All of these proteins accept a wide range of substrates, (ii) their <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for the phloem-translocated hexitols mannitol and sorbitol are similar, and (iii) compounds other than mannitol or sorbitol might be even better transport substrates.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>AtPMT1</italic> and <italic>AtPMT2</italic> are expressed in pollen, hydathodes, and in young xylem cells</title><p>Expression analyses of plants transformed with p<italic>AtPMT1</italic>/reporter or p<italic>AtPMT2</italic>/reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) revealed promoter activities in pollen, hydathodes and, in rare cases, also in young xylem cells, immediately adjacent to the cambium.

No activity of p<italic>AtPMT1</italic> was detected in anthers at any developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). By contrast, <italic>AtPMT1</italic> expression was observed in germinating pollen grains and in pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>, C). Moreover, both <italic>AtPMT1</italic> (not shown) and <italic>AtPMT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7D</xref>) are expressed in hydathodes, and for both genes one plant was found with GUS activity in young xylem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figs 6D&#x02013;F, 7E</xref>). Most importantly, this expression in the xylem which found only for one p<italic>AtPMT1</italic>-<italic>GUS</italic> line and only for one p<italic>AtPMT2</italic>-<italic>GUS</italic> line could be confirmed in immunohistochemical analyses with the &#x003b1;AtPMT1/2-R1 antiserum that specifically recognizes AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), and that decorates AtPMT1 and/or AtPMT2 in the young xylem cells of the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). The reason for the low frequency of plants with GUS-staining in the xylem is unclear. The strong signals obtained with &#x003b1;AtPMT1/2-R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>) suggest high expression levels in these cells. Possibly strong promoter activities cause xylem-specific silencing in the majority of the GUS reporter lines.</p></sec><sec><title>The physiological roles of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2</title><p>What are the physiological roles of the H<sup>+</sup>/xylitol or H<sup>+</sup>/fructose symporters AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> pollen/pollen tubes and young xylem cells? Both cells and tissues are rapidly expanding, non-green sinks and depend on the supply with organic carbon to drive their metabolism and energy supply. A first possible function of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 might, of course, be the retrieval of molecules lost from certain cells by passive diffusion. Developing xylem cells are important sites of cell wall biosynthesis, and cellulose, lignin, and glucuronoxylans are the main components of their secondary cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pena <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, in plants, the xylose residues necessary for biosynthesis of xylose-containing cell wall oligosaccharides are synthesized by nucleotide sugar interconversion as UDP-xylose by decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harper and Bar-Peled, 2002</xref>) and immediately transferred to the different acceptor molecules via xylosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolwell, 2000</xref>). Similarly, UDP-arabinose is synthesized from UDP-xylose by an epimerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burget <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Thus, the amount of free pentoses that might leak out of developing xylem cells or out of pollen grains is most likely small, and high cellular concentrations of xylitol have never been reported for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>A second function of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 might be the feeding of cells with fructose. It is well known that germinating pollen and growing pollen tubes hydrolyse extracellular sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ylstra <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), that this hydrolysis is mediated by an extracellular invertase, and that a loss of this invertase can impair pollen development and may even cause male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goetz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Similarly, from several invertase genes identified in poplar (<italic>Populus alba</italic> L.&#x000d7;<italic>grandidentata</italic> Michx.), one, <italic>PaxgINV2</italic>, appears to encode an enzyme that is involved in phloem unloading and in providing developing xylem cells with energy and carbon skeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). So far, several pollen-specific monosaccharide transporters that might be responsible for the uptake of these products of sucrose hydrolysis have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ylstra <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneidereit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scholz-Starke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, these transporters are rather specific for aldohexoses (including glucose), whereas the ketohexose fructose is not a substrate or only a poor substrate for these transporters. A function of PMT-type proteins in rapidly growing tissues like pollen, pollen tubes or young xylem cells might, therefore, be the uptake of fructose produced by extracellular invertases and not transported by classical STP-type monosaccharide transporters.</p></sec><sec><title>Functions of PMT-type proteins in polyol-translocating species</title><p>The finding that the physiological substrate of AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 might be fructose and, to a lesser extent, possibly also pentoses, and the observation that AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 can transport sorbitol with <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values similar to those found in SOT proteins, although sorbitol is most probably not their physiological substrate, might be relevant for further analyses of PMT-type transporters in polyol-translocating species.</p><p>Firstly, the fact that all higher plants (also non-polyol-translocating species) do possess PMT-type proteins that can transport mannitol and/or sorbitol and that even the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> has a related protein (accession number: XP_001755457), may provide an insight into the evolution of polyol translocation. When polyol-translocating species evolved, the transporters necessary for phloem loading were probably already available, although their main function might not have been the transport of sorbitol or mannitol. The main challenge might have been to redirect the expression of one of these genes to the phloem companion cells, i.e. to modify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in the promoter. Such an evolution on the promoter level has been demonstrated for C<sub>4</sub>-plants, where the allocation of <italic>cis</italic>-elements led to an altered cell-specificity of genes already available in C<sub>3</sub> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyildiz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, it is quite likely that polyol-translocating species also have to deal with similar transport processes (e.g. with fructose transport) in cells and tissues outside their phloem that are handled by AtPMT proteins like AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Polyol-translocating species will, therefore, (i) either have independent PMT-type proteins for these functions that are not involved in phloem transport, or (ii) their phloem-loading proteins take over these functions and are also expressed in cells or tissues different from the phloem. The identification of a PMT-type protein in a sorbitol-translocating or mannitol-translocating plant will, therefore, not be sufficient to describe the respective protein as SOT or MAT.
