Studies with Dectin-1, a PRR for fungi, have defined a novel innate signaling pathway involving Syk kinase and the adaptor CARD9, which is critical for inducing Th17 responses to fungal infection. We show that another C-type lectin, Dectin-2, also signals via Syk and CARD9, and contributes to dendritic cell (DC) activation by fungal particles. Unlike Dectin-1, Dectin-2 couples to Syk indirectly, through association with the FcR&#x003b3; chain. In a model of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infection, blockade of Dectin-2 did not affect innate immune resistance but abrogated <italic>Candida</italic>-specific T cell production of IL-17 and, in combination with the absence of Dectin-1, decreased Th1 responses to the organism. Thus, Dectin-2 constitutes a major fungal PRR that can couple to the Syk&#x02013;CARD9 innate signaling pathway to activate DCs and regulate adaptive immune responses to fungal infection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The sensing of pathogens by innate immune cells is mediated by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janeway, 1989</xref>). Although some PRRs may be involved primarily in phagocytic clearance of invading organisms, others engage a plethora of signaling pathways that lead to the expression of genes that encode chemokines, cytokines, and other mediators of innate immune responses to infection. In addition, PRR signaling in DCs renders them competent to prime T cells, thereby initiating adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reis e Sousa, 2004</xref>). Established families of PRRs regulating both innate and adaptive immunity include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I&#x02013;like receptors (RLRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Kim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</xref>). However, recent work by us and others has indicated that Dectin-1 and related members of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family may also function as PRRs that can signal to regulate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robinson et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Dectin-1 is expressed primarily by neutrophils, macrophages, and DCs, and recognizes &#x003b2;-glucans present in cell walls of fungi and some bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Gordon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dennehy and Brown, 2007</xref>). The intracellular tail of Dectin-1 contains a single YxxL motif, termed a hemITAM, that is able to recruit and activate Syk upon engagement by agonist ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Underhill et al., 2005</xref>). Dectin-1 coupling to Syk leads to downstream activation of MAPKs, NFAT, and, via the adaptor CARD9, NF-&#x003ba;B, which coordinate the transcription of innate response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodridge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>). In DCs, the pattern of cytokines triggered by selective Dectin-1 engagement is somewhat different from that induced by agonists of TLR, RLR, or NLR pathways, and is typified by robust induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, and IL-23 accompanied by high levels of IL-2 and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with its stimulatory effects on DCs, a Dectin-1 agonist acts as an adjuvant in vivo to induce adaptive immune responses against a coadministered model antigen, resulting in induction of antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as CTL and antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, Dectin-1&#x02013;activated DCs are able to convert regulatory T cells into IL-17 producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio et al., 2008</xref>). In view of its immunomodulatory activities, Dectin-1 is therefore thought to modulate both the innate and adaptive responses to fungal infection. In line with this notion, Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient mice display increased susceptibility to <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Pneumocystis carinii</italic> infection in some models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saijo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Innate immune cells express many receptors that can potentially recognize fungi, including TLR-2, TLR-4, Dectin-2, mannose receptor, DC-SIGN, SIGN-R1, and Mincle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Netea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Willment and Brown, 2008</xref>). Although many of these receptors signal independently of Syk, Syk-deficient DCs fail to produce IL-2 and IL-10 upon stimulation with zymosan, a heat-killed and trypsinized preparation of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2005</xref>). This would be consistent with a dominant role for Dectin-1 in DC responses to fungi, as we have observed in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). However, surprisingly, Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient DCs display only a mild impairment in their ability to produce the same two cytokines in response to zymosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saijo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). Along the same lines, <italic>Card9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice appear to be much more susceptible to infection by <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2008</xref>) than Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saijo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, CARD9-deficient mice fail to mount a <italic>Candida</italic>-specific Th17 response, yet this response is preserved in mice lacking Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, a recent paper suggests that the mannose receptor contributes to human Th17 responses to <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Veerdonk et al., 2009</xref>), although there is as yet no evidence linking that receptor to the Syk&#x02013;CARD9 pathway. Collectively, these different observations imply that Dectin-1 is not the only Syk&#x02013;CARD9&#x02013;coupled fungal PRR in DCs and suggest that multiple receptors capable of activating this signaling pathway could regulate DC-dependent Th17 responses to fungal infection.</p><p>Dectin-2 is a type II transmembrane CLR that was originally cloned from a DC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariizumi et al., 2000a</xref>) but is most abundantly expressed on tissue macrophages and inflammatory monocytes and has specificity for high mannose structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGreal et al., 2006</xref>). Dectin-2 lacks any obvious signaling motif within its short cytoplasmic domain and, despite its name, is only 20&#x02013;25% homologous to Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariizumi et al., 2000a</xref>). Nevertheless, like Dectin-1, Dectin-2 can bind to zymosan and to many fungi, including <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, <italic>Microsporum audouinii</italic>, and <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic>, displaying a preference for the hyphal form over yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGreal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, Dectin-2 can associate with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)&#x02013;bearing FcR&#x003b3; chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrett et al., 2009</xref>), and Dectin-2&#x02013;transfected macrophages respond to hyphal stimulation with protein tyrosine phosphorylation, NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and secretion of TNF and IL-1ra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2006</xref>). Whether this reflects signaling by Dectin-2 or is a consequence of fungal binding allowing engagement of other signaling receptors has not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2006</xref>) but led us to hypothesize that Dectin-2 might substitute for Dectin-1 in activating Syk and CARD9 in DCs in response to fungal presence.</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that Dectin-2, together with Dectin-1, explains most of the Syk- and CARD9-dependence of DC responses to fungal stimuli. We show that triggering of endogenous Dectin-2 in DCs activates Syk and the MAPK cascades, and leads to CARD9- and Syk-dependent cytokine production. Furthermore, by blocking Dectin-2 in vivo, we identify a role for this CLR in the induction of adaptive immune responses, particularly Th17, in a model of systemic <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. These results not only confirm Dectin-2 as a PRR for fungi but also describe it as another Syk-coupled myeloid CLR involved in regulating DC function and the nature of the adaptive immune response to fungal infection.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Induction of IL-2, IL-10, and TNF by fungal stimuli in DCs is dependent on Syk but not on Dectin-1</title><p>In previous studies using DCs stimulated with zymosan, we found that production of IL-10 and IL-2 but not production of IL-12/23 p40 depends on Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2005</xref>). In more recent experiments, we have found that zymosan-induced production of TNF is also Syk dependent and independent of MyD88 and TRIF, two adaptors essential for TLR signaling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082818/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). To extend those studies to a potential fungal pathogen, we compared the response of GM-CSF&#x02013;cultured bone marrow&#x02013;derived DCs (BMDCs) to different preparations of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082818/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). As for zymosan, both live and heat-killed yeast and hyphal forms of <italic>C. albicans</italic> elicited production of IL-2, IL-10, and TNF by BMDCs. Production of these cytokines was not greatly affected by the antifungal agents used to prevent overgrowth in cultures with live <italic>C. albicans</italic>, although slight variations between samples treated with fungizone and with caspofungin were noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S2 B). However, none of the antifungal agents stimulated cytokine production on their own or altered the response to curdlan, a selective Dectin-1 agonist (Fig. S2 B). Notably, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF were strictly dependent on Syk whether live or heat-killed organisms were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast, the production of IL-12/23 p40 and IL-6 was dependent on MyD88/TRIF adaptors and largely independent of Syk (not depicted). Interestingly, the three Syk-dependent cytokines were more strongly induced by the hyphal than the yeast form of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, especially when the organisms were subjected to heat inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The latter also unmasked a MyD88/TRIF dependence for IL-2 induction, which was not seen with live organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). The dual dependence of IL-2 on Syk and MyD88/TRIF pathways has been previously noted for zymosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2005</xref>), and may reflect denaturation of some PAMPs and exposure of others during the heat inactivation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gantner et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with PAMPs being altered by boiling, the MyD88/TRIF adaptors contributed partially to TNF induction by live but not heat-inactivated <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). IL-10 remained largely MyD88/TRIF independent regardless of the fungal stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), consistent with our data using zymosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2005</xref>). We conclude that, independently of possible contributions from TLR pathways, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF production by BMDCs in response to fungal stimuli requires signaling via Syk and can be used to monitor the activity of Syk-coupled PRRs for fungi that are expressed on DCs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The contribution of Syk and TLR signaling to cytokine induction by <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</bold> (A) BMDCs from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT, black bars), <italic>Myd88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>/<italic>Trif<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (MyD88/TRIF DKO, white bars), or <italic>Syk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> chimeric (Syk KO, gray bars) mice were stimulated with 10<sup>5</sup> live <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast or hyphae.

Compared with wild-type cells, Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient BMDCs produced similar levels of IL-2, IL-10, and TNF in response to heat-killed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) or live <italic>C. albicans</italic> (not depicted). Similarly, in response to zymosan, the induction of the Syk-dependent cytokines was only marginally reduced by Dectin-1 deficiency (Fig. S1 B). This is consistent with previous observations made in DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saijo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>) but, interestingly, contrasts with data indicating that in macrophages induction of TNF by zymosan and <italic>Candida</italic> is predominantly mediated by Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saijo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). The near complete Syk dependence and the relative Dectin-1 independence of TNF, IL-2, and IL-10 responses to fungal stimuli suggests the existence of additional Syk-coupled fungal PRRs in DCs that remain active in triggering this signaling pathway in the absence of Dectin-1.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The contribution of Dectin-1 to cytokine induction by <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</bold> BMDCs from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT, black bars) or <italic>Clec7a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> chimeric (Dectin-1 KO, gray bars) mice were stimulated overnight with 10<sup>5</sup> or 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast or hyphae.

Despite previous reports of limited expression of Dectin-2 on DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2006</xref>), using a more sensitive detection method we found surface expression by the CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and double-negative subsets of splenic DCs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082818/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). As reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrett et al., 2009</xref>), BMDCs also expressed Dectin-2 (Fig. S3 B). This broad expression of Dectin-2 on conventional DCs is similar to that of Dectin-1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082818/DC1">Fig. S5 C</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saijo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). Next, we cultured BMDCs with anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 immobilized on plastic to assess whether selective stimulation through Dectin-2 alone was sufficient to promote DC activation. F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> preparations of secondary antibody and Fab preparations of anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 were used to avoid Fc receptor engagement, but in all cases, similar data were obtained with intact antibodies (unpublished data). Contact of DCs with the anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 surfaces induced phosphorylation of Syk and of ERK, p38, and JNK MAPKs, whereas no increase above basal phosphorylation was observed with control antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In addition, overnight stimulation with plated anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 induced accumulation of high levels of IL-2, IL-10, and TNF in culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B&#x02013;D</xref>). This was not caused by contamination of the Fab/F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> preparations with TLR agonists, because a similar response was observed with BMDCs doubly deficient in MyD88 and TRIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). We therefore explored the notion that Dectin-2 might signal via the Syk&#x02013;CARD9 pathway. Consistent with that hypothesis, Dectin-2 cross-linking completely failed to induce IL-2, IL-10, and TNF from Syk- or CARD9-deficient BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>) despite the fact that those cells expressed normal levels of Dectin-2 and responded normally to stimulation with TLR agonists (not depicted). We conclude that triggering of endogenous Dectin-2 in DCs is sufficient to activate Syk and downstream signaling pathways in DCs, leading to TLR-independent production of cytokines.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Syk- and CARD9-dependent activation of DCs by Dectin-2.</bold> (A) Activation of Syk and MAPK cascades by plated anti&#x02013;Dectin-2.

This increase in surface expression conferred the ability to bind fluorescent zymosan, which was not detectable in the other B3Z cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we compared fungal stimulation of Dectin-1&#x02013;sufficient and &#x02013;deficient BMDCs with or without Dectin-2 function. As has been observed for many antibodies against other ITAM-coupled receptors, anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 did not trigger activation unless immobilized on plastic or beads (unpublished data). Instead, in solution, the mAb caused down-regulation of Dectin-2 and could consequently be used as a blocking reagent (unpublished data). Therefore, we treated BMDCs with anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 or an isotype-matched irrelevant antibody control for 2 h before stimulation with zymosan. As with loss of Dectin-1, down-regulation of Dectin-2 in wild-type DCs only modestly reduced the levels of IL-2, IL-10, or TNF produced in response to zymosan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). However, blockade of Dectin-2 in Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient BMDCs led to a profound reduction in the same cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>), approaching the decrease observed in Syk-deficient cells (Fig. S1 A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2005</xref>). Similar results were obtained using live <italic>C. albicans</italic>: blockade of Dectin-2 in wild-type BMDCs or genetic loss of Dectin-1 led to modest and variable reductions in the levels of IL-2 and IL-10, but blockade of Dectin-2 in Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient BMDCs caused an almost complete loss in production of all three Syk-dependent cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The exception was TNF, which was only partially dependent on the two CLRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>), possibly reflecting the TLR contribution noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>. Induction of IL-2, IL-10, and TNF by heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic> was mediated by Dectin-1 and -2, as seen with zymosan. We also analyzed the induction of IL-12 and IL-23 and found that IL-12 p35 mRNA was at the limit of detection (unpublished data), whereas IL-23p19 mRNA was elicited by <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation in a manner dually dependent on Dectin-1 and -2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082818/DC1">Fig. S6</ext-link>). To verify the contribution of Dectin-2 by an independent means, we used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down Dectin-2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrett et al., 2009</xref>). Infection of BMDCs with a lentivirus encoding Dectin-2 shRNA but not with a lentivirus encoding a scrambled control insert reduced the surface expression of Dectin-2 by &#x0003e;50% as determined by flow cytometry (not depicted).

These results indicate that the primary binding receptors for zymosan on DCs are Dectin-1 and -2. At the same time, they raise a caveat with the interpretation that Syk-dependent DC activation is caused by signals propagated by Dectin-1 and -2 because the loss of cytokines seen with Dectin-2 blockade in Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient cells could, at least in principle, be caused by lack of binding of fungal particles, which would then prevent triggering of any other Syk-coupled receptors. To address this possibility, we transduced Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient BMDCs with a Y15F mutant form of Dectin-1 that allows restoration of zymosan binding without Syk signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2005</xref>). The transduced cells bound zymosan even more avidly than wild-type controls, and in this setting, the binding was only marginally decreased by Dectin-2 blockade (Fig. S7). Yet, production of IL-2, IL-10, and TNF was profoundly compromised by the same Dectin-2 blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Indeed, anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 blocked cytokine production by Y15F-transduced cells to the same extent as in Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient mock-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Thus, anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 nearly completely blocks Syk-dependent cytokine responses in a condition in which Dectin-1 is unable to signal but promotes a high degree of binding of fungal particles. This, in turn, argues against a major contribution from other signaling receptors and indicates that the requirement for Dectin-1 and -2 in Syk-dependent DC activation by fungi is caused by signals propagated by these receptors and not just by their ability to mediate binding of fungal particles.</p></sec><sec><title>Dectin-2 and -1 direct the Th cell response to fungal infection</title><p>In light of our in vitro results with DCs, we assessed the contribution of Dectin-2 to adaptive immunity to <italic>Candida</italic> infection in vivo.

In contrast, little effect of Dectin-2 blockade was apparent on the Th1 response to the same pathogen, although when anti&#x02013;Dectin-2 was used in combination with Dectin-1 deficiency, a statistically significant decrease in IFN-&#x003b3; production was observed in cells restimulated with the lower but not the higher dose of heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> and Fig. S8 A).

However, a subset of PRRs possesses the ability to trigger intracellular signaling pathways that lead to expression of innate response genes, including those encoding chemokines and cytokines. These types of PRRs play a key role in orchestrating the innate and adaptive immune responses to infection, and have previously been described as belonging to the TLR, RLR, and NLR families. The C-type lectin Dectin-1 constituted a notable exception, as it is not a member of any of these families yet it is able to induce immunity via a Syk and CARD9-dependent pathway. In this study, we identify Dectin-2 as an additional Syk&#x02013;CARD9&#x02013;coupled C-type lectin that mediates DC activation by fungi. Notably, we show that Dectin-2 accounts for the seemingly paradoxical Syk- and CARD9-dependent yet Dectin-1&#x02013;independent aspects of DC activation by fungal stimuli. This is in contrast to most macrophages that respond to <italic>C. albicans</italic> primarily through Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>) and to some types of DCs that may rely primarily on TLR signaling via TRIF to respond to the same organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Luca et al., 2007</xref>). The importance of Dectin-2 in DC function is underscored by the fact that in vivo blockade of Dectin-2 severely reduces Th17 responses to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection and, in the context of Dectin-1 deficiency, affects Th1 immunity to the same organism. Thus, Dectin-2 constitutes a major receptor regulating T cell responses to fungi by engaging the Syk&#x02013;CARD9 pathway in DCs.</p><p>The fungal PAMP recognized by Dectin-2 has not been fully identified. The C-type lectin domain of Dectin-2, unlike that of Dectin-1, possesses a classical carbohydrate recognition site that coordinates Ca<sup>2+</sup> and specifically recognizes high mannose structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGreal et al., 2006</xref>). Binding of this domain to zymosan is blocked by mannose, fucose, or mannan, suggesting that the yeast ligand is probably a high-mannose&#x02013;like structure such as mannan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGreal et al., 2006</xref>). Both O- and N-linked yeast mannans possess immunostimulatory properties, and the activity of the former has been ascribed to its ability to engage TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Netea et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, many innate receptors, including SIGNR-1, DC-SIGN, mannose receptor, and TLR2, have been proposed to bind structures within N-mannan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jouault et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambi et al., 2008</xref>). Dectin-2 may fall in the same group, although competition studies suggest that the molecular pattern recognized by Dectin-2 is distinct from that bound by SIGNR-1 and mannose receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGreal et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, different receptors may sense different forms of mannan, which could be differentially expressed during the fungal life cycle. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al. (2006)</xref> have shown that Dectin-2 preferentially binds the hyphal form of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and suggested that the ligand may not be expressed or could be concealed in the yeast form. Our results, however, show that, although hyphae induce the Dectin-1/2&#x02013;dependent cytokines more strongly than yeasts, Dectin-2 is also involved in the sensing of the latter. Consistent with the notion that Dectin-2 can act as a yeast receptor, we have previously reported that the recombinant C-type lectin domain of Dectin-2 binds to zymosan and to the yeast form of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGreal et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, the PAMPs recognized by Dectin-2 may not be restricted to fungi, as this receptor appears to play a role in the response to house dust mite allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrett et al., 2009</xref>) and the extracellular domain of Dectin-2 is capable of binding bacterial polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGreal et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Stimulation through Dectin-2 defines a new mechanism for DC activation by a PRR. We show that Dectin-2 requires association with the FcR&#x003b3; chain to be expressed on the surface of cells but, more critically, we provide evidence that the ITAM of this adaptor is required for signaling. Cross-linking of Dectin-2 triggered the activation of Syk and the MAPK cascades, leading to cytokine production. The latter process was dependent on CARD9, the adaptor necessary for induction of NF-&#x003ba;B downstream of Dectin-1 and other ITAM-signaling myeloid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hara et al., 2008</xref>). However, in contrast to Dectin-1 that binds Syk directly, Dectin-2 couples to Syk in trans, through association with FcR&#x003b3; chain. In this regard, Dectin-2 behaves like lymphocyte antigen receptors and activatory Fc receptors, all of which engage Syk or ZAP-70 indirectly, through association with ITAM-bearing signaling chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Isakov, 1997</xref>). Likewise, other myeloid receptors, including Mincle, MAIR-II, TREM-1, TREM-2, OSCAR, and DCAR, engage ITAM pathways through association with FcR&#x003b3; chain or DAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouchon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanazawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamasaki et al., 2008</xref>). All of these receptors can be easily triggered by means of antibody cross-linking, as shown in this study for Dectin-2. In contrast, antibody cross-linking does not induce measurable Dectin-1&#x02013;mediated cytokine responses. Thus, although our study highlights the equivalence of Dectin-1 and -2 in activating the Syk&#x02013;CARD9 pathway, hemITAM and ITAM receptors may have distinct signaling requirements, which could lead to subtle differences in downstream responses not apparent in our study.</p><p>As shown in this paper, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF, the hallmark cytokines triggered by either Dectin-1 or -2 engagement in DCs, are the same cytokines that are critically dependent on Syk and CARD9 for induction in response to fungal stimuli. Why TLR signaling in response to agonists present in fungal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hohl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Netea et al., 2008</xref>) is unable to mimic Syk-dependent signals in eliciting IL-2, IL-10, and TNF but can induce IL-6 and IL-12 p40 is at present unclear. This phenomenon may be DC subtype dependent, as TLR signaling via TRIF can also lead to IL-10 production by mesenteric lymph node DCs in response to <italic>Candida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Luca et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is consistent with our previous study showing a marked dependence of zymosan-induced IL-2 and IL-10 on ERK, which was predominantly activated via Syk but not MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slack et al., 2007</xref>). Also, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and zymosan activate NFAT via Dectin-1 and not via TLRs in macrophages, and this NFAT activation is required for IL-2 and IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodridge et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, a robust engagement of the ERK and NFAT pathways by Dectin-1 and -2 may underlie the induction of the Syk-signature cytokines.</p><p>It is important to note that IL-2, IL-10, and TNF may be only part of the Syk&#x02013;CARD9 &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d; of DC activation by fungi, which will need to be investigated fully using genome-wide screens. Interestingly, a recent report indicates that, in DCs, Dectin-2/Syk signaling can additionally couple to the generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrett et al., 2009</xref>). The contribution of Dectin-2 to DC activation by fungi is not fully elucidated, but in vivo, it maps out at the level of the Th17 response to the organism. This follows from previous work in which we found that systemic infection with <italic>C. albicans</italic> induces potent Th1 and Th17 responses and that the latter but not the former are completely abrogated in CARD9-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>). In this paper, we show that Dectin-2 is the major regulator of the Th17 response to systemic <italic>Candida</italic> infection and confirm earlier evidence that Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient mice show little or no impairment in this response in the absence of concomitant Dectin-2 blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>). However, combined Dectin-2 blockade and Dectin-1 deficiency impaired the Th1 response to the organism, indicating that Dectin-1 is not fully dispensable for adaptive immunity to <italic>Candida</italic>. This is an identical phenotype to that seen previously in the CARD9-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2007</xref>), implying that Dectin-1 and -2 account for most of the CARD9-dependent adaptive immune response to <italic>Candida</italic> infection.</p><p>In contrast to Th1 and Th17 induction, Dectin-1 and -2 do not fully account for the CARD9-dependent innate immune response to <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Indeed, we observed no significant increase in renal fungal burden, even when Dectin-2 was blocked in Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient mice, which indicates that Dectin-2 function may be redundant for antifungal resistance during the first week of systemic infection. This is consistent with previous data showing that fungal burden in the kidneys of Dectin-1&#x02013;deficient mice infected i.v. with similar doses was significantly increased only in those mice that succumbed to the infection and not at these early time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Card9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are highly susceptible to a similar dose of the fungus and have large increases in kidney mass and fungal burden as early as 4 d after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gross et al., 2006</xref>). As it is believed that resistance to disseminated candidiasis in acute infection primarily reflects the activity of innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Romani, 2008</xref>), it seems likely that additional Syk&#x02013;CARD9&#x02013;coupled receptors are expressed by other immune cells, such as granulocytes, which are involved in the killing of <italic>Candida</italic> organisms during the acute phase of the antifungal response. A distinct question is whether the adaptive Th17 response to <italic>Candida</italic> infection is involved in protection from infection. In favor of that notion, a recent paper has shown that mice deficient in IL-23p19, a critical cytokine for Th17 responses, or in IL-17RA are very susceptible to oropharyngeal candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conti et al., 2009</xref>). This is in agreement with earlier observations that IL-17RA&#x02013;deficient mice are very susceptible to the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, human memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for <italic>C. albicans</italic> are skewed toward Th17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), and STAT3-mediated Th17 deficiency in humans is associated with increased susceptibility to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2008</xref>). However, Th17 responses have also been argued to contribute not to protection but to <italic>Candida</italic>-associated immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelante et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, we have recently found that IL-17 responses initiated by Dectin-1&#x02013;activated DCs can involve FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells that, by other criteria, would be classified as regulatory and thought to have a downmodulatory effect on immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the protective role of type 17 immunity in fungal infection remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zelante et al., 2009</xref>). It should be noted that any protective effect of Th17 immunity might only be apparent in a longer term follow up of animals infected with sublethal doses of <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Unfortunately, in the absence of a Dectin-2&#x02013;deficient mouse, we are restricted to short-term experiment infection with mAb blockade such as described in this paper, in which any protective (or detrimental) effect of Th17 cells may be masked by innate resistance mechanisms.</p><p>Dectin-1 was previously considered an exception as it does not belong to the three most prominent families of PRRs, namely the TLRs, NLRs, and RLRs. Given our present and past findings, we propose that Dectin-1 and -2 may represent a novel class of myeloid innate receptors characterized by Syk&#x02013;CARD9 coupling that can function to initiate immunity. It is important to note that Dectin-1 and -2 possess structurally different C-type lectin domains, fall into different subgroups of the CLR family, and use markedly different strategies for engaging the Syk pathway. Therefore, members of this class of CLRs will need to be defined by reference to function rather than structure. A possible candidate to be included in this family is Clec5a, which has recently been shown to be a receptor for Dengue virus involved in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Clec5a associates with DAP-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakker et al., 1999</xref>), an ITAM-bearing adaptor similar to the FcR&#x003b3; chain, and therefore may link to Syk. In addition, Mincle, an inducible myeloid CLR, was recently implicated in macrophage sensing of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>Malassezia</italic> species and the subsequent induction of proinflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wells et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamasaki et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, Mincle has also been shown to associate with the FcR&#x003b3; chain and signal via CARD9 in response to self-ligands such as the ribonucleoprotein SAP130 released by necrotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamasaki et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, both Dectin-1 and -2 have also been reported to possess an endogenous ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ariizumi et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragane et al., 2003</xref>), and DNGR-1, an additional hemITAM-bearing CLR, mediates Syk-dependent crosspriming responses to dead cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sancho et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, Syk-coupled CLRs may have additional functions not only as PRRs but also as innate receptors for initiating proinflammatory responses to sterile injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 and <italic>Myd88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>/<italic>Trif<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were bred at Cancer Research UK in specific pathogen-free conditions.
