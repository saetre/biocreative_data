Here we show that Snail1 regulates this balance by controlling osteoblast differentiation. Snail1 is necessary for the early steps of osteoblast development, and it must be downregulated for their final differentiation. At the molecular level, Snail1 controls bone mass by repressing the transcription of both the osteoblast differentiation factor <italic>Runx2</italic> and the <italic>vitamin D receptor</italic> (<italic>VDR</italic>) genes in osteoblasts. Sustained activation of Snail1 in transgenic mice provokes deficient osteoblast differentiation, which, together with the loss of vitamin D signalling in the bone, also impairs osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, the mineralisation of the bone matrix is severely affected, leading to hypocalcemia-independent osteomalacia. Our data show that the impact of Snail1 activity on the osteoblast population regulates the course of bone cells differentiation and ensures normal bone remodelling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bone remodelling</kwd><kwd>osteoblasts</kwd><kwd>osteoclasts</kwd><kwd>Runx2</kwd><kwd>snail</kwd><kwd>VDR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The integrity of the bone depends on the balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Karsenty and Wagner, 2002</xref>). Indeed, imbalances between these two processes lead to a number of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Rodan and Martin, 2000</xref>). Although increased bone mass may be due to osteoclast dysfunction (osteopetrosis) or to high osteoblast activity (osteosclerosis), a reduction in bone mass is usually caused by increased osteoclast number or activity, sometimes accompanied by suppression of osteoblast activity (osteoporosis). Defective mineralisation of the bone matrix associated with defects in the vitamin D signaling leads to osteomalacia. In addition, osteoclast differentiation directly depends on osteoblast activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Boyle <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), as they secrete osteoclastogenic factors, such as the receptor for activation of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Lagasse and Weissman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Lacey <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Thus, a tight control of osteoblast differentiation is necessary to ensure the appropriate balance between bone formation and bone resorption in the adult.</p><p>Runx2 is the main transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation. It is required for both the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblast lineage and the late stages of osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ducy <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Komori <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Otto <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Nakashima and de Crombrugghe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Although the mechanisms that control Runx2 activity at the post-translational level are already known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bialek <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Jones <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), regulators of its transcription in osteoblasts remain to be identified.</p><p><italic>Snail</italic> genes are transcriptional repressors best known by their ability to trigger the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), endowing epithelial cells with motility and invasive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Peinado <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In addition to the regulation of cell movements and adhesion, Snail factors have a broad spectrum of biological functions, including the regulation of cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Vega <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, Snail also functions in non-epithelial cells, such as chondrocytes, where it is unable to induce EMT but still controls proliferation. Indeed, its deregulated expression in the developing bone leads to achondroplasia in transgenic mice, the most common form of dwarfism in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">de Frutos <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Achondroplasias are associated with activating mutations in FGFR3, which signal in a ligand-independent manner to impair chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Ornitz and Marie, 2002</xref>). Snail1 is the transcriptional effector of FGFR3 signaling during bone development and disease, and its activity can be inversely correlated with the length of the long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">de Frutos <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). As in other tissues, Snail1 expression is very tightly regulated in the bone, and thus, we wondered whether its aberrant activation in the adult had any impact on bone homeostasis. Indeed, our data highlight the fundamental role of Snail1 in controlling bone mass by acting as a repressor of both <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>VDR</italic> transcription during osteoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sustained Snail1 activation in osteoblasts leads to osteomalacia in transgenic mice</title><p>We showed recently that Snail1 activity regulates longitudinal bone growth by controlling chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">de Frutos <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, Snail1 transcripts are also found in the perichondral area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that it might also be expressed by osteoblasts. Indeed, we have found intense Snail1 expression in osteoblasts from mouse calvaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). As Snail transcription factors are pleiotropic proteins involved in different cellular processes depending on the cell context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005</xref>), we examined whether Snail1 might also fulfil additional roles in bone formation. To address this issue, we took advantage of our conditional transgenic mouse model in which Snail1 could be activated in the developing bones (Snail1-ER; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">de Frutos <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; see also Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). To avoid interference with the effects of Snail1 on longitudinal bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">de Frutos <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), we have only analysed adult animals here. In this model, constitutively expressed exogenous Snail1 protein only becomes active on nuclear translocation induced by tamoxifen administration. Accordingly, the transgenic Snail1-ER protein was expressed in the osteoblasts of both the trabecular and the cortical bones, and it was efficiently translocated to the nucleus on tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). On Snail1 activation, cartilage-bone staining highlighted deficiencies in the ossification of the long bones in these mice as assessed by Von Kossa staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C and D</xref> are representative of the phenotype observed in around two thirds of the Snail1-ER tamoxifen-treated mice (20 mice analysed per condition in four independent experiments). Cortical thickness was not affected as assessed in Van Gieson stained transverse sections of the tibias (not shown). In the vertebrae, around 15&#x00025; of the matrix was not calcified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B, E and F</xref>). The histomorphometric analysis also revealed that when total bone volume was considered as both mineralised bone and osteoid, as established previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Parfitt <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>), the total bone volume did not significantly change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, the trabeculae were similar in number and thickness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The deficient mineralisation was more severe in the tibia than in the vertebrae and indeed, in around 20&#x00025; of the treated animals the majority of the cortex and some trabeculae were composed of only osteoid tissue 2 months after Snail1 activation commenced. As the mice had well mineralised bones before tamoxifen administration, it appears that bone remodelling is very rapid. To confirm this, we analysed the rate of remodelling in wild-type mice by injecting calcein for 8 consecutive days into wild-type mice, and assessing the labelling that remained at different time points. This labelling had decreased 1 month after the injection (not shown), and it was greatly diminished after 2 months, particularly in the tibia and the vertebrae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1G&#x02013;J</xref>). Hence, the strong phenotype that we observed in our transgenic mice was compatible with Snail1 inducing a defect in bone formation, and on the other hand, it is very reminiscent of osteomalacia or defective bone mineralisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Karsenty and Wagner, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Snail1 represses VDR transcription in osteoblasts and impairs osteoclastogenesis</title><p>Osteomalacia has been associated with a deficit in vitamin D or its signalling through the VDR receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Yoshizawa <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). However, the primary role of vitamin D signalling in bone mineralisation is to stimulate intestinal absorption of calcium. Indeed, dietary restoration of mineral ion homeostasis prevents osteomalacia in VDR mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Amling <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). As Snail1 directly represses the transcription of the <italic>Vdr</italic> gene in human colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Palmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Pena <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), the osteomalacia phenotype of Snail1-ER mice could be due to a deficient VDR expression in the intestine and low calcium absorption. However, as the Snail1-ER transgenic protein was not expressed in the intestine, this does not appear to be the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4A&#x02013;E</xref>). Consequently, VDR protein expression and distribution as well as the morphology of the intestine were unaffected by tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4F&#x02013;M</xref>). Consistent with this finding, calcium and phosphate serum levels were normal in the Snail1-ER tamoxifen-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Moreover, serum levels of creatinine and urea (not shown) were also unaffected, indicating that tamoxifen administration to Snail1-ER mice did not affect the kidneys, as might be expected from the very low levels of transgenic protein in the kidney (not shown). Although the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase were elevated in the tamoxifen-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>), this increase was very modest compared with that observed in VDR mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Yoshizawa <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Panda <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we also found normal serum levels of the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> precursor 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>) and normal expression levels of its hydroxylase Cyp27b1 in both kidney and bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).</p><p>Although an ion-rich diet can rescue osteomalacia in <italic>VDR</italic> mutant mice, the number of osteoclasts remains low because VDR signalling is also required in osteoblasts for osteoclast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Panda <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). As such, VDR is also expressed in osteoblasts, where it directly activates the promoter of the osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL and downregulates the expression of OPG, a decoy RANKL receptor that inhibits osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Simonet <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Kitazawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kondo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). We examined whether Snail1 could repress <italic>Vdr</italic> transcription in the bone as it does in colon cancer cells, and we found that Snail1 activation on tamoxifen administration did indeed repress of both <italic>Vdr</italic> transcription and protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G</xref>). This inhibition of <italic>Vdr</italic> expression impairs the activation of <italic>Rankl</italic> expression and increases <italic>Osteoprotegerin</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2H</xref>), which could explain the reduction observed in the osteoclast population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2I&#x02013;K</xref>). We also examined the chondrocytes, as the deletion of VDR in these cells also provokes a reduction in osteoclastogenesis due to decreased RANKL expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Masuyama <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Tamoxifen did not affect <italic>Rankl</italic> expression (not shown) in chondrocytes differentiated from dissociated 14.5 dpc hindlimb cells obtained from transgenic embryos as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">de Frutos <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Finally, although endogenous <italic>Snail1</italic> is not expressed in the osteoclast population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>), we examined whether the transgenic protein might be expressed in these cells, possibly contributing to the impaired osteoclast differentiation observed in the Snail1-ER mice treated with tamoxifen. Transgenic osteoclasts do not express Snail1-ER (not shown) and their differentiation in cultures was similar in wild-type and transgenic animals, although tamoxifen seemed to slightly decrease the efficiency of the process in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2L&#x02013;N</xref>). Together, these data indicate that on the one hand, the impaired osteoclastogenesis was due to the defects in VDR signalling in osteoblasts that diminished the availability of RANKL, and on the other hand, that there is no cell-autonomous defect in the osteoclast population or defects in VDR signalling in chondrocytes. Thus, with respect to VDR signalling, the Snail1-ER mice represent an osteoblast-specific model for VDR deficiency.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transient Snail1 expression is required for osteoblast differentiation</title><p>Although bone-specific repression of <italic>VDR</italic> transcription by Snail1 can explain the defects in osteoclastogenesis in the transgenic mice, it cannot account for the defective mineralisation given that ion homeostasis is maintained. Thus, we decided to assess the rate of bone formation by examining calcein incorporation after its injection <italic>in vivo</italic>. The strong impairment in calcein apposition observed was compatible with the defective mineralisation observed in these bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), and suggesting that the osteoblasts failed to fully differentiate. Indeed, the bones from Snail1-ER tamoxifen-treated mice expressed higher levels of <italic>Collagen I</italic> transcripts and lower levels of <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> expression in Snail1-ER bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C and E</xref>), markers of early and late osteoblast differentiation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Nakashima and de Crombrugghe, 2003</xref>), while the number of osteoblasts remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F and G</xref>).</p><p>To examine the role of Snail1 in osteoblast differentiation, we developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> system from embryonic bones in which the stages of proliferation, differentiation and mineralisation could be followed. This culture system accurately reproduced the differentiation pattern described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Maes <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), in terms of osteoblasts differentiated from wild-type embryos or from transgenic Snail1-ER embryos in the absence of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A&#x02013;C</xref>). We found that <italic>Snail1</italic> was transiently expressed in a profile that closely resembled that of <italic>Collagen I</italic>, probably reflecting the indirect induction of <italic>Collagen I</italic> expression by Snail1 as occurs in kidney epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boutet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The expression of phospho-histone 3, p21 or p27 was not altered when cells from transgenic embryonic bones differentiated to osteoblasts in the presence of tamoxifen, indicating that unlike in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">de Frutos <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), Snail1 does not affect osteoblast proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Transgenic Snail1 activation by nuclear translocation on tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>) was correlated with cell commitment to the osteoblast lineage. Mesenchymal cells were converted into immature osteoblasts as they expressed <italic>Osteopontin</italic> and upregulated <italic>Collagen I</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Komori, 2008</xref>). However, sustained Snail1 activation prevented them from continuing their differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). Significantly, the normal maturation process was recovered on Snail1 inactivation due to its cytoplasmic relocalisation after tamoxifen removal. <italic>Collagen I</italic> and <italic>Osteopontin</italic> expression were downregulated, and the transcription of the <italic>Bone Sialoprotein</italic>, <italic>Osteocalcin</italic>, <italic>Dentin matrix protein 1</italic> (<italic>Dmp1</italic>) and the transmembrane endopeptidase <italic>Phex</italic> began to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F and G</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The expression of <italic>ATF4</italic>, an osteoblast marker not regulated at the transcriptional level, was unaltered regardless of the state of Snail1 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). In summary, our data indicate that although Snail1 downregulation was necessary for osteoblast differentiation, it might be required for the initial steps in the differentiation process. To assess whether this was indeed the case, Snail1 siRNA was transfected into wild-type primary cultures derived from 14.5 dpc embryonic hindlimbs at the time of endogenous Snail1 induction. Snail1 was almost totally silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4H</xref>) and differentiation was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, Snail1 is necessary at early stages of osteoblast differentiation and must be downregulated for differentiation and mineralisation to proceed. Given the role of Snail1 in osteoblast differentiation, it is likely that it also contributes to intramembranous ossification.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Snail1 directly controls Vdr and Runx2 transcription during osteoblast differentiation</title><p>Having determined that Snail1 regulates osteoblast differentiation in culture, and given that it is a transcription factor, we set out to define its targets. Having shown that VDR expression was inhibited in bones when Snail1 was activated, we analysed <italic>Vdr</italic> expression in our osteoblast differentiation system. As expected, <italic>Vdr</italic> expression inversely correlated with that of <italic>Snail1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>) and, furthermore, its transcription remained repressed in the presence of activated Snail1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). As Snail1 directly inhibits <italic>Vdr</italic> transcription in colon cancer cells as assessed in promoter activity assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Palmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), we examined whether it could also bind to its promoter in osteoblasts. Three consensus E-boxes for Snail binding exist in a 0.5-kb fragment upstream of the <italic>Vdr</italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Cano <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIp) analyses of osteoblasts from Snail1-ER transgenic mice confirmed that Snail1-ER can bind to boxes II and III and as expected, only in the presence of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). In these ChIp experiments, the ER-antibody was used to detect only the exogenous Snail1-ER fusion protein and not the endogenous Snail1 that would bind to the promoter in the presence or absence of tamoxifen administration. These data confirm that Snail1 also binds directly to the <italic>Vdr</italic> promoter in osteoblasts.</p><p>Besides <italic>VDR</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic> was a clear candidate target to examine, as it is considered the main regulator of osteoblast differentiation, and it is first required for the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteogenic and osteoblast lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ducy <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Komori <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Otto <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Nakashima and de Crombrugghe, 2003</xref>). Later on, Runx2 is also required for the conversion of these cells to mature osteocytes and for the expression of mineralisation proteins (e.g., osteocalcin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). We analysed <italic>Runx2</italic> expression in our osteoblast differentiation system and as for <italic>Vdr</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic> transcription was inversely correlated with that of <italic>Snail1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). This relationship suggested that Snail1 might repress <italic>Runx2</italic>, compatible with the repression of <italic>Runx2</italic> observed in transgenic osteoblasts cultured in the presence of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>). Furthermore, Snail1 transfection in differentiating osteoblasts induced sustained repression of <italic>Runx2</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F</xref>), although <italic>Runx2</italic> was expressed strongly after transfection of a Snail1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data indicate that Snail1 may act as a <italic>Runx2</italic> repressor, and this led us to assess whether Snail1 could directly repress <italic>Runx2</italic> promoter activity.</p><p>Nine consensus E-boxes for Snail binding exist in an 8-kb fragment upstream of the <italic>Runx2</italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, only the two most proximal boxes were conserved between human and mouse. Using a reporter construct that included these two boxes, we found that Snail1 decreased the activity of the <italic>Runx2</italic> promoter in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>; construct 1). Although deletion or mutations of the distal E-box of this pair (constructs 2 and 5) did not affect repressor activity, deletion or mutations in the most proximal box significantly relieved the repression of the <italic>Runx2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>; constructs 3 and 4). Moreover, simultaneous mutations in the two boxes completely abrogated inhibition. The sequences deleted in construct number 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>) are likely to contain binding sites for Runx2 activators, as its activity in the absence of Snail1 is much lower than that of the control fragment (construct 1). Together, these data indicate that the binding of Snail1 to the most proximal box is sufficient to inhibit <italic>Runx2</italic> promoter activity and that the second box cooperates in this repression.</p><p>A similar ChIp analysis of osteoblasts from Snail1-ER transgenic mice confirmed that like the <italic>Vdr</italic> promoter, Snail1-ER can also only bind to these two conserved boxes in the <italic>Runx2</italic> promoter in the presence of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, Snail1 is unable to bind to four additional consensus boxes or to the three perfect-match E-boxes contained in 3 kb or between 7 and 8 Kb fragments upstream of the <italic>Runx2</italic> coding region, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Although our culture system reproduced the described pattern of osteoblast differentiation, we decided to analyse whether Snail1 also behaved as a Runx2 repressor <italic>in vivo</italic>. We first examined the endogenous pattern of <italic>Snail1</italic> expression in the perichondral area of mouse embryos throughout fetal development. We found that <italic>Snail1</italic> expression was very dynamic, and that it followed a similar profile to that found in our cultures, with a peak of high expression at 16.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Snail1</italic> expression was inversely correlated with that of <italic>Runx2</italic> both in the perichondral area and in the trabecular bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A&#x02013;J</xref>). These data are compatible with the repression of <italic>Runx2</italic> by Snail1. As such, we also found that <italic>Runx2</italic> is repressed in Snail1-ER transgenic bones on Snail1 activation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7K&#x02013;N</xref>). In addition, the direct downstream target of Runx2, <italic>Osterix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nishio <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), was also inhibited on Snail1 activation in these bones (not shown). These data validate the specificity of the transfection and ChIp assays and confirm that Snail1 directly binds to the <italic>Runx2</italic> promoter and represses its transcription during osteoblast differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that Snail1 directly represses both <italic>VDR</italic> and <italic>Runx2</italic> transcription during osteoblast differentiation. The transitory expression of Snail1 in osteoblasts can control the course of differentiation by facilitating an early and a late phase of Runx2 activity. Sustained activation of Snail1 in mice stabilises the normally transient repression of transcriptional cascades downstream of <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>Vdr</italic> in osteoblasts, inducing defective mineralisation and impairing osteoclastogenesis, respectively. When coupled with the Snail1-mediated induction of <italic>Collagen I</italic>, these alterations generate uncalcified matrix or osteoid and thus, osteomalacia independent of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia.</p><p>Despite the <italic>in vivo</italic> data obtained in this study come from a transgenic mouse model overexpressing Snail1, we believe that it significantly helps understand the mechanisms that control bone formation and resorption. It reveals an unexpected and important role of Snail1 in osteoblast differentiation in culture, which is compatible with the data obtained in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). Although our model is not osteoblast specific, we have ruled out the cell-autonomous contribution of chondrocytes or osteoclasts in these processes in our mice. On the one hand, Snail1-ER protein is not expressed in osteoclasts, and on the other hand, we have not seen any defect in chondrocytes that could explain the observed phenotype. We show that Snail1 controls <italic>Vdr</italic> expression in osteoblasts. It is known that impaired <italic>Vdr</italic> signalling in the intestine leads to osteomalacia due to defective calcium absorption in the intestine. However, Snail1 cannot be associated with VDR signalling or calcium uptake in the intestine in healthy conditions, as Snail1 is not endogenously expressed in normal intestinal tissue. Similarly, this transgenic line of Snail1-ER mice does not express Snail1 in the intestine either and maintained normal VDR expression and serum ion levels. Thus, with respect to VDR signalling, Snail1-ER mice provide an osteoblast-specific defective model, where Snail1-mediated repression of <italic>Vdr</italic> transcription in osteoblasts leads to defects in osteoclastogenesis due to the consequent deregulation of <italic>Rankl</italic> and <italic>Osteoprotegerin</italic>. Interestingly, Snail1 is aberrantly activated in colon cancer cells, where it represses <italic>Vdr</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Palmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), as it normally occurs in osteoblasts (this work). Perhaps the benefits of a higher calcium intake associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) can be related to a compensation of deficient calcium uptake in patients with impaired VDR signalling after aberrant activation of Snail1 as part of the transformation process.</p><p>Importantly, our studies also help to clarify the temporal regulation of <italic>Runx2</italic> transcription during normal bone development and homeostasis. Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells have low levels of <italic>Snail1</italic>, allowing the expression of <italic>Runx2</italic> transcripts. However, Runx2 activity is low at these early stages due to its interaction with Twist proteins, which prevent the Runx2 protein from binding to its target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bialek <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). When Twist is downregulated, Runx2 becomes functional and by blocking adipocyte and chondrocyte differentiation, it activates osteoblast formation. It is known that Runx2 must be later suppressed for immature osteoblasts to continue differentiating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Komori, 2008</xref>), and later on, it needs to be re-expressed as it is essential for terminal differentiation into osteocytes and complete mineralisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Stein <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Our data showing the transient nature of Snail1 expression during osteoblast differentiation and its ability to act as a direct transcriptional repressor of <italic>Runx2</italic>, provide an explanation for this complex dynamics of Runx2 expression throughout the differentiation process. As such, at the time when Runx2 has specified the osteoblast phenotype, Snail1 is activated and transiently represses <italic>Runx2</italic> so that differentiation to the immature osteoblast can proceed. In addition to inhibiting <italic>Runx2</italic> expression, Snail1 actively favours the formation of immature osteoblasts, as it is necessary for <italic>Collagen I</italic> and <italic>Osteopontin</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4H</xref>) and represses the expression of the mineralisation genes <italic>Phex</italic> and <italic>Dmp1</italic>. Subsequent Snail1 downregulation releases <italic>Runx2</italic> transcriptional repression and allows mineralisation to proceed, as this second wave of <italic>Runx2</italic> expression is necessary to activate <italic>Bone Sialoprotein</italic> and <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Stein <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). On mineralisation, the levels of Runx2 protein are controlled by Schnurri-3, which promotes its degradation in the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Jones <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have revealed Snail1 to be the first transcriptional repressor of <italic>Runx2</italic>, which together with the post-translational regulation co-ordinated by Twist and Schnurri-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bialek <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Jones <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), controls the complex dynamics of Runx2 protein activity during osteoblast differentiation. Snail1 also favours the synthesis of unmineralised matrix by indirectly activating <italic>Collagen I</italic> expression and it controls osteoclastogenesis by directly repressing <italic>Vdr</italic> transcription. Thus, Snail1 lies upstream of three fundamental pathways in bone remodelling and the control of adult bone mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). Our data indicate that aberrant expression of Snail1 would lead to osteomalacia even under normal ion homeostasis conditions as it occurs in the presence of vitamin D and a wild-type <italic>Vdr</italic> gene. In addition, this study provides further insight into the complex regulation of bone formation and resorption.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>The Snail-ER<sup>T2</sup> construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">de Frutos <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) was microinjected into fertilised C57 &#x000d7; CBA hybrid eggs to generate transgenic mice according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hogan <italic>et al</italic> (1994)</xref>.
