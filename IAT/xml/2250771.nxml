However, recent reports indicate that A&#x003b2; can form several different prefibrillar and fibrillar aggregates and that each aggregate may confer different pathogenic effects, suggesting that manipulation of A&#x003b2;42 aggregation may not only quantitatively but also qualitatively modify brain pathology. Here, we compare the pathogenicity of human A&#x003b2;42 mutants with differing tendencies to aggregate. We examined the aggregation-prone, EOFAD-related <underline>Arc</underline>tic mutation (A&#x003b2;42<underline>Arc</underline>) and an <underline>art</underline>ificial mutation (A&#x003b2;42<underline>art</underline>) that is known to suppress aggregation and toxicity of A&#x003b2;42 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, A&#x003b2;42Arc formed more oligomers and deposits than did wild type A&#x003b2;42, while A&#x003b2;42art formed fewer oligomers and deposits. The severity of locomotor dysfunction and premature death positively correlated with the aggregation tendencies of A&#x003b2; peptides. Surprisingly, however, A&#x003b2;42art caused earlier onset of memory defects than A&#x003b2;42. More remarkably, each A&#x003b2; induced qualitatively different pathologies. A&#x003b2;42Arc caused greater neuron loss than did A&#x003b2;42, while A&#x003b2;42art flies showed the strongest neurite degeneration. This pattern of degeneration coincides with the distribution of Thioflavin S-stained A&#x003b2; aggregates: A&#x003b2;42Arc formed large deposits in the cell body, A&#x003b2;42art accumulated preferentially in the neurites, while A&#x003b2;42 accumulated in both locations. Our results demonstrate that manipulation of the aggregation propensity of A&#x003b2;42 does not simply change the level of toxicity, but can also result in qualitative shifts in the pathology induced <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The amyloid-&#x003b2;-42 (A&#x003b2;42) peptide has been suggested to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating, and currently incurable, neurodegenerative disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001703-Selkoe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

It should be noted that although age-dependent accumulation of A&#x003b2;42Arc in FA fraction from 5 to 25dae was clearly observed, the level of A&#x003b2;42Arc at 35dae was less than that at 25dae, presumably due to a progressive cell loss in A&#x003b2;42Arc fly brains (See below).

Data obtained from male and female flies are presented separately, since expression of A&#x003b2; is higher in males than in females, as a result of dosage compensation. For 5 dae flies in both male and female groups, A&#x003b2;42Arc flies showed the most severe 1 hour memory defects (memory scores were measured 1 hour after the training session), and A&#x003b2;42art flies were also defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001703-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, memory in A&#x003b2;42 flies was indistinguishable from control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001703-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).
