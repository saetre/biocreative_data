However, these PDGF-A-mediated mechanisms remain incompletely defined. At postnatal days 4 and 12 (P4 and P12), using mouse lung fibroblasts, we examined (a) how PDGF-R&#x003b1; correlates with ki67 (proliferation marker) or alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA, myofibroblast marker) expression, and (b) whether PDGF-A directly affects &#x003b1;SMA or modifies stimulation by transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using flow cytometry we examined PDGF-R&#x003b1;, &#x003b1;SMA and Ki67 in mice which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression.

At P4, more of the higher than lower PDGF-R&#x003b1; + fibroblasts contained Ki67 (Ki67+), and Ki67+ fibroblasts predominated in the &#x003b1;SMA + but not the &#x003b1;SMA- population. By P12, Ki67+ fibroblasts comprised a minority in both the PDGF-R&#x003b1; + and &#x003b1;SMA+ populations. At P4, most Ki67+ fibroblasts were PDGF-R&#x003b1; + and &#x003b1;SMA- whereas at P12, most Ki67+ fibroblasts were PDGF-R&#x003b1;- and &#x003b1;SMA-. More of the PDGF-R&#x003b1; + than - fibroblasts contained &#x003b1;SMA at both P4 and P12. In the lung, proximate &#x003b1;SMA was more abundant around nuclei in cells expressing high than low levels of PDGF-R&#x003b1; at both P4 and P12. Nuclear SMAD 2/3 declined from P4 to P12 in PDGF-R&#x003b1;-, but not in PDGF-R&#x003b1; + cells.

In accordance, PDGF-R&#x003b1; more dominantly influences fibroblast proliferation at P4 than at P12.

Whereas many studies have focused on disease states, similar mechanisms may account for both normal lung development and remodelling after lung injury. Increased knowledge of the links between these processes could introduce more effective treatment strategies for terminal diseases such as intrapulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Alveolar septal formation involves coordinated expansion of epithelial and mesenchymal cells and establishment of a specialized epithelial-endothelial interface that permits efficient gas exchange. The attenuated alveolar-capillary basement membrane is interrupted at the thickened portions of septum, which reside primarily at the base and at the alveolar entry rings. Differentiated mesenchymal cells such as the myofibroblasts, reside in these regions and deposit extracellular collagen and elastic fibers that support the delicate intervening alveolar-capillary interface. Myofibroblasts have been identified in the developing pulmonary alveolar interstitium of a variety of species, including rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These specialized fibroblasts display smooth muscle cell-like features, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family, consisting of the ligands A, B, C and D and the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGF-R&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, regulate the proliferation, migration and differentiation of mesenchymal cells during embryonic and postnatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. All four ligands form dimers; whereas A and B can both homo- and heterodimerize (AA, AB or BB), C and D exist solely as homodimers (CC and DD). PDGF A signals solely via PDGF-R&#x003b1;, B and C via both PDGF-R&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, and D solely via PDGF-R&#x003b2;. PDGFs A, B and C are expressed in the developing mouse lung[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but mice that are null for the <italic>pdgf-a </italic>gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] display reduced numbers of PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing cells, lack myofibroblasts and elastin deposits, and fail to develop alveoli. A role for PDGFs B and C in alveolar septal formation and myofibroblast development has not been identified, as both <italic>pdgfs-b </italic>and <italic>-c </italic>null mice die <italic>in utero </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the behavior of PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing mesenchymal cells may necessarily, but not exclusively reflect the actions of PDGF-A.</p><p>Whereas it is well known that fibroblasts actively proliferate and deposit alveolar septal ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and that PDGF-A/PDGF-R&#x003b1; signaling is required for myofibroblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it remains unclear how PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression influences the timing of fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. Stimulatory and inhibitory signals normally confine myofibroblasts to the period of pulmonary alveolarization and myofibroblasts are rarely observed in the adult lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Understanding more about these normal regulatory signals is important, because myofibroblasts reappear in injured and inflamed lung tissue, and contribute to the progression of fibrosis which leads to scarring and eventual loss of lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an <italic>in vivo </italic>marker for pulmonary PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression, we have demonstrated that fibroblasts actively expressing the PDGF-R&#x003b1; gene are more likely to contain &#x003b1;SMA (characteristic of myofibroblasts) than their non-expressing counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We have now investigated the relationships between proliferation (using ki67 as a marker for proliferation) and &#x003b1;SMA gene expression in individual PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing + and non-expressing - lung fibroblasts.</p><p>Because PDGF-B antagonizes &#x003b1;SMA gene expression in smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we hypothesized that PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing lung fibroblasts differ from non-expressing lung fibroblasts in their response to transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;). TGF&#x003b2;1 is well characterized as a mediator of fibroblast to myofibroblast conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and is important for alveolar development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore using cultured mouse lung fibroblasts, we have examined potential direct effects of PDGF-A on &#x003b1;SMA.

Briefly, the human histone <italic>H2B </italic>gene was subcloned into a pEGFPN1 cloning vector to generate the H2B-GFP construct encoding a nuclear form of GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The resultant H2B-GFP construct was inserted into targeting (knock in) vectors. By homologous recombination in the mouse embryos, these vectors replaced a fragment in the wildtype <italic>pdgf-r&#x003b1; </italic>allele corresponding to the signal peptide and the first two immunoglobulin domains. Thus nuclear GFP expression in the transgenic mice is under the control of the endogenous <italic>pdgf-r&#x003b1; </italic>promoter.

For PCR, 1 &#x003bc;l of tail DNA was mixed with dNTPs, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10&#x000d7; PCR buffer, and the following GFP primers: EGFP forward - 5' - GCC ATG CCC GAA GGC TAC GTC - 3' EGFP reverse - 5' - GGG TGC TCA GGT AGT GGT TGT C - 3' The amplification reaction was performed in a thermocycler unit (Techne Limited, Cambridge UK). To screen the animals using fluorescence microscopy, a small piece of the lung was compressed on a glass slide using a coverslip, and the presence or absence of GFP fluorescence was observed using an epifluorescence microscope.</p><p>Primary mouse lung fibroblasts were isolated from 4 and 12-day old mice using a previously reported method, with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. After the animals had been anesthetized with 25 &#x003bc;l of a mixture of 90 mg/ml ketamine and 10 mg/ml xylazine, their lungs were removed, pooled together and digested for a total period of 1 h, with removal of the dispersed cells every 10 minutes. The enzyme solution consisted of Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS, without Ca or Mg) with 300 &#x003bc;g/ml collagenase type I, 250 U trypsin (8500 U/mg solid), 75 &#x003bc;g/ml DNAse I and 5 mM calcium chloride. After each digestion interval, the solution containing dispersed cells was passed through 100 &#x003bc;m mesh into Ham's F-12 k media containing 10% FBS, and the undigested lung tissue placed in fresh enzyme solution. Once digestion was complete (after 3-4 digestions), erythrocytes were separated from the fibroblasts by sedimentation through a 40% Percoll solution. To select for fibroblasts, cells were adhered to 100 mm tissue culture dishes for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization followed by gentle scraping and centrifugation.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of freshly isolated mouse lung fibroblasts for Flow Cytometry analysis of &#x003b1;SMA and Ki67</title><p>Freshly isolated mouse lung fibroblasts were proportioned into aliquots of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells and washed several times by mixing with 1&#x000d7; phosphate-buffered saline (PBS - 0.145 M NaCl, 0.0015 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.0027 M KCl, 0.0086 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation. Following rinsing, the fibroblasts were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS (v/v) for 20 min with shaking at 4&#x000b0;C. After additional rinses in PBS, the fibroblasts were permeabilized in 0.1% (w/v) saponin in PBS at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 min. After the permeabilization step, non-specific binding was reduced by incubating the fibroblasts in 5% non-fat dry milk/0.1% saponin/PBS for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Following the blocking step, monoclonal rat anti-ki67 primary antibody (1:300 dilution, clone TEC-3) or rat IgG2a was added to the fibroblasts, and the cells incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The next day, the cells were rinsed in 0.1% saponin/PBS. In a sequential manner, Alexa Fluor 647-goat-anti rat secondary IgG (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) and phycoerythrin (PE) - anti-&#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin primary antibody (0.0625 &#x003bc;g/ml) or PE-mouse IgG2a were added and the cells incubated for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C.

An unstained sample was used to gate the forward and side scatter pattern of the cell population of interest. Optimization of signal as well as compensation for overlap between the PE and GFP or the Alexa Fluor 647 signals was achieved using BD Comp beads - polystyrene microparticles coated with mouse IgG<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>or FBS (negative control, BD Bioscience) - stained in the same manner as the fibroblasts. The resultant data were analyzed using Cell Quest Pro (BD Biosciences), Microsoft Excel and Sigma Stat software (Jandal Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Each "n" represents a cohort of 2 to 5 mice, of the same age, whose lungs had been pooled and digested together. A minimum of 9000 gated events were analyzed for each "n." Background compensation was determined from the IgG controls prior to calculating the proportions of the different fibroblast populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluating the purity of the fibroblast isolate</title><p>The fibroblast isolate was evaluated for epithelial, endothelial and macrophage contamination using flow cytometry. Epithelial cells were detected after fixation using monoclonal mouse anti-cytokeratin 18 (Sigma), followed by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary IgG. Anti-cytokeratin independent staining was assessed using only the secondary antibody. Endothelial cells were stained prior to fixation using PE-conjugated monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD31 or -mouse IgG<sub>1 </sub>isotype control (BD Biosciences). Macrophages were detected after fixation and permeabilization using Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated-rat anti-mouse mannose receptor c type 1 (CD206) or -IgG<sub>2a </sub>(Serotec).

Fixed sections were then rinsed extensively with 1&#x000d7; PBS. All subsequent antibody incubations were performed in a humidified chamber, and rinses in Coplin jars. Following the rinses, the lung tissue was permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) (permeabilization buffer) for 30 min at RT. To minimize non-specific antibody binding, the tissue was then placed in blocking solution - permeabilization buffer/5% normal goat serum - overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After the blocking step, rabbit polyclonal anti-SMAD 2/3 primary antibody (0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) was added to the blocking solution, and the incubation performed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

Each alveolus selected for analysis was traced through the z-stack, and was defined as having an entry ring and a base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Inspection of the tissues revealed that there were different levels of intensity of GFP-fluorescence that were not related to the distance from the laser beam or the detector. Therefore we devised uniform segmentation criteria using IP lab software (BD Bioscience, Rockville, MD), which discriminated between populations of nuclei with high and low intensities of GFP fluorescence. Because the intensity of the GFP was intrinsic to the tissue and not dependent on antibody staining, it is representative of the level of PDGF-R&#x003b1; gene expression. To examine PDGF-R&#x003b1;-GFP distribution at the alveolar entry ring and base, "low" and "high" PDGF-R&#x003b1;-GFP cells were manually counted at each level.</p><p>The intensity of &#x003b1;-SMA staining was antibody-dependent, thus we always imaged tissues obtained from P4 and P12 animals that were stained concurrently. To avoid variability related to distances from the laser beam, alveolar entry rings located 1/4 to 1/2 of the way into the z-stack were used for analysis. To quantify the pixel density of &#x003b1;SMA associated with PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression at the alveolar entry ring, a circle measuring 9 &#x003bc;m in diameter was drawn around each PDGF-R&#x003b1;-GFP nucleus. The pixel density of &#x003b1;SMA was ascertained relative to this uniform region of interest. The entry ring was defined by staining of &#x003b1;SMA, which occupied at least 75% of the circumferential transition from an alveolar duct into an alveolus. The areal pixel densities of &#x003b1;SMA were expressed in binned segments.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of nuclear SMAD 2/3 in the alveolar region</title><p>Localization of SMAD 2/3 to nuclei in cells that either expressed PDGF-R&#x003b1; (nuclei with GFP) or did not express PDGF-R&#x003b1; (nuclei without GFP) was ascertained as follows: The fluorescent DNA dye, PoPo3, was assigned a blue pseudocolor. In the blue-only image, we optimized the threshold intensity to accurately select pixels representing all blue nuclei (nuclei stained with PoPo3), and quantified the pixel area covered by all the nuclei (all nuclei comprised both those with and without GFP). Next, in the green-only image, we selected only for the nuclei, which also contained GFP above a fixed threshold intensity, and quantified the total pixel area covered by these nuclei.

We have used GFP as a marker for endogenous PDGF-R&#x003b1; gene expression to evaluate the proliferative and myofibroblastic characteristics of marked and unmarked cells during alveolar septal eruption (P4) and elongation (P12).</p><p>Our studies suggest that during septal eruption and elongation, the proliferative characteristics of PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts vary with receptor expression levels. Based on fluorescence intensity, we observed differential PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression in newly isolated fibroblasts using flow cytometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and in intact tissue using fluorescence microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This differential expression of the receptor is functionally significant, because "low" expressing fibroblasts are less proliferative than the "high" PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts during septal eruption at P4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and there are larger pixel area densities of &#x003b1;SMA protein proximate to the "high" than "low" PDGF-R&#x003b1;-GFP nuclei at both P4 and P12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>"Low" expressing fibroblasts may be less sensitive to PDGF-induced proliferation, either due to decreased available surface receptor expression, and/or decreased receptor activation. This hypothesis is consistent with previous reports of reductions in PDGF-A-mediated cell growth associated with diminished PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Hamilton et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] demonstrated using flow cytometry that PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression overlapped with GFP fluorescence intensity in cells that had been derived from PDGF-R&#x003b1;-GFP mouse embryos. Our flow cytometry data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) also suggest that either the "low" population decreases as alveolarization progresses, or may become "high" PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing. A proportional increase in "high" PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts may be advantageous during septal elongation (P12) to support the formation of a mature, elastin-laden ECM. Further studies are required to determine whether "high" PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts produce more elastin.</p><p>Our data also suggests that the overall proliferative state of the PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts is different from the non-expressing fibroblasts, and may depend on their differentiative state. On postnatal day 4 (P4), at the onset of septal eruption, a larger proportion of fibroblasts within the PDGF-R&#x003b1;- and &#x003b1;SMA- expressing groups were proliferative compared to the proportions within the non-expressing counterparts (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Conversely, at P12 these proportions of proliferating fibroblasts within the PDGF-R&#x003b1;- and &#x003b1;SMA-expressing groups were smaller compared to the non-expressing counterparts (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). A larger proportion of the PDGF-R&#x003b1;-GFP positive fibroblasts were &#x003b1;SMA-positive compared to their PDGF-R&#x003b1;-GFP negative counterparts at both P4 and P12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Of the proliferating fibroblasts, PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing cells comprised a majority only at P4 and &#x003b1;SMA-containing cells comprised a minority at both P4 and P12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results are consistent with a transition of PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts from a proliferative to a less proliferative more differentiated, ECM-producing state. A similar transition has been observed in fibrotic states where myofibroblasts initially proliferate at the site of injury, and thereafter become less proliferative and produce more ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Our results corroborate earlier electron micrographic studies showing that the <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine labelling indices of fibroblasts in the rat and mouse lung was highest at P4, and afterwards declined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Our results suggest that during septal eruption at P4, PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts that are &#x003b1;SMA expressing and non-expressing proliferate more, potentially in response to PDGF-A. However, as alveolar septal elongation progresses and septal eruption is abating by P12, proliferation is less frequent among myofibroblasts and among PDGF-R&#x003b1; expressing cells.</p><p>Although <italic>pdgfa</italic>-null mice lack &#x003b1;SMA-expressing myofibroblasts, it is not clear whether PDGF-A can directly stimulate &#x003b1;SMA expression in mouse lung fibroblasts. We thus stimulated a neonatal mouse lung fibroblast cell line with PDGF-AA and observed that PDGF-AA suppressed &#x003b1;SMA mRNA expression only in sub-confluent, but had no effect in confluent cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). These <italic>in vitro </italic>results do not necessarily contradict our <italic>in vivo </italic>observations of greater &#x003b1;SMA abundance around the "high" compared to the "low" nuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Differences in &#x003b1;SMA distribution around the "low" and "high" PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing nuclei may reflect cells undergoing heterogenous differentiation pathways. PDGF-A/PDGF-R&#x003b1; signalling during alveolar development may not directly induce the myofibroblast pathway, but instead regulate the numbers of fibroblasts entering the transdifferentiation pathway. This theory is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that lung fibroblasts can switch between the myo- and lipo- fibroblast phenotype, depending on the <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>presence or absence of (i) lipofibroblast-promoting parathyroid hormone-related protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], or (ii) agonists of the nuclear lipogenic transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x003b3;)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, studies in hepatic stellate cells (liver myofibroblasts) show that PDGFs inhibit lipofibroblast-promoting pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and the formation of adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It is possible that PDGF-A/PDGF-R&#x003b1; signalling could suppress lipid storage thereby indirectly enhancing the myofibroblast phenotype during alveolar development. This hypothesis is supported by earlier studies conducted in our lab that showed a higher accumulation of lipid droplets in the "low" compared to the "high" PDGF-R&#x003b1;-GFP nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Unlike PDGF-A, TGF&#x003b2; promotes the myofibroblast phenotype <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and is also required for alveolar development. Therefore we also investigated whether PDGF-A and TGF&#x003b2; have competing effects on &#x003b1;SMA expression in Mlg cells. We observed that TGF&#x003b2; increased &#x003b1;SMA mRNA expression. However, subsequent addition of PDGF-AA, or treatment with PDGF-AA alone, reduced &#x003b1;SMA mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Stimulation or repression of &#x003b1;SMA gene expression is complex, and involves the competitive binding of various positively- and negatively- acting cell-specific transcription factor complexes to multiple elements within the &#x003b1;SMA promoter-enhancer region, including the CC(AT-rich)6GG (CARG) and AGGAATG (MCAT) sequences, as well as the TGF&#x003b2; 1 control element (TCE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>The suppressive effects of PDGF-AA on &#x003b1;SMA mRNA expression are similar to observations made by Yoshida and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], who found that the PDGF-BB repressed &#x003b1;SMA gene expression in smooth muscle cells by inducing the dissociation of the positive-acting myocardin related transcription factors (MRTFs or MKLs), from the CArG elements. This dissociation resulted from competitive binding between the PDGF-BB downstream effector, Elk1, and the MRTFs at earlier than at later timepoints. PDGF-AA may act through similar mechanisms to suppress TGF&#x003b2;-mediated &#x003b1;SMA expression in fibroblasts, because PDGF-A/PDGF-R&#x003b1; signaling also activates downstream Elk-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and MRTFs are expressed in both embryonic and adult mouse lung tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Furthermore, TGF&#x003b2; enhances the binding of positive-acting transcription factors such as serum response factor (SRF) to the CArG and TCE elements in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Whereas in cultured Mlg cells, PDGF-AA antagonized TGF&#x003b2;-mediated &#x003b1;SMA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), nuclear SMAD 2/3 localization in PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing cells was preserved in the intact tissue during both septal eruption (P4) and septal elongation (P12, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). However, in the non-expressing cells, nuclear SMAD 2/3 was lower at P12 compared to P4. Our results confirm earlier reports of persistent SMAD 3 and phospho-SMAD 2 staining in the developing alveolar interstitium until P28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To our knowledge, our findings are the first to address differences in SMAD 2/3 nuclear localization specifically in PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing and non-expressing cells within the alveolar interstitium.</p><p>Our results also suggest that PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression did not preclude TGF&#x003b2;/SMAD signaling at the indicated stages of alveolar formation. We observed that a greater proportion of PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts at both P4 and P12 contained &#x003b1;SMA compared to their non-expressing counterparts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Therefore, other predominating factors may have maintained the myofibroblast phenotype, and overridden any <italic>in vivo </italic>suppressive effects of PDGF/PDGF-R&#x003b1; signaling. Potential overriding factors include the development of focal contacts between the myofibroblasts and ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], integrin-mediated signaling via focal adhesion kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], and increased mechanical stretching related to septal formation and respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. An alternative explanation could be that intracellular cross talk between PDGF-A and TGF&#x003b2; signaling may occur via SMAD-independent pathways. The transcription factor known as early growth response-1 (Egr-1), which is induced by both PDGF-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and TGF&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], is important for TGF&#x003b2;-mediated collagen expression in mouse lung fibroblasts. This Egr-1-dependent activity is maintained even in fibroblasts derived from SMAD-3 null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) diminished TGF&#x003b2;-mediated &#x003b1;SMA production in primary cultured human neonatal lung fibroblasts, via induction of Egr-1 without changing SMAD phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study has provided valuable information concerning proliferative and differentiative characteristics of PDGF-R&#x003b1;-expressing fibroblasts during alveolar development. We have demonstrated that PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression levels <italic>in vivo </italic>positively correlate with &#x003b1;SMA protein expression during both P4 and P12, and with proliferation at P4, but not at P12. In addition, whereas the majority of proliferating fibroblasts at both stages are undifferentiated (non-&#x003b1;SMA-expressing), most of the fibroblasts are PDGF-R&#x003b1; + at P4, but PDGF-R&#x003b1;- at P12. In addition, we have demonstrated that PDGF-AA suppresses TGF&#x003b2;-mediated &#x003b1;SMA induction <italic>in vitro</italic>, but PDGF-R&#x003b1; expression does not preclude TGF&#x003b2;-dependent nuclear localization of SMAD 2/3 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore the data support an indirect mechanism for the PDGF-mediated regulation of the myofibroblast (&#x003b1;SMA) phenotype, and also imply that fibroblasts respond differently to PDGFs at different stages of alveolarization, possibly to regulate the timing of fibroblast differentiation and function. Furthermore, PDGF-A/PDGF-R&#x003b1; signaling may separately or in combination with TGF&#x003b2;, regulate myofibroblast differentiation and function during alveolar development. These interactions among the intracellular pathways may be SMAD-independent, and/or involve other myofibroblast-promoting factors such as mechanical tension and cell-ECM interactions.</p><p>Our results and those of others demonstrate the complex regulatory network that exists in the developing lung, and how the myofibroblast plays a key role in driving the process of alveolarization. Increasing understanding of the delicate molecular balance that regulates myofibroblast differentiation and function could lead to improved therapeutic strategies for fibrotic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>PDGF-A: Platelet-derived growth factor A; &#x003b1;SMA: Alpha-smooth muscle actin; PDGF-R&#x003b1;: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha; TGF&#x003b2;: Transforming growth factor beta; GFP: Green fluorescent protein; SMAD: Homologs of the <italic>drosophila </italic>protein, Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (MAD) and the <italic>C. elegans </italic>protein, SMA; P4: postnatal day 4; ECM: Extracellular matrix; PBS: 0.145 M NaCl, 0.0015 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.0027 M KCl, 0.0086 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4; BSA: bovine serum albumin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PWK designed and conducted the cell culture, flow cytometry and SMAD 2/3 confocal experiments, analyzed and interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript.
