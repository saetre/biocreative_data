Purifying selection is thought to be important in shaping mtDNA sequence evolution, but the strength of this selection has been debated, mainly due to the threshold effect of pathogenic mtDNA mutations and an observed excess of new mtDNA mutations in human population data. We experimentally addressed this issue by studying the maternal transmission of random mtDNA mutations in mtDNA mutator mice expressing a proofreading-deficient mitochondrial DNA polymerase. We report a rapid and strong elimination of nonsynonymous changes in protein-coding genes; the hallmark of purifying selection. There are striking similarities between the mutational patterns in our experimental mouse system and human mtDNA polymorphisms. These data show strong purifying selection against mutations within mtDNA protein-coding genes. To our knowledge, our study presents the first direct experimental observations of the fate of random mtDNA mutations in the mammalian germ line and demonstrates the importance of purifying selection in shaping mitochondrial sequence diversity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally transmitted and does not undergo bi-parental recombination in the germ line. This asexual mode of transmission, together with a high rate of mutation, should eventually lead to the accumulation of numerous deleterious mtDNA mutations and a &#x0201c;mutational meltdown&#x0201d; (a phenomenon know as Muller's Ratchet). In this study, we utilized a genetic mouse model, the mtDNA mutator mouse, to introduce random mtDNA mutations, and followed transmission of these mutations. Maternal transmission of mtDNA is typically subjected to a bottleneck phenomenon whereby only a fraction of the mtDNA copies in the germ-cell precursor are amplified to generate the approximately 10<sup>5</sup> mtDNA copies present in the mature oocyte. As a consequence of this phenomenon, the established maternal mouse lines carried high levels of a few mtDNA mutations. We sequenced the entire mtDNA to characterize the maternally transmitted mutations in the established mouse lines. Surprisingly, mutations causing amino acid changes were strongly underrepresented in comparison with &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; changes in the protein-coding genes. These results show that mtDNA is subject to strong purifying selection in the maternal germ line. Such selection of functional mtDNA genomes likely involves a mechanism for functional testing to prevent transmission of mutated genomes to the offspring.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>We have used a genetic mouse model with a proofreading-deficient mitochondrial polymerase to mutagenize the mouse mitochondrial genome.

The typical animal carried approximately 30 mtDNA mutations (mean &#x0003d; 29.8 mutations, standard deviation &#x0003d; 9.2). In each line, a large proportion of the identified mtDNA mutations (38.48&#x00025;) were transmitted to the descendents of that particular N1 female, similar to the propagation of mtDNA haplogroups in human pedigrees.

The ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per site to synonymous substitutions per site for the protein-coding regions gave a value of 0.6035, signifying purifying selection against amino acid changes in the protein-coding genes (values less than 1.0 signify purifying selection). When mutations that occur only in an individual or a single litter were removed from the dataset, the ratio dropped to 0.4617.

This distribution of mutations is a hallmark of purifying selection, because changes in the first and second codon position usually result in an amino acid substitution, whereas many third codon position changes do not.

There was a similar level of reduction of first codon position mutations in comparison with third codon position mutations in mtDNA mutator lines (2.0-fold reduction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and humans (2.6-fold reduction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This striking similarity is surprising because the mtDNA mutator strains have undergone selection for at most six generations, whereas human sequence variation is the consequence of a much larger number of generations to act on these less deleterious substitutions. This illustrates the speed and strength of the selection on the mtDNA and its importance in sculpting modern mtDNA variation in natural populations. It also demonstrates this experimental model can be a powerful tool in investigation of mtDNA evolution. The smaller number of nonsynonymous changes in the mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) in comparison with mtDNA mutator lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) can probably be explained by the limited sampling of only one individual from each of the 21 different mouse strains. In addition, it should be emphasized that the mtDNA mutator mice have been exposed to the effects of purifying selection for only a few generations.</p><p>We further investigated the observed selection on protein-coding genes in the mtDNA mutator lines by separating the mutations at 4-fold degenerate sites (third codon positions for amino acids L2, V, A, T, P, S1, R, and G) from all other protein-coding mutations. The 4-fold degenerate sites can mutate to any nucleotide without changing the encoded amino acid and should therefore be subject to less selective constraint than other protein-coding sites. Expected values were calculated based on an assumption of an equal distribution of the observed mutations of these two classes, across the genes and corrected for their coding size. The ratios between observed and expected mutation frequencies at 4-fold degenerate sites were approximately equal in all of the protein-coding genes except for <italic>mt-ND2</italic> and <italic>mt-ATP8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060010-st003">Table S3</xref>A). In contrast, mutations at the non&#x02013;4-fold degenerate sites deviated profoundly from the ratios predicted by equal distribution of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Contingency table analysis was carried out to detect changes in the proportion of 4-fold degenerate site mutations to other sites within the protein-coding genes. The 13 protein-coding subunits were grouped by the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme complex to which they belong. Only complexes III (containing <italic>mt-CYTB</italic>) and complex IV (containing <italic>mt-CO1&#x02013;3</italic>) showed statistically significant changes in the ratio of 4-fold to non&#x02013;4-fold sites (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060010-t002">Table 2</xref>). After correcting for multiple tests, only the complex IV data remained significant. Interestingly, the <italic>mt-ATP8</italic> and <italic>mt-ATP6</italic> subunits appear to allow for excess changes at all sites relative to the expected values, though the ratio of 4-fold to non&#x02013;4-fold sites did not vary significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

There are several observations from human mtDNA disease that imply that tRNA genes may be subject to a less rapid form of purifying selection than that observed for the protein-coding genes of our mtDNA mutator mouse lines: (1) Population-level sampling has revealed an increase in recent mtDNA sequence variation within tRNA and rRNA genes in humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;; (2) 58.2&#x00025; of the known pathogenic human mtDNA mutations are located in the tRNA genes, although these genes only occupy 9.1&#x00025; of the genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, implying that these changes are, at low levels of heteroplasmy, more compatible with life than some protein-coding mutations; and (3) disease-causing tRNA gene mutations reach high heteroplasmic levels, or sometimes must be homoplasmic, before the onset of disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. A less acute, but equally important, mechanism of purifying selection appears to be acting on tRNA genes.

The drastic reduction of mutations in the amino acid changing first and second codon positions of protein-coding genes are a direct result of purifying selection against deleterious mtDNA mutations at some stage within the reproductive cycle of these mice. This bias occurs rapidly and is evident as early as the N2 generation. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of how mutated mtDNA is transmitted between generations. It is important to recognize that this strong purifying selection against nonsynonymous changes that we observe is likely to be a universal phenomenon in mammals, but the rapid nature of this selective force would render these mutations difficult to detect in population studies. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of how mutated mtDNA is transmitted between generations.</p><p>Within studies of human mtDNA evolution, the observation is that many substitutions are not ancient changes shared deep within human haplogroups, but rather are new variants clustered within the tips of phylogenetic networks and found only in a small number of individuals. This implies they are mildly deleterious variants not yet selected against &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies of disease-causing mtDNA mutations show they are often heteroplasmic, and can be present at high levels without consequence for the carrier. However, once the levels exceed a specific threshold, the respiratory chain function will be impaired, causing a clinical phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Based on these observations, when using the mtDNA mutator mouse to study germ line transmission of mtDNA mutations, one could expect to observe the inheritance of high numbers of mutations at all sites in the early generations, which would eventually be removed from the mouse lines once their phenotypic thresholds had been crossed. Whereas the inheritance of the tRNA, rRNA, and third codon position mutations appear to be following this expected pattern (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g004">4</xref>), this is not the behaviour of mutations at the nonsynonymous first and second codon positions in our mouse lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The strongest signature of purifying selection can be observed within <italic>mt-CO1</italic> and <italic>mt-CO2</italic>, consistent with the very high levels of sequence conservation in these genes. The strength and speed of this purifying selection could have other effects on the mutation patterns observed in our model. The consensus view is that bi-parental recombination of mammalian mtDNA is at most extremely rare &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; and therefore selection acting at any one site in the mtDNA will affect the entire mtDNA molecule. The observed strong and rapid selection of mtDNA mutations could therefore also reduce the number of neutral variants observed, due to their linkage to deleterious mutations. This means that 4-fold degenerate sites or even noncoding mutations might not be the reliable measure of the mitochondrial neutral mutation rate. Such an underestimation of the mtDNA mutation rate using phylogenetic or population methods relative to pedigree-based observation has been reported previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b045">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. If this is the case, the models based on this assumption require recalibration.</p><p>This point is also important in interpreting the excess change observed for the <italic>mt-CYB</italic>, <italic>mt-ATP6</italic>, and <italic>mt-ATP8</italic> genes in mtDNA mutator lines. Similar gene-specific increases of mutations have been reported in human mtDNA, especially in <italic>mt-ATP6</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Though some argue that this signifies positive selection, the pattern may also be due to less-intense purifying selection on these specific genes. If mutations at <italic>mt-ATP6</italic> experience less-selective constraint, mutations at these sites will be allowed to accumulate and persist in the mtDNA pool. Meanwhile, mutations at strongly selected sites, such as <italic>mt-CO1</italic> and <italic>mt-CO2</italic>, are eliminated, leading to the relative increase in the observed frequency of <italic>mt-ATP6</italic> and <italic>mt-ATP8</italic> mutations in our model organisms.</p><p>In contrast to the rapid selection against nonsynonymous changes, rRNA and tRNA genes experienced less-intense purifying selection in our mtDNA mutator lines. Though tRNA genes also have high levels of sequence conservation, the frequency of observed mutations at these sites in our mouse lines was quite similar to the rate observed at third codon positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060010-g004">4</xref>A). Some of the identified tRNA mutations, e.g., the deletion of one base in the anticodon loop of <italic>mt-TM</italic> (3873delC mutation) can be predicted to have a biochemical effect if present at high levels. Previous models have mainly been based on observational studies of transmission of mutated mtDNA in human pedigrees affected by mitochondrial disease. Such threshold-mediated protection from selection should lead to slower purifying selection of the mtDNA variant, which may be reflected in the essentially neutral segregation patterns observed for disease-causing mutations prior to clinical manifestation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>It is plausible that these tRNAs, as well as a number of the nonsynonymous changes in the protein-coding genes in our model system, may eventually behave like human mtDNA disease mutations in that these mutations are transmitted and cause no obvious phenotype at low levels, but may be selected against or cause a disease-like phenotype at higher levels. We will continue sampling our lines to investigate the long-term fate of the observed tRNA gene mutations, as well as the stably transmitted nonsynonymous protein-coding gene changes.</p><p>In the mtDNA mutator mice, the mutations within protein-coding genes are equally distributed across all three codon positions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas the pattern of mutation accumulation is different in the mtDNA mutator lines. It has previously been proposed that mitochondrial fitness may be selected for during oocyte development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, and it is therefore quite possible that mtDNA in germ cells is under a different selective regime than the mtDNA in somatic cells. There is a massive proliferation of mtDNA during oogenesis, whereby a small number of mtDNA copies in the primordial germ cells are extensively amplified to generate the approximately 10<sup>5</sup> mtDNA copies in the mature oocyte &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. This mechanism provides ample opportunities for functional testing of mtDNA during female germ-cell development, and future research is required to unravel molecular mechanisms responsible for this selection.</p><p>Our experimental strategy has allowed us to look at the fate of a broad spectrum of mtDNA variation, and we report evidence of strong purifying selection in the mouse female germ line. All of the generated mtDNA mutator mouse lines showed the same strong reduction in nonsynonymous substitutions, exemplified by the reduction in first and second codon position mutations. This pattern is also seen in human populations and implies that purifying selection has a similar, drastic impact on the mtDNA variation in humans despite different demographic histories. The RNA genes, in contrast, appear to accumulate at levels approximating the synonymous third codon positions. These mutations are expected to eventually raise to high-enough levels and lead to impaired mitochondrial function in a manner similar to the threshold effect seen in human mtDNA disease. The data generated from this experimental model will allow us to build more accurate molecular models of mtDNA evolution and aid the understanding of inheritance patterns of human mtDNA disease mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse strains and generation of mouse lines.</title><p>Heterozygous knock-in male mice (<italic>PolgA<sup>mut</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060010-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d; were crossed to C57Bl/6NCrl females (Charles River Laboratories).
