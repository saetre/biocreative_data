Further investigation of 14 &#x003b1;-like (<italic>Abpa</italic>) and 13 &#x003b2;- or &#x003b3;-like (<italic>Abpbg</italic>) undisrupted gene sequences revealed a rich diversity of developmental stage-, sex- and tissue-specific expression. Despite these studies, our understanding of the evolution of this gene family remains incomplete. Questions arise from imperfections in the initial mouse genome assembly and a dearth of information about the gene family structure in other rodents and mammals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we interrogate the latest 'finished' mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) genome sequence assembly to show that the <italic>Abp </italic>gene repertoire is, in fact, twice as large as reported previously, with 30 <italic>Abpa </italic>and 34 <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes and pseudogenes. All of these have arisen since the last common ancestor with rat (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>). We then demonstrate, by sequencing homologs from species within the <italic>Mus </italic>genus, that this burst of gene duplication occurred very recently, within the past seven million years. Finally, we survey <italic>Abp </italic>orthologs in genomes from across the mammalian clade and show that bursts of <italic>Abp </italic>gene duplications are not specific to the murid rodents; they also occurred recently in the lagomorph (rabbit, <italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>) and ruminant (cattle, <italic>Bos taurus</italic>) lineages, although not in other mammalian taxa.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that <italic>Abp </italic>genes have undergone repeated bursts of gene duplication and adaptive sequence diversification driven by these genes' participation in chemosensation and/or sexual identification.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Approximately 90% of genes in the dog (<italic>Canis familiaris</italic>), mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), and human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) genomes have been preserved without duplication, disruption or deletion, since their last common ancestors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The remaining ~10% of genes, representing the volatile portion of the mammalian gene complement, in general possess functions that are very different from those of the conserved gene set: they are substantially enriched in functions contributing to chemosensation, reproduction, immunity, host defense and toxin degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Moreover, gene families, such as those containing olfactory or vomeronasal receptors, immunoglobulin domain-containing proteins, or cytochromes P450 that are expanded in one lineage are often expanded in another. This likely reflects similar evolutionary responses to similar environmental challenges.</p><p>Some among us contributed to initial analyses of the draft mouse genome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] by identifying mouse-specific gene duplications that remained unduplicated in the human genome. We argued that such genes contribute disproportionately to biology that is specific to the rodent lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One of these mouse-specific clusters includes homologs of the &#x003b1;-subunit of the androgen-binding protein (ABP) which was of particular interest owing to evidence that ABP mediates sexual selection in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Others among us have investigated the biochemical, genetic, molecular and physiological functions, and evolution of ABP molecules since the 1980s. These investigations revealed that the ABP heterodimer consists of an &#x003b1;-subunit (encoded by the <italic>Abpa </italic>gene), disulfide-bridged to either a &#x003b2;- or a &#x003b3;-subunit (encoded by <italic>Abpb </italic>or <italic>Abpg</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), and that <italic>Abp </italic>genes evolved rapidly, potentially because of positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In common with all other members of the secretoglobin family to which they belong, ABP subunits have not unequivocally been assigned molecular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Upon combining our research efforts, we first performed a more detailed comparative analysis of <italic>Abp </italic>gene orthologs in the mouse, rat (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>), chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) and human draft genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These analyses established that <italic>Abp </italic>sequences, present within human and chimpanzee regions of conserved synteny, have acquired disruptions to their reading frames and these are highly likely to be pseudogenes. Mouse <italic>Abp </italic>genes appear to have been subject to positive selection with coding sequences acquiring greater numbers of nucleotide substitutions than their introns. Surprisingly, mouse <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes were found all to be monophyletic with respect to families of orthologs from either rat or wood mouse (<italic>Apodemus</italic>). This is consistent with multiple duplications of <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes occurring independently in each of the mouse, rat and <italic>Apodemus </italic>lineages, and with the genome of the last ancestor common to rodents and primates containing only single versions of <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes. It is also consistent with the presence, in the cat genome, of single adjacent <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>orthologs, whose protein products form a heterodimer termed Fel dI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In a subsequent study, we investigated the spatiotemporal expression of seventeen <italic>Abp </italic>genes, and concluded that differential expression patterns of mouse <italic>Abp </italic>genes reflect an animal's gender and sexual maturity status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The mouse genome assembly is substantially improved: it is now essentially complete and is of high accuracy (Mouse Genome Sequence Finishing Consortium, submitted). The draft mouse genome previously analyzed (NCBI build 30, mm3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] contained four large (&#x0003e;5 kb) gaps, into which we now realize fall many hitherto unrecognized <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>paralogues. We were interested in whether these paralogues arose more rapidly than the genome-wide average, for primates and rodents, of 1 duplicate gene fixed per hundred million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the absence of genome sequences from more closely related species, we sequenced <italic>Abpa </italic>homologs from three <italic>Mus musculus </italic>subspecies (<italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>, <italic>M. m. musculus </italic>and <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic>) and three other species within the genus <italic>Mus </italic>(<italic>M. spretus</italic>, <italic>M. caroli</italic>, and <italic>M. pahari </italic>&#x02013; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for a phylogeny). <italic>M. musculus </italic>and <italic>M. spretus </italic>represent the Palearctic clade, <italic>M. caroli </italic>is an Asian species serving as an outgroup to the Palearctic species, whereas <italic>Mus pahari </italic>(a.k.a. <italic>Coelomys</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) serves as an outgroup to the subgenus <italic>Mus</italic>; these species all diverged from a common ancestor more than seven million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our finding of single <italic>M. pahari </italic>orthologs of multiple <italic>Mus musculus Abpa </italic>genes thus supports the rapid duplication of these <italic>Mus </italic>genes within the last seven million years.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A canonical phylogeny of murid rodents (adapted from [20]).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2148-8-46-1"/></fig><p>As the common ancestor of murid rodents appeared to contain only a single pair of <italic>Abp </italic>genes and because gene duplication events are relatively rare, we predict that single <italic>Abpa</italic>-like and <italic>Abpbg</italic>-like genes will also be present in the genomes of most other eutherian mammals, and of metatherians, such as the opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>). The recent availability of draft assemblies of many species' genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] provides an opportunity to investigate this prediction. While our methodology provides slight underestimates of the numbers of <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>paralogues and precludes definitive assignment of predicted sequences as genes or pseudogenes, here we report identification of the expected single pair of <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes in genome assemblies for multiple diverse mammals. Interestingly, we identified considerably more such paralogues in two mammals, rabbit and cattle, hinting that <italic>Abp </italic>genes have been the substrate for frequent duplication in lineages beyond the murid rodents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Rodent gene predictions and nomenclature</title><p>We revisited the <italic>Abp </italic>region of the mouse (C57BL/6J strain) genome sequence considering that a recent assembly (mm8; February 2006) might contain genes that had been hidden within the gaps of the 2002 initial draft assembly (mm2). We report that this region is now free of sequence gaps. By comparing new (mm8) and old (mm2) genome assemblies we identified 41 <italic>Abp </italic>genes in a large (~1.8 Mb) contiguous segment that had presented difficulties when originally assembled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The mouse <italic>Abp </italic>gene region is now seen to be 3 Mb in size, approximately twice as large as previously estimated, and 6-fold larger than estimated for the orthologous region in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Pipmaker [61] dot plot of Abp-containing regions for the mm2 and mm8 assemblies of the mouse (C57BL6/J) genome sequence. Transposable element sequences have been masked in order to emphasize this region's coding sequences. Two grey shaded regions represent gaps in the earlier mm2 assembly. The second of these can be now seen, in mm8, to harbour a large number of <italic>Abp </italic>genes that were absent from mm2. Predicted genes and pseudogenes are indicated as filled and unfilled triangles, respectively. <italic>Abpa </italic>paralogues are shown in blue and <italic>Abpbg </italic>paralogues are shown in red.

More recent, <italic>Mus </italic>lineage-specific, duplications are represented by smaller colored rectangles embedded within the outlined rectangles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2148-8-46-2"/></fig><p><italic>Abp </italic>genes were originally described as <italic>Abpa </italic>(alpha subunit; A), <italic>Abpb </italic>(beta subunit; B) and <italic>Abpg </italic>(gamma subunit; G), based on the identification of the three ABP subunits in two different dimeric combinations: AB and AG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The three genes were mapped on the proximal end of mouse chromosome 7 in a study that also demonstrated that <italic>Abpb </italic>and <italic>Abpg </italic>are closely related, both in exon/intron structure and in sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. When it became apparent that multiple copies of <italic>Abpa </italic>and of <italic>Abpb/Abpg </italic>exist in the genomes of mouse and rat, with 5'-5' orientations of pairs of <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg</italic>, the nomenclature was modified to represent <italic>Abpb </italic>and <italic>Abpg </italic>as <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The mouse <italic>Abp </italic>region contains a total of 30 <italic>Abpa </italic>and 34 <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes or pseudogenes (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for cDNA sequences and gene locations), over twice the numbers we reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the report that follows, we distinguished the <italic>Abpa </italic>paralogues obtained from the mouse genome from those we derived from wild-derived rodent taxa by designating them "B6" (an abbreviation of C57BL/6, the source strain for the mouse genome project). New B6 paralogues reported here are designated in bold typeface. Twelve of the 30 <italic>Abpa </italic>genes and 19 of the 34 <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes have missense or nonsense mutations in an exon, while four <italic>Abpa </italic>and three <italic>Abpbg </italic>paralogues have non-canonical splice sites (all marked as pseudogenes on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; details in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). We recognize that pseudogenes that possess full-length open reading frames are mis-assigned as functional genes by this method. It is also possible that one or more of those we have designated pseudogenes could be expressed. Of note is the paralogue B6_<italic>bg2 </italic>(previously numbered <italic>Abpbg</italic>2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), which has a deletion eliminating a conserved stop codon that allows the protein sequence to be extended by two extra amino-acid residues before ending in a non-conserved stop codon. We have assigned this paralogue gene status because we have identified transcripts by RT-PCR for this gene in numerous tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and have found at least 10 <italic>Mus musculus </italic>ESTs for this slightly longer version in the <italic>Mus musculus </italic>EST database (CK616889 and others). Others working on Swiss-Webster mice reported a different change at the 3' end of this paralogue (AY370634), supporting the possibility of strain-specific polymorphisms within this gene.</p><p>Consistent with previous observations, the majority of the newly-predicted genes are located in <italic>Abpa</italic>-<italic>Abpbg </italic>pairs, and are likely to be transcribed in opposite, head-to-head (i.e. 5'-5') arrangements. Our original gene sequence and pair assignments are likewise essentially unchanged from our initial report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We number the <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>paralogues by their sequential occurrence in <italic>Abpa</italic>-<italic>Abpbg </italic>gene pairs along the chromosome (i.e., B6_<italic>Abpa1</italic>-B6_<italic>Abpbg</italic>1, B6_<italic>a2</italic>-B6_<italic>bg2</italic>, etc.; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) despite this resulting in the reassignment of some gene names (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for current and previous designations).</p></sec><sec><title>The Abp gene cluster in other rodent taxa</title><p>The most recent rat genome assembly (rn4; November 2004) contains only three <italic>Abpa</italic>-<italic>Abpbg </italic>gene pairs in a region spanning ~0.2 Mb of chromosome 1 (RNO1), which is ten times fewer than the <italic>Abp </italic>genes distributed over ~3 Mb of the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 7 (MMU7). Originally, we reported that one of the six rat paralogues was a pseudogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, we have since discovered a cDNA with a single base sequence change in that gene which eliminates a frameshift mutation resulting from an additional A nucleotide in a run of A's (Laukaitis and Karn, unpublished). Although this region of the rat genome assembly contains many gaps (including 5 contig gaps) there is no evidence, as there was for previous mouse assemblies, from unplaced genomic and cDNA sequences for additional <italic>Abp </italic>gene paralogues.</p><p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the second introns (of length ~800 bp) available from the mouse (genome: "B6"), rat (genome), <italic>Apodemus</italic>, <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>, <italic>M. m. musculus</italic>, <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic>, <italic>M. spretus</italic>, <italic>M. caroli </italic>and <italic>M. pahari </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> for intron sequences). As noted in Materials and Methods, this is the first report of intron sequences from <italic>Apodemus</italic>. The <italic>Abpa </italic>genes in <italic>Mus musculus, Apodemus </italic>and <italic>Rattus </italic>cluster separately into three monophyletic clades, indicating that the mouse, <italic>Apodemus </italic>and rat <italic>Abp </italic>gene complements arose by duplication independently from single <italic>Abpa </italic>or <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes in the last common ancestor; this is consistent with our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, whether these rodent <italic>Abp </italic>gene duplications were relatively contemporaneous, or whether they were more uniformly distributed over time, remained unclear.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Panel A: NJ phylogeny of intron 2 from rodent <italic>Abpa </italic>genes.

Thereafter, we used Southern blotting to interrogate genomic DNA from different rodent taxa using <italic>Abpa </italic>probes from <italic>M. m. domesticus </italic>and <italic>M. pahari </italic>paralogues. We chose to focus on <italic>Abpa </italic>genes, because extensive repeats of single bases in <italic>Abpbg </italic>introns ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and Karn, unpublished) make it difficult to amplify and sequence. Since most <italic>Abpa </italic>genes are paired with single <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes, our results are also relevant to <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes. The effectiveness of each of these methods necessarily depends on the evolutionary divergence between <italic>Abpa </italic>probe sequences and the other rodent taxa being studied. Such approaches resulted in the identification and partial sequencing of two <italic>Abpa </italic>genes in <italic>M. pahari</italic>, six in <italic>M. caroli</italic>, and five each in <italic>M. spretus</italic>, <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic>, <italic>M. m. musculus</italic>, and <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>.</p><p>By manually reconciling the known species phylogeny (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) with a phylogeny of these genes and pseudogenes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we deduce that many of the 30 mouse genome <italic>Abpa </italic>genes and pseudogenes arose by duplications within the <italic>Mus </italic>subgenus clade. The basal positions of each of the <italic>Rattus</italic>, <italic>Apodemus </italic>or <italic>M. pahari </italic>clades indicate that the last common ancestor of <italic>Mus</italic>, <italic>Apodemus</italic>, and <italic>Rattus </italic>contained only one <italic>Abpa </italic>gene.

We calculate that these duplication events occurred between 400,000 and 2.8 million years ago, although the low divergences for introns from some of these paralogues suggest even more recent duplication events. We considered, and eventually discarded, the possibility that gene conversion has caused the low divergence of these intron sequences. For the <italic>B6_a27 </italic>clade (previously reported as <italic>Abpa11</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and, originally, <italic>Abpa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]), two <italic>M. caroli </italic>paralogues cluster as outgroups, suggesting a <italic>M. caroli</italic>-specific duplication event.

Similarly, single gene pairs, at most, were found for four species (little brown bat, horse, dog, and cat) whose lineages arose prior to the last common ancestor of primates and rodents.

Two <italic>Monodelphis Abpa </italic>genes appear to have arisen from duplication within the metatherian lineage, as evidenced by their relatively low divergence at synonymous sites (K<sub>S </sub>= 0.06). <italic>Abp </italic>genes, on the other hand, were not detected in the draft platypus genome, but we cannot exclude that sequence divergence disfavours their prediction using the methods we employed. Alternatively, <italic>Abp </italic>genes may simply lie within the ~10% of its genome that is absent from the current assembly.</p><p>By way of contrast, the genomes of two further species each contain independent expansions of <italic>Abp </italic>genes. The rabbit genome assembly contains 43 <italic>Abpa </italic>or <italic>Abpbg </italic>sequences, whereas the cattle genome assembly contains 18 such homologs. <italic>Abpa</italic>-<italic>Abpbg </italic>gene pairs are observed in head-to-head (5'-5') arrangements on 7 and 4 occasions within cattle and rabbit contig sequences. Rabbit gene paralogues are more closely related (maximum K<sub>S </sub>= 0.16) than they are to closely-related orthologs in other species (guinea pig or squirrel minimum K<sub>S </sub>= 0.78 and K<sub>S </sub>= 0.97, respectively). Similarly, cattle paralogues are more closely related (maximum K<sub>S </sub>= 0.49) to each other, than they are to their dog or cat orthologs (minimum K<sub>S </sub>= 0.74 and 0.51, respectively). We infer, therefore, that expansions of <italic>Abp </italic>genes have occurred independently in the cattle and rabbit lineages.</p><p>In the macaque genome assembly, we were able to identify neither an <italic>Abpbg </italic>exon 1 (which is all that is discernible in the human and chimpanzee genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), nor an <italic>Abpa </italic>gene. Although it remains possible that <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes or pseudogenes fall into gaps that are present in the syntenic region of the current macaque genome assembly, evidence for these homologues was also not forthcoming from searches of the macaque trace sequence reads. We are yet unable, therefore, to delineate definitively the time-points in the primate lineage at which <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes acquired deleterious mutations.</p><p>We determined that the numbers of <italic>Abp </italic>genes present in the 2-fold coverage genome assemblies represented reliable estimates and were not adversely affected by large-scale duplications confounding the accurate assembly of trace sequence reads. For each species we aligned the nucleotide sequences of <italic>Abpa </italic>genes' second exons with all available trace sequences using MegaBLAST. For those 2-fold coverage genome assemblies (for armadillo, tree shrew, squirrel, microbat and cat) with only single <italic>Abpa </italic>(pseudo)genes, only 5.6 traces on average (range 2&#x02013;14), were returned (representing, on average, 6.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>of sequences in the trace archive for these species). For rabbit, by contrast, 140 traces were returned, on average (representing 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>of rabbit sequences in the trace archive). The trace archive thus contains evidence for approximately 20-fold more <italic>Abpa </italic>genes or pseudogenes in the rabbit genome than present in the genomes of tree shrew, squirrel, microbat and cat despite these all, including rabbit, having been sequenced at 2-fold coverage. Further evaluation to confirm ascertainment of all gene copies by synteny-based methods is not possible with low-coverage genomes owing to contigs not being placed on chromosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Positive selection on Abpa and Abpbg paralogs in various species</title><p>The presence of sites under positive selection was established for either <italic>Abpa </italic>or <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes from all mammals we considered, using a log likelihood ratio test comparing paired models M7/M8 and M1/M2 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).

The large number of evolutionarily very recent duplications generated many virtually identical sequence regions that proved impossible to assemble for the initial mouse draft genome (mm2).</p><p>Although we have, thus far, only considered gene duplication, the homogeneity of <italic>Abpa </italic>genes we observe might also have arisen because of non-allelic gene conversion, as previously observed for interferon-alpha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and globin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] genes, for example. Nevertheless, we discount this explanation by inspecting the phylogenetic tree of ribosomal protein L23a pseudogenes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>), which frequently appear to have co-duplicated with <italic>Abpa</italic>-<italic>Abpbg </italic>gene pairs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); these duplications are of recent origin since similar sequences are absent from the syntenic region in the rat.

Despite expectations that mammalian genes are duplicated and fixed once every 100 million years, and acquire inactivating mutations after approximately 7 million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we observe a highly-unusual expansion of a gene family from 5 to 30 members within only 7 million years.</p><p>We previously observed expression of six <italic>Abpa </italic>paralogues and five <italic>Abpbg </italic>paralogues in ten glands and other organs located predominantly in the head and neck (olfactory lobe of the brain, three salivary glands, lacrimal gland, Harderian gland, vomeronasal organ, and major olfactory epithelium; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). We positively identified PCR products in this expression study by comparing their sequences to those of the paralogues from which the primers were developed. Nonetheless, because the new paralogues' sequences are often closely-related to those used to develop the expression primers, we identified, using the UCSC genome browser's <italic>in silico </italic>PCR resource (February 2006 assembly), which of the new paralogues that would have been amplified with these primers, were they expressed. Only the original <italic>Abpa13 </italic>(now <italic>B6_a29</italic>) primer pair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] amplified additional paralogues beyond that for which they were designed.

These unusual changes could be strain-specific changes (e.g. between C3H/HeJ and C57BL6/J) or very new pseudogenization events where control regions have not yet acquired mutations that silence transcription.

Further, interrogating Southern blots with probes developed from the two <italic>M. pahari </italic>paralogues revealed other <italic>M. pahari </italic>paralogues that were not seen when the blots were probed with <italic>M. m. domesticus </italic>probes and that were not discovered in the PCR-based gene finding experiments. These could reflect an expansion of the <italic>Abpa </italic>gene cluster that is, at least in part, unique to <italic>M. pahari</italic>. This suggests that the common ancestor of <italic>M. pahari </italic>and the subgenus <italic>Mus </italic>possessed a cluster of genes, some of which may have been duplicated separately in both the subgenus <italic>Mus </italic>and <italic>M. pahari </italic>lineages and some of which may have been expanded in the <italic>M. pahari </italic>lineage alone. In the event that their sequences become available, the additional bands in <italic>M. pahari </italic>Southern blots may be associated with other clusters of subgenus <italic>Mus </italic>paralogues. While there may be as yet undiscovered <italic>Apodemus </italic>lineage-specific paralogues, these would not be close relatives of <italic>Mus </italic>genes owing to our inability to detect them by either of the methods we used.</p><p>The genome of the last common ancestor of <italic>Mus </italic>and <italic>M. pahari </italic>harbored only approximately five <italic>Abpa </italic>genes. This conclusion is drawn from the branching orders of the two sequenced <italic>M. pahari Abpa </italic>genes and the 30 mouse genome <italic>Abpa </italic>genes and pseudogenes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Of five clades, two possess <italic>M. pahari </italic>genes as outgroups, flanking numerous <italic>Mus</italic>-specific genes as ingroups. The genes from each of the five clades lie in contiguous genomic sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) implying that sequence duplications of <italic>Abpa </italic>(and, by inference, their partner <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes) generated neighboring tandem duplications. From the <italic>Abpa </italic>phylogeny (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and from their order on the chromosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), we predict that of the five <italic>Abpa </italic>genes predicted to be in the common ancestor of <italic>Mus </italic>and <italic>M. pahari </italic>one duplicated to generate B6_<italic>a1 </italic>and B6_<italic>a2 </italic>(formerly <italic>Abpa1 </italic>and <italic>Abpa2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), a second duplicated on numerous occasions leading to <bold>B6_<italic>a3</italic>-</bold><italic>23 </italic>(all herein are new paralogues except B6_<italic>a21-23 </italic>which were previously numbered as <italic>Abpa5-7 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) and B6_<italic>a28</italic>-<italic>29 </italic>(previously <italic>Abpa12 </italic>and <italic>Abpa13</italic>), a third and a fourth (corresponding to B6_<italic>a24 </italic>and B6_<italic>a25; </italic>formerly <italic>Abpa8 </italic>and <italic>Abpa9 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) remained unduplicated, and the fifth duplicated to yield B6_<italic>a26</italic>-<italic>27 </italic>and B6_<italic>a30 </italic>(formerly <italic>Abpa10-11 </italic>and <italic>Abpa14 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), all in the <italic>Mus </italic>lineage and within an estimated time span of 7 MY.</p><p>Deletion, as well as duplication, events are likely to have shaped this region of the mouse genome. Establishing evidence for this is more problematic for unassembled genomes for which it is unknown whether the absence of a gene represents a deletion or simply a lack of sequencing of that region. However, we reject the possibility that rapid birth and death (pseudogenisation) processes are sufficient to explain our striking finding of independent expansions. First, searches of the trace server archives failed to find additional sequences whose high duplication content confounds assembly. Second, the ability of our prediction algorithms to identify divergent genes and pseudogenes (K<sub>S </sub>&#x0003e; 0.97 between rabbit genes and their single ortholog) in distant species provides confidence in their ability to identify even rapidly evolving genes. Third, we have found evidence for retained, but potentially pseudogenized genes that have changed splice sites. Thus, the speed of evolution of this genomic region would not be expected to result in removal of all inactive paralogous gene copies. Nevertheless, in those lineages that have experienced much gene duplication, it is likely that many deletions of genes, by non-allelic homologous recombination, have also occurred.</p><p>The picture arising from these data suggests a fascinating scenario in which <italic>Abp </italic>duplications occurred independently in the three lineages leading to <italic>Rattus</italic>, to <italic>Apodemus </italic>and to <italic>Mus</italic>. This was followed by a more complex evolutionary history in the genus <italic>Mus</italic>, in which at least two <italic>Abpa </italic>genes further duplicated to produce additional paralogues in the subgenus <italic>Mus </italic>lineage while other paralogues duplicated independently in the <italic>M. pahari </italic>lineage. Additionally interesting points include: 1) <italic>M. caroli </italic>appears to have duplicated its <italic>Abpa27 </italic>paralogue independently of the other species, suggesting that unique gene duplications may have taken place in some lineages of the subgenus; 2) An orthologue of <italic>Abpa30 </italic>was observed in each species we investigated, in spite of the fact that it is one of the few <italic>Abpa </italic>paralogues unpaired with an <italic>Abpbg </italic>in the mouse genome and is a pseudogene; 3) The <italic>M. m. musculus Abpa27 </italic>paralogue unexpectedly lies outside the <italic>M. spretus </italic>node. This was described previously by Karn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], who noted an unexpected resemblance between the Palearctic species (<italic>M. m. musculus </italic>excluded) when comparing divergence levels between an <italic>Abpa </italic>intron and single copy number DNA. They hypothesized that this pattern was due to secondary genetic exchanges along the lineages leading to the Palearctic species.</p></sec><sec><title>Independent expansions of Abp have occurred in non-rodent taxa</title><p>Our prediction of <italic>Abp </italic>genes in <italic>Monodelphis </italic>demonstrates that these were not a eutherian invention, but were present in the last common ancestor of eutherians and metatherians, approximately 180 MYA. The presence of, at most, one <italic>Abpa </italic>or <italic>Abpbg </italic>gene in most eutherian genomes is most parsimoniously explained by only single versions of these genes in the genome of the earliest eutherian mammal. This single <italic>Abpa</italic>-<italic>Abpbg </italic>gene pair appears to have been conserved in active form in most mammalian lineages (e.g., cat and dog), but was silenced by pseudogenization in primates (represented in this study by bushbaby, chimpanzee and human). By contrast, <italic>Abp </italic>evolutionary history in <italic>Mus</italic>, <italic>Rattus</italic>, <italic>Apodemus</italic>, rabbit and cattle lineages is characterized by rapid and independent expansions of these gene families by gene duplication, with some of the paralogues remaining active and some likely being silenced.</p><p>We believe it unlikely that the large numbers of gene predictions in the rabbit assembly arose solely because of errors arising from two-fold statistical coverage. The nucleotide error rate and heterozygosity present in the animals sequenced, taken together, are insufficient to explain the high number of sequence-different paralogues we found. Indeed, the ~74% genome sampling from two-fold coverage sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] should result in an under-estimate, not an over-estimate, of the gene count. Finally, in this study we have inspected a large number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] of two-fold coverage genome sequences, all of which have been sequenced and assembled using similar methods, and yet for these we often observe either one or no paralogues. In particular, we discount the possibility that the two-fold coverage genome of rabbit might, by chance, have sampled a single locus to generate a total of 38 sequence-distinct <italic>Abpa </italic>sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Mouse is the only organism in which an extensive survey of <italic>Abp </italic>gene expression has been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Expression of many <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>paralogues were noted, primarily in glands of the face and neck. Expression in the organs otherwise appeared to be restricted to prostate and ovaries; only a single EST has been found in mouse skin. The single <italic>Abpa</italic>/<italic>Abpbg </italic>gene pairs in the house cat (<italic>Fel dI</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]) and, possibly, the dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] are expressed in salivary glands and sebaceous glands of the skin. Both the cat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] coat their pelts with <italic>Abp </italic>during grooming. Cattle <italic>Abp </italic>sequences and similar sequences in sheep and goat have been found in skin EST libraries (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>). Skin glands are known to be pheromone sources in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and the minimal <italic>Abp </italic>gene expression in mouse skin suggests that this source has been supplanted in rodents by the complex, multi-gland expression in the face and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. ABP thus provides the potential to present an olfactory profile for an animal of the same or a closely related species. In primates, however, these genes are conspicuously silent, suggesting a shift to a reliance on visual cues.</p><p>It is clear that <italic>Abp </italic>genes have diverged widely through evolutionary time, both in sequence and in gene copy number, and remain under the influence of positive selection, which has shaped the gene family in rodents. Other gene families shaped by positive selection include those involved in chemosensation, pathogen defense and sexual identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We previously proposed that <italic>Abp </italic>is involved in chemosensation and/or sexual identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Different organisms have devised different physiological mechanisms for accomplishing this function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and this is reflected in the evolutionary history of the relevant genes (e.g., lineage-specific duplications in V1R vomeronasal receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]). Both the finding of different positively-selected sites in different organisms with <italic>Abp </italic>expansions, as well as the independent gene duplication events, reflect the effect these diverse mechanisms of evolutionary adaptation have exerted on <italic>Abpa</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified 30 <italic>Abpa </italic>and 34 <italic>Abpbg </italic>genes or pseudogenes in a 3 Mb region of mouse chromosome 7.

High scoring alignments were re-aligned against the previous multiple sequence alignments. Manual curation of multiple genomic DNA sequence alignments was performed to ensure: (a) that the third exon, containing only a short portion of rapidly evolving coding sequence, was predicted correctly and without exons from different loci being inadvertently joined in erroneous gene predictions, and (b) that we were able to identify splice site consensus dinucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>Predicting Abpa and Abpbg genes from other mammalian genome assemblies</title><p>The following 17 genome sequence assemblies were also searched for the presence of <italic>Abpa </italic>or <italic>Abpbg </italic>orthologous genes: Guinea pig (<italic>Cavia porcellus</italic>); Ground squirrel (<italic>Spermophilus tridecemlineatus</italic>); European rabbit (<italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>); Tree Shrew (<italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>); Bushbaby (<italic>Otolemur garnetti</italic>); Common Shrew (<italic>Sorex araneus</italic>); European hedgehog (<italic>Erinaceus europaeus</italic>); Little brown bat (<italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>); Cattle (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) at 7.1-fold coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; Cat (<italic>Felis catus</italic>); Dog (<italic>Canis familiaris</italic>) at 7.6-fold coverage; Nine-banded armadillo (<italic>Dasypus novemcinctus</italic>); Lesser hedgehog (tenrec; <italic>Echinops telfairi</italic>); African savannah elephant (<italic>Loxodonta africana</italic>); Horse (<italic>Equus caballus</italic>) at 6.8-fold coverage; South American opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>) at 6.5-fold coverage; and Duck-billed platypus (<italic>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</italic>) at 6-fold coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p><italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>transcripts in these genomes were predicted on the basis of homology to a set of template protein sequences (see below) using the program Exonerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Transcript prediction proceeded in two steps: (1) Genomic regions containing putative transcripts of <italic>Abp </italic>were identified first using Exonerate in heuristic mode (options: &#x02013; maxintron 50000 &#x02013; proteinwordthreshold 3 &#x02013; proteinhspdropoff 5 &#x02013; proteinwordlen 5 &#x02013; score 80); and, (2) Transcripts were then predicted using Exonerate in Genewise mode (-exhaustive) in all regions identified in step 1, but extended by 150 kb on either side. Identical predictions of transcripts were removed and overlapping transcripts were combined into individual genes.</p><p>For each genome, prediction of <italic>Abp </italic>genes was initiated with experimentally well-established mouse &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;/&#x003b3; peptide reference sequences (NP_987098, NP_033726, NP_919319, and NP_840093). After a first round of gene prediction, predictions arising from all species' genomes were added to these four reference sequences (above), and the entire process of gene prediction was repeated. Parameters used for Exonerate searches were optimized specifically for <italic>Abp </italic>gene predictions resulting, for each species, in sequences with matched intron-exon boundaries. Further manual intervention ensured, for example, that dog predictions were orthologous to those in the house cat (<italic>Fel dI</italic>).</p><p>Exonerate often failed to predict the short third exon of <italic>Abpa </italic>genes (~9 codons). In order to arrive at complete transcripts, we re-predicted all transcripts with Genewise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] using separate hidden Markov models of the first two exons and of the third exon. If the first two exons were successfully predicted, a search for the third exon was initiated in the 5 kb downstream segment. On success, the two predictions were combined into a single transcript. The hidden Markov models were constructed using HMMer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] from the coding sequences of the manually curated multiple sequence alignment of the mouse and rat <italic>Abp </italic>genomic DNA alignments (including novel predictions from the mm8 mouse genome assembly). This step also served as a filter for spurious predictions because those not yielding alignments using Genewise were discarded. Genewise exhibits a bias towards producing artefactual undisrupted coding sequences when faced with frameshifts or in-frame stop codons, which were likewise culled by manual curation. In order to decrease the possibility of missing paralogues in unassembled sequence data, we looked for additional copies with species-specific searches of the trace archive used MegaBLAST at the National Center for Biotechnology Information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and default parameters, as well as using evidence from known cDNA or EST sequences. This was also used to search for evidence of expression of paralogues with non-canonical splice sites.</p><p><italic>Abp </italic>gene predictions in the target genome were classified as members of either the <italic>Abpa </italic>or <italic>Abpbg </italic>family using HMMer and HMMs derived from mouse and rat <italic>Abp </italic>coding sequences (see above).

B6_<italic>a2 </italic>and B6_<italic>a27 </italic>were selected because they are located close to the two extremities of the mouse ~3 Mb <italic>Abp </italic>genomic region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Probes were labeled by random-primed incorporation of &#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P-dATP into PCR products using a modification of the Amersham (Piscataway, NJ) Mega Prime random-primed system and protocol. For a 25 &#x003bc;l reaction, 10% of a 25 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction was used as template and was mixed with 1 &#x003bc;l of each of the original 10 &#x003bc;M forward and reverse PCR primers as well as 2.5 &#x003bc;l of the Mega Prime random primer mix. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a QiaQick PCR clean-up kit and the probe was boiled for 5 min in 5 ml of hybridization solution, followed by 2 min of incubation on ice, before being placed on the edge of the blot and incubated at 60&#x000b0;C overnight. Subsequently, the blot was washed with an increasingly stringent series of washes, using 5&#x000d7; to 0.1 &#x000d7; SSC and 0.1% SDS, which produced consistent bands with a decrease in background at higher stringency. Blots were exposed to Kodak x-ray film for 18 hours to 15 days between washes and were stripped for re-probing using two fifteen minute washes of boiling 0.1 &#x000d7; SSC/0.1% SDS. Gels were scanned with a Nikon scanner and prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop v. 7.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression analysis of Abp paralogues</title><p>The BLAST algorithm of the NCBI genome browser was used to identify mouse ESTs, using the <italic>Abpa </italic>and <italic>Abpbg </italic>cDNAs reported here as search strings.
