GUN4 (GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4) stimulates chlorophyll biosynthesis by activating Mg-chelatase, the enzyme that commits porphyrins to the chlorophyll branch. GUN4 stimulates Mg-chelatase by a mechanism that involves binding the ChlH subunit of Mg-chelatase, as well as a substrate (protoporphyrin IX) and product (Mg-protoporphyrin IX) of Mg-chelatase. We chose to test whether GUN4 might also affect interactions between Mg-chelatase and chloroplast membranes, the site of chlorophyll biosynthesis. To test this idea, we induced chlorophyll precursor levels in purified pea chloroplasts by feeding these chloroplasts with 5-aminolevulinic acid, determined the relative levels of GUN4 and Mg-chelatase subunits in soluble and membrane-containing fractions derived from these chloroplasts, and quantitated Mg-chelatase activity in membranes isolated from these chloroplasts. We also monitored GUN4 levels in the soluble and membrane-containing fractions derived from chloroplasts fed with various porphyrins. Our results indicate that 5-aminolevulinic acid feeding stimulates Mg-chelatase activity in chloroplast membranes and that the porphyrin-bound forms of GUN4 and possibly ChlH associate most stably with chloroplast membranes. These findings are consistent with GUN4 stimulating chlorophyll biosynthesis not only by activating Mg-chelatase but also by promoting interactions between ChlH and chloroplast membranes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Chlorophylls are produced from a branched pathway located within plastids that also produces heme, siroheme, and phytochromobilin. In photosynthetic organisms, the universal tetrapyrrole precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> is derived from glutamyl-tRNA and subsequently converted into protoporphyrinogen IX in the chloroplast stroma. Protoporphyrinogen IX is converted to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) and then ultimately to chlorophylls on plastid membranes. Almost all the genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes have been identified. Transcriptional control provides coarse regulation of this pathway, and the regulation of enzyme activities provides fine regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Arabidopsis GUN4 (hereafter referred to as GUN4) was identified from a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). GUN4 is a major positive regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis but is not absolutely required for the accumulation of chlorophyll in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, one of the GUN4 relatives, <italic>sll0558</italic> (hereafter referred to as SynGUN4), was subsequently shown also to be required for the accumulation of chlorophyll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The 140-kDa subunit of Mg-chelatase copurifies with the 22-kDa GUN4 from solubilized Arabidopsis thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>); similar results were subsequently reported using <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Mg-chelatase catalyzes the insertion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> into PPIX, yielding Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-PPIX). This reaction diverts PPIX from heme biosynthesis and commits this porphyrin to chlorophyll biosynthesis. Mg-chelatase requires three subunits <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These three subunits are conserved from prokaryotes to plants and are commonly referred to as BchH or ChlH, BchD or ChlD, and BchI or ChlI. In Arabidopsis, these subunits are 140, 79, and 40 kDa, respectively. ChlH is the porphyrin-binding subunit and is likely the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding subunit of Mg-chelatase. ChlI and ChlD are related to AAA-type ATPases and form two associating hexameric rings that interact with ChlH and drive the ATP-dependent metalation of PPIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). SynGUN4 stimulates <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Mg-chelatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Cyanobacterial relatives of GUN4 bind deuteroporphyrin IX (DPIX) and Mg-deuteroporphyrin IX (Mg-DPIX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), which are more water-soluble derivatives of PPIX and Mg-PPIX. Crystal structures of SynGUN4 and <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic> GUN4 indicate a novel fold that resembles a &#x0201c;cupped hand&#x0201d; that binds DPIX and Mg-DPIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Preincubation experiments indicate that a SynGUN4-DPIX complex stimulates Mg-chelatase more potently than SynGUN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). SynGUN4 was found to lower the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic><sup>DPIX</sup> of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Mg-chelatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and to cause a striking increase in the apparent first-order rate constant for DPIX-Mg-chelatase interactions, an effect that is particularly striking at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The Mg-DPIX binding activity of SynGUN4 was also found to be essential for stimulating Mg-chelatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>GUN4 and Mg-chelatase subunits have been found in both soluble and membrane-containing fractions of purified chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In contrast, protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PO) and Mg-PPIX methyltransferase (Mg-PPIX MT), which function immediately upstream and downstream of Mg-chelatase in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, are found only in the membrane-containing fractions and not in stromal fractions when purified chloroplasts are lysed and fractionated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). PPIX and Mg-PPIX accumulate in chloroplast membranes rather than soluble fractions, which provides more evidence that these chlorophyll precursors are synthesized on chloroplast membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). If GUN4 promotes chlorophyll biosynthesis by not only stimulating Mg-chelatase activity but also promoting the formation of enzyme complexes that channel porphyrins into chlorophyll biosynthesis, GUN4 would be expected to more stably associate with chloroplast membranes by interacting with chloroplast membrane lipids or chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes after binding porphyrins.

Ni-NTA-agarose was poured into an Econo-Pac column (Bio-Rad), and proteins were step-eluted using buffer B (20 m<sc>m</sc> Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 500 m<sc>m</sc> potassium acetate, 250 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, 20 m<sc>m</sc> &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol).

Because chlorophyll biosynthesis is well conserved among plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), we expected that GUN4 would interact similarly with proteins associated with chloroplast membranes such as ChlH from pea and Arabidopsis. The full-length GUN4 precursor containing the transit peptide was produced by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation. During SDS-PAGE, this translation product migrated like a 30-kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>), which was expected, based on the mass calculated from the derived amino acid sequence of GUN4 containing the predicted transit peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). We tested whether GUN4 could be imported into pea chloroplasts as judged by the following: (i) a mobility shift that is consistent with the removal of the predicted 69-residue transit peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and (ii) resistance to a trypsin protease treatment, which cannot digest proteins that are transported across the inner envelope of pea chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). After import into the pea chloroplast, GUN4 migrates as a doublet in SDS gels, with the predominant band migrating like a 22-kDa protein, consistent with the removal of the predicted transit peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). A similar doublet was previously observed when whole cell and various chloroplast extracts from Arabidopsis were analyzed by immunoblotting with affinity-purified anti-GUN4 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). After GUN4 was imported, chloroplasts were digested with trypsin. Intact chloroplasts were then recovered using Percoll gradients and subjected to hypotonic lysis, and the soluble and membrane-containing fractions of the chloroplast were separated by centrifugation. GUN4 was observed in both the soluble and the membrane-containing pellet fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), which indicates that GUN4 was imported into these chloroplasts and not digested by trypsin. Two control proteins, Tic40 and SS, accumulated in membrane and soluble fractions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>), as has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Distribution of GUN4, Tic40, and SS in fractionated chloroplasts.</bold><italic>A</italic>, distribution of GUN4 in fractionated pea chloroplasts. <sup>3</sup>H-Labeled GUN4 leucine was imported into intact pea chloroplasts.

ALA feeding was previously reported to induce the levels of PPIX and Mg-PPIX in whole plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) and to increase the levels of heme efflux from purified chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).

We found that half of GUN4 associated with the membrane fraction in unfed chloroplasts, and the amount of GUN4 in the membrane fraction increased by 50% in ALA-fed chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). In contrast, the distribution of Tic40 and SS did not change after ALA feeding (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.025205/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></ext-link>). Additionally, ALA feeding did not appear to change the total protein profile of the soluble and pellet fractions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.025205/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></ext-link>).

These data are consistent with the following: (i) elevated porphyrin levels causing GUN4 to accumulate in the membrane-containing pellet fraction after GUN4 has been imported into the chloroplast, but also with (ii) the distinct targeting of GUN4 to the stroma and to the chloroplast membranes and ALA feeding inhibiting stromal targeting. To distinguish between these possibilities, we fed ALA to chloroplasts following the import of GUN4. We found that ALA feeding subsequent to the import of GUN4 leads to increased levels of PPIX and Mg-PPIX and causes GUN4 to redistribute to the membrane-containing pellet fraction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.025205/DC1">supplemental Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></ext-link>).

To test this idea, we assayed chloroplast membranes for Mg-chelatase after ALA feeding. Reactions were initiated by addition of PPIX dissolved in DMSO. When membranes derived from chloroplasts that were not fed ALA were provided or not provided PPIX, they could synthesize 4 or 3 pmol Mg-PPIX/20 min/mg protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), which is 10&#x02013;16-fold less activity than previously reported for pea chloroplast membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). These differences may be caused by the more dilute hypotonic lysis and the distinct hypotonic lysis buffer used here, compared with that of Walker and Weinstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We observed up to a 43-fold increase in Mg-chelatase activity in membranes isolated from ALA-fed chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).

These data indicate that Mg-chelatase does not utilize exogenous PPIX efficiently and that 2% DMSO has an inhibitory effect that is similar to PPIX dissolved in DMSO. Based on these data, we suggest that PO loads at least a fraction of the Mg-chelatase that associates with chloroplast membranes with PPIX during ALA feeding and that this preformed PPIX-Mg-chelatase complex turns over during the subsequent Mg-chelatase assay.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Mg-chelatase activity associated with chloroplast membranes after ALA feeding.</bold> Mg-chelatase assays were programmed with membranes that were isolated from chloroplasts that were either not fed (&#x02212;<italic>ALA</italic>) or fed (+<italic>ALA</italic>) ALA.

Porphyrins or a GUN4-porphyrin complex might contribute to this elevated level of Mg-chelatase activity by promoting the redistribution of Mg-chelatase subunits from the soluble into the membrane-containing pellet fraction. For example, a GUN4-porphyrin complex might stabilize interactions between Mg-chelatase and chloroplast membrane lipids or between Mg-chelatase and other chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes such as PO and Mg-PPIX MT. This type of regulation would be distinct from the stimulation of Mg-chelatase activity that was previously reported for GUN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).

Nonetheless, our finding that GUN4 can bind a variety of porphyrins implies that GUN4 binding any of these ligands might cause a redistribution of GUN4 from the soluble to the membrane-containing pellet fraction. We expected that chloroplasts would take up PPIX and other porphyrins <italic>in vitro</italic> and that GUN4 might bind these porphyrins after they are taken up because purified chloroplasts were reported previously to synthesize Mg-PPIX from exogenous PPIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). To test this idea, we fed pea chloroplasts with various porphyrins that GUN4 binds and monitored the distribution of GUN4 in soluble and membrane-containing fractions by immunoblotting. We found that similar to feeding chloroplasts ALA, feeding chloroplasts PPIX, Mg-PPIX, uroporphyrin III, coproporphyrin III, hemin, or pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> caused GUN4 to accumulate in the pellet fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>).</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>FIGURE 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Subchloroplastic distribution of GUN4 after feeding with ALA or various porphyrins.</bold> Pea chloroplasts were incubated in import buffer lacking ALA (&#x02212;<italic>ALA</italic>), containing ALA (+<italic>ALA</italic>), containing 2% DMSO (<italic>DMSO</italic>), or 20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> of the indicated porphyrin and 1&#x02013;2% DMSO.

Here we report a roughly 50:50 distribution, or that GUN4 predominantly associates with the membrane-containing fraction depending on whether GUN4 was imported or pea GUN4 was monitored in 6&#x02013;8-day-old pea leaves. Differences in the affinities of GUN4 and pea GUN4 for chloroplast membranes or differences in the chlorophyll biosynthetic capacities of fully expanded and young rapidly growing leaves may account for these differences. Consistent with the relatively higher rate of chlorophyll biosynthesis in young leaves stabilizing interactions between GUN4 and chloroplast membranes, we found that feeding ALA to purified chloroplasts causes a striking increase in the biosynthesis of PPIX and Mg-PPIX and also causes both GUN4 and ChlH to accumulate in the membrane-containing fraction at the expense of the soluble fraction. Although we cannot rule out possibilities such as porphyrin binding causing a rapid redistribution of GUN4, ChlH, or a GUN4-ChlH complex from the chloroplast stroma to the chloroplast membranes, this possibility seems unlikely because of the high viscosity of the chloroplast stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The most parsimonious interpretation of our data is as follows: (i) most of GUN4 and ChlH associate with chloroplast membranes; (ii) a fraction of GUN4, ChlH, or a GUN4-ChlH complex dissociates from chloroplast membranes and accumulates in the soluble fraction during chloroplast lysis and fractionation; and (iii) the porphyrin-bound conformations of GUN4 and ChlH have higher affinities for either chloroplast membrane lipids and/or chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes that more stably associate with chloroplast membranes such as PO and Mg-PPIX MT.</p><p>Although GUN4-porphyrin complexes were previously reported to stimulate Mg-chelatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), our findings suggest that GUN4 might regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis on another level. We propose that GUN4 or a GUN4-porphyrin complex helps to stabilize interactions between ChlH and chloroplast membranes (<italic>i.e.</italic> the site of chlorophyll biosynthesis), which was not previously reported for GUN4. Complexes of chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes that include Mg-chelatase have been reported or suggested because Mg-chelatase and Mg-PPIX MT can convert PPIX to Mg-PPIX ME <italic>in vitro</italic> without appreciable accumulation of Mg-PPIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and because ChlH stimulates Mg-PPIX MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). However, all Mg-PPIX does not appear to be efficiently channeled through a complex composed of Mg-chelatase and Mg-PPIX MT because Mg-PPIX accumulates in green Arabidopsis seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). We propose that GUN4 binds at least a fraction of the Mg-PPIX that accumulates <italic>in vivo</italic> by itself or as part of a GUN4-ChlH complex. GUN4 may be necessary if Mg-chelatase-Mg-PPIX complexes are unstable or if a fraction of active ChlH does not associate with Mg-PPIX MT and might help prevent the photosensitizing chlorophyll precursors from causing photooxidative damage.</p><p>These findings may contribute to our understanding of the competition between Mg-chelatase and ferrochelatase for PPIX. By stabilizing complexes of enzymes that contain Mg-chelatase, GUN4 might help divert PPIX from heme biosynthesis and into chlorophyll biosynthesis. Both PO and ferrochelatase stably associate with chloroplast membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>) and have been predicted to form a complex based on their crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Porphyrin-bound GUN4 might help Mg-chelatase compete with ferrochelatase for interactions with PO, thereby helping to divert PPIX from heme to chlorophyll biosynthesis. Alternatively, if Mg-chelatase and ferrochelatase utilize separate pools of PPIX, as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), we would expect that GUN4 would affect only chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p><p>Complexes of cooperating enzymes are expected to limit active site access of exogenously supplied substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we found that exogenously supplied PPIX did not stimulate Mg-chelatase activity in our membrane-containing pellet fraction but that PPIX derived from ALA feeding caused a striking increase in Mg-chelatase activity. Pea chloroplast membranes were previously reported to contain low levels of Mg-chelatase activity when assayed with exogenous PPIX. Reactions lacking exogenous PPIX were not previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The striking increase in Mg-chelatase activity caused by ALA feeding likely results from the 22% increase in GUN4 and the 15% increase in ChlH in the chloroplast membranes, along with the preloading of ChlH or a GUN4-ChlH complex with PPIX. Our finding that, in contrast to GUN4 and ChlH, ALA feeding does not stabilize interactions between chloroplast membranes and either ChlI or ChlD suggests that these Mg-chelatase subunits do not have a higher affinity for the porphyrin-bound form of ChlH or at least that such a difference cannot be detected with the chloroplast lysis and fractionation assay described here. The low levels of ChlI and ChlD that we observed in the pellet fraction likely explain the low Mg-chelatase activity that we and Walker and Weinstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) observed in membrane-containing pellet fractions relative to reactions programmed with both soluble and membrane-containing fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p><italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>DPIX</sup> and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-DPIX</sup> have been reported for SynGUN4 and <italic>T. elongatus</italic> GUN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), but only qualitative porphyrin-binding experiments were previously reported for GUN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). We found similarities and differences in the porphyrin-binding constants of GUN4 and its cyanobacterial relatives. Like its cyanobacterial relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), GUN4 has a higher affinity for Mg-DPIX than DPIX, but GUN4 has a 3&#x02013;10-fold lower affinity for these porphyrins than its cyanobacterial relatives. <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>PPIX</sup> and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-PPIX</sup> had not been reported previously for GUN4 or any cyanobacterial relatives of GUN4. We found that including 1% DMSO in binding assays did not significantly affect <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>DPIX</sup> and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-DPIX</sup> but promoted the solubility of PPIX and Mg-PPIX, thereby allowing us to determine <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>PPIX</sup> and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-PPIX</sup>, which resembled <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>DPIX</sup> and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-DPIX</sup>, respectively. GUN4 has a slightly higher affinity for Mg-PPIX than for Mg-DPIX and has an almost 2-fold lower affinity for PPIX than for DPIX. The higher affinity of SynGUN4 for metalated porphyrins was previously attributed to these porphyrins assuming a planar conformation in contrast to unmetalated porphyrins, which assume a more puckered or ruffled conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Our findings indicate that this preference for metalated porphyrins is more striking for the natural ligands than for the deuteroporphyrins, and we suggest that the vinyl groups that distinguish PPIX from DPIX contribute to this binding selectivity. This finding may at least partially explain why <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic><sup>DPIX</sup> is lower than <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic><sup>PPIX</sup> in lysed pea chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>SynGUN4 was previously shown to bind a variety of porphyrins with <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values that range from 0.26 to 11 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Here we report that GUN4 can bind nine different porphyrins with <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values ranging from 1.6 to 15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. Most of the porphyrins that we analyzed are found in plants or are oxidized versions of porphyrins and porphyrinogens found in plants. Although the only difference in Mg-PPIX and hemin is a chelated magnesium or ferric ion, we found that GUN4 binds Mg-PPIX with a 5-fold higher affinity than hemin. SynGUN4 was previously reported to bind cobalt(III) PPIX with an almost 2-fold higher affinity than hemin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, like SynGUN4, GUN4 can distinguish between derivatives of PPIX that contain distinct metal ions. Modifications of the porphyrin ring were also reported to affect the affinities of SynGUN4 for porphyrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Arg-214 of SynGUN4 is conserved as Arg-211 in GUN4. In SynGUN4, Arg-214 resides in the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop that lies loosely across the &#x0201c;palm&#x0201d; region of the cupped hand domain and makes a major contribution to porphyrin binding, presumably by interacting with one of the carboxyl moieties of DPIX and Mg-DPIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Methylation of a carboxyl moiety in Mg-PPIX ME could lower the affinities of both GUN4 and SynGUN4 for this porphyrin. Indeed, we observed that <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-PPIX ME</sup> was 2.5-fold higher than <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-PPIX</sup>. However, because either the carboxyl moiety of the commercially available Mg-PPIX ME used here is methylated rather than the carboxyl moiety attached only to ring C, as observed in nature, these data do not unambiguously establish that GUN4 binds Mg-PPIX ME with a lower affinity than Mg-PPIX. GUN4 binding uroporphyrin III, coproporphyrin III, hemin, and pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> indicates that GUN4 is similar to SynGUN4 in that GUN4 can bind a variety of porphyrins with diverse ring substituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Moreover, we found that feeding uroporphyrin III, coproporphyrin III, hemin, or pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> to chloroplasts causes pea GUN4 to accumulate in the membrane-containing pellet fraction. These data lend further support to a model in which a porphyrin-bound conformation of GUN4 has an elevated affinity for chloroplast membranes. The finding that binding a variety of porphyrins promotes interactions between GUN4 and chloroplast membranes implies that GUN4 could be involved in other reactions besides the Mg-chelatase reaction. However, previous analyses of <italic>gun4</italic> mutants are consistent with GUN4 not having a major role in the metabolism of porphyrinogens and other porphyrins besides PPIX and Mg-PPIX. <italic>gun4</italic> mutants are chlorophyll-deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>); <italic>gun4</italic> nulls are albino under optimal growth conditions but viable when they are provided sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Although these phenotypes are expected for mutants that cannot synthesize chlorophyll, we expect that mutants with severe defects in plastid heme metabolism would exhibit more severe or lethal phenotypes regardless of whether sucrose is provided. Additionally, <italic>gun4</italic> mutants were not reported to exhibit lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) like those present in mutants with reduced levels of uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase and coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Moreover, although we found that GUN4 binds pheophorbide <italic>a</italic>, an early intermediate in chlorophyll catabolism, we observed that <italic>gun4</italic> mutants do not exhibit phenotypes like those with defects in the enzymes that degrade chlorophyll such as the stay-green phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.025205/DC1">supplemental Fig. 11</ext-link>). From these data we conclude that GUN4 does not appear to promote chlorophyll catabolism. In summary, although GUN4 can bind diverse porphyrins <italic>in vitro</italic> and binding any of these porphyrins causes GUN4 to more stably associate with chloroplast membranes, the simplest interpretation of these new data and previous analyses of <italic>gun4</italic> mutants is that the major function of GUN4 <italic>in vivo</italic> is to promote the biosynthesis of Mg-PPIX and to bind Mg-PPIX.</p><p>Several amino acid substitutions that do not affect the solubility of His-tagged SynGUN4 expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> appear to cause GST-GUN4 &#x00394;1&#x02013;69 to accumulate as inclusion bodies. Species-specific differences in stability, or technical explanations such as the use of different tags, may explain these apparent differences in solubility. Among the seven amino acid substitutions that did not cause GST-GUN4 &#x00394;1&#x02013;69 to accumulate in inclusion bodies, only V123A, F191A, and R211A reduced the affinity of GUN4 for porphyrins. The finding that four amino acid substitutions inhibit porphyrin binding in SynGUN4 but not GUN4 is consistent with species specificity in particular binding determinants or in indirect effects on binding. Val-123 in GUN4 is homologous to Val-135 in SynGUN4. In SynGUN4, Val-135 contributes to a concave and hydrophobic surface referred to as the &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of the cupped hand domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Phe-191 in GUN4 is homologous to Phe-196 in SynGUN4. Like Arg-214 of SynGUN4, Phe-196 resides on the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop, which lies across the greasy palm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Because V123A, F191A, and R211A elevate <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>DPIX</sup> and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-DPIX</sup>, we expected that these amino acid substitutions would also impair the porphyrin-mediated interactions between GUN4 and chloroplast membranes. Indeed, we found that much less V123A, F191A, and R211A associated with membranes. However, because we found that these amino acid substitutions impair rather than abolish binding, and because ALA feeding causes a striking increase in PPIX and Mg-PPIX, we expected that ALA feeding might stabilize interactions between these proteins and chloroplast membranes, thereby causing more V123A, F191A, and R211A to accumulate in the membrane-containing pellet fraction. However, we found that ALA feeding could not stabilize interactions between chloroplast membranes and V123A, F191A, or R211A. These data are consistent with pea GUN4 competing much more effectively with V123A, F191A, and R211A relative to wild-type GUN4. These data are also consistent with V123A, F191A, and R211A not only affecting porphyrin binding but also directly or indirectly affecting interactions between GUN4 and other molecules that might tether GUN4 to chloroplast membranes such as ChlH.</p><p>The L88F substitution derived from the <italic>gun4-1</italic> missense allele causes the GUN4 protein to accumulate at much lower levels than in wild-type Arabidopsis, as judged by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The homologous amino acid substitution in <italic>T. elongatus</italic> GUN4 does not cause misfolding and causes a striking decrease in the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>DPIX</sup> and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic><sup>Mg-DPIX</sup> for <italic>T. elongatus</italic> GUN4 and SynGUN4. Together, these data provide evidence that GUN4 might be degraded more rapidly when bound to porphyrins. However, the observation that the L88F substitution promotes insolubility of GST-GUN4 &#x00394;1&#x02013;69 expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> reported here suggests that, in Arabidopsis, less GUN4 accumulates in <italic>gun4-1</italic> because of protein instability caused by misfolding, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), rather than from protein instability caused by a striking increase in the affinities for porphyrins.</p><p>In summary, our major finding is that porphyrin binding helps stabilize interactions between GUN4 and possibly ChlH with chloroplast membranes. Based on these data, we suggest that porphyrins and/or GUN4-porphyrin complexes might stabilize interactions between ChlH and chloroplast membranes, thereby facilitating the channeling of porphyrins into chlorophyll biosynthesis. These findings support a model in which GUN4-porphyrin complexes promote chlorophyll biosynthesis not only by stimulating Mg-chelatase activity but also by affecting interactions between ChlH and chloroplast membranes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_37_24783__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.025205_Supplemental_figures_and_tables.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported in part by Department of Energy Grant DE-FG02-91ER20021 and National Science Foundation Grants IOB 0517841 (to R.
