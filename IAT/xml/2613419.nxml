Several surveillance systems that monitor nuclear mRNP biogenesis and export have been described, but the mechanism by which the improper mRNPs are recognized and eliminated remains poorly understood. Here we report that the conserved PIN domain protein Swt1 is an RNA endonuclease that participates in quality control of nuclear mRNPs and can associate with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Swt1 showed endoribonuclease activity in vitro that was inhibited by a point mutation in the predicted catalytic site. Swt1 lacked clear sequence specificity but showed a strong preference for single-stranded regions. Genetic interactions were found between Swt1 and the THO/TREX and TREX-2 complexes, and with components of the perinuclear mRNP surveillance system, Mlp1, Nup60, and Esc1. Inhibition of the nuclease activity of Swt1 increased the levels and cytoplasmic leakage of unspliced aberrant pre-mRNA, and induced robust nuclear poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA accumulation in <italic>mlp1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>esc1</italic>&#x00394; strains.

We therefore tested whether Swt1 purified from yeast has in vitro nuclease activity. We generated FLAG-tagged wild-type Swt1 and an Swt1 mutant expected to be catalytically inactive (Swt1-D135N; Asp 135 is predicted to be a residue of the catalytic center). These were expressed in yeast and purified by affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000008-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The ability of these proteins to degrade single-stranded RNA in vitro was assessed using 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-radiolabeled oligo(A)<sub>30</sub> substrates. Wild-type Swt1 efficiently degraded both 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-labeled oligo(A)<sub>30</sub> RNA.

The endonuclease activity of the PIN domain of Swt1 is crucial for its in vivo function at physiological (i.e., low) expression levels. Heavily overexpressed Swt1 constructs lacking the PIN domain could fulfill some of the in vivo functions of Swt1, whereas overexpression of active Swt1 was lethal. This indicates that Swt1 functions both as a nuclease and as a protein component of mRNP surveillance complexes.</p><p>To avoid the cytoplasmic translation of defective mRNPs into a potentially deleterious proteins, mRNP biogenesis and surveillance systems cooperate in the nucleus. The endoribonuclease activity of Swt1 is essential when the function of complexes that cotranscriptionally form and check the nuclear mRNPs is impaired, suggesting that Swt1 could be involved in degrading the mRNA component of aberrant nuclear mRNPs. An endonuclease activity could be important because transcriptionally trapped mRNPs, export-incompetent mRNPs, or pre-mRNPs incapable of splicing all lack accessible RNA ends that would allow degradation by the nuclear 5&#x02032;-exonuclease Rat1 or the 3&#x02032;-exonuclease activity of the exosome. Endonuclease cleavage of defective mRNA and mRNPs by Swt1 could generate free mRNA ends for further exonucleolytic degradation.

The nuclear accumulation of an intron-containing reporter pre-mRNA induced by Swt1 overexpression was stronger than for the corresponding intronless pre-mRNA, consistent with a defect in pre-mRNA surveillance. Notably, overexpression of Mlp1, but not deletion of its gene, also caused nuclear accumulation of intron-containing pre-mRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, consistent with the model that Swt1 and Mlp1 function together in this pathway.</p><p>Our data are consistent with the previously suggested role of Swt1 in TREX-assisted mRNA transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. TREX/TREX-2 complexes are required for a cotranscriptional mRNP assembly, and failure in their function leads to formation of aberrant mRNP structures, which impede RNAPII transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. We predict that these defective mRNP particles represent important substrates for endonuclease degradation by Swt1. Consistent with this model, defective and export-incompetent mRNPs formed in TREX mutants accumulate in association with the NPCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, where Swt1 can also be detected.</p><p>In wild-type cells, Swt1 was distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and hence could potentially detect the formation of defective pre-mRNPs all along the mRNP biogenesis pathway. However, Swt1 was accumulated at the NPCs when these were clustered in the <italic>nup133</italic>&#x00394; mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000008-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This NPC localization of Swt1 cannot be correlated to an impaired mRNA export (<italic>nup133</italic>&#x00394; cells also exhibit an mRNA export defect), as 4xGFP-Swt1 did not accumulate at the nuclear envelope in the <italic>mex67&#x02013;5</italic> mRNA export mutant (unpublished data). Moreover, Swt1 lacking its endonuclease domain became concentrated in perinuclear spots even in cells with a normal complement of nucleoporins. We speculate that Swt1 is transiently recruited to the NPCs via interactions with nucleoporins and/or with export-incompetent pre-mRNPs blocked at the NPCs, and function there to prevent inappropriate pre-mRNA export.</p><p>Analyses of nuclear degradation of defective RNAs in yeast have largely concentrated on the activities of the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-exonucleases. This work demonstrates that endonuclease cleavage is also likely to play an important role in nuclear RNA surveillance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, and genetic manipulations.</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000008-st001">Table S1</xref>; plasmid constructs are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000008-st002">Table S2</xref>.
