Millions of Americans live in areas with a level of ozone higher than that recommended by the National Ambient Air Quality Standard limit, and this could negatively affect their health. Ozone exposure can cause shortness of breath and coughing, trigger asthma attacks and reduce lung function, often leading to hospital admissions and emergency room visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. According to American Lung Association data for 2008, every year almost 400,000 Americans die from lung disease, the number three killer (behind heart disease and cancer), and death rates from lung disease are currently increasing. In 2003, the age-adjusted death rates for females and males were 19.4 and 26.1 per 100,000, respectively. An estimated 651,000 hospital discharges in males and 717,000 discharges in females were attributable to pneumonia in 2005. Lung disease costs the U.S. economy a total of $154 billion. Together, pneumonia and influenza cost the U.S. economy more than $40.2 billion in 2005, according to the American Lung Association.</p><p>Pulmonary surfactant plays a key role in lung innate immune defense. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) is a major surfactant component and innate immune molecule, with activities that include stimulation of chemotaxis of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], enhancement of phagocytosis of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], proliferation of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], linkage of innate and adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and production of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] by involving, at least in part, NF&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Genetically modified mice lacking SP-A are more susceptible to challenge with experimental pneumonia caused by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], group B <italic>Streptococcus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] than WT mice.</p><p>As a strong oxidizing agent, ozone can affect SP-A related functions. Ozone-induced oxidation of SP-A reduces its ability to interact with alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], inhibits its effect on phosphatidylcholine secretion from alveolar type II cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and has a negative impact on its regulation of cytokine production by a human monocytic cell line THP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. After ozone exposure of SP-A, its aggregation pattern, absorption spectra, gel electrophoretic pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], as well as SP-A-mediated lipid aggregation, binding of SP-A to immobilized mannose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and the ability of SP-A to enhance phagocytosis of <italic>Herpes simplex </italic>virus and superoxide anion production by alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] are all changed. In recent <italic>in vitro </italic>studies we observed that ozone exposure of SP-A decreases its ability to stimulate phagocytosis of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Taken together, impairment of SP-A activity through oxidation may be one of the mechanisms that contribute to the increased susceptibility to pneumonia.</p><p>Sex is one of the known risk factors in lung disease. Males have been shown to suffer more from neonatal respiratory distress syndrome after premature birth when compared to females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. They are also affected more by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Young males also have a greater incidence of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, females are less afflicted by most types of pneumonia and generally have more favorable outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In contrast to lung diseases, in the case of air pollutants, the male disadvantage or female advantage appears to reverse. Elderly females have been shown to have a more pronounced response to ambient air pollution than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and some experimental studies have shown that the lungs of female mice sustain greater damage after naphthalene exposure than those of males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, sex differences in lung health and in response to air pollution may have important biological and clinical consequences.</p><p>Alveolar macrophages comprise the first line of lung host defense. Ozone exposure has been associated with impaired functional competence of alveolar macrophages: the release of one of the modulators of inflammation (prostaglandin E2), phagocytosis of particulate immune complexes, superoxide production and production of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, and IL-6, in response to bacterial LPS were all decreased in alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. An ineffective activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B cell signaling pathway was observed when a monocytic cell line, THP-1, was exposed to ozone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Sex may differentially affect alveolar macrophage function and thus contribute to sex differences in pneumonia. Indeed, a decrease in alveolar macrophage phagocytic activity from mice exposed to ozone has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] with female mice affected more than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Moreover, decreased survival in animals infected with <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>was demonstrated in response to ozone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] with females being more susceptible than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which various pollutants influence biological processes are incompletely understood. Furthermore it should be noted that in order to be able to extrapolate findings from rodents exposed to ozone to humans, it is necessary that rodents be exposed to a considerably higher dose of ozone than what would humans are likely to be exposed to. Rodents require exposures to higher ozone concentration than human to reach comparable amounts of ozone in the distal lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Moreover, resting rodents exposed to 2 ppm showed either comparable PMNs and protein content or lower macrophage number compared to an exercising human exposed to a lower ozone dose (0.44 ppm).</p><p>Given that SP-A plays a critical role in assisting phagocytosis in the lung, we hypothesized that either the absence of SP-A expression in the lung of SP-A (-/-) mice or a decrease in SP-A function after oxidation of SP-A in WT mice is one of the factors that contribute to increased susceptibility of mice to pneumonia if exposed to air pollutants, such as ozone. In the present study, we investigated this hypothesis by exposing SP-A (-/-) mice and WT mice to ozone or FA and studying the survival rates, phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages of SP-A (-/-) mice, and SP-A oxidation in WT mice. The survival and phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages of WT mice exposed to ozone and infected with <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] were compared, when appropriate, to those of the SP-A (-/-) mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and media</title><p>Tryptic soy agar (TSA) and tryptic soy broth (TSB) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and Dulbecco's PBS was from Invitrogen (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).

The SP-A (-/-) mice on the C57BL/6 background were bred in the Animal Care Facility of Penn State University College of Medicine in isolators under pathogen-free conditions in accordance with approved protocols and policies of Penn State University. Male and female SP-A (-/-) mice were used at the age of 8&#x02013;12 weeks. The Penn State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures involving animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Infection of male and female SP-A (-/-) mice with <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>bacteria for survival and <italic>in vivo </italic>phagocytosis analyses</title><p>Infection with <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>was performed as we described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] with no modifications. In brief, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae </italic>bacteria (ATCC 43816) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and prepared for infection of mice as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>bacteria, used in this study, were from the same stock as in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Moreover, bacteria were taken from the same passage to minimize variation in virulence. The experimental group of mice was exposed to ozone (2 ppm for 3 h), and the control group of mice was exposed to filtered air (FA) at the same time in different chambers. The ozone dose, temperature, flow rate, and humidity levels in chambers were kept at the same levels, as in our previous work with wild type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Through all experiments, the incubator temperature was set to room temperature (25&#x000b0;C), the humidity was set to 50%, and the flow rate was 15 L/min through each (FA and ozone) 3.66 L exposure chamber. The ozone dose/duration was chosen in our preliminary work as being optimal for further investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Immediately after exposure to ozone, mice were infected intratracheally with <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>bacteria and allowed to recover from the procedure for inclusion in the study. Animals that died during the procedure were excluded from the analyses.</p><sec><title>A) Survival study</title><p>The <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection dose was ~450 CFU/mouse in 50 &#x003bc;l of PBS. There were 16 independent experiments. Eight experiments involved females and 8 experiments involved males, starting with 10 mice per experiment. Each experiment (10 mice) involved 5 mice exposed to ozone, and 5 mice, exposed to FA. After infection, the mice were monitored for survival twice a day for 14 days. The total number of mice used for analysis in the survival study was 149.</p></sec><sec><title>B) In vivo phagocytosis study</title><p>The <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection dose for assessing <italic>in vivo </italic>phagocytosis was ~1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>CFU/mouse in 50 &#x003bc;l of PBS, and the number of independent experiments was 5 for females and 4 for males, starting with 6 mice per experiment (3 mice were exposed to ozone, and 3 mice to FA). One hour after infecting mice, the lungs were lavaged 3 times with 0.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl and the BAL cells. The alveolar macrophages, were washed similarly and then applied to slides using a cytocentrifuge.

The experimental design was as described above for <italic>in vivo </italic>phagocytosis with the exception that mice after exposure to FA or to ozone received an intratracheal administration of 50 &#x003bc;l of PBS (sham control), rather than infected with bacterial suspension. One hour after inoculation mouse lungs were lavaged with 0.9% NaCl. The BAL fluid was centrifuged (150 &#x000d7; g, 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C) and the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.9% sodium chloride. Total cell counts were performed using a hemocytometer, and cells were then applied to slides using a cytocentrifuge and stained with the Hema-3 stain kit (Fisher) for differential cell counts. Cell-free supernatants were frozen at -80&#x000b0;C for subsequent protein analyses. The total number of mice used in this study was 39.</p></sec><sec><title>B) Detection of total protein and SP-A levels in mouse BAL</title><p>Total protein concentration in mouse BAL was determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay (Pierce Biotechnology, IL). SP-A levels in BAL were determined by Western blot analysis. Briefly, 200 &#x003bc;l aliquots of BAL samples were lyophilized and then resuspended with 20 &#x003bc;l of sample buffer. Protein samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Blots were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-SP-A IgG (1:10,000), and then with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugate; 1:25,000) (Bio-Rad). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). The film was developed and SP-A levels were quantified by laser densitometry for each BAL sample. The OD &#x000d7; mm<sup>2 </sup>values were calculated for: SP-A monomer; SP-A dimer; and total SP-A (monomer + dimer).</p></sec><sec><title>C) Detection of total protein and SP-A oxidation in mouse BAL</title><p>Total protein oxidation level was determined using the OxyBlot Oxidized Protein Detection Kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] with some modifications. This kit detects carbonyl groups that have been introduced into proteins through oxidation. Briefly, equal volumes (25 &#x003bc;l) of different mouse BAL samples were mixed with 12% SDS at a ratio of 1:1. Samples were then derivatized with 2.5 &#x003bc;l of 10&#x000d7; 2,4-dinitriphenylhydrazine (DNPH) solution and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Derivatization was stopped and samples were then analyzed by dot blot. Aliquots containing the DNPH-derivatized proteins were brought up to a volume of 500 &#x003bc;l with 100 mM phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.5) and 200 &#x003bc;l of each sample was blotted onto nitrocellulose by vacuum using a 96-well dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) for immunodetection of oxidized proteins, using rabbit anti-DNP and goat anti-rabbit IgG (HRP-conjugated) antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and blots were exposed to XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). After this, the protein oxidation levels were quantified by laser densitometry, and OD &#x000d7; mm<sup>2 </sup>values were calculated for each BAL sample. Oxidized SP-A level was determined by the method of Robinson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] with some modifications. The same samples were used for the detection of SP-A (see above) and oxidized SP-A. Briefly, 200 &#x003bc;l aliquots of BAL samples were lyophilized and then resuspended with 20 &#x003bc;l of sample buffer. Protein samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The membrane was washed for 5 minutes in 0.02 M Tris (pH 7.5) with 20% methanol, 5 minute with 2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl), and then treated with 100 &#x003bc;g DNPH/ml 2 N HCl for 5 minutes. The membrane was again washed 3 times with 2 N HCl, 7 times with 100% methanol, and one time with 0.02 M TBS (5 minutes each wash). After, blocking, immunodetection of oxidized SP-A was done as described for the total protein oxidation analysis (see above). The bands in mouse BAL samples, corresponding to human SP-A dimer (used as a marker), were analyzed for the quantitation by laser densitometry and OD &#x000d7; mm<sup>2 </sup>values were calculated for each mouse SP-A sample.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Survival data were analyzed with log-rank test of Kaplan-Meyer survival curves (cumulative survival, for all 14 days), and with Chi-Square test or Fisher's Exact test (daily survival). Proportions of surviving animals were compared with a Z-test. In all other analyses, a t-test was used. The appropriate analysis is mentioned in the respective figure legends.

To address these goals, we first exposed mice to ozone (or to FA which was used as a control) and then infected them with <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>bacteria. Then, we compared the survival rates of the various groups of mice under study: a) ozone-exposed vs. FA-exposed mice, and b) males vs. females. For this analysis, 149 SP-A (-/-) mice were used. To get further insight into the impact of SP-A on survival, we compared survival of SP-A (-/-) mice with our published data of WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Both the cumulative survival (over the entire 14 day period) as well as daily survival were analyzed.</p><sec><title>Comparison of survival rates of SP-A (-/-) mice vs. WT mice</title><p>Data for WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] were used here to statistically compare with survival rates of SP-A (-/-) mice regardless of sex. Analysis of cumulative survival rates revealed that the survival of FA-exposed SP-A (-/-) mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Although the survival of ozone-exposed mice appeared to be lower for SP-A (-/-) mice than for WT mice, these differences were not found to be significant with the log-rank test. When we compared the daily survival rates, we found that the survival rate of FA-exposed SP-A (-/-) mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice on days 2&#x02013;14 post-infection, whereas the survival rates of ozone-exposed SP-A (-/-) mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice on days 9&#x02013;14 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). On day 14, the final day of observation, the survival rates (%) were as follows: for SP-A (-/-) mice &#x02013; 31.9 &#x000b1; 4.7% and 4.1 &#x000b1; 2.2% for FA- and ozone-exposed mice, respectively; and for WT mice &#x02013; 60.9 &#x000b1; 5.6% and 14.4 &#x000b1; 3.1% for FA- and ozone-exposed mice, respectively.

Lung immune function may also be affected by sex-specific mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that genetic ablation or functional reduction of SP-A has a negative impact on the susceptibility of mice to <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae </italic>infection after ozone exposure, and that sex differences on the effect of ozone do exist. For this, we tested survival rate and alveolar macrophage phagocytic function of SP-A (-/-) mice after ozone exposure followed by <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection, as well as the level of total protein and SP-A oxidation in the lung of WT mice after exposure to ozone. We found that: i) ozone exposure significantly decreases survival and alveolar macrophage phagocytic function of SP-A (-/-) mice after intratracheal infection with <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>bacteria; ii) females are more affected than males, and SP-A (-/-) mice are more affected than WT mice; iii) ozone exposure appears to increase infiltration of PMNs and total protein and SP-A oxidation in WT mice; iv) ozone exposure significantly increases SP-A oxidation in WT females more than in males; and v) infiltration of PMNs and total protein oxidation also appear to be more pronounced in female mice in response to ozone. The results demonstrate that absence (i.e. ablation of SP-A in SP-A (-/-) mice) or reduction of functional activity of SP-A (i.e. oxidation of SP-A in WT mice) increase susceptibility of mice to experimental pneumonia after ozone exposure, and that in both cases females are more affected by ozone exposure than males. Moreover, the findings indicate an important role of SP-A in response to oxidative stress.</p><p>Experimental mouse models of infection have been frequently used to study human pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] because the molecular mechanisms mediating responses during lung infection in mice and human appear to be more similar than different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Nevertheless caution should be exercised in the interpretation of mouse data to the human situation due to some species differences, including differences in the anatomy, physiology, and the function of the respiratory tract (see ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] for review), the ability of alveolar macrophages to ingest and kill bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and potential differences in the inflammatory and/or immune responses in mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, the advantages of mouse models include the ready access of genetically modified mice where the role of specific molecules can be investigated and thus specific hypotheses can be generated and studied under controlled conditions. In our recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] where rat and human alveolar macrophages were studied for their phagocytic ability (which is relevant to the present study) in the presence or absence of human SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants, similar results were obtained. Moreover, the fact that the observation made in the present study (i.e. females are more susceptible to pneumonia in response to environmentally-induced oxidative stress) is consistent with data from clinical studies, provides further support of the usefulness of the mouse model used in gaining insight into the human situation. In this study, we used genetically-modified mice that do not express the innate host defense molecule SP-A in their lungs to gain insight into the role of SP-A in the susceptibility of male and female mice to experimental pneumonia after oxidative stress caused by ozone.</p><p>Data from human clinical studies (except cystic fibrosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]) typically show that females are less susceptible to pneumonia and have a better outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However, in contrast to pneumonia, when the effect of environmental pollutants was analyzed, the male disadvantage or female advantage appears to reverse. Elderly females have been shown to have more pronounced respiratory symptoms in response to ambient air pollution than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Consistent with the majority of the clinical data and the present study, the lungs of female mice have been shown to sustain greater damage after naphthalene exposure than those of males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Phagocytosis of bacteria <italic>in vitro </italic>has been shown to be assisted by SP-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and ozone-induced oxidation of SP-A compromises its ability to enhance phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>In vivo </italic>findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] appear to implicate SP-A in regulating inflammation and limiting epithelial damage in response to ozone. Recent <italic>in vivo </italic>studies showed that ozone exposure decreases both survival and alveolar macrophage phagocytic function in WT mice after <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] with females showing a greater susceptibility in both than males. We hypothesized that a compromise in alveolar macrophage function in response to ozone exposure and <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection may be one of the mechanisms that account for the observed differences in the survival rate between males and females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Specifically, we postulated that SP-A plays an important role in the overall activity of the alveolar macrophage. In the present study, we investigated the role of SP-A in survival rates and the <italic>in vivo </italic>alveolar macrophage phagocytic function of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>-infected SP-A (-/-) mice in response to ozone-induced oxidative stress. The observations made revealed the same trend as in WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], although the SP-A (-/-) mice had lower survival rates for both FA- and ozone-exposed mice. However, the phagocytic indices of alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed WT mice were at levels similar to those of FA-exposed SP-A (-/-) mice for each sex. Moreover, ozone exposure of SP-A (-/-) mice reduced the activity of their alveolar macrophages even further, indicating that the alveolar macrophages are functionally hypoactive compared to alveolar macrophages derived from WT mice. These observations together support the notion that alveolar macrophages from SP-A (-/-) mice function sub-optimally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] compared to those from WT mice.</p><p>Several possibilities may account for this, including the following: 1) SP-A may "prime" the alveolar macrophages (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]) to be ready to respond in the face of a challenge (i.e. infection, oxidative stress, other). The priming may involve expression of cell surface proteins including ICAM-1 and CD14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and Toll-like receptors (our unpublished observations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]). These cell surface molecules may then recognize and transduce various signals, whether from microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] or toxic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] such as ozone. When alveolar macrophages or macrophage-like cell lines are incubated in the presence of SP-A, NF-&#x003ba;B activation is enhanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], cytokine production is increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] and there may be modulation of expression or function of other effector molecules. Thus, in the absence of SP-A, as in the case of SP-A (-/-) mice, the function of the alveolar macrophage is likely to be compromised. The function of alveolar macrophages is expected, under the proposed scenario, to also be compromised in the presence of SP-A modifications, whether these are due to oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], nitration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], or proteolytic damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. An <italic>in vivo </italic>study also provided some support for this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. 2) SP-A was shown previously to be oxidized immediately after the ozone-induced oxidative stress and before increases in total protein oxidation were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. A similar trend was observed in the present study, although this reached significance for female mice. This observation points to the possibility that SP-A plays an antioxidant role as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The antioxidant role of SP-A in WT mice may involve its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species resulting from ozone exposure and thus protect other molecules from immediate oxidative damage. In the absence of SP-A (as in SP-A (-/-) mice) there may be an increased basal level of oxidative stress (as if an external agent such as ozone exposure was present) and this may compromise the function of the alveolar macrophages. Observations from the present study (i.e. alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed WT mice and FA-exposed SP-A (-/-) mice exhibit similar phagocytic activity) are consistent with this possibility. 3) Oxidation of SP-A immediately after ozone exposure may have an important role in signaling that relates to the presence of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Oxidation of SP-A was determined by assessing carbonylation, an irreversible oxidative modification. However, it is possible that SP-A is also subject to reversible oxidative modifications involving cysteine thiol side chains that may be physiologically important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>] in signaling of redox-active molecules. Cysteine residues in SP-A have been shown to be oxidized following ozone exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], although the specific nature of this modification has not been identified. Whether SP-A is subject to reversible oxidative modifications of its cysteine thiol groups and whether sex differences exist in these putative modifications, remain to be determined.</p><p>The number of PMNs in WT male mice is significantly increased in response to ozone-induced oxidative influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, we observed a differential effect of ozone on the number of neutrophils in BAL of male and female mice following <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Female mice appeared to have more PMNs in their BAL after ozone-exposure than males, although statistical significance was not achieved. Moreover, FA-exposed (control) female mice also had more (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) PMNs in their BAL than males, although the number of PMNs was similar between males and females when BALs from untreated (not subject to FA or ozone exposure) males and females were compared (data not shown). This may be a consequence of a markedly increased rate of air exchange in FA-exposed mice versus untreated mice. The above information indicates that female mice may be more sensitive to stress, because even under control conditions, with room air in the airflow the number of PMN cells was increased compared to that in males. It is important to note, that recruited PMNs maintain the capacity to generate proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and this may further contribute to the acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Moreover, exposure to low levels of ambient ozone has been shown to lead to defective neutrophil phagocytosis and intracellular killing in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Thus, the increased PMNs in females may explain, in part, their increased susceptibility. We speculate that, as assessed by the increased recruitment of PMNs, females exhibit a higher sensitivity to stress and, in particular to ozone-induced oxidative stress, and that this negatively impacts the survival and the phagocytic activity of the macrophage in <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection model.</p><p>No significant differences were found in the levels of total protein oxidation between FA and ozone-exposed mice for either males or females. However, oxidation of dimeric SP-A was observed in both males and females at the one hour post-exposure time point. These levels achieved significance for females, and although males showed the same trend, significance was not reached, even though in our previous study with WT male mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] the differences in levels of SP-A oxidation between FA and ozone exposures was significant. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are not clear. The relative content of SP-A dimer is small compared to total SP-A content. However, under normal conditions most of the SP-A in the lung is associated with lipid and only a relatively small amount of SP-A is free of lipid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] and presumably available for non-surfactant related functions. It is possible that this "free" SP-A is reflected here by the SP-A dimer that is subject to oxidative modification and this modification, as discussed above, may be physiologically important in signaling, in the redox state of the lung, modulation of macrophage activity, or other.</p><p>In summary, absence or functional impairment of SP-A may be one of the mechanisms that contribute to the increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia when ambient ozone levels are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. The present study indicates that sex differences exist with regards to survival and phagocytic activity of the alveolar macrophage in the <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection model in response to ozone-induced oxidative stress with females being more at risk; this is consistent with most relevant clinical observations. Moreover, the present study indicates a role for SP-A in oxidative stress and macrophage function. We speculate that a compromise in innate immunity may add a further burden, especially in the female lung, to its ability to cope with <italic>K. pneumoniae </italic>infection in the face of environmental oxidant-producing stressors. Future studies that take sex into account are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Absence (i.e. ablation of SP-A in SP-A (-/-) mice) or reduction of functional activity of SP-A (i.e. oxidation of SP-A in WT mice) increases the susceptibility of mice to experimental pneumonia after ozone exposure, and in both cases females are more affected by ozone exposure than males.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ANM set up the infection model, the <italic>in vivo </italic>phagocytosis model, planned and carried out all experiments, analyzed and interpreted data, and wrote the manuscript.
