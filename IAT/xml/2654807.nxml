Entry into the host cell requires the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1), a type I transmembrane protein located in the micronemes of the merozoite. Although AMA-1 is evolving into the leading blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate, its precise role in invasion is still unclear. We investigate AMA-1 function using live video microscopy in the absence and presence of an AMA-1 inhibitory peptide. This data reveals a crucial function of AMA-1 during the primary contact period upstream of the entry process at around the time of moving junction formation. We generate a <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> cell line that expresses a functional GFP-tagged AMA-1. This allows the visualization of the dynamics of AMA-1 in live parasites. We functionally validate the ectopically expressed AMA-1 by establishing a complementation assay based on strain-specific inhibition. This method provides the basis for the functional analysis of essential genes that are refractory to any genetic manipulation. Using the complementation assay, we show that the cytoplasmic domain of AMA-1 is not required for correct trafficking and surface translocation but is essential for AMA-1 function. Although this function can be mimicked by the highly conserved cytoplasmic domains of <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic>, the exchange with the heterologous domain of the microneme protein EBA-175 or the rhoptry protein Rh2b leads to a loss of function. We identify several residues in the cytoplasmic tail that are essential for AMA-1 function. We validate this data using additional transgenic parasite lines expressing AMA-1 mutants with TY1 epitopes. We show that the cytoplasmic domain of AMA-1 is phosphorylated. Mutational analysis suggests an important role for the phosphorylation in the invasion process, which might translate into novel therapeutic strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Malaria is one of the most lethal parasitic diseases worldwide, causing more than 1 million fatalities per annum. Drug resistance is widespread, and a vaccine is not available. One of the leading blood stage vaccine candidates is the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1), which is well-conserved among apicomplexan parasites. Although this protein plays an essential role in the invasion of human red blood cells, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying its function. In this study we use live video microscopy in the presence and absence of an invasion-inhibiting molecule to investigate the function of AMA-1 in real time. We establish a complementation assay based on strain-specific AMA-1 inhibition that allows functional characterization of this protein on a molecular level. Using this approach, we provide evidence that the intracellular cytoplasmic domain of AMA-1 is directly involved in the invasion process and that this domain is phosphorylated. We conclude that the phosphorylation of AMA-1 might represent an attractive target for novel therapeutic drug strategies independent of the polymorphic extracellular domain.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Invasion of red blood cells (RBCs) is one of the critical points in the erythrocytic life cycle of the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. The invasive form of the parasite, the merozoite, harbours a set of specialized secretory organelles, in particular two varieties called rhoptries and micronemes, which house key proteins involved in the invasion process. Upon invasion, these proteins are released either onto the surface of the invading merozoite or into the intercellular matrix, where they mediate host-cell recognition, receptor binding, active invasion and the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole. Some of these proteins, like the apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1, PF11_0344), are primary targets for vaccine development since antibodies directed against these proteins can prevent invasion (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Genton1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the full length AMA-1 protein is a 83 kD type I transmembrane protein stored in the micronemes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Hodder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Waters1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon egress of the merozoite from an infected erythrocyte, AMA-1 is translocated onto the merozoite surface where it is concentrated at the apical pole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Hodder2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This translocation process is accompanied by N-terminal cleavage of a prodomain, which results in a 66 kDa protein that is itself further cleaved during invasion, releasing a 48 and a 44 kDa isoform into the extracellular environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Howell1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Narum1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>AMA-1 plays an essential role in the invasion process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Hehl1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Triglia1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and is well conserved between apicomplexan parasites.

More insights were gained in the related apicomplexan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, where it was shown that AMA-1 is involved in the regulation of rhoptry secretion and in mediating the formation of the moving junction, an area of intimate contact between the invading parasite and the host cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Alexander1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Mital1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

In order to confirm correct localization of the AMA-1-GFP fusion, we localized the protein in unfixed parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000322-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and colocalized AMA-1<sub>W2</sub>-GFP with the endogenous protein in fixed parasites using the 3D7 specific monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000322-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The distribution of AMA-1-GFP is identical to endogenous AMA-1. The GFP-fusion protein is localized at the apical end of forming merozoites (s) and is distributed onto the surface in free merozoites (m). To visualize AMA-1 dynamics during schizont rupture and merozoite release, video fluorescence microscopy was undertaken using the AMA-1-GFP parasite lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000322-g001">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000322.s008">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000322.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Does this imply dual function? On the one hand these different properties could argue for the involvement of peripheral AMA-1 in the reorientation process by its interaction with erythrocyte receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Kato1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This could be achieved, for instance, by an AMA-1 density gradient with highest concentrations at the apical end. Apical AMA-1 could play an essential role in the intimate contact between the apical pole and host cell that culminates in the formation of a moving junction, a membrane contact that migrates down the length of the invading parasite. On the other hand, peripherally distributed AMA-1 could simply be functionally redundant excessive AMA-1, while only apical AMA-1 is required for invasion. Such a scenario was proposed for <italic>T. gondii</italic>, where it was shown that TgAMA-1 is associated with two proteins, RON2 and RON4, that colocalize with the moving junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Alexander2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the conditional knock-out of <italic>Tgama-1</italic> that resulted in its depletion impaired the ability of the parasite to attach intimately to its host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Mital1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These two observations argue against an essential role of AMA-1 in the steps preceding the formation of the moving junction, at least in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Video microscopy in the presence of the invasion inhibitory peptide R1 was used to further examine AMA-1 function. To date only very few video recordings of the actual erythrocyte invasion process have been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Dvorak1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Gilson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and none of these were made in the presence of invasion inhibiting molecules. The results obtained by comparing invasion in the presence and absence of R1 peptide suggest a role for the hydrophobic cleft just prior to invasion, after binding and reorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000322-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000322.s010">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000322.s012">S5</xref>). Interestingly, the essential reorientation seems to be independent of erythrocyte deformation, strengthening the hypothesis of merozoite reorientation by either active reorientation with the use of motor proteins or a gradient of adhesive surface proteins with higher affinity or avidity towards the apical pole of the merozoite. The forward movement in the presence of the peptide indicates triggering of motor proteins even though invasion is inhibited. The apparent reorientation of the merozoite in the presence of the R1 peptide was surprising given that AMA-1 was shown to play an essential role in this process. This was previously shown by using inhibitory, monoclonal antibodies directed against <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> AMA-1 in combination with electron microscopy analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. One simple explanation for this differing observation could be that the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> epitope recognized by inhibitory antibodies and the hydrophobic pocket in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> AMA-1 recognized by the R1 peptide are distinct functional domains of the AMA-1 ectodomain. This, once again, points to multiple functions of AMA-1 during the invasion process. Alternatively, the inhibition of the reorientation step by antibodies might be primarily mediated by a sterical hindrance due to the size of the antibodies and therefore might not reflect a functional property of the AMA-1 molecule.</p><p>The observed induction of echinocytosis in the presence of R1 peptide could argue for the initiation of a moving junction. Alternatively, transient echinocytes might be a consequence of transient lipid bilayer breaks caused by the force acting on the host cell during the invasion attempt, as reported for <italic>T. gondii</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-SussToby1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, blocking of the hydrophobic pocket in the ectodomain of AMA-1 could either induce a blockage of the formation of the moving junction or the progression of the latter. One conceivable explanation for this observation is that R1 binding directly affects the interaction of AMA-1 with PfRON4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Alexander1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> or other unknown proteins involved in the moving junction complex. Alternatively, binding could interfere with conformational changes that might be necessary for AMA-1 function, potentially disrupting the essential role of the cytoplasmic domain. Functional knowledge about the cytoplasmic domains of invasion-related type I transmembrane proteins like AMA-1 is limited. Here we report that the cytoplasmic domain does not play a role in trafficking or translocation of the protein to the micronemes and subsequently to the surface, but is essential for function. This intriguing finding is reminiscent of previous work showing that although the cytoplasmic domain confers a function in the members of the EBL superfamily, these proteins are trafficked independently of their cytoplasmic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Treeck1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Gilberger1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This is further supported by the fact that cytoplasmic domain-swaps with either EBA-175 or Rh2b do not interfere with trafficking but cannot complement AMA-1 function, pointing to a decisive role of this AMA-1 domain in the invasion process. This function can be mimicked by the homologous regions of the AMA-1 protein of <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> that show a high degree of conservation (above 70&#x00025; identity within the cytoplasmic domains). In the cytoplasmic domain the degree of conservation increases towards the extreme C-terminus. Coincidentally, only mutations of residues positioned towards the transmembrane domain such as YD<sub>577</sub> show no effect on AMA-1 function.</p><p>We show that the cytoplasmic domain of AMA-1 is phosphorylated and mutation of all putative phosphorylation residues inactivates AMA-1 function. Furthermore, the phosphorylation mutant, which possesses a fully functional AMA-1 ectodomain is blocked just prior to invasion, suggesting a coordinated function of the hydrophobic cleft and phosphorylation. In this context it is interesting to note that AMA-1 appears not to be phosphorylated prior to invasion but after schizont rupture: mass spectrometric peptide mass fingerprinting did not recover any phosphorylated AMA-1 in schizont material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Howell1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> (AMA-1<sub>66</sub> fragment).

Recently, Ono and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Ono1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> showed that the secretion of apical organelles is induced by the increase of the cAMP concentration in sporozoites of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. The major downstream effector of cAMP is protein kinase A (PKA), a serine threonine kinase l. Further, four of the up-regulated kinases display features of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent kinases in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The dependence of efficient secretory organelle release on a raised concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is well established in <italic>T. gondii</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Kieschnick1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Lovett1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Chen1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and was also suggested for <italic>Plasmodium</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Cowman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that the cAMP and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling pathways are intertwined in the parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Beraldo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, the cytoplasmic domain of AMA-1 might function as a sensing device triggering downstream events like rhoptry secretion. It is noteworthy that the conditional AMA-1 knockout in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> leads to defective rhoptry secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Mital1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain might induce a conformational change in the extracellular domain resulting in its functional activation. Although phosphorylation seems to be a prerequisite for AMA-1 function, mutagenesis of conserved amino acids that are not predicted to be phosphorylated also interfered with AMA-1 function. These residues might be crucial for the interaction with downstream proteins that are involved in the invasion process. Alternatively, phosphorylation might depend on the recognition of surrounding non-phosphorylated residues. To further understand the functional effect of phosphorylation, it will be important to pinpoint the phosphorylation sites, the phosphorylating kinase(s), the downstream effector proteins, the precise moment of phosphorylation and then correlate this with individual invasion steps.</p><p>In summary, our findings provide evidence that AMA-1 is not only an essential part in the moving junction but also that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain might be a prerequisite for invasion. This might translate into important novel therapeutic strategies using AMA-1-phosphorylating kinases as drug targets to inactivate this crucial player of erythrocyte invasion circumventing any antigenic escape mechanisms of the parasite.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Parasites strains and transfection</title><p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> asexual stages were cultured in human 0<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> erythrocytes according to standard procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000322-Trager1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

(A) Representative pictures of a bleached merozoite at different time points PB (pre bleach), B (bleach pulse), post B (post bleach), and 2 s ABP (2 seconds after the bleach pulse). The bleached area is indicated as white area. FRAP data was collected in 13 independent experiments. (B) Kinetics of the fluorescence for every single region of interest (ROI). Positions of the ROIs are indicated in the inlay. The bleach impulse was at 0.6 seconds. All ROIs in the cell are affected by the bleach pulse. In the bleached area, fast recovery can be observed (green). In the apical ROI (violet) the loss of fluorescence is delayed by 0.2 seconds. 50&#x00025; of surface fluorescence (violet) is lost within 0.157 seconds. Background fluorescence was measured in the rectangular ROI (orange). (C) Qualitative analysis: the FRAP curve was normalized by pre-bleach fluorescence intensity. Time point zero indicates the bleach impulse when recovery starts. Fluorescence recovery halftime (t/2) in the bleached area was 0,148 s (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;0.04 s), and the mobile fraction was calculated to be 89&#x00025; (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;4&#x00025;).
