Flt-1 (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] receptor 1) is a high affinity VEGF-A receptor whose loss leads to vessel overgrowth and dysmorphogenesis. We examined the ability of Flt-1 isoform transgenes to rescue the vascular development of embryonic stem cell&#x02013;derived <italic>flt-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant vessels.

During angiogenesis, endothelial cells respond to both proliferative signals and morphogenetic cues to extend simple vascular structures and form and expand a branching plexus. Although several signaling pathways important in angiogenesis have been identified, relatively little is known about how these signals are regulated to coordinate vessel branching and endothelial cell proliferation.</p><p>The VEGF-A signaling pathway is a crucial mediator of endothelial cell division and migration during angiogenesis (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowanetz and Ferrara, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shibuya and Claesson-Welsh, 2006</xref>). The VEGF-A pathway requires tight dose-dependent regulation for proper blood vessel formation because minor changes in the amount of VEGF-A adversely affect vascular development, and the loss of even one copy of the <italic>vegfa</italic> gene leads to embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmeliet et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferrara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bautch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miquerol et al., 2000</xref>). VEGF-A signaling is modulated by alternative splicing of VEGF-A RNA to produce three major isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tischer et al., 1991</xref>). These VEGF-A isoforms have differing affinities for heparin that are predicted to lead to differential distribution from VEGF-A&#x02013;producing cells, and genetic manipulation of these isoforms leads to vessel dysmorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruhrberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stalmans et al., 2002</xref>). Recent studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerhardt et al. (2003)</xref> support a model in which the spatial context of VEGF-A ligand presentation to the endothelial cell is important for vessel morphogenesis, whereas endothelial cell proliferation is regulated by the local VEGF-A concentration in a spatially independent manner.</p><p>The biological effects of VEGF-A are mediated by two high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases expressed on endothelial cells: flk-1 (VEGFR-2) and flt-1 (VEGFR-1). VEGF-A signaling through flk-1 positively regulates endothelial cell division and migration, whereas the function of flt-1 is less clear (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rahimi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shibuya, 2006</xref>). Deletion of <italic>flt-1</italic> in mice results in embryonic lethality at midgestation with vascular defects, and deletion of <italic>flt-1</italic> in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell&#x02013;derived vessels leads to the overproliferation of endothelial cells and dysmorphogenesis of vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kearney et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2004</xref>). Flt-1 mRNA is alternatively spliced to encode both a full-length receptor tyrosine kinase (mFlt-1) and a soluble isoform (sFlt-1) that contains the VEGF-A&#x02013;binding extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kendall and Thomas, 1993</xref>). VEGF-A has a higher affinity for Flt-1 than for Flk-1, so both Flt-1 isoforms can potentially sequester VEGF-A and modulate signaling through Flk-1. <italic>Flt-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ES cell&#x02013;derived vessels have approximately threefold higher levels of activated Flk-1 than do normal vessels as measured by overall levels of tyrosine phosphorylation, which is consistent with a role for Flt-1 in ligand sequestration during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roberts et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, mice lacking the cytoplasmic tail of the Flt-1 receptor are viable, indicating that the signaling function of Flt-1 is not essential during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hiratsuka et al., 1998</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that Flt-1 functions in vascular development as a ligand sink to bind and sequester VEGF-A, and in this way Flt-1 regulates signaling through the Flk-1 receptor. However, how the two Flt-1 isoforms contribute to this regulation has not been elucidated.</p><p>We hypothesized that the Flt-1 isoforms have differential effects on endothelial proliferation and branching morphogenesis in developing vessels. To test this hypothesis, we reintroduced isoform-specific Flt-1 transgenes into <italic>flt-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> vessels. We found soluble Flt-1 to be highly effective at rescuing branching morphogenesis relative to membrane-bound Flt-1, whereas both membrane-tethered and soluble Flt-1 rescued endothelial cell proliferation equivalently. Moreover, expression from the <italic>flt-1</italic> locus was heterogeneous in developing vessels, and the level of Flk-1 phosphorylation on individual endothelial cells in developing vessels was more heterogeneous in sFlt-1&#x02013;rescued vessels than in mFlt-1&#x02013;rescued vessels, suggesting that sFlt-regulated spatial discontinuities in Flk-1 signaling derived from heterogeneous <italic>flt-1</italic> locus expression are required for proper branching morphogenesis. Our results support a model in which VEGF-A ligand presentation is modulated by Flt-1 isoform production in the target endothelial cells to ensure proper vessel morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Both flt-1 isoforms are expressed in developing blood vessels</title><p>To determine the relative expression levels of Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) isoforms during vascular development, we used real-time PCR with isoform-specific primers for sFlt-1 or mFlt-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hazarika et al., 2007</xref>).

To directly assess the role of the soluble (sFlt-1) and membrane-bound (mFlt-1) Flt-1 isoforms on endothelial cell division and vessel morphogenesis, we targeted sFlt-1 and mFlt-1 isoform transgenes linked to the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) promoter/enhancer into the <italic>ROSA26</italic> genomic locus of <italic>flt-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ES cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

Both the soluble and membrane-localized Flt-1 isoform transgenes rescue endothelial proliferation to equivalent levels, but they affect branching morphogenesis in different ways. The soluble Flt-1 isoform transgene but not the membrane-tethered Flt-1 isoform transgene rescues vessel branching morphogenesis, and the different branching rescue phenotypes correlate with different patterns of Flk-1 activation in developing vessels. These findings suggest that the ability of sFlt-1 to bind and sequester VEGF-A at a distance from the endothelial cell surface is important for proper vessel morphogenesis, and, thus, endothelial cells of developing vessels provide critical input for their own morphogenesis.</p><p>Previously, the <italic>flt-1</italic> genomic locus was modified in vivo to a locus that generated both sFlt-1 and mFlt-1 without the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hiratsuka et al., 1998</xref>). This nonsignaling locus was compatible with embryonic vascular development, which is consistent with our data, but the role of individual Flt-1 isoforms was not tested. Recently, the <italic>flt-1</italic> locus was modified in vivo to a locus that generated only the sFlt-1 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiratsuka et al., 2005</xref>). The resulting embryos were viable on certain genetic backgrounds and partially viable on others, suggesting that sFlt-1 is sufficient to promote proper vascular development in vivo in the appropriate genetic background. It is compelling that both genetic manipulation of the endogenous <italic>flt-1</italic> locus and rescue via transgene expression of the different Flt-1 isoforms yield evidence that sFlt-1 has a critical role in vascular development. Our data provide the first direct comparison of the ability of the different Flt-1 isoforms to rescue specific aspects of vascular development, and we show here that vessel branching is uniquely sensitive to the soluble isoform of the Flt-1 receptor.</p><p>Targeting of each Flt-1 isoform transgene independently to the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus also allowed us to separate the effects of sFlt-1 and mFlt-1 on specific parameters of vessel development. Our analysis revealed that sFlt-1&#x02013;expressing clones were able to rescue vessel branching to significant levels, whereas the mFlt-1 clones did not rescue vessel branching. In contrast, both Flt-1 isoform transgenes rescued vessel area, endothelial cell numbers, and the endothelial mitotic index to equivalent levels. These findings suggest that differences between the two Flt-1 isoforms are not relevant to the ability of Flt-1 to rescue endothelial proliferation, but they are critical to the role of sFlt-1 in vessel branching morphogenesis. The major differences between the Flt-1 isoforms are that the soluble isoform cannot signal, but it can diffuse away from the endothelial cell and into the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Orecchia et al., 2003</xref>), whereas the membrane-tethered isoform cannot diffuse but can theoretically signal. However, our preliminary data show that mFlt-1 deleted for the cytoplasmic signaling domain has the same rescue profile as intact mFlt-1 (unpublished data), as expected from the finding that deleted mFlt-1 can support embryonic vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hiratsuka et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, the differences in the ability to rescue vascular development between the two Flt-1 isoforms reside primarily in the putative spatial location of the different isoforms. Flt-1 can form heterodimers with Flk-1, although these interactions have been difficult to analyze with receptors at endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Autiero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neagoe et al., 2005</xref>). However, if heterodimer formation is relevant during vascular development, the mFlt-1 isoform would presumably have an advantage in forming heterodimers over sFlt-1 because it is membrane localized near Flk-1; therefore, this mechanism is unlikely to account for the increased efficiency of sFlt-1 in the rescue of vessel branching morphogenesis developmentally. Thus, the most likely model is that during vascular development, both Flt-1 isoforms act as ligand sinks to sequester VEGF-A, and this property is sufficient to regulate the amplitude of the VEGF signal and rescue endothelial proliferation independent of spatial context. However, the unique ability of sFlt-1 to leave the cell surface provides additional spatial regulation of VEGF signaling and rescues branching morphogenesis.</p><p>How does the soluble form of the Flt-1 receptor impact vessel morphogenesis? The three major VEGF-A isoforms are hypothesized to have different spatial distributions in the extracellular matrix that are important in regulating vessel morphogenesis, perhaps by formation of a gradient. In support of this model, mice expressing either only VEGF-A<sub>120</sub>, which lacks a heparin-binding domain, or VEGF-A<sub>188</sub>, with multiple heparin-binding domains, have retinas with perturbed migration of vascular tip cell filopodia and aberrant vessel morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruhrberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>). sFlt-1 contains a heparin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park and Lee, 1999</xref>), and it also binds the extracellular matrix upon release from the endothelial cell in addition to binding and sequestering the VEGF-A ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Orecchia et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, secreted Flt-1 may spread uniformly from the endothelial cell and, in a quantitative fashion, regulate the presentation of VEGF-A that is already established. In other developmental contexts, cells respond differentially to gradients of the same morphogen in specific concentration ranges, so the interaction between VEGF-A and sFlt-1, even if quantitative, could change the morphogenetic response of the endothelial cell to VEGF-A (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashe and Briscoe, 2006</xref>). Alternatively, sFlt-1 might establish a countergradient or some other configuration that modulates VEGF-A presentation to endothelial cells qualitatively as well. We favor the latter model because it is consistent with the differences in <italic>flt-1</italic> locus expression and distribution of Flk-1 activation that we documented in developing vessels (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). In either scenario, the ability of sFlt-1 to move away from the endothelial cell after secretion is critical to its mechanism of action.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model proposing a mechanism for differential Flt-1 isoform activity in Flk signaling and branching morphogenesis.</bold> We propose a model in which Flt-1 secreted from endothelial cells modulates a VEGF-A gradient (greenish blue) to affect ligand availability based on the heterogenous expression of both Flt-1 isoforms in developing vessels. (A) In WT vessels, both mFlt-1 and sFlt-1 act as ligand sinks to modulate the amplitude of the VEGF signal to endothelial cells. The ability of sFlt-1 to be secreted leads to the modulation of pFlk signaling in neighboring cells as well. (B) In the absence of Flt-1, the VEGF-A gradient is not modulated either quantitatively or qualitatively, which leads to excess and more uniform pFlk signaling and aberrant proliferation and branching. (C) Expression of an mFlt-1 transgene reduces overall levels of pFlk signaling, but the pattern of pFlk activation remains more homogeneous because the mFlt-1 effects are cell autonomous and do not extend to neighboring cells. Thus, proliferation but not branching is rescued. (D) Expression of an sFlt-1 transgene also reduces overall levels of Flk-1 activation and modulates signal amplitude to rescue proliferation, but the ability of sFlt-1 to be secreted allows it to modulate ligand availability to nearby cells and thus restores more of the heterogeneity of pFlk staining and rescue branching.

Filopodia are involved in sensing the environment in other systems, such as guidance of the neuronal growth cone (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koleske, 2003</xref>). Analysis of retinal vessels indicates that endothelial tip cells differ from neighboring endothelial stalk cells in the number of filopodia and expression of marker genes, implicating filopodia as transducers of positional information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>). Our data support and extend this model by revealing a required role for sFlt-1 in providing positional information. We found that Flk-1 activation, as measured by the phosphorylation of Tyr-1173, is not normally uniform in developing vessels, but it exhibits a mosaic pattern. In many cases, small groups of endothelial cells had higher levels of pFlk staining than neighboring endothelial cells, suggesting that these cells experience higher levels of Flk-1 activation. In contrast, <italic>flt-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant vessels had both higher levels and a more homogeneous distribution of pFlk staining, suggesting that spatial information required for different levels of Flk-1 activation in different endothelial cells is missing in the <italic>flt-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant genetic background. This implies that Flt-1 provides that spatial information, at least in part. We found that a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene inserted into the <italic>flt-1</italic> locus is expressed at different levels among endothelial cells of developing vessels. This finding strongly suggests that endogenous Flt-1 RNA is also expressed heterogeneously in developing vessels, and it provides a starting point for a model of how heterogeneity of Flt-1 expression may lead to a mosaic pFlk signal (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). However, the ability of sFlt-1 but not mFlt-1 to rescue branching morphogenesis and the mosaic pattern of Flk-1 activation in sFlt-rescued <italic>flt-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant vessels indicates that only sFlt-1 critically regulates VEGF-A signaling that leads to proper vessel morphogenesis. We suggest that both sFlt-1 and mFlt-1 are expressed heterogeneously in developing vessels but that the impact of heterogeneous sFlt-1 expression is amplified by its ability to leave the cell surface and affect VEGF availability to nearby cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, A and D</xref>). In contrast, the ability of mFlt-1 to induce heterogeneous Flk signaling is predicted to be cell autonomous and, thus, local and modest in comparison to the effects of sFlt-1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 C</xref>).</p><p>Although it is not completely clear how the discontinuities of Flk-1 signaling that are formed as a result of sFlt-1 expression are achieved, it is interesting that a similar pattern of mosaic activation has recently been reported for the Notch signaling pathway in developing vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellstrom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann and Luisa Iruela-Arispe, 2007</xref>). Expression of the Notch ligands Dll-4 (Deltalike 4) and Jagged were found in a mosaic pattern. The VEGF-A pathway appears to function both upstream and downstream of the Notch pathway in endothelial cells because VEGF signaling was required for Dll4 expression in tumors, and VEGF receptor expression was modulated in retinas heterozygous for Dll4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noguera-Troise et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suchting et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in the latter study, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) RNA was down-regulated with the loss of Notch-Delta signaling in <italic>Dll4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> retinas, suggesting that under normal conditions, Notch-Delta signaling up-regulates Flt-1, and this regulation may contribute to the negative regulation of tip cell formation and sprouting mediated by Notch-Delta. In this scenario, it is provocative to speculate that perhaps the spatial organization of Notch signaling influences spatial VEGF signaling or vice versa.</p><p>Recently, the importance of the Flt-1 receptor in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function has been established. Both homing of hematopoietic progenitors and their ability to set up a niche for metastatic tumor cells in distant organs require Flt-1, and these functions are likely mediated via the signaling properties of the Flt-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hattori et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>). However, it has been difficult to establish a physiological role for the soluble form of the Flt-1 receptor. It is implicated in the pathology of preeclampsia in pregnant women because sFlt-1 serum levels are elevated in women with the condition, but its exact role in this placental disease is not well understood (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maynard et al., 2005</xref>). A recent study in the eye showed that avascularity of the cornea, which allows for proper vision, results from the expression of soluble Flt-1 that binds VEGF-A protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambati et al., 2006</xref>). Our work shows that soluble Flt-1 is also critical for proper vessel morphogenesis in developing vessels and suggests that sFlt-1 exerts its effects by spatial modulation of VEGF-A signaling. Thus, it seems likely that sFlt-1 acts as an endogenous modulator of blood vessel formation in numerous physiological contexts. In some cases, its expression provides for the complete blockade of VEGF signaling, whereas in other contexts, its regulated activity modulates the presentation of VEGF-A to the developing vessel. Our increased knowledge of the antiangiogenic mechanisms used by nature to regulate blood vessel formation should aid in the development of rational therapies for vascular diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs and electroporation</title><p>The PECAM promoter/intron enhancer was a gift from H.

Embryoid bodies were plated onto either slide flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or wells of a 24-well tissue culture dish at day 3 of differentiation and cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until day 8, when cultures were fixed and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibody staining and quantitative image analysis</title><p>Day 8 ES cell cultures were rinsed with PBS and fixed for 5 min in ice-cold methanol-acetone (50:50) for PECAM or &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining or 4% PFA in PBS for Flk-1 staining. For PECAM staining, fixed cultures were reacted with rat anti&#x02013;mouse PECAM at 1:1,000 (MEC 13.3; BD Biosciences) and donkey anti&#x02013;rat IgG (IgG; H&#x0002b;L) TRITC at 1:100 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or goat anti&#x02013;rat conjugated to AlexaFluor488 (IgG; H&#x0002b;L) at 1:200 (Invitrogen) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bautch et al., 2000</xref>). For &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining, cultures were reacted with rabbit polyclonal anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-galactosidase at 1:300 (Cappel Laboratories) and donkey anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG (IgG; H&#x0002b;L) TRITC at 1:100 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For Flk-1 and pFlk (Tyr-1173/1175) staining, cultures were blocked in staining medium (5% goat serum in PBS) for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, and all antibodies were diluted into staining medium. Cultures were incubated in phospho&#x02013;VEGFR-2 (Tyr-1175) rabbit antibody (19A10; Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:200 overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and after PBS washes were incubated with goat anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor488 (Invitrogen) at 1:400 for 2 h at RT. Cultures were then incubated with rat anti&#x02013;mouse Flk-1 antibody (BD Biosciences) at 1:200 overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and with goat anti&#x02013;rat IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor568 (Invitrogen) for 1 h at RT and rinsed in PBS. PECAM-stained cultures were viewed and photographed with an inverted microscope (IX-50; Olympus) outfitted with epifluorescence using a 10&#x000d7; NA 0.25 CPlan RT objective (Olympus) and a camera (DP71; Olympus) with DP Controller version 3.1.1.267 software (Olympus). Flk-1&#x02013; and &#x003b2;-galactosidase&#x02013;stained cultures were analyzed with a confocal microscope (LSM 5 PASCAL; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using either a 40&#x000d7; NA 1.3 EC Plan-Neofluor oil objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) or a 100&#x000d7; NA 1.4 plan-Apochromat oil objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) at RT using PASCAL Release version 4.2 SP1 acquisition software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). For the &#x003b2;-galactosidase&#x02013;stained cultures, &#x0223c;10 confocal images were acquired through 12 &#x003bc;m of thickness on the z axis and were combined and flattened. Minor adjustments (brightness and contrast to the whole panel) were done using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe).</p><p>To quantify the vascular area labeled with PECAM antibody, PECAM-stained cultures were photographed and analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kearney et al., 2002</xref>). In brief, four to six wells were analyzed for each genotype. For each well, six to eight images were acquired sequentially for analysis. Percent PECAM area means for each well were calculated, and the mean of four wells for each clone was used to determine SD values. Branch point analysis was performed on similar images from PECAM-stained cultures as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kearney et al., 2004</xref>). The mean branch point score from 8&#x02013;12 pictures for each clone was used to determine SD values. All values were statistically analyzed using the two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test. Flk-1&#x02013;stained cultures were analyzed by counting the number of total Flk-1&#x02013;positive cells that also were positive for pFlk (Tyr-1173/1175) in representative areas. Quantitative analysis of the ratio of pFlk (Tyr-1173/1175) to total Flk staining was performed by outlining individual endothelial cells and using MetaMorph software (MDS Analytical Technologies) to calculate the ratio.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitotic index analysis</title><p>ES cell cultures were differentiated to day 8 and were fixed and stained with antibodies to PECAM-1 and phosphohistone H3 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kearney et al., 2002</xref>).

In brief, total RNA was extracted from cells using the Ribopure total RNA kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions. After DNase digestion, 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the high capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). 50 ng cDNA was amplified in a Real-Time PCR System (model 7300; Applied Biosystems) using Taqman gene expression assays specific for mFlt-1 and sFlt-1 (custom-designed Taqman assay; forward primer, 5&#x02032;-GCAGAGCCAGGAACATATACACA-3&#x02032;; reverse primer, 5&#x02032;-GAGATCCGAGAGAAAATGGCCTTT-3&#x02032;; probe, CAGTGCTCACCTCTAACG). Each sample was run in duplicate, and the expression of target was normalized to endogenous 18S ribosomal RNA. Target copies were quantified using the comparative threshold cycle relative quantitation method. Total RNA without reverse transcription was used as the nontemplate control.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Western blot analysis was performed as described previously with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roberts et al., 2004</xref>). In brief, day 8 ES cell cultures were lysed into radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and supernatants were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gel transfer was to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (GE Healthcare) under standard conditions. The phospho-Flk signal was detected by incubation with antiphospho-VEGFR2 (Tyr-1175; 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology) and HRP-labeled anti&#x02013;mouse secondary antibody (1:5,000; GE Healthcare). Total Flk-1 was detected by using rat ant&#x02013;mouse Flk-1 antibody (1:500; BD Biosciences) and HRP-labeled anti&#x02013;rat secondary antibody (1:5,000; GE Healthcare). After detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare), the results were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).</p></sec><sec><title>FACS analysis</title><p>Day 8 differentiated ES cell cultures were rinsed twice with PBS and dissociated with 0.5&#x000d7; trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen) for 2&#x02013;3 min.
