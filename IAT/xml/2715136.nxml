A fundamental unanswered question is how splicing factors achieve specificity in the selection of target substrates despite the recognition of information-poor sequence motifs. The CUGBP2 splicing regulator plays a key role in the brain region-specific silencing of the NI exon of the NMDA R1 receptor. However, the sequence motifs utilized by this factor for specific target exon selection and its role in splicing silencing are not understood. Here, we use chemical modification footprinting to map the contact sites of CUGBP2 to GU-rich motifs closely positioned at the boundaries of the branch sites of the NI exon, and we demonstrate a mechanistic role for this specific arrangement of motifs for the regulation of branchpoint formation. General support for a branch site-perimeter&#x02013;binding model is indicated by the identification of a group of novel target exons with a similar configuration of motifs that are silenced by CUGBP2. These results reveal an autoregulatory role for CUGBP2 as indicated by its direct interaction with functionally significant RNA motifs surrounding the branch sites upstream of exon 6 of the CUGBP2 transcript itself. The perimeter-binding model explains how CUGBP2 can effectively embrace the branch site region to achieve the specificity needed for the selection of exon targets and the fine-tuning of alternative splicing patterns.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Alternative splicing is a precisely controlled process that determines whether an exon will be included or skipped in the mature mRNA transcript. Factors that control alternative splicing bind to RNA sequence motifs in the exon or flanking introns and guide tissue and developmental specific splicing events. CUGBP2 is a dual functional regulator of alternative splicing that can cause inclusion or skipping of a target exon, depending on the context of its binding motifs. Previously, the mechanisms of regulation by this protein and the positional significance of its target motifs have not been characterized. In this study, the authors dissected the mechanism of exon skipping by CUGBP2 and demonstrate that a specific configuration of motifs at the perimeters of a functional reference point are intimately involved in this event. Furthermore, this mechanism of regulation is shown to have general significance because novel CUGBP2 target exons contain a similar arrangement of motifs. The most interesting of this group is an exon within the CUGBP2 transcript itself. This study underscores the importance of a functional reference point in the specificity of regulation by an alternative splicing factor and reveals a novel autoregulatory role for CUGBP2.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is prevalent throughout vertebrate genomes where an individual gene can be diversified into hundreds or even thousands of related mRNA isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Graveley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Matlin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

One of the major challenges in postgenome biology is to understand how alternative splicing, which involves a high degree of inherent flexibility, can achieve the specificity needed to select the correct set of target transcripts for regulation.</p><p>The spliceosome is the functional context for regulation, since this is the macromolecular machinery that guides intron removal and exon joining. It is assembled from the dynamic associations of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and hundreds of accessory factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Staley1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Patel1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Initially, U1 snRNP and U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) recognize the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites of the exon, respectively, and U2 snRNP base pairs with the branch site region thereby designating the adenosine to be used as the branchpoint. The association of U456 tri-snRNP and various RNA rearrangements then activate the first step of catalysis, which generates the 5&#x02032; exon and lariat intron-3&#x02032; exon intermediate. As catalysis advances to the second step, the lariat intron is excised and the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; exons are ligated. The overall pattern of exon inclusion/skipping depends on the ability of the spliceosome to recognize each splice site signal, which is a reflection of the inherent strength of the site as well as the regulatory effects of splicing factors acting from sequence motifs nearby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Matlin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Black1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

SR splicing factors most commonly recognize exonic splicing enhancers, whereas hnRNP proteins recognize intronic or exonic splicing silencers and enhancers. These regulatory motifs are typically short and degenerate making it difficult to reliably predict the target exons of a splicing factor based upon sequence inspection alone. CUG Binding Protein 2, or CUGBP2 (also called NAPOR, CELF-2, ETR-3, or BRUNOL3) is a member of the larger family of CUGBP and ETR-3-like (CELF) RNA binding proteins, which have been shown to regulate alternative splicing through UG-rich motifs in accordance with their tissue-specific expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Ladd1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Faustino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

A variety of intronic UG-rich motifs can be found within several hundred nucleotides of the NI and CI exons by sequence inspection, but functionally significant motifs in these regions have not yet been identified. We initially used a chemical-based RNA footprinting approach to detect RNA-protein interactions at nucleotide-level resolution. Here we identify the direct contact sites of CUGBP2 in the 3&#x02032; splice site region of the NI exon, and establish that this arrangement of binding sites plays a mechanistic role in silencing a group of branch sites in between. We show the significance of this mechanism by demonstrating its involvement in the regulation of other skipped exons, most notably exon 6 of the CUGBP2 transcript itself.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CUGBP2 contacts conserved UGUGU and GU motifs surrounding the predicted branch site region upstream from the NI cassette exon</title><p>A silencing role for CUGBP2 was shown for the NI exon of the GRIN1 transcript in a previous study but the mechanism of silencing was not characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Zhang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. To gain insight into the mechanism, we sought to extend this analysis to identify the sequence and spatial arrangement of motifs associated with direct binding of CUGBP2 and silencing of the NI exon. A nitrocellulose filter binding assay was used initially to locate the RNA region involved in stable binding by CUGBP2. Bound/total RNA was plotted as a function of increasing protein concentration and data were fit to a hyperbola to estimate the dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) for binding to individual RNA transcripts. These RNA substrates included the NI exon, the NI exon and flanking introns, and the upstream intron, substrates E5-8, E5-10, and E5-15, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). CUGBP2 was found to bind to the E5-10 and E5-15 substrates containing the upstream intron region with apparent dissociation constants in the nanomolar range (96 and 92 nM K<sub>d</sub> values), but not to the E5-8 substrate containing the exon alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Because the downstream intron region is not a common feature of the high affinity binding substrates, this region, as well as the exon, must be dispensable for high affinity binding.</p><fig id="pgen-1000595-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000595.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CUGBP2 contacts multiple motifs in the intron upstream from the NI cassette exon.</title><p>(A) Schematic of the NI exon (rectangle) and flanking introns (lines) are shown with corresponding nucleotide lengths (numbers, top).

A representative footprint of the region upstream from the NI exon is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These results reveal that a core (UGUGU) and upstream flanking (GU) motif are protected by CUGBP2 in a dose-dependent manner. Regions within the NI exon and in the downstream intron were also subjected to RNA footprinting with CUGBP2, but no additional binding sites were detected in agreement with the filter binding experiments.</p><p>To verify the specificity of the assay, additional footprinting reactions were carried out with purified splicing factors U2AF and PTB. Protected regions were distinct from those observed for CUGBP2 and consistent with the known RNA binding specificities of these factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s001">Figure S1</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;8). We also demonstrate that PTB can compete with CUGBP2 for binding to this region of RNA. That is, when PTB binds to its cognate sites which overlap with the core UGUGU motif, the pattern of CUGBP2 protection is lost from not only the core motif but also the upstream GU motif, suggesting that one CUGBP2 protein simultaneously contacts both of these sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s001">Figure S1</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;12). Notably, the core and flanking motifs protected by CUGBP2 are located at the boundaries of the predicted branch site region with the nucleotides protected by U2AF also within these boundaries. Thus, these results together with the high sequence conservation of the motifs (100&#x00025;) across human, rat, mouse, fruit fly, and chicken genomes, support their involvement in the mechanism of silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sequence motifs identified by RNA footprinting are functionally associated with exon silencing</title><p>In order to determine whether nucleotides in contact with CUGBP2 upstream from the NI exon are necessary for its silencing role, we generated an <italic>in vivo</italic> splicing reporter with the NI exon and its immediate adjacent flanking introns inserted between &#x003b2; globin exons 1 and 2 (DUPNIwt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

The gel panel is a representative polyacrylamide gel image with the top band corresponding to the exon included and the bottom band corresponding the exon skipped mRNA.

The change in exon inclusion value, &#x00394;EI, was then calculated as the difference between the &#x00025; exon inclusion&#x000b1;CUGBP2. The &#x00394;EI value is used here as a convenient measure of the effectiveness of CUGBP2 to induce exon skipping (or silencing). While CUGBP2 expression in C2C12 cells induced exon skipping of the wild type substrate with a &#x00394;EI value of &#x02212;33&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes wt) mutations in all three motifs eliminated silencing entirely as indicated by a &#x00394;EI value of 0&#x00025; (lanes m1,2,3). The double mutations also showed a significant reduction in the silencing effect of CUGBP2 (lanes m1,2, m2,3, m1,3). Of this group, combined mutations at positions m1 and m2 showed the smallest degree of silencing (&#x00394;EI &#x02212;5&#x00025;), suggesting that these sites are intimately involved in the mechanism of action. Single mutations also showed a reduction in silencing indicative of additive effects (lanes m1, m2, m3). Similar results were observed in N18TG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). New to this cell type is higher basal levels of inclusion in the absence of CUGBP2 and reduced silencing by CUGBP2 on all substrates tested. This could be the consequence of the differential expression of splicing factors in these two cell lines. That is, an enhancer may act on the NI exon in N18TG2 cells and may be better able to compete with CUGBP2 when its binding sites are compromised. A good candidate enhancer is FOX because a perfect match to its enhancer element, (U)GCAUG, is located near the NI 5&#x02032; splice site in the downstream intron.</p><p>To further investigate the roles of the m1, m2, and m3 motifs for exon silencing by CUGBP2, we introduced a 39 nucleotide region containing the three motifs upstream of a constitutive exon in a different context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Constitutive exon 3 of the DIP13&#x003b2; transcript was tested, since its splicing pattern is insensitive to CUGBP2 regulation, and unlike the NI exon is not under alternative splicing control. The introduction of the 39 nucleotide region conferred strong silencing by CUGBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes NIwt; &#x00394;EI, &#x02212;54&#x00025;), in contrast to the parent plasmid, which was unregulated by CUGBP2 (lanes m93wt; &#x00394;EI, &#x0223c;0&#x00025;). Single and combined mutations in the m1, m2, and m3 motifs were also tested in this context (lanes m1, m2, m3, m1,2, m2,3, m1,3, and m1,2,3). Exon silencing by CUGBP2 was nearly eliminated when site-directed mutations were introduced into both the m1 and m2 positions (lanes m1,2; &#x00394;EI, &#x02212;6&#x00025;). Mutations in both the m2 and m3 positions also led to a significant reduction in silencing (lanes m2,3). Thus, the general requirement for a pair of proximal CUGBP2 motifs, and the additive effects of the single mutations were verified in this context. This heterologous reporter was also tested in N18TG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Here, the silencing effects of CUGBP2 were more consistent between cell lines across all mutations tested. Furthermore, compared to the NI exon, the DIP13&#x003b2; exon has stronger 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites, therefore mutations had less of an effect on the basal level of exon inclusion. Taken together, this reporter is a good system to study isolated effects of CUGBP2 on the m1, m2, and m3 motifs without indirect effects caused by other splicing factors or weak cis elements.</p><fig id="pgen-1000595-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000595.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>CUGBP2 silencing motifs are functionally transferable.</title><p>(A) A 39 nucleotide region containing the m1, m2, and m3 silencing motifs from the NI intron (DIPNIwt) was inserted upstream from DIP13&#x003b2; exon 3 (middle exon) in the SIRT1 splicing reporter context.

As additional controls, we carried out similar experiments with overexpression of PTB or Nova, since both of these factors are known to silence the NI exon through distinct motifs (UCUU and YCAY, respectively; Y, pyrimidine). As expected, PTB and Nova were active in silencing the NI exon in the context of the DUPNIwt splicing reporter, and these effects were maintained in the presence of the m1,2,3 triple mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Thus, the m1, m2, and m3 motifs are specific for silencing by CUGBP2.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>CUGBP2 blocks branchpoint formation between core and flanking interaction motifs</title><p>We hypothesized that CUGBP2 may function to silence the NI exon by blocking branchpoint formation in the upstream intron.

The A1 and A2 branchpoints satisfied the criteria for ATP dependence (lane 1). Primer extension of reactions following debranching showed a loss of stops at A1, A2, and A3 providing confirmation that all three of these adenosines are used as branchpoints (data not shown). Notably, branchpoint formation was inhibited when the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reactions were supplemented with recombinant CUGBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 4). An analysis of the corresponding <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reactions confirmed that CUGBP2 inhibited the formation of splicing intermediates of these reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s004">Figure S4</xref>, lanes wt).</p><p>We next examined the effect of the single mutation in motif m1 as a test of whether branchpoint inhibition occurs between core and flanking motifs. That is, a single mutation in m1 should permit the binding of CUGBP2 to the remaining intact sites (m2 and m3) leading to preferential inhibition of branchpoint A3. Indeed, under conditions in which the m1 site was mutated, branchpoint A3 was preferentially inhibited as expected for a model involving flanking interaction motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 7,8). Consistent with this observation, the corresponding <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing gel showed that CUGBP2 inhibited the formation of one lariat intermediate but not the other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s004">Figure S4</xref>, lanes m1). For the single mutant, m3, which should display the reciprocal pattern of inhibition by CUGBP2, branchpoints A1 and A2 were preferentially inhibited relative to A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 11,12). Finally, the triple mutant, m1,2,3, was tested. Here, the elimination of all three binding motifs neutralized the inhibitory effects of CUGBP2 on branchpoint formation (lanes 17,18). Again, these results were consistent with the splicing intermediates of these reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s004">Figure S4</xref>, lanes m3 and m1,2,3). Adenovirus major late (Ad1) pre-mRNA was tested as a control, because Ad1 pre-mRNA lacks CUGBP2 motifs in the upstream intron. Both the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing and branchpoint formation of Ad1 were unaffected by the addition of recombinant CUGBP2 (data not shown).</p><p>To determine which step before branchpoint formation is specifically affected by the addition of CUGBP2 to the splicing reaction, we analyzed complex assembly on the E5-10 RNA substrate in the presence or absence of recombinant CUGBP2. We demonstrate that CUGBP2 blocks U2 snRNP association because CUGBP2 inhibited complex A formation on the wild type substrate but not on the m1,2,3 mutant substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). The identity of the complex was verified as the U2 snRNP-containing complex A, since its assembly was inhibited by U2 snRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s005">Figure S5A, S5B</xref>). In contrast, parallel samples assembled in the absence of ATP showed no effect of CUGBP2 on complex E assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).</p><p>The results shown above are consistent with a model in which site-specific binding of CUGBP2 surrounding the branch site region mediates exon skipping. Because exon definition could potentially affect branchpoint formation in the upstream intron by interactions involving U1 snRNP and U2AF across the exon, we asked whether strengthening the 5&#x02032; splice site of the NI exon would antagonize the silencing effect of CUGBP2. For this purpose, we increased the complementarity of the 5&#x02032; splice site to U1 snRNP and tested the ability of CUGBP2 to induce silencing <italic>in vivo</italic>. This mutation had no detectable effect on silencing by CUGBP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s006">Figure S6</xref>). We also show that U2AF and CUGBP2 can contact the same RNA at the same time indicating that branchpoint inhibition occurs after U2AF but before U2 snRNP binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s007">Figure S7</xref>). This, together with the lack of effect of CUGBP2 on complex E, which contains U1 snRNP, U2AF, and SF1, is consistent with a mechanism involving inhibition at a step subsequent to exon definition. Thus, the inhibitory role of CUGBP2 is likely to involve direct antagonism of U2 snRNP binding at the NI branch site region.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Autoregulation of CUGBP2 at the level of alternative splicing was revealed by a search for additional skipped exons with a similar arrangement of core and flanking motifs</title><p>A recent publication by Yeo, et al.

One of the ISREs identified was a UGUGUU motif with the propensity to be found within 400 nucleotides of conserved skipped exons. The Yeo study identified 168 skipped exons with a UGUGUU motif in their upstream intron. We obtained this list for further analysis.</p><p>In order to extend our analysis to identify additional exons that are potentially silenced by CUGBP2, we searched the list of 168 exons for the following sequence features: (1) the presence of conserved pairs of UGUGU and GU motifs within 100 nucleotides of the 3&#x02032; splice site of the skipped exon with a spacing of 10&#x02013;30 nucleotides between the motifs, and (2) the presence of potential branch site(s) between the motifs. Because the m1 and m2 motifs were sufficient to inhibit branchpoints A1 and A2 on the DUPNIwt substrate, we rationalized that two motifs flanking the branch site would be sufficient for the prediction of CUGBP2 regulation. Potential branch sites were required to match the human consensus sequence, YUNAY (Y, pyrimidine; N, any nucleotide) with one mismatch allowed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Gao1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

HEK293T cells were chosen for these experiments, since there is no detectable expression of CUGBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, Western blot). RNA was harvested from the cells and the test exon region was amplified by RT-PCR with primers specific for the flanking exons. Ten predicted exons showed an increase in exon skipping when CUGBP2 was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, panels MAP4_E15, SORBS1_E5, PPF1BP1_E19, SMARCE1_E4, FOX2_E11, and CUGBP2_E6; not shown: NFAT_E2, CTBP1_E2, PTER_E3, and MLLT10_E13). Of the 17 exons that were not affected by CUGBP2, one was constitutively included and resistant to CUGBP2, 8 were not expressed in HEK293T cells, and 8 were always skipped, therefore, CUGBP2 could not induce additional skipping. Therefore, 10 out of 11 testable exons were regulated by CUGBP2 indicating that we have identified a specific code that can be used to accurately predict CUGBP2 regulation. For all of the confirmed target exons, the core and flanking motifs were separated by 14&#x02013;29 nucleotides, and multiple branch site candidates were located between the CUGBP2 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

However, the primers in this case also amplified mRNA expressed from transfected CUGBP2, thereby complicating interpretation. For this reason we designed a downstream primer specific for the junction between exons 5 and 7, since such a junction primer should amplify only the skipped product from the endogenous mRNA. The junction primer was used together with a forward primer specific for the first exon. The results with the junction primer clearly showed the accumulation of the exon 6 skipped version of the endogenous CUGBP2 transcript upon overexpression of CUGBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, black box). Note that this primer did not amplify the CUGBP2 protein expression plasmid or mRNA from transfected CUGBP2 (data not shown). It is also important to note that although CUGBP2 protein is not detected by Western blotting, there are low levels of CUGBP2 RNA in HEK293T cells. This may indicate that trace amounts of the protein are present in these cells or that the mRNA is translationally repressed. Furthermore, because there is an enrichment of CUGBP2 protein in the rat cerebral cortex and a deficiency in the cerebellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Zhang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, we predicted and confirmed that there would be more skipping of exon 6 in the cortex (data not shown). To establish the identity of the exon 6 skipped product, we cut the band out of the gel, cloned and sequenced it. The cloned product exactly matched the exon 5&#x02013;7 junction sequence demonstrating its identity as the skipped product (data not shown).</p><p>We also tested an exon in the CUGBP1 transcript that is homologous to CUGBP2 exon 6 (CUGBP1_E6). Here, there is one mismatch to the core motif and although CUGBP2 can silence this exon, the effect is less than other target exons with perfect matches to the consensus motifs. This suggests that CUGBP2 regulation can be titrated depending on the sequence content and binding affinity to target motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>CUGBP2 silences its own exon through interaction sites flanking the branch site region</title><p>To determine whether CUGBP2 silences its own exon by a mechanism similar to that shown for the NI exon, exon 6 and the adjacent introns of CUGBP2 pre-mRNA were cloned into the DUP splicing reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

To address the functional significance of the CUGBP2 binding sites at the boundaries of the predicted branch sites, we tested site-directed mutations in the core (CORE) and downstream (DSM) motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). One perfect match to the branch site consensus (A2) and two additional candidates with a single mismatch (A1,A3) are the only plausible branch sites located within 100 nucleotides of the 3&#x02032; splice site of exon 6. Mutations in the CORE and DSM motifs resulted in a reduction of splicing silencing by CUGBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes CORE mt, DSM mt), and these effects were additive in the double mutant (lanes CORE/DSM mt). These are similar to the results shown for the NI exon, providing additional support for the perimeter-binding model. We note that although mutations did not completely eliminate CUGBP2 regulation of exon 6, footprinting experiments documented additional contact points extending from the CORE and DSM motifs suggesting that alternate binding registers might allow for some residual silencing (see below). Also note that we tested the possible role of an intronic UGUGU motif located 70 nucleotides downstream from exon 6. Mutation of this motif to UAUAU had a negligible effect on splicing silencing by CUGBP2, ruling out effects across the exon and further supporting our model (data not shown).

Notably, exon 6 of the CUGBP2 transcript was the most interesting member of this group due to the implications for autoregulation.

This is not necessarily a discrepancy, but more likely a reflection of a mechanism operating on a subset of exons containing a U17-related element.

Here multiple contact sites may furnish CUGBP2 with the added stability to inhibit the association of U2 snRNP with the branch site region and/or may block conformational transitions of the spliceosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Staley2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The perimeter-type binding model described here is significant in allowing for the coordinate regulation of multiple branchpoints to control alternative splicing of a cassette exon. Moreover, the distinctive pattern of RNA motif recognition by CUGBP2 may facilitate its enhancing roles in other contexts.</p><p>CUGBP2 is a modular protein containing three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) in which a divergent domain of unknown function separates RRMs 2&#x02013;3. The domain structure of the protein may be geared to facilitate binding of a monomer to a pair of core and flanking motifs forming a bridge between them as our model indicates. Alternatively, a single monomer might bind to all three GU-rich motifs. Both models would limit access to the branch sites by factors sliding along the RNA from upstream and downstream directions. Our footprinting results with CUGBP2 are in agreement with previous structural studies showing that a single RRM can contact &#x0223c;2&#x02013;7 nucleotides of its bound RNA ligand, but additional studies will be required to understand the topology of binding associated with its silencing function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Oberstrass1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Sickmier1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the inherent flexibility of RNA binding proteins, it would not be surprising that breathing motions of CUGBP2 could adjust the relative conformations of the RRM domains to optimize recognition specificity in different sequence contexts.</p><p>Autoregulation has been shown for a growing number of splicing factors, including PTB, FOX-2, Nova-1, SRp20, SC-35, TIA1, and TIAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Wollerton1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Ni1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we dissect the mechanism of CUGBP2 autoregulation. CUGBP2 acts functionally through motifs surrounding the branch site region to silence exon 6 near the 5&#x02032; end of its own transcript. Conceptual translation reveals that skipping of this exon causes a shift in the reading frame, which introduces a premature termination codon in the exon 7 region of the transcript. In this way, the resulting transcript could be targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Conversely, translation of the exon 6 skipped transcript could generate a truncated protein ending within RRM2. The advantage of a tight motif arrangement around the branch site region would be to dynamically adjust exon 6 inclusion based on fluctuations in the levels of CUGBP2 protein.</p><p>The observation that CUGBP2 can cross regulate exons in the CUGBP1 and FOX2 transcripts, and that CUGBP1 can silence CUGBP2 exon 6 to a lesser extent, implicates CUGBP2 in a network of splicing factor regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000595-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000595.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We speculate that this may be important in specifying neural cell identity and for fine-tuning of neural exon splicing. In the future, it would be of interest to study the differences in binding specificities and target exon selection by CUGBP1 and CUGBP2.</p><p>The binding of CUGBP2 to the perimeters of the branch sites allows for sensitive gradations specifying the levels of NI exon inclusion. Because the peptide region encoded by the NI exon modulates sensitivity of the NMDA receptor to zinc ions, protons, and polyamines, such a mechanism would be advantageous for fine-tuning this modular property of receptor function in different regions of the brain or during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Lipscombe1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. The biochemical functions of NMDA receptors are of fundamental importance in synaptic plasticity where deficits in this subunit are associated with altered brain function in the context of Alzheimer's disease. The CI cassette exon, which is regulated by the enhancing face of CUGBP2, encodes a functionally important region of the receptor involved in membrane trafficking and signaling to the nucleus. Our study provides the starting point to investigate the broader roles of CUGBP2 in regulation of the CI cassette and additional exons throughout the transcriptome. Insights from this study can also be applied to systematically examine the role of intronic mutations in the neighborhood of the branch site underlying mechanisms of human disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The mouse CUGBP2 (pcDNA4/NAPOR) and rat PTB (pcDNA4/PTB) protein expression vectors were described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000595-Zhang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.
