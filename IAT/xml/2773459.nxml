The replication fork speed was found to be gradually reduced proportionately to moderate reductions in nucleotide availability. Cells with highly extended C periods showed a &#x0201c;delay&#x0201d; in cell division i.e. had a higher cell mass. Visualization of SeqA structures by immunofluorescence indicated no change in organization of the new DNA upon moderate limitation of RNR activity. Severe nucleotide limitation led to replication fork stalling and reversal. Well defined SeqA structures were not found in situations of extensive replication fork repair. In cells with stalled forks obtained by UV irradiation, considerable DNA compaction was observed, possibly indicating a reorganization of the DNA into a &#x0201c;repair structure&#x0201d; during the initial phase of the SOS response.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>The results indicate that the replication fork is slowed down in a controlled manner during moderate nucleotide depletion and that a change in the activity of RNR does not lead to a change in the organization of newly replicated DNA.

It has been proposed that the local concentration of dNTPs at the replication forks is higher than elsewhere in the cells and that this is achieved by a co-organization of nucleotide synthesizing enzymes and replication enzymes into structures in which intermediates are channeled from one enzyme to the next without diffusion of these intermediates into the surrounding cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Mathews1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Norris1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been suggested that the presence of the structures is dependent on function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Thellier1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Evidence for structures containing both replication enzymes and enzymes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis have been found in phage T4 infected <italic>E. coli</italic> cells during synthesis of viral DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Kim1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Shen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Evidence for such structures has so far not been found in uninfected <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.</p><p>Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme responsible for the reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs) and is the rate-limiting step in nucleotide biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Nordlund1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The main RNR protein expressed during aerobic growth is a class Ia RNR consisting of two homodimeric subunits encoded by the <italic>nrdA</italic> (R1) and <italic>nrdB</italic> (R2) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Nordlund1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Torrents1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Both protein activity and gene transcription is under tight regulatory control in order to provide a balanced pool of dNTPs for DNA replication and repair. The R1 subunit contains both the allosteric sites for regulation and the catalytic site for NDP reduction, while the R2 subunit provides the metallo-cofactor (a tyrosyl radical) necessary for reduction of the substrate. Transcription of the <italic>nrdAB</italic> genes is regulated via several types of binding sites near the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Torrents1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Jacobson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These include binding sites for the initiator protein, DnaA, and for the repressor of several ribonucleotide reductase genes, NrdR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Torrents1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Gon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that prior to initiation of replication the ATP-bound form of DnaA acts as a repressor of <italic>nrdAB</italic> gene expression. During replication ATP-DnaA is converted to ADP-DnaA which reduces the extent of repression. The conversion of ATP-DnaA to ADP-DnaA thus seems to couple the expression of <italic>nrdAB</italic> to chromosome replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Gon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been suggested that since DnaA can bind dATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Sekimizu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and the autoregulation of <italic>nrdAB</italic> is dependent on DnaA, the regulation of <italic>nrdAB</italic> expression by DnaA may also be directed by cellular dNTP concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Gon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Also the NrdR protein binds ATP and dATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Grinberg1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore possible that both proteins function as sensors of dATP levels and regulate <italic>nrdAB</italic> expression accordingly.</p><p>Cells containing a temperature-sensitive NrdA protein were found to be able to complete one round of replication at the non-permissive temperature when protein synthesis was inhibited and it was proposed that this was due to protection of the mutant protein by a replication hyperstructure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Guzman1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The same mutant was also found to generate stalled replication forks at the permissive temperature that was not due to the limited supply of dNTPs, but rather assumed to be due to the presence of a less efficient replication hyperstructure causing frequent replication pauses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Guarino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The SeqA protein binds to hemimethylated GATC sequences present on newly replicated DNA and multimerizes into a left-handed helical filament that probably has a role in organizing the newly replicated DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Brendler1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Slater1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Such SeqA structures can be visualized <italic>in vivo</italic> as a GFP-fusion and in fixed cells by immunostaining with SeqA antiserum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Hiraga1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Onogi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The SeqA structure could also have a role in stabilizing the proposed replication hyperstructure by functioning as an assembly site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Norris2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. A changed pattern of SeqA structures could therefore be expected if one of the components in the hyperstructure is missing or not functioning properly.</p><p>Rapidly growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells replicate the single chromosome with overlapping cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Cooper1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The larger the difference between the generation time and the duration of C (replication) and D (segregation) periods, the larger the overlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Skarstad1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies of replication fork localization by comparing the distribution of SeqA structures with the distribution of replication forks in rapidly growing cells indicate that on average 2.5 replication forks are co-localized in a SeqA structure (for instance, in cells with 12 replication forks, the forks are localized to 4 sites in some cells and 6 sites in others) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Fossum1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Molina1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Morigen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. It was found that cells with impaired function of thymidylate synthase (ThyA) seemed to exhibit a changed pattern of replication fork organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Molina1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. One explanation for this could be that the structurally altered ThyA protein caused a less stable hyperstructure. Based on this finding and the proposed presence of RNR in the replication hyperstructure described above, we decided to investigate fork organization in cells experiencing a change in the activity or function of the RNR protein.</p><p>We investigated three different situations of limiting dNTPs: i) wild type cells incubated with hydroxyurea (HU), ii) cells with different concentrations of ectopically expressed mutant RNR protein, <italic>nrdB</italic> (D367G), and iii) cells with a severely impaired temperature-sensitive RNR protein, <italic>nrdA</italic> (L89P). It was found that the replication process is flexible and can tolerate a considerable slowing of replication fork movement before replication forks stall. The organization of replication forks was not affected by large changes in the activity of RNR protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p>All strains used were <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12.

HU inhibits the activity of RNR by scavenging its free radical necessary for catalysis, and the reduced RNR activity leads to decreased concentration of dNTPs in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Moore1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, wild type cells (MG1655) grown in glu-CAA-uri medium at 37&#x000b0;C, were treated with different concentrations of HU (2.5, 5 and 10 mM) to see if we could obtain a situation of reduced fork movement, but unchanged growth rate. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that cells initiated earlier in the cell cycle with increasing concentrations of HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This can be seen from the run-out histograms by the increase in the numbers of origins per cell with increasing HU concentration. When an exponentially growing cell culture is treated with rifampicin and cephalexin, new initiations and cell division are inhibited while ongoing rounds of replication are allowed to finish. Thus the number of completed chromosomes corresponds to the number of origins at the time of drug action. If initiation takes place earlier in the cell cycle, this will be reflected as an increase in the fraction of cells with the highest number of completed chromosomes in the run-out histogram. Whereas wild type cells contained four and eight origins, cells treated with 2.5 mM or 5 mM HU contained mainly eight, and cells treated with 10 mM HU, eight and sixteen origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The replication period (C), found from the <italic>oriC/terC</italic> ratio obtained by Southern blot analysis and quantitative PCR, increased by about 15&#x00025;, 30&#x00025; and 70&#x00025; when grown in 2.5 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM HU, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007617.s003">Table S1</xref>). The increased C period obtained after HU-treatment could be explained by a reduced rate of fork movement in general or by frequent replication fork stalling causing an extended replication period due to repair of stalled forks. If forks stall more frequently in the presence of HU, cells deficient in one of the repair enzymes necessary for fork reconstitution should be more sensitive to HU-treatment. The survival of MG1655 <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells grown in the presence of 2.5 mM or 5 mM HU was found to be 100&#x00025;. This shows that cells can tolerate 5 mM HU without an increase in the frequency of fork stalling. In the presence of 10 mM HU the survival of cells in a <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> background has been reported to be about 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> relative to wild type cells grown under the same conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Beam1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. This indicates that in cells grown in the presence of 10 mM HU replication forks frequently stall. This is apparent also in the run-out histogram of cells grown in this concentration of HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel), where DNA contents are found also between the integer values of 8 and 16 chromosome equivalents, indicating the presence of incomplete chromosomes.

In the presence of 5 mM HU this number decreased to 620 nucleotides. It is not known how the replication fork moves in the presence of 5 mM HU. It is possible that fork movement is slower simply because the nucleotide incorporation by the polymerase is slowed down because of the lower dNTP concentration. Alternatively, it is possible that the low nucleotide level in the cells is sensed and the fork therefore actively inhibited by dedicated (unknown) components. To gain more insight into how the fork speed is changed, for instance to see if there are pauses at certain chromosomal sites, a microarray experiment was undertaken. The result showed that all genes were present at exactly the same relative frequency under the two growth conditions (data not shown).

In the experiment where wild type cells were grown in the presence of 5 mM HU, the reduction in D was less than the increase in C, and in the experiment with the severely impaired, temperature-sensitive mutant RNR (strain E101) the D period was almost unchanged. In the latter two situations C&#x0002b;D was increased and therefore the time point of initiation was moved to earlier in the cell cycle. At first glance this seems strange. How can the initiation complex be assembled earlier than normal? This can, however, be explained if we also consider cell mass. In the latter two experiments it was found that cell mass was increased, i.e. cell division occurred at a larger mass than normal. Thus, it is likely that the requirements for initiation components have not changed, and that the initiation mass is not significantly changed. The cells are just growing as larger cells (and will reach a required &#x0201c;initiation mass&#x0201d; at an earlier point in life). The results thus indicate that the decrease in cellular dNTPs mainly affects replication fork elongation and cell division, and not initiation of replication.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>The phenotype of the <italic>nrdA</italic> (ts) mutant is not caused by replication fork stalling</title><p>It has previously been reported that replication forks in the <italic>nrdA</italic> (ts) mutant frequently stall and are recovered by the replication fork reversal process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Guarino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Guarino2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Also SMG386 cells grown in the presence of amounts of IPTG lower than 10 &#x000b5;M acquired this appearance (data not shown). The results indicate that a decrease in the dNTP concentrations below a certain level leads to cessation of growth with elongated cells and compact nuclei with relatively uniform SeqA immunostaining across the nuclei. A normal pattern of SeqA structures was observed in most of the <italic>dnaN159</italic> (ts) mutant cells. This indicates that in cells where the stalled forks are reversed and repaired, the SeqA structure formation is unchanged. Hence, the presence of an increased number of stalled forks is probably not the reason for the phenotype observed in the <italic>nrdA</italic> (ts) mutant at the permissive temperature.</p><fig id="pone-0007617-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007617.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>SeqA focus patterns in cells undergoing replication fork stalling and reversal.</title><p><italic>dnaN159</italic> (ts) mutant cells were grown exponentially in glu-CAA-uri medium at permissive (30&#x000b0;C) (A) and semi-permissive temperature (37&#x000b0;C) (B).

When cells are irradiated with UV, most DNA synthesis stops for at least 15&#x02013;20 minutes before it continues again when the replication forks have been repaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Rudolph1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Undamaged origins, however, continue to initiate at the normal rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Rudolph1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. MG1655 wild type cells were grown in glu-CAA-uri medium at 37&#x000b0;C to early exponential phase and irradiated with 50 J/m<sup>2</sup> of UV light. Samples for flow cytometry and microscopy were taken at different time points after UV irradiation. Staining with Hoechst showed that the DNA became highly compact and apparently took up much less space in each cell (compare 15 and 30 minute with 0 minute time points, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The immunostaining of SeqA covered most of the compact Hoechst-stained nucleoids. Flow cytometry analysis showed that DNA synthesis was delayed at least 30 minutes after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). After 60 minutes the DNA was again more normally spread out in the cells and small, discrete SeqA structures appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This was also the case after 90 minutes (data not shown). This result indicates that the normal SeqA focus distribution is lost soon after irradiation when most forks are stalled and then slowly reappears again when forks are repaired and replication continued. The SeqA focus distribution was, however, not normal after 60 and 90 minutes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g007">7A</xref>). Since cell division is still inhibited at these time points it could be that the cells are not segregating their DNA in the usual manner. This result indicates that normal segregation is required for normal SeqA focus formation. The apparently unspecific binding of SeqA that appears after UV irradiation may represent binding of SeqA protein also to fully methylated DNA. Although undamaged origins are reported to initiate as normal after irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Rudolph1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, and some hemimethylated DNA should be present in the irradiated cells, the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007617-g007">Figure 7</xref> show that the SeqA protein seems to interact with most of the compacted repair site DNA. This indicates that normal amounts of hemimethylated DNA may not be present during the SOS response.

Whereas a severe limitation in dNTPs leads to frequent replication fork stalling (and probably reversal) and dependence on recombination enzymes, the mild limitation studied here, led to a controlled slowing of replication forks. Each polymerase went from incorporating the normal, on average 800 nucleotides per second, to incorporating on average 600 nucleotides per second. The relative frequency of gene copies around the chromosome remained the same showing that the change in fork speed was evenly distributed.</p><p>Measurements of cell mass and DNA concentration showed that the mass at the time of initiation was roughly unchanged in both the experiments with relatively well functioning RNR, and whereas average cell mass was about 30&#x00025; increased in the HU experiment, it was unchanged in the experiment with ectopically regulated expression of RNR. Thus, the considerable change in replication elongation rate did not lead to a significant change in the regulation of initiation, but did (in one case) lead to changes in the control of cell division. The &#x0201c;delay&#x0201d; in cell division which makes the HU-treated cells grow with a 30&#x00025; larger mass, probably is necessary for completion of chromosome replication and segregation. It is known that checkpoints are activated to delay cell division if chromosome replication and segregation is incomplete (e.g. the SOS response). In the experiment with ectopically regulated expression of mutant RNR the growth rate was 10&#x00025; increased. This is possibly a reason why these cells were able to accommodate the extended C period without delaying cell division.</p><p>In cells with the poorly functioning mutant NrdA1 protein similar effects were seen. Cells grew with a highly extended C period and a larger mass. These phenotypes were reversed upon complementation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>No evidence was found for replication hyperstructures affected by RNR activity</title><p>During bacteriophage replication, structures form that contain both nucleotide synthesizing enzymes and replication enzymes.

We find here that changes in the activity of ribonucleotide reductase do not compromise the normal distribution of SeqA foci.

It is possible that the replication forks experience prolonged stalling and that most of the new, hemimethylated DNA becomes fully methylated, and that SeqA then must bind fully methylated DNA (i.e. all GATC sites on the chromosome with equal preference).</p><p>The stress response induced by UV irradiation led to a dramatic change in the appearance of the nucleoid indicating that a major reorganization occurs. It is possible that the SOS response directs the generation of a &#x0201c;repair domain&#x0201d; in which repair enzymes are organized and damaged DNA and forks may be processed. Studies by Rudolph and co-workers indicate that the RecFOR-mediated loading of RecA at stalled forks, protects and stabilizes them after UV irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007617-Rudolph2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is thus possible that RecFOR and RecA organize the DNA into a specialized structure suited for efficient DNA repair, and if so, the compact nucleoid in the middle of the cell could represent such a repair factory. If much of the DNA in this situation is covered by RecA protein, this may affect how the SeqA protein binds and whether its binding sites are accessible or not.</p><p>Also, 5&#x00025; of the <italic>dnaN159</italic> (ts) cells grown at semipermissive temperature, 1&#x00025; of the E101 mutant cells, and SMG386 cells grown with less than 10 &#x000b5;M IPTG, were found to be elongated and contain small central nucleoids. It is thus possible that an SOS response and the suggested RecO-dependent repair structure were induced also in these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007617.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Method of cell cycle parameter calculation</p><p>(0.11 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007617.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007617.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Replication patterns of nrdA mutant cells</p><p>(0.05 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007617.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007617.s003"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Cell cycle parameters of cells grown with HU</p><p>(0.05 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007617.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Kirsti Solberg Landsverk at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at the Department of Radiation Biology for technical assistance in performance of flow cytometry, Line Johnsen for construction of the LJ52 strain and Torsten Waldminghaus for helping with the microarray experiments.
