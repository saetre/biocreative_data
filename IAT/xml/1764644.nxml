C4b-Binding Protein (C4BP) has been reported to act as a potential surrogate ligand for CD40, suggesting that it could be involved in modulating liver epithelial cell survival. Using surface plasmon resonance (BiaCore) analysis supported by gel filtration we have shown that C4BP does not bind CD40, but it forms stable high molecular weight complexes with soluble CD40 ligand (sCD154). These C4BP/sCD154 complexes bound efficiently to immobilised CD40, but when applied to cholangiocytes they failed to induce apoptosis or proliferation or to activate NFkB, AP-1 or STAT 3, which are activated by sCD154 alone. Thus C4BP can modulate CD40/sCD154 interactions by presenting a high molecular weight multimeric sCD154/C4BP complex that suppresses critical intracellular signalling pathways, permitting cell survival without inducing proliferation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated co-localisation and enhanced expression of C4BP and CD40 in human liver cancers. These findings suggest a novel pathway whereby components of the complement system and TNF ligands and receptors might be involved in modulating epithelial cell survival in chronic inflammation and malignant disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation of cholangiocyte survival is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell integrity in the biliary tract.

We have previously shown that apoptosis of human hepatocytes and cholangiocytes is regulated by co-operative interactions involving CD40 and CD95 (Fas) in which activation of cell surface CD40 by its ligand CD154 results in the induction of Fas ligand (CD178) and autocrine or paracrine activation of Fas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-Afford1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-Afford2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The liver is a major site of synthesis of both soluble and membrane associated C4BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-Dahlback1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> prompting us to investigate whether C4BP could bind CD40 on epithelial cells and thereby modulate cell survival. Herein we report that C4BP can form stable high-molecular weight complexes with soluble CD154 (sCD154), which despite binding CD40, completely inhibit CD40-mediated apoptosis of human cholangiocytes. Furthermore, we show using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore), that C4BP does not bind directly to CD40. Whereas activation of cholangiocyte CD40 by sCD154 produced transient upregulation of NFkB (Rel A), sustained activation of AP-1 (cJun/cFos) and pSTAT 3 resulting in cholangiocyte apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-AhmedChoudhury2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, the sCD154/C4BP complex failed to activate these pathways and resulted in inhibition of apoptosis and enhanced cell survival. Thus C4BP can modulate CD40/sCD154 interactions by presenting a high molecular weight multimeric sCD154/C4BP complex that suppresses activation of transcription factors that critically regulate cholangiocyte apoptosis permitting survival without proliferation. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which components of the innate immune system can modulate the survival of epithelial cells during inflammation and infection. The results may also have important implications for cellular transformation during epithelial malignancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>C4BP prevented CD40 mediated cholangiocyte apoptosis but did not cause cell proliferation</title><p>On its own C4BP at concentrations of up to 50 ug/ml had no effect on cholangiocyte apoptosis whereas treatment with 1 ug/ml sCD154 increased apoptosis from 14.8&#x0002b;/&#x02212;3.8&#x00025; ISEL positive cells to 59.1&#x0002b;/&#x02212;7.5&#x00025; (p&#x0003c;0.005) at 24 hours.

However no binding was observed between CD40 and C4BP under any conditions. The possibility that sCD154 occupancy obscured potential C4BP-binding sites on CD40 was excluded by challenging immobilised CD40 with C4BP first, followed by sCD154. In this experiment binding and dissociation of the ligand could be seen, whereas no interaction between C4BP and CD40 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g002">figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the lack of CD40/C4BP interaction was due to the concentration of C4BP used in the system, a range of C4BP concentrations were tested from 40 &#x000b5;g/ml up to 400 &#x000b5;g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g003">figure 3a</xref>). No interaction was seen between CD40 and C4BP, even at the highest achievable protein concentration. The possibility that immobilisation of CD40 had altered the structural conformation of the protein thereby preventing binding to C4BP was eliminated by demonstrating that CD40 was able to bind sCD154 before and after titration of C4BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g003">figure 3a</xref>). Subsequent dissociation of the sCD154/C4BP complex was also clearly seen over time.</p><p>To confirm the findings and to determine whether C4BP could bind any component of the CD40/CD154 dyad, experiments were carried out in which C4BP was immobilised on a CM5 chip and soluble CD40 (sCD40) or sCD154 added. C4BP was again unable to bind sCD40, confirming the findings with immobilised CD40. However, C4BP did bind sCD154 in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of between 0.313 &#x000b5;g/ml to 10 &#x000b5;g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g003">figure 3b</xref>).

One hundred ul fractions were collected from the column and assayed for the presence of sCD154 using a commercially available ELISA kit. Column void volume was determined using dextran blue exclusion. Cytochrome C was used to identify the maximum elution volume for proteins in excess of 14kDa.

The small trailing edge of the major pear (between 7&#x02013;9 ml elution volume) suggests that a small proportion of intermediate sized complexes of C4BP/sCD154 may also be present but were not clearly separable using this methodology. sCD154 was also detected in fractions corresponding to cytochrome C, demonstrating that some unbound, sCD154 was also present, representing either an excess of sCD154 or a small fraction that had dissociated from the C4BP/sCD154 complex during the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>NFkB (Rel A) cJun/cFos and STAT 3 activation in cholangiocytes following co-incubation with CD154/C4BP</title><p>We have previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-Afford2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-AhmedChoudhury2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and confirmed here, that activation of CD40 on cholangiocytes results in a transient rise in NFkB activation and a sustained activation of ERK/JNK and cFos/cJun (AP-1 subunits) and STAT 3 phosphorylation associated with death by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-AhmedChoudhury2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

This explanation can be excluded because when we repeated the experiments with C4BP followed by sCD154 and found that binding of C4BP to CD40 was still negligible although sCD154 subsequently bound as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g002">figure 2 middle panel</xref>). These data confirm that on its own C4BP is unable to bind immobilised CD40. When a mixture of sCD154 and C4BP was flowed over the chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g002">figure 2 lower panel</xref>) binding was achieved confirming in agreement with Brodeur and collegues, that the presence of C4BP did not prevent sCD154 binding to CD40 (see below). Altering the concentration of C4BP by 10 fold, changing the coating concentration of immobilised CD40 or flowing sCD40 over immobilised C4BP had no effect, confirming that C4BP is incapable of binding CD40 under any of the conditions described here.</p><p>In theory it remains possible that the recombinant CD40 used in our experiments may differ in tertiary structure to its native form making it incapable of binding C4BP. We feel this is unlikely however because the recombinant protein retains full functional ligand binding activity either when immobilised directly on the BiaCore chip or coupled via immobilised monoclonal antibody specific for CD40 (data not shown).</p><p>Thus we remain uncertain why some of our data differ from those published by Broduer and collegues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-Brodeur1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of CD154 either on a subset of B cells or in a non B cell subpopulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells could be a factor in their studies. The absence of a C4BP effect in cells from patients with CD40 mutations is more difficult to reconcile with our data, although it is possible that the mutation caused a more generalised defect rendering cells unresponsive to TNFr mediated stimuli. Our data provide an explanation for some of the effects they reported on restoration of class switching and proliferative responses in cells with CD154 mutations. If C4BP binds the mutant CD154 protein it could promote more effective crosslinking of CD154 and CD40 and thereby restore binding and functionality.</p><p>Our data confirm that C4BP does not prevent the binding of sCD154, or in our hands, the C4BP/sCD154 complex to CD40. Biacore analysis showed dose-dependent saturable binding of C4BP to increasing concentrations of sCD154 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g003">figure 3b</xref>). Although the Biacore data are convincing in themselves, we thought it important to confirm the formation of C4BP/sCD154 complexes using an alternative method, gel filtration, which provided further evidence that CD154 forms stable high molecular weight complexes with C4BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g004">figure 4</xref>). We then went on to investigate the effect of C4BP/sCD154 complex on the major signalling pathways involved in primary cholangiocyte survival, NFkB (RelA), AP-1 (cJun/cFos) and STAT 3. We have previously shown that activation of cholangiocyte CD40 leads to transient RelA expression and sustained cJun/cFos and STAT 3 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-Afford2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-AhmedChoudhury1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> resulting in apoptosis. Surprisingly, despite the ability to bind CD40 when the C4BP/sCD154 complex was used to activate CD40 on cholangiocytes, we were unable to detect transient activation of NFkB or sustained STAT3 phosphorylation and saw only transient activation of the cFos subunit of the AP-1 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g005">figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g006">6</xref>). This provides a possible reason why the presence of C4BP can prevent sCD154 mediated cholangiocyte apoptosis and suggests further complexities to CD40 mediated signalling in relation to cholangiocyte survival.</p><p>Our previous comparisons of CD40 mediated NFkB and AP-1 signalling in cholangiocytes and endothelial cells provide evidence for cell-specific differences in transcription factor activation following CD40 ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-AhmedChoudhury1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000159-AhmedChoudhury2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to cholangiocytes, activation of CD40 on endothelial cells resulted in sustained activation of NFkB and no effect on the AP-1 pathway, the net result being cell proliferation. In the present study, our initial predictions were that the C4BP/sCD154 complex would function to crosslink CD40 more efficiently than sCD154 alone leading to more effective receptor crosslinking and as a consequence, an increase in NFkB and AP-1 (cJun/cFos) activation in cholangiocytes. However, this was not the case and the C4BP/sCD154 complex suppressed the activation of these signalling pathways resulting in cell survival in the absence of proliferation.</p><p>The ability of C4BP to modulate the outcome of sCD154 interactions with CD40 suggests the complement system may be involved in regulate epithelial cell survival in the liver. Prolongation of epithelial cell survival is important to facilitate normal protective immune responses, but if sustained could theoretically facilitate malignant transformation. Furthermore, C4BP could potentially modulate CD40 signalling in other cells including endothelial cells, infiltrating leukocytes and stromal cells, which could lead to perpetuation of inflammation. A link between inflammation and malignancy is supported by our finding that C4BP is expressed strongly in the reactive stroma at tumour margins in association with CD40 expression on tumour cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g007">figure 7</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000159-g008">8</xref>). Interestingly, C4BP protein was also strongly expressed in inflammatory cells and proliferating bile ductules in PSC, a disease associated with a high risk of for malignant transformation of biliary epithelium and the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Thus the presence of C4BP in close proximity to tumor cells expressing the CD40 receptor could suppress the induction of CD40-mediated apoptosis by CD154 effector cells and favour tumour cell survival. The presence of C4BP in this setting may also prevent complement mediated lysis of the tumour cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Isolation and culture of primary cholangiocytes</title><p>Cholangiocytes were isolated from a) liver tissue obtained from fully informed consenting patients undergoing transplant surgery for end-stage liver disease b) normal donor liver surplus to transplant requirements.

Panel d) Histogram summary of the effects of sCD154 and C4BP on Cholangiocyte proliferation. Primary human cholangiocytes were cultured in 24-well culture plates and simulated with either sCD154, C4BP or a mixture of both. Following incubation for 24 hours, the cells were fixed and proliferation assessed by immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 antigen. No significant difference was seen between the un-stimulated controls and treated samples, implying that sCD154, C4BP or the mixture had any effect on cholangiocyte proliferation. These data represent the mean of three different counted areas per well repeated for three different liver preparations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000159.g001"/></fig><fig id="pone-0000159-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000159.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) analysis &#x02013; This figure shows the sensogram for interactions between immobilised CD40, sCD154 (10 ug/ml) and C4BP (40 ug/ml).

Soluble C4BP was then flowed across the surface of the chip at increasing concentrations. The chip was regenerated between the different concentrations using 2M glycine. No binding or dose-response was seen. The integrity of the CD40 was confirmed by the determining the ability of the receptor to subsequently bind sCD154. Panel b) This figure shows the sensogram for sCD154 binding to immobilised C4BP. C4BP was immobilised on an activated CM5 research grade chip. sCD154 was then flowed across the chip at increasing concentrations up to 10 ug/ml. The chip was regenerated between concentrations using 2 M glycine. Dose dependent binding of sCD154 was observed across the concentration range. No binding was observed with an irrelevant fusion protein (data not shown).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000159.g003"/></fig><fig id="pone-0000159-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000159.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Fractionation of C4BP/sCD154 complex by gel filtration.
