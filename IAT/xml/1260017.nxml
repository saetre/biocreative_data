These sequences have been deposited into an internet-accessible database designed for sequence comparisons of eIF4E-family members. Most members can be grouped into one of three classes. Class I members carry Trp residues equivalent to Trp-43 and Trp-56 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E and appear to be present in all eukaryotes. Class II members, possess Trp&#x02192;Tyr/Phe/Leu and Trp&#x02192;Tyr/Phe substitutions relative to Trp-43 and Trp-56 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E, and can be identified in Metazoa, Viridiplantae, and Fungi.

Evolutionarily it seems that a single early eIF4E gene has undergone multiple gene duplications generating multiple structural classes, such that it is no longer possible to predict function from the primary amino acid sequence of an eIF4E-family member. The variety of eIF4E-family members provides a source of alternatives on the eIF4E structural theme that will benefit structure/function analyses and therapeutic drug design.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The recruitment of mRNAs to the ribosomal apparatus is a key step in the regulation of translation initiation. For the majority of eukaryotic mRNAs, recruitment is dependent upon the activity of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. eIF4E binds to the 5'-m<sup>7</sup>GTP-cap structure of mRNAs and to the initiation factor eIF4G (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Through the interaction of the eIF4E:eIF4G complex with ribosome bound factor eIF3, the 40 S ribosomal subunit is positioned at the 5'-end of the mRNA. Subsequently, the 40 S ribosomal subunit scans the mRNA (5'-3') for the translational start codon prior to 60 S binding and formation of the first peptide bond.</p><p>The crystal structures of eIF4Es from <italic>Mus musculus </italic>and <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>and the solution structure of eIF4E from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, in each case bound to cap-analogues, show that each consists of an eight-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet supported by three &#x003b1;-helices forming the palm and back of a 'cupped' hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Two conserved aromatic Trp residues (Trp-56 and Trp-102 for <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E) grasp the aromatic guanine residue of the cap-structure through '&#x003c0;'-bond interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Similar interactions of aromatic amino acid residues with the guanine nucleotide of cap-analogues are seen in the structures of other cap-binding proteins which appear to have evolved independently such as the vaccinia virus 2'-O-methyltransferase, VP39, and of the nuclear cap-binding protein subunit, CBP20, suggesting a common evolutionary theme for methylguanosine/nucleotide-interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Hydrogen bonds to the guanine base from a Glu residue (Glu-103 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E) and the adjacent peptide bond stabilize the interaction of the cap-analogue to the protein. A third Trp residue (Trp-166 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E) interacts with the N<sup>7</sup>-methyl moiety of the cap-structure. Sequence comparisons of mammalian eIF4E with eIF4Es from plants and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, coupled with deletion analyses of eIF4Es from <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, suggest that the N- and C-termini of eIF4E are dispensable for translation and that the core of eIF4E represented by ~170 amino acids (from His-37 to His-200 in <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E) is sufficient for binding to the cap-structure and to eIF4G and 4E-BPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the N- and C-termini may be involved in the regulation of eIF4E-activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or affect the stability of the protein.</p><p>eIF4E-activity is regulated by the actions of eIF4E-binding proteins or 4E-BPs which share sequence similarity with the eIF4E-binding domain within the N-terminal region of eIF4G (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). 4E-BPs act as competitive inhibitors of eIF4E-eIF4G interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Crystal structures of mouse eIF4E bound to 4E-BPs and fragments of eIF4G show that both proteins interact with eIF4E via a common mechanism involving a sequence with the consensus YxxxxL&#x003a6; (where &#x003a6; is a hydrophobic residue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hyper-phosphorylation of 4E-BPs occurs following stimulation of the Akt/FRAP/TOR signal transduction pathway and results in a reduced affinity for eIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Studies of <italic>M. musculus </italic>eIF4E bound to either a fragment of eIF4G or 4E-BP1 have revealed that His-37, Pro-38, Val-69, Trp-73, Leu-131, Glu-132, and Leu-135 (numbers for <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E) interact with the eIF4E-binding regions within eIF4G and 4E-BPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Val-69 and Trp-73 are within a conserved sequence of the consensus (S/T)V(e/d)(e/d)FW (where the acidic residues are not completely conserved). Substitution of a non-aromatic amino acid for Trp-73 has been shown to disrupt the ability of eIF4E to interact with eIF4G and 4E-BPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Substitution of a Gly residue in place of Val-69 creates an eIF4E variant that binds still binds 4E-BP1 but has a reduced capacity to interact with both eIF4G and 4E-BP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>eIF4E is ubiquitously expressed and is generally isolated from cell extracts using m<sup>7</sup>GTP-affinity matrices. Use of such matrices led to the conclusion that in mammalian cells, eIF4E was represented by a single polypeptide of ~25 kDa. Similar chromatographic resolution of proteins from plant cell extracts suggested that plants differ from mammalian cells in that they contain two different but related proteins termed plant eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E, or p26 and p28 (in reference to their apparent molecular weights as judged by SDS-PAGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A gene encoding eIF4E from <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>was isolated and shown by southern analyses and gene disruption studies to be the sole eIF4E gene in that organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], a conclusion confirmed by the availability of the sequence of the complete genome. <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>lacking a functional eIF4E-gene can be rescued by exogenous expression of mammalian eIF4E showing that <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and mammalian eIF4Es are structurally and functionally comparable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Overall, these findings suggested that, with the exception of plants, organisms contain a single gene that encodes eIF4E.</p><p>Growing evidence from genome/EST sequencing projects has revealed that many organisms contain multiple genes encoding proteins that have sequence similarity to recognized, or prototypical, eIF4E proteins such as mammalian eIF4E (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). Consequently, the translation factor eIF4E and its relatives comprise a family of structurally related proteins within a particular organism. To distinguish the recognized vertebrate eIF4E from its relatives, vertebrate eIF4E has since been renamed eIF4E-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (or eIF4E-1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). The functions of the eIF4E-related proteins are not yet understood. Some may act as translation factors and stimulate global mRNA recruitment, or specifically the recruitment of a subset of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Others may possess only partial activities when compared to prototypical eIF4Es [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and thus act as inhibitors of mRNA recruitment. Lack of detection of these eIF4E related proteins in fractions derived from cell extracts resolved by m<sup>7</sup>GTP-affinity chromatography may reflect a variety of underlying causes. The proteins may be expressed ordinarily at low levels, at specific developmental times, or in restricted and untested tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Alternatively, they may be unresolved from eIF4E-1 in fractionation by standard polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Conversely, they may fail to interact stably with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], or recognize structures that differ from, the m<sup>7</sup>GTP-cap-structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] preventing isolation using standard m<sup>7</sup>GTP-affinity resins.</p><p>At the time of writing, BLAST search of the NCBI GenBank NR database using the amino acid sequence of <italic>M. musculus </italic>eIF4E-1 as a probe recovers &#x0003c;100 unique cDNA sequences of eIF4E-family members with expected values below 14. Only some of these are recognized as eIF4E-family members in the GenBank database. Additional eIF4E-family member sequences can be uncovered from genomic sequences, although these predicted sequences are subject to errors arising from less than adequate predictions of intron/exon boundaries. Through mining of the GenBank dbEST database and assembling sequences of overlapping cDNA fragments to derive consensus cDNA sequences, as well as performing reiterative searches, we have been able to extend the number of identified complete or partial cDNA sequences encoding eIF4E-family members to 379 (derived from 204 taxonomic species). A further 32 eIF4E-family members from 26 additional species can be predicted from the genomic sequences of organisms known to lack or contain few introns in genes transcribed from RNA polymerase II promoters. The sequences of identified eIF4E-family members have been deposited in an internet-accessible database designed for sequence analyses of eIF4E-family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Analyses of the sequences suggest that the eIF4E-structure has been duplicated numerous times during evolution producing new forms of the protein that may serve other tasks or regulate the activities of the prototypical translation factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Definition of the amino acid core of an eIF4E-family member</title><p>Alignment of the complete amino acid sequences of the <italic>bonafide </italic>translation initiation factors <italic>M. musculus </italic>eIF4E-1, <italic>D. rerio </italic>eIF4E-1A, <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>eIF4E-1, <italic>T. aestivum </italic>eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>eIF4E1, and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eIF4E, suggests the presence of an evolutionarily conserved "core" region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The region stretches approximately 160&#x02013;170 residues from His-37 to His-200 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>and <italic>M. musculus </italic>eIF4E-1. Evidence supporting the designation of this region as a functional core comes from deletion analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The variant of <italic>D. rerio </italic>eIF4E-1A, eIF4E-1A(&#x00394;1&#x02013;33), lacking sequences N-terminal to within one amino acid of the conserved core region, is able to rescue the growth of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>lacking a functional <italic>eIF4E</italic>-gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Also, the variant of <italic>M. musculus </italic>eIF4E-1, eIF4E-1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;35), lacking N-terminal residues up to Lys-36, can bind both the cap-structure, the N-terminal fragment of eIF4G, and 4E-BPs <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similarly, the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eIF4E variants eIF4E(&#x00394;1&#x02013;29/&#x00394;207&#x02013;213) and eIF4E(&#x00394;201&#x02013;213) remain active in their ability to rescue the growth of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>lacking a functional <italic>eIF4E</italic>-gene and to bind the cap-structure <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As evident in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, regions N- and C-terminal to the defined core are not conserved in all <italic>bonafide </italic>eIF4E proteins. These regions may be involved in the regulation of eIF4E-activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or may affect the stability of the protein. The N-terminal residues of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eIF4E interact have been found to interact with eIF4G and stabilize the interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

Consequently, for the most part, sequences of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were acquired. In general, direct use of genome sequences was avoided due to the possibility of including pseudogenes and the possible inaccuracy with which intron/exon boundaries can be predicted. However, where sufficient EST data to verify nucleotide sequences encoding the core region of an eIF4E-family member was absent, it was considered reasonable to use genome sequences for confirmation. Furthermore, the use of genome sequences was considered valid for organisms whose genomes are known to lack, or contain few, introns in genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II such as some Protista and yeasts. In such cases, genome sequences were used only if sequences indicated that indeed no introns were present in the gene representing an eIF4E-family member and that expressed cDNAs could be identified in the same, or closely related organisms.</p><p>Expressed nucleotide sequences encoding putative eIF4E-family members were acquired from GenBank NR and dbEST databases by using the nucleotide and amino acid sequences encoding <italic>M. musculus </italic>eIF4E-1, eIF4E-2, and eIF4E-3, <italic>T. aestivum </italic>eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E, <italic>A. thaliana </italic>nCBP, <italic>C. elegans </italic>IFE-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eIF4E as probes for BLAST searches. Sequences encoding putative eIF4E-family members were easily identified by comparison of computed translations and the consensus pattern for the conserved core region described above. The retrieved eIF4E-related sequences were used to re-probe the databanks to retrieve further sequences of overlapping cDNA fragments from the same species or to obtain sequences from additional species. The process of iteration was continued to obtain sequences encoding more eIF4E-family members.

The majority of acquired sequences represented eIF4E-family members from Metazoa (Animalia), Viridiplantae and Fungi. Comparison of the number of eIF4E-family members defined within a particular taxonomic division and the number of species the members represented suggests that many organisms contain two or more eIF4E-family members.

Sequences representing either one of eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E can be identified in other viridiplantae classes suggesting that the genes arose from an earlier duplication event. The two forms are closely related in sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) and each possesses all the activities attributed to mammalian eIF4E-1 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

However, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that these duplications occurred prior to speciation.

Three eIF4E-1 sub-family members can be identified from the zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, termed eIF4E-1A, eIF4E-1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and eIF4E-1C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Orthologues of the gene encoding eIF4E-1B, but not that of eIF4E-1C, can be found in almost all species above Actinoptergyii for which sequence has been acquired. Both eIF4E-1A and eIF4E-1B possess similar levels of identity when compared to mammalian eIF4E-1s and possess all known residues required for interaction with the cap-structure, eIF4G, and 4E-BPs. eIF4E-1A, like mammalian eIF4E-1, is expressed ubiquitously and can restore the growth of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>lacking a functional <italic>eIF4E</italic>-gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It can bind to the cap-structure, eIF4G, and 4E-BP <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Conversely, eIF4E-1B is expressed only during early embryogenesis and in the gonads and muscles of adult fish, and is unable to complement yeast lacking eIF4E. Furthermore, eIF4E-1B is unable to bind to the cap-structure, eIF4G, or 4E-BP <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>has a total of six genes, all of which are expressed, encoding Class I eIF4E-family members eIF4E-1a-f (also termed eIF4E-1, 4, 5, 3, 7, and 6, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). There is also evidence of a seventh Class I eIF4E-family member (termed eIF4E-2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]) that arises from alternate splicing of primary transcripts and shares the same core sequence as eIF4E-1a. Four of the genes share exon/intron structure in their carboxy-terminal regions and form a cluster in the genome. All Class I eIF4Es from <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>bind to cap-analogue. Furthermore, all of them, except eIF4E-1f (eIF4E-6 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]), which has a truncated carboxy-terminal domain, are able to interact with <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>eIF4G or 4E-BP. The expression of each has been shown to vary throughout the life cycle of the fly. Examination of both expressed sequences and partial or complete genome sequences of insect species has not revealed a similar repertoire of Class I eIF4E-family members outside the genus of <italic>Drosophila </italic>(data not shown).</p><p>An alignment of Class I eIF4E-family members from nematodes is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>. Although only a single Class I eIF4E orthologue can be found in <italic>Ascaris suum</italic>, many nematodes express more than one Class I family member (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Four of the five <italic>C. elegans </italic>eIF4E-family members (termed IFEs for <underline>i</underline>nitiation <underline>f</underline>actor of <italic><underline>e</underline>legans</italic>), are Class I members. With respect to activities, IFE-3 corresponds to mammalian eIF4E-1 and binds only to mono-methylated cap-structures. However, in nematodes, a proportion of the mRNAs possesses a tri-methyl-cap arising from the post-transcriptional addition of a tri-methyl-cap containing spliced leader RNA (SLRNA) to the 5' end of a transcribed mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The translation of such trans-spliced mRNAs in <italic>C. elegans </italic>is thought to be mediated by IFE-1, 2, and 5 since they, unlike IFE-3, interact with both mono- and tri-methylated cap-structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. IFE-1, 2, and 5 possess more similarity to IFE-3 in sequence than to Class I family members from other phyla of Metazoa suggesting they arose from gene-duplications of a progenitor IFE-3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Evidence in support of this hypothesis comes from recent studies of the only identified IFE-3-like protein from the nematode <italic>Ascaris suum. A. suum </italic>IFE-3 (also termed eIF4E-3) can bind and stimulate the translation of mRNAs possessing mono- or tri-methylated cap structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]<italic> in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, identified sequences from some nematodes, such as the parasitic <italic>Haemanchus contortus </italic>suggest that they express single form of eIF4E similar to IFE-3 and a single form related to IFE-1, -2 or -5. No direct relatives of IFE-1, -2 and -5-like proteins have been found in any taxonomic group other than Nematoda.</p><p>Multiple Class I eIF4E-family members can also be found in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

Unlike eIF4E1, expression of eIF4E2 is not essential. However, levels of eIF4E1 and eIF4E2 vary with growth temperature and at higher temperatures eIF4E2 is more abundant than eIF4E1. Both eIF4E1 and eIF4E2 can bind the cap-structure with similar affinity <italic>in vitro </italic>but eIF4E1 has a 100-fold greater affinity for <italic>S. pombe </italic>eIF4G than eIF4E2 despite the fact that both share all known amino acids required for interaction with eIF4G.

The members also posses ~30&#x02013;35 % identity and 60&#x02013;65 % similarity to Class I eIF4E-family members of sub-groups 1, 2, and 3. Like Class I eIF4E-family members, Class II eIF4Es also share a structural core of approximately ~160&#x02013;170 amino acids. All identified members of this class differ from Class I eIF4E-family members in that they possess a hydrophobic residue such as Tyr, Phe, or Leu, but not Trp, in the position equivalent to Trp-56 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E-1. All identified Class II members from Metazoa and Viridiplantae also contain a substitution at the position equivalent to Trp-43 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E-1.

Mutants of <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>that express a markedly reduced level of eIF4E-2 show defects in anterior-posterior axis formation during early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Development of the anterior-posterior axis in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>embryos is dependent on the distribution of the maternal effect genes which include <italic>bicoid </italic>and <italic>caudal</italic>. In the oocyte, caudal mRNA is evenly distributed, whereas bicoid mRNA is restricted to the anterior of the cell. Translation of bicoid mRNA is activated upon fertilization resulting in a gradient of bicoid protein decreasing toward the posterior of the embryo. Through interaction of bicoid with a region within the 3' UTR of caudal mRNA, the translation of caudal mRNA is inhibited resulting in an opposing gradient of caudal expression. Evidence suggests that <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>eIF4E-2 binds specifically to a region of bicoid resembling the eIF4E-binding region within eIF4G. This suggests that inhibition of caudal mRNA translation is due to sequestration of the caudal mRNA into a inactive 'circular' complex with which eIF4E-1 and ribosomes cannot interact. Such a mechanism of translational regulation through eIF4E-2 may not be restricted to <italic>D. melanogaster. </italic>The nematode Class II representative, IFE-4, is expressed in <italic>C. elegans </italic>in pharyngeal and tail neurons, body wall muscle, spermatheca and vulva, suggesting a special use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

The Class III members recognized have only been identified in Metazoa. They are well represented in chordates from tunicates, agnathans, jawed fish and higher vertebrates.

No evidence supporting the expression of Class III eIF4E-family members was found in nematodes.

In Arachnida, a Class III eIF4E-family member can be identified in the Parasitiforms (brown ear tick, <italic>Rhiphicephalus appendiculatus</italic>). The origins of Class III may result from a early duplication of a Class II gene as suggested in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. A fuller picture of its phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary relationships will depend on the accumulation of more sequence data from more non-chordate metazoa.

The sequences of two of these members (Leish4E-1 and Leish4E-2) are also presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>. Leish4E-1 and Leish4E-2 possess a Class I-like signature (Trp-residues at the equivalent of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E-1 residues 43 and 56). Like family members of sub-group 8, both Leish4E-1 and Leish4E-2 contain extended amino acid stretches between structural units of the core, although the positions or lengths of the extensions differ from those found in sub-group 8 eIF4Es. In Trypanosomatidae, polycistronic pre-mRNA transcripts are processed to generate monocistronic RNAs which are further modified by the addition of capped spliced leader (SL) RNA. Unlike the tri-methylated SLRNAs from nematodes, the SLRNA of Trypanosomatidae possess mono-methylated cap-structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] that are further modified on the first four transcribed nucleotides by addition of 2'-O methyl groups resulting in all mRNAs containing so-called cap-4 structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The presence of cap-4 and/or the nucleotide sequence of the SLRNA is thought to be required for efficient recruitment of trans-spliced mRNAs into polysomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Studies <italic>in vitro </italic>have shown that <italic>L. major</italic>, LeishIF4E-1, which contains two areas of extended sequence between the structural units of the core, binds both m<sup>7</sup>GTP and the cap-4 structure with similar affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This is in contrast to mammalian eIF4E-1 which possesses a 5-fold greater affinity for m<sup>7</sup>GTP compared to cap-4. Although trans-splicing has not been demonstrated in Alveolata, Stramenopiles, or Haptophyta, the presence of extensions within the core regions may signify that these eIF4E-family members, like Leish4E-1, recognize more complex cap-structures, specific modifications, or other sequences close to the cap-structure of a mRNA. This is of particular interest because many representatives of these sub-kingdoms are parasites or infectious agents.</p><p>Although reliant only on genomic data, specialization of a different nature can be seen in eIF4E-family members from the microsporidian, <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>, and of the algal endosymbiont of the cryptophyte <italic>Guillardia theta </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). The diminutive genome of the <italic>G. theta </italic>algal endosymbiont (~0.55 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]) has undergone extreme compaction relative to the genomes of other Rhodophyta such as <italic>Cyanidioschyzon merolae </italic>which has a genome of ~16.5 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The <italic>E. cuniculi </italic>genome is also highly compacted at ~2.9 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].

With the exception of <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>eIF4E-1d, all members of the three defined non-protist structural classes of eIF4E-family members possess a Trp-residue equivalent to Trp-73 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E-1. Examination of the eIF4G-binding regions of eIF4E-family members from both <italic>E. cuniculi </italic>and the <italic>G. theta </italic>nucleomorph reveals differences relative to <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E-1. In both cases, residues equivalent to Trp-73 of <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E-1 are substituted by a non-aromatic Leu residue. As discussed earlier, such a substitution in <italic>H. sapiens </italic>eIF4E-1 has been shown to impair the ability of eIF4E-1 to interact with either eIF4G or with 4E-BPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the case of the <italic>G. theta </italic>algal endosymbiont this variation may not be remarkable since the genome of the nucleomorph appears to lack any identifiable sequence encoding eIF4G-like or 4E-BP-like proteins. Since the genome of the <italic>G. theta </italic>endosymbiont has been so severely compacted, it is hypothesized that the genes encoding complex cellular functions in the endosymbiont, such as protein synthesis, are limited to the minimal set needed to accomplish the function. Although the endosymbiont has its own mRNAs with 5'-caps and poly(A) tails, elongation and release factors, its genome only encodes a subset of translational initiation factors: eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF2 (all subunits, although the alpha subunit is truncated), eIF4E, eIF6 and poly(A) binding protein. The genes for many initiation factors thought to be essential for cannot be identified including eIF4B, eIF5, or the scaffold protein eIF3 (any subunit).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>eIF4E, a translational initiation factor found only in eukaryotes has a unique alpha/beta fold that is considered to have no homologues outside the eukaryotes, as determined by sequence comparison or structural analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The expansion of sequenced cDNAs and genomic DNAs from organisms of all taxonomic kingdoms has significantly altered our picture of eIF4E which must now be considered to be one member of a structurally related family of eIF4E-like proteins.</p><p>Evolutionarily it seems that a single early eIF4E gene has undergone multiple gene duplications generating multiple structural classes. The functions of each member of each structural class remain to be completely understood. However, it is no longer possible to predict eIF4E-function from the primary amino acid sequence of an eIF4E-family member, as exemplified by the functional diversity of examples mentioned here and recently reviewed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The ancestral gene of eIF4E has also provided a blueprint for the generation of related proteins with specialized functions found only in certain taxonomic groups. The <italic>C. elegans </italic>IFE-1, -2 and -5 appear to result from gene duplications that occurred within early nematodes to give rise to a specialized sub-class that recognizes alternate cap structures. No direct relatives of these tri-methyl-cap binding proteins can be found in any other phyla. The extended eIF4Es of certain protists, like <italic>L. major </italic>have evolved independently to fulfill a similar function. These eIF4E variants seem likely to provide a rich source of variations on the eIF4E structural theme that will provide unique opportunities for structure/function studies and therapeutic drug design.

Sequences were not considered verified unless a minimum of two sequences representing overlapping cDNA fragments confirmed the assignment of a single nucleotide. Where multiple nucleotides assignments for a particular base in a consensus sequence were supported by multiple sequences these variations were considered to represent polymorphisms or variations in strains. To allow for such variations, information about the strain used for development of the cDNA library from which an EST was recovered (provided by some submitters to GenBank databanks) was utilized to select a subset of sequences. Where strain information was not available, or where strain information still suggested multiple possibilities for an assignment, the assignment of a base supported by the majority EST sequences was chosen. In almost all cases these variations led to either no change at the amino acid level due to codon-degeneracy, or a single amino acid variation. Furthermore, such variations were either confined to regions encoding segments N-terminal of the core of the eIF4E-family member or had no affect on the prediction of amino acids in positions related to those known to be involved in the interaction of mammalian eIF4E-1 with the cap-structure, eIF4G, and 4E-BPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Alignments and analyses of sequences representing eIF4E-family members</title><p>Since alignments of mammalian eIF4E-1s, plant eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eIF4E suggest the presence of an evolutionarily conserved core region and because deletion analyses of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eIF4E and <italic>D. rerio </italic>eIF4E-1A suggest that the N-termini and C-termini are dispensable with respect to cap-binding, eIF4G and 4E-BP interaction, sequences representing the core region of an eIF4E-family member were used for analyses unless otherwise stated.

The predicted amino acid sequences, accession numbers of all sequences used to derive consensus cDNA sequences, and full names of all the species from which they were derived, are supplied in the form of Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.
