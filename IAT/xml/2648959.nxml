Microarray expression analysis revealed changes in genes important in cell growth including members of the MAPK signal transduction pathway.

Studies of ErbB1, ErbB2 and heregulin (the ErbB3/4 ligand) deficient mice indicate that these genes are essential for embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In turn, the activity of the ErbB receptors is regulated by their interacting partners. An ErbB3 binding protein (Ebp1) was cloned in our laboratory during a yeast two-hybrid screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Ebp1 is identical to the murine p38-2G4 protein which was isolated as a DNA binding protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These proteins are members of the Proliferation-associated 2G4 <italic>(Pa2g4) </italic>gene family, which is highly conserved throughout evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. More than 30 genes encoding proteins homologous to Ebp1 have been found in organisms ranging from <italic>Danio rerio </italic>to <italic>Pan troglodytes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Ebp1 is expressed in mammalian cell lines derived from multiple origins. Ebp1 mRNA is also found in all normal adult human and murine tissues examined including liver, heart, brain, placenta, lung, muscle, pancreas, kidney, prostate and breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Examination of EST data bases reveals that Ebp1 is expressed in all tissue types at different stages of embryonic development. Its ubiquitous distribution in both embryonic and adult tissues suggests it affects various developmental and physiological pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>An important role for Ebp1 in cell proliferation and survival <italic>in vitro </italic>has been demonstrated by many groups. We have shown that Ebp1 inhibits transcription of E2F1 regulated cell cycle genes such as E2F1, Cyclin D1 and cyclin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This transcriptional regulation is due in part to interactions with the transcriptional corepressors Sin3A, Rb and HDAC2 on E2F1 regulated promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Ectopic expression of <italic>Ebp1 </italic>inhibits the growth of human breast[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] both <italic>in vitro </italic>and in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In breast cancer cell lines, Ebp1 regulates levels of ErbB2 and controls the cellular response to heregulin and the antiestrogen tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In prostate cancer, ectopic expression of Ebp1 results in downregulation of Androgen Receptor (AR) and several of its target genes and inhibition of AR-regulated cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Ebp1 also has a role in regulating cell survival as its interaction with AKT kinase suppresses apoptosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which Ebp1 exerts its effects on cell proliferation and survival are incompletely understood. The biological effects of Ebp1 were originally postulated to be based on its ability to bind DNA. Ebp1 is a member of the SF00553 protein superfamily, the prototype of which is a 42 KDa DNA binding protein isolated from the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Blast analysis reveals that Ebp1 and the yeast 42 KDa protein have 38% amino acid identity and 56% similarity. The <italic>S. pombe </italic>protein preferentially binds a synthetic curved DNA sequence. Ebp1 binds directly to this synthetic curved DNA sequence and is recruited to E2F1 promoter elements <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>as part of a protein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The interaction of Ebp1 with the E2F1 promoter is regulated by the ErbB3 ligand HRG.</p><p>In addition to its ability to interact with proteins and DNA, Ebp1 binds to an array of RNA targets. Squaritto et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] found that a pool of EBP1 localized to the nucleolus binds RNA and may be involved in ribosomal biogenesis. EBP1 can bind to B23 (nucleophosmin), as a component of pre- ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the cytoplasm, Ebp1 associates with the 40 S subunit of mature ribosomes, suggesting that it can also be involved in protein translation. Sedimentation studies revealed that Ebp1 copurified with eIF2&#x003b1;, a component of the translation initiation complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Ebp1 contains an RNA binding domain &#x003c3;- 70 like motif that maps to aa 46&#x02013;64 that mediates its interaction with RNA and its nucleolar localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A double-stranded RNA binding domain was also mapped to aa 91&#x02013;156. Other studies showing that EBP1 binds the 3'UTR of bcl-2 mRNA and stabilizes &#x003b2;-globin-ARE bcl-2 transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] suggest that EBP1 is a functional RNA binding protein. Finally, Ebp1 has been demonstrated to bind to viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite burgeoning interest in the role of Ebp1 in several important cellular activities, the physiological function of Ebp1 in the intact organism is not known. We therefore characterized Ebp1- deficient mice generated by a gene trap insertion in intron 2 of the <italic>pa2g4 </italic>gene. We show that Ebp1-deficient mice exhibit transient dwarfism. This is accompanied by a decrease in serum levels of IGF-1 and IGF binding proteins and changes in expression of several other genes associated with cell growth. These results provide <italic>in vivo </italic>evidence that Ebp1 plays an important role in cellular growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Disruption of the Ebp1 gene</title><p>Ebp1<sup>+/- </sup>mice were generated at Lexicon Genetics from ES cells containing a retroviral gene trap in the <italic>Ebp1 </italic>locus as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Sequence analysis showed that the gene trap was inserted at a single site in the 2.3 kb intron 2 of the <italic>Ebp1 </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). The insertion led to the expression of an Ebp1-neomycin fusion molecule containing only the first 20 amino acids that are encoded by Exon 1 of <italic>Ebp1 </italic>that has no known biological function. The mice were genotyped by PCR with primers located at each side of the gene trap and in the LTR2 cassette (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of the Ebp1 null mouse</bold>.

We therefore measured Ebp1 protein expression in several organs to determine the penetrance of the knock out. We found as expected that Ebp1 was expressed in adult lung and kidney of 10 week old wild type mice. Ebp1 expression was absent in the Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>mouse (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Breeding data and post natal lethality</title><p>Breeding data were obtained from crosses between both heterozygous and homozygous mice, since both Ebp1<sup>+/- </sup>and Ebp1<sup>-/-</sup>male and females were fertile. In all cases, the sex ratio was approximately 1:1. The genotypes of the pups from heterozygous pairs were present at approximately the expected ratio of 25:50:25 (Ebp1<sup>+/+</sup>, Ebp1<sup>+/- </sup>and Ebp1<sup>-/-</sup>) (n = 40). Survival was approximately equal for all three groups eight weeks after birth. Male and female knock-out mice were fertile and inbred mating resulted in viable offspring. However, litter size was smaller for the Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>mice. Litter size of wild type mice was 9.1 &#x000b1; .8, and for knock out mice,4.2 &#x000b1; 1.3 (4 litters for each group).</p><p>In general, life expectancy, of knock out mice was indistinguishable compared with their littermates. Ten mice of each genotype were maintained for one year. 9/10 knock out and 10/10 heterozygous and 10/10 wild type mice survived.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced growth of Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>mice</title><p>The most striking feature of adult <italic>Ebp1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice is their initial smaller body size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and in about 1/3 of the mice the presence of kinky tails. The progeny of crosses between heterozygous parents were kept with the heterozygous mother and weighed sequentially. At day 19, there was a significant (p = .008) reduction of approximately 30% in body weight for both males and females. Mice were weaned at Day 21. After Day 30 mice began to catch up in size with wild type litter mates and at Day 60 there were no differences in weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). To rule out the possibility that competition during milk sucking was responsible for growth retardation, Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>males and females or wild type males and females were crossed. KO or WT progeny were housed alone with their mother. Males and females were weighed and data pooled due to difficulties in determining sex at early time points. Weights were the same for WT and KO mice at Day 4. However, at Days 10 and 18, these mice also displayed a 25% reduction in weight (2 litters, 9 total knock out, 15 total wild type).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Growth retardation of Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>mice</bold>.

We therefore tested if the cellular response to EGF would be changed in Ebp1 knock out MEFs.

However, MAPK was basally phosphorylated only in knock out MEFS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). EGF-induced AKT phosphorylation in wild type and knock out cells was also determined using a phospho specific AKT antibody.

The gene trap leads to deletion of all but the first 20 amino acids of Ebp1 which have no biological function on their own. The most striking feature of the Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>phenotype was the small size of the mice. It is of interest to note that inhibition of expression of the potato homologue of Ebp1 also results in a dwarf phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>Ebp1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>pups were on average 25% smaller than their wild type and heterozygous littermates until Day 30, the approximate onset of puberty. Mice were well proportioned with no skeletal abnormalities other than a kinky tail in approximately 1/3 of the mice. An unusual feature of our <italic>in vivo </italic>analysis is the fact that the reduced weight was recovered after the prepubescent stage, while Ebp1 is still normally transcribed and translated and therefore likely to have a regulatory role. Although we are unable to explain the mechanism underlying this recovery, we report this observation as a possible example of temporal restricted competence in growth regulation of specific cell types by Ebp1. This phenotype is similar to that observed for the OTX 1 gene, a homeobox containing gene that <italic>in vitro </italic>activates transcription of GH, FSH, and LH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>It is of interest that the phenotype of Ebp1 knock out animals also resembles that of the <italic>IMP1 </italic>knock out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. IMP1 belongs to a family of RNA binding proteins implicated in mRNA localization, turnover, and translational control. These mice also exhibit a dwarf phenotype with reduced proliferation of knock out MEFs. In these mice, growth retardation is related to a hypoplastic small intestine. In contrast, Ebp1 mice exhibit a transient dwarfism and their intestines are both grossly and histologically normal at 10 weeks. However, we were unable to assess intestinal anatomy and histology at earlier time points, and it remains possible that abnormalities occur when the weight differences are most marked. Ebp1 has also been shown to be an RNA binding protein with a sigma- 70 like motif. This motif has been identified as a new RNA binding domain unique to the superfamily of Imp4 or Brix proteins that are required for ribosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A role for Ebp1 in ribosomal biogenesis is supported by studies indicating its localization in the nucleolus, its association with 5 S ribosomal RNA, and its complexing with proteins such as B23 which are involved in ribosome processing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Whereas the significance of RNA binding proteins in spatial and temporal control of gene expression during development is evident in invertebrate organisms, the function of RNA binding proteins during mammalian development is less clear. With the exception of FMRP, Dazla, and Nova-1, which are associated with mental retardation, azospermia, and neuronal viability respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the majority of the mammalian RNA binding proteins are constitutively expressed and exhibit a relative broad RNA-binding specificity. Further work is needed to uncover the role that Ebp1's RNA binding activity has in the development of this phenotype and the target RNAs that specifically interact with Ebp1.</p><p>The molecular pathways leading to dwarfism are likely to involve several mechanisms. As reduced growth was manifested in the MEFs from Day 12.5 embryos, we used these cells to measure changes in gene expression associated with loss of Ebp1. Global gene expression analysis indicated that expression of IGF-1 and the IGF binding proteins IGFBP3 and 4 was decreased. The <italic>in vivo </italic>growth promoting role of the IGFs has been demonstrated conclusively from the dwarfing phenotypes observed after targeted mutagenesis of the mouse <italic>Igf1 </italic>and <italic>Igf1r </italic>genes. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. IGF-1 functions both during embryonic and post natal development. IGF-1 mutants exhibit a birth weight that is 60% of normal and the difference between their size and that of wild type mice increases progressively with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The Ebp1 phenotype is not as severe as that observed in IGF-1 deficient mice. The function of IGFBPs in cell growth is more complex. However, one role is to sequester and stabilize IGF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, decreases in IGFBPs may result in destabilization of IGF-1 and may be partially responsible for lower levels of serum IGF-1.</p><p>We found that MAPK was constitutively phosphorylated in MEFs derived from knock out mice. This constitutive phosphorylation was associated with the overexpression of SOS-1, an upstream activator of the Ras -MAPK signal transduction pathway. It is possible that overexpression of SOS-1 led to increased basal phosphorylation of MAPK. In contrast, both the basal and HRG-induced activation of the MAPK pathway is increased in <italic>EBP1 </italic>transfected breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The reasons for these apparently discordant findings may be related to the ligand used, the differential expression of ErbB receptors in breast cancer cells versus fibroblasts, and the cellular background.</p><p>We have previously shown that inhibition of Ebp1 expression results in increases in phospho AKT in human breast cancer cell lines, whereas ectopic expression of <italic>ebp1 </italic>inhibits HRG induced AKT activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Here, we found that Ebp1 had no effect on AKT phosphorylation after EGF stimulation of MEFs. However, AKT was constitutively phosphorylated in mammary epithelial cells of knock-out mice. The mechanism of the increase in AKT phosphorylation is unclear. Paradoxically, Ahn et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have shown the binding of Ebp1 to nuclear AKT increases AKT phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] in PC-12 neuronal cells. It is not known if Ebp1 binds AKT in normal mammary epithelial cells or affects its phosphorylation. These studies point up the importance of tissue context in the activation of specific signaling molecules. As activation of AKT is important in development of mammary adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], we are currently monitoring breast tumor incidence with age in Ebp1 knock out mice. We have not yet seen increased tumor incidence in a small cohort of mice that have been carried until one year.</p><p>Finally, our laboratory has demonstrated that ectopic expression of <italic>Ebp1 </italic>results in decreased expression of AR and AR target genes and inhibition of growth of prostate cancer cells both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the current study, deletion of the <italic>Ebp1 </italic>gene led to increased expression of AR in prostates of adult mice and upregulation of the metastasis associated gene <italic>AGR2</italic>. AR plays a key role in the development and progression of prostate cancer, and we anticipate that the <italic>Ebp1 </italic>knockout mouse may have a hyperactivated AR signaling axis that may result in increased incidence of prostate cancer. Also with regard to prostate cancer, decreased expression of IGFBP-3 is correlated with increased risk of developing prostate cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Western blot analysis verified that <italic>Ebp1 </italic>knockout led to reduced protein levels of IGFBP-3 in liver and kidney. We were unable to detect IGFBP-3 in prostates of either wild type or knock out mice, but studies are ongoing to assess if there are changes in IGFBP-3 expression in the prostates of knock out mice. We are also monitoring the incidence of prostate cancer of the Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>mice as they age. Nevertheless, current studies, together with our previous reports, strongly suggest that Ebp1, as an endogenous regulator of ErbB-AR crosstalk, may regulate expression of a series of genes that are involved in aggressive prostate cancer growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, although Ebp1 appears to be dispensable for prenatal development, loss of Ebp1 affects post-natal growth. This growth delay may be related to changes in IGF-1 and IGFBP levels and to changes in key components of cellular proliferation pathways. Of interest, two genes involved in prostate cancer progression, androgen receptor and AGR2, are increased in prostates of Ebp1 knock out mice. Our Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>mouse line represents a new <italic>in vivo </italic>model to investigate Ebp1 function in the entire organism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Gene trap insertion in ES cells and generation of Ebp1<sup>-/- </sup>mice</title><p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells (129/SvEvBrd) with a retroviral gene trap vector insert (VICTR20) into the Ebp1 locus (Omnibank no.
