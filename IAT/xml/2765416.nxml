In this direction we investigated, in some regions of the rat gastrointestinal tract, the presence and localization of aquaporin-6, given its peculiar function as an ion selective channel.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RT-PCR and immunoblotting experiments showed that aquaporin-6 was expressed in all the investigated portions of the rat gastrointestinal tract. The RT-PCR experiments showed that aquaporin-6 transcript was highly expressed in small intestine and rectum, and less in stomach, caecum and colon. In addition, jejunal mRNA expression was specifically stimulated by feeding.</p><p>Immunoblotting analysis showed a major band with a molecular weight of about 55 kDa corresponding to the aquaporin-6 protein dimer; this band was stronger in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. Immunoblotting analysis of brush border membrane vesicle preparations showed an intense signal for aquaporin-6 protein.</p><p>The results of in situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that aquaporin-6 transcript is present in the isthmus, neck and basal regions of the stomach lining, and throughout the crypt-villus axis in both small and large intestine. In the latter regions, immunohistochemistry revealed strong aquaporin-6 labelling in the apical membrane of the surface epithelial cells, while weak or no labelling was observed in the crypt cells. In the stomach, an intense staining was observed in mucous neck cells and lower signal in principal cells and some parietal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results indicate that aquaporin-6 is distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Aquaporin-6 localization at the apical pole of the superficial epithelial cells and its upregulation by feeding suggest that it may be involved in movements of water and anions through the epithelium of the villi.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The gastrointestinal tract moves a large amount of fluid, quantitatively second only to that of the kidney. In man, about 9 L/day of water (deriving from diet and digestive juices) are absorbed, and about 1-2 L/day are secreted with enteric juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Like the kidney, the intestine can also contribute to water homeostasis maintenance by modulating water (and electrolytes) absorption and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Transporting epithelia offer two pathways for water and solute flows: 1) the paracellular route, consisting of junctional complexes and lateral intercellular spaces; 2) the transcellular route, consisting the apical and basolateral cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These routes are not completely independent, since the lateral intercellular spaces may provide a compartment in which the transport pathways may communicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Transcellular water transport may occur by several mechanisms but, in the last decade, a special attention has been paid to the role of AQPs, which allow rapid and substantial bi-directional movement of fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Indeed, eight different AQPs have been identified and partially characterized in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Aquaporin-6 (AQP6) was first identified in the kidney of the rat (original name WCH3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and human (original name hKID; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). In the rat, AQP6 gene localizes to chromosome 7 locus 7q36, where it is composed of four exons and three introns. The predicted amino acid sequence contained one consensus site for N-linked glycosylation at Asn-134 and one for phosphorylation at Ser-197 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Expression of AQP6 in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes shows low water permeability (<italic>Pf</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] which rapidly increases up to ten fold with Hg<sup>2+ </sup>treatment, unlike other AQPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Acidic pH (lower than 5.5) also increases the <italic>Pf </italic>of AQP6 oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This activation of AQP6 water permeability is accompanied by an increased ion conductance with the following halide permeability sequence: NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>&#x0003e;I<sup>-</sup>&#x0003e;&#x0003e;Br<sup>-</sup>&#x0003e;Cl<sup>-</sup>&#x0003e;&#x0003e;SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, differently from other mammalian orthologs AQPs, AQP6 seems to function primarily as an anion-selective channel rather than as a water channel. Moreover, a careful analysis of AQP sequences alignment and mutation experiments demonstrated that the single substitution of the Asn-60 with a Gly residue eliminates the anion permeability and greatly enhances the osmotic water permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Whereas most known AQPs are localized on the plasma membrane (except AQP11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), AQP6 in the kidney is localized almost solely in intracellular vesicles (only 1.2% is associated with plasma membrane) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Immunogold studies revealed that AQP6 is colocalized with H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in intracellular vesicles of the intercalated cells of renal collecting ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recently, AQP6 was also found in the cerebellum, close to the tight junctions, in secretory granule membranes of parotid acinar cells, and in the apical portion of inner ear supporting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but its expression in the gastrointestinal tissue has been not investigated yet.</p><p>In the present study, we investigate whether AQP6 is expressed in several regions of the rat gastrointestinal tract and then define the localization of AQP6 protein, from stomach to rectum, under the hypothesis that it could be involved in physiological mechanisms of fluid movement, acid base regulation and/or anion transport. The expression of AQP6 mRNA and protein in different portions of the rat gastrointestinal tract was studied by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, and the cellular and subcellular localization of mRNA and protein by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, the small intestine expression of AQP3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 mRNA was investigated in relation to feeding. This study provides evidence for the expression of AQP6 at the apical side of superficial cells of both small and large intestine and to a minor extent in gastric principal and parietal cells. Moreover, the upregulation of AQP6 by feeding in the small intestine suggests its direct involvement in the absorption of water and anions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RT-PCR analysis of AQ6 mRNA expression in rat gastrointestinal tract</title><p>We investigated the expression and distribution of AQP6 mRNA in different portions of rat gastrointestinal tract by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of AQP6 was normalized using &#x003b2;-actin as internal standard. Single bands of the size expected for cDNA fragments were amplified (379 and 509 bp for AQP6 and &#x003b2;-actin, respectively). The results of agarose gel electrophoresis of representative PCR reaction products are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Negative controls of RT-PCR experiments were always performed by omitting reverse transcriptase (not shown). The specificity of the amplified cDNAs was confirmed by sequencing PCR products. The nucleotide sequence of PCR products was identical to the published sequence for rat AQP6 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_022181">NM_022181</ext-link>]. AQP6 mRNA was expressed in all the portions of the rat gastrointestinal tract, although expression levels varied between samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Densitometric analysis of the bands showed that AQP6 transcript was significantly higher in the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and in the rectum than in the large intestine (caecum, proximal and distal colon). The values (means &#x000b1; S.E.M.; n = 4), expressed as AQP/&#x003b2;-actin densitometric percentage ratio, were: 15.4 &#x000b1; 2.7 (stomach); 27.5* &#x000b1; 1.4 (duodenum); 29.9* &#x000b1; 3.6 (jejunum); 22.3&#x000a7;. &#x000b1; 2.4 (ileum); 15.1 &#x000b1; 1.6 (caecum); 12.7 &#x000b1; 1.1 (proximal colon); 12.4 &#x000b1; 1.1 (distal colon); 21.8&#x000a7; &#x000b1; 2.6 (rectum). *, P &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. caecum, proximal colon, distal colon and stomach; &#x000a7;, P &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. proximal colon and distal colon (one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls's <italic>Q </italic>test).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Distribution of AQP6 mRNA expression in different portions of the rat gastrointestinal tract</bold>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The results revealed two main bands (28 and 55 kDa) on immunoblots of membranes from AQP6 oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), consistent with published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], while non-injected oocytes were negative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Specificity of the reaction was further confirmed by preabsorption experiments performed with total membrane homogenates from rat stomach and kidney (control tissues known to express AQP6) and by incubating the blots with pre-immune rabbit serum. In both cases the AQP6 protein bands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>) were completely ablated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>).

AQP6 was demonstrated, characterized and extensively studied in the &#x003b1;-intercalated cells of the renal collecting duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recent studies demonstrate AQP6 expression in extra renal tissues such as the cerebellum, parotids, and inner ear endorgans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The results presented here show for the first time that AQP6 is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). RT-PCR experiments reveal that AQP6 transcript is significantly higher in the small intestine and in the rectum than in the other portion of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Immunoblotting analysis of crude gastrointestinal tissue homogenates and BBMV preparations show that AQP6 protein expression is higher in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). As suggested by immunohistochemistry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>, inset), the small intestine AQP6 immunoreactivity is concentrated in the apical membrane domain (since immunoblotting of BBMV show an increased signal in comparison to the whole homogenate). The specificity of the reaction was tested on immunoblots of membranes isolated from AQP6 oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), by preadsorbing the antibody with a 20 fold molar excess of immunizing peptide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>) or by incubating the blots with pre-immune-serum (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). The AQP6 protein bands were similar to those previously obtained from kidney homogenates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], although the major band observed here was the 55 kDa (that represents the dimer form) and only occasionally the monomeric form at 28 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><p>The combined analysis of AQP6 mRNA and protein were made to strengthen the results of localization experiments. Except for the stomach, AQP6 mRNA and protein have different patterns of distribution within the gut wall. While mRNA abundance is homogeneous, protein labelling increases from the crypt toward the villus tip. The presence of AQP6 transcript in the crypt cells and lower part of the villus suggests that the gene is transcribed early in the differentiation of epithelial cells, while the protein is present almost exclusively in the mature epithelial cells of the villus tip. Discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression has been observed in the small and large intestine also for AQP3.)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the stomach, AQP6 mRNA is present in the isthmus, neck and basal region, as observed by in situ hybridization experiments. The results by immunohistochemistry show a strong AQP6 immunolabelling in the isthmus and neck regions and a weak signal in some parietal cells dispersed throughout the glands and in the zymogenic cells at the base of the gland (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>).</p><p>Based on available data, besides AQP6 only AQP3 and AQP4 are present in the stomach, both at the basolateral side of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, the cellular and subcellular localization of AQP6 cannot support its involvement in gastric juice secretion.</p><p>Indeed, the intense labelling of MNC appeared located in intracellular vesicles (apical granules) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>, inset). This restrictive localization of AQP6 in the cytoplasm of MNC in close association with small secretory granules was similar to that previously shown for AQP6 in the renal epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and for AQP10 in the membrane of the granular vesicles of gastroenteropancreatic endocrine cells of the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Apart from the well known capacity of the MNC to secrete mucus, the functions of this cell lineage are still obscure. Three possible functions were hypothesized: i) MNC could be undifferentiated (immature) cells, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; ii) MNC could secrete several peptides involved in both mucosal protection and repairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; iii) MNC could contain pepsinogen A and C granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, independently from these hypotheses the common characteristic of these cells is the secretory function. Thus, AQP6 expression in the membrane of the MNC secretory granules may be involved in osmotic water movement associated with the exocytotic process. Moreover, the lower AQP6 expression observed in mature chief and parietal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>) could indirectly prove the stem cell function of MNC. Indeed, AQP6 may be expressed as an early gene in a developmental stage of the MNC that undergoes gene repression: this stage corresponds to the differentiation process of this cell lineage culminating in the phenotype of the fully functional mature zymogenic and parietal cells. Another important finding of this study is that AQP6 localizes at the apical membrane domain of the superficial epithelial cells of both small and large intestine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d, f</xref>) similarly to that observed in the parotid glands. The apical membrane localization of AQP6 has been also confirmed by immunoblotting results obtained with BBMV preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). Thus a role of this water/anion channel in the intestinal absorptive and secretive functions cannot be excluded. This suggestion has been strengthened by the observed increase in AQP6 transcript and protein in fed rat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, of all AQPs studied, AQP6 was the only one upregulated by feeding in the small intestinal mucosa. Higher AQP8 mRNA levels were conversely found in fasting condition. However, further experiments are required to clarify fully the meaning of this finding. Moreover, no modification by feeding was observed in renal mRNA extracts (not shown).</p><p>The involvement of a transcellular pathway for water movement across the intestinal epithelium has acquired an ever-growing importance in the last years since several AQPs have been identified in the digestive system of mammals, i.e. AQP1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These AQPs have been found in different cells of the intestinal epithelium (enterocytes, goblet cells, endothelial cells and gastroenteropancreatic endocrine cells) and in different cellular membranes (i.e., apical or basolateral). However, the direct AQPs involvement in water transport through apical membranes of the intestinal superficial epithelial cells has been demonstrated only for AQP8 in rat isolated colonocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and for AQP7 and AQP8 in rat small intestinal BBMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Recently, AQP10, a new member of the aquaglyceroporin family, was identified in the human small and large intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and, due to its localization on the apical membrane of the absorptive cells, an important role for it in water intestinal absorption was suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This hypothesis was successively disproved, since further studies identified two AQP10 isoforms localized in the small intestinal capillary endothelium and in the gastroenteropancrestic endocrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We tested therefore its presence in the rat intestine by RT-PCR but no signal was observed (Laforenza, unpublished data).</p><p>We previously proposed a model for transcellular AQP-mediated water movement in the absorptive intestinal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the working model water entered the luminal side through AQP7 and AQP8 and exited at the basolateral side through AQP3 (small intestine: villi, large intestine: surface epithelial cells of the crypts, rectum: surface epithelial cells) and AQP4 (small intestine: crypt cells, large intestine: surface epithelial cells of the crypts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We have now to modify this model by including the data reported here, i.e. the presence of an apical AQP6. However, the unique functional properties of AQP6 do not necessarily suggest its involvement in the apical water transport through the superficial epithelial cells of the small and large intestine.</p><p>Even if AQP6 belongs to the aquaporin water channel family, at neutral pH it functions as anion-selective channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and only at pH lower than 5.5 it becomes a functional water channel with maintained ion channel properties. This is interesting in the light of the well know fact that the rat duodenal and jejunal surface have an acidic microclimate (pH 5.2-6.7) that can modulate the intestinal transport of several substances, including weak electrolytes and vitamins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results strengthen the role of AQP6 in the homeostatic osmoregulation of the cytoplasm and its organelles, but also, for the first time, suggest a role upregulated by feeding for AQP6 in ion and water absorption in the gastrointestinal tract epithelium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult Wistar albino rats (350-400 g body weight) reared on a complete standard diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] were used.
