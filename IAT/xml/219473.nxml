Members of both groups, the hypoxic genes and the <italic>DAN</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>TIR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERG</italic> genes, are jointly repressed under aerobic conditions by two factors. One is Rox1, an HMG protein, and the second, originally designated Rox7, is shown here to be Mot3, a global C2H2 zinc finger regulator. Repression of anaerobic genes results from co-induction of Mot3 and Rox1 in aerobic cells. Repressor synthesis is triggered by heme, which de-represses a mechanism controlling expression of both <italic>MOT3</italic> and <italic>ROX1</italic> in anaerobic cells; it includes Hap1, Tup1, Ssn6 and a fourth unidentified factor. The constitutive expression of various anaerobic genes in aerobic <italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>mot3</italic>&#x00394; cells directly implies that neither factor can repress by itself at endogenous levels and that stringent aerobic repression results from the concerted action of both. Mot3 and Rox1 are not essential components of a single complex, since each can repress independently in the absence of the other, when artificially induced at high levels. Moreover, the two repression mechanisms appear to be distinct: as shown here repression of <italic>ANB1</italic> by Rox1 alone requires Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6, whereas repression by Mot3 does not. Though artificially high levels of either factor can repress well, the absolute efficiency observed in normal cells when both are present&#x02014;at much lower levels&#x02014;demonstrates a novel inhibitory synergy. Evidently, expression levels for the two mutually dependent repressors are calibrated to permit a range of variation in basal aerobic expression at different promoters with differing operator site combinations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Yeast adapt to the absence of oxygen by expressing several groups of genes. Two of the anaerobic regulons are negatively regulated by heme, which is produced only in the presence of oxygen. The members of one heme-repressed gene group are referred to as &#x02018;hypoxic genes&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c2">2</xref>) and encode intracellular proteins dedicated to more efficient utilization of oxygen. They are all regulated by the Rox1 repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c4">4</xref>), which is induced during aerobic growth by heme(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c3">3</xref>), resulting in &#x02018;aerobic repression&#x02019; of the regulon. In the absence of oxygen, expression of Rox1 ceases, partly through inhibition by Hap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c5">5</xref>), and Rox1 is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c6">6</xref>), de-repressing transcription. The widely varying efficiency of Rox1 repression of various hypoxic genes depends on the number and fidelity of operator sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c1">1</xref>).</p><p>The second group of heme-repressed genes are the <italic>DAN</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>TIR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERG</italic> genes, which are transcriptionally activated through a common response element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c7">7</xref>) by Mox4&#x0002f;Upc2, a binucleate zinc cluster protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c9">9</xref>). Eight of these genes encode the Dan&#x0002f;Tir cell wall proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c12">12</xref>), three of which are essential for anaerobic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c12">12</xref>); others are involved in sterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c13">13</xref>) or transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c8">8</xref>). Regulators controlling expression of this group include the oxygen-inhibited Mox4&#x0002f;Upc2 activator, and two repressors bound at neighboring sites responsible for aerobic repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c13">13</xref>). One of these is Rox1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c9">9</xref>). The second, originally designated Rox7, was identified as a repressor of <italic>DAN1</italic> and some of the other <italic>DAN</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>TIR</italic> genes, as well as of the hypoxic gene <italic>ANB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c9">9</xref>). As we show here, Rox7 is Mot3. It was previously identified as a zinc finger regulator which functions either as a repressor or activator of a diverse group of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c16">16</xref>), acting through a consensus site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c15">15</xref>) shown to be important for aerobic repression of <italic>ANB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c17">17</xref>). Through its versatility as an activator and repressor, Mot3 participates in a cell wall remodeling process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c12">12</xref>) in which anaerobic and aerobic cell wall proteins &#x0005b;the CWP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c18">18</xref>)&#x0005d; are alternately expressed in response to oxygen.</p><p>Anaerobic genes encode proteins serving several different purposes. Presumably, it is advantageous for the regulatory system to permit gene-to-gene variation in basal and induced expression as well as cross-talk by other regulatory pathways. Thus, repression in aerobic cells ranges from moderate, for some genes, e.g. those whose basal expression is indispensable, like <italic>HEM13</italic> and <italic>OLE1</italic>, to highly stringent, for genes like <italic>DAN1</italic> and <italic>ANB1</italic>. Aerobic repression depends on heme signaling through multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c12">12</xref>). We show here that expression of Mot3, like Rox1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c5">5</xref>), is induced to inhibitory levels by heme. It acts to de-repress a mechanism which includes Hap1, Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 and a fourth unidentified factor. Induction levels for Mot3 and Rox1 appear to be calibrated to establish a range of responses to oxygen levels for each target gene, as determined by the number of operator sites in each promoter.</p><p>The requirement for both Mot3 and Rox1 for inhibition of aerobic expression might suggest each is a necessary component of a single complex. Arguing against this, we show that either repressor can almost fully compensate for the lack of the other when artificially expressed at high levels. However, at the low levels present in aerobic cells, Mot3 and Rox1 act synergistically to achieve stringent repression. Though functioning in concert, the two mechanisms are distinct, as shown by the observation that Rox1, but not Mot3, requires the Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 co-repressor for its function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Strains used were FY23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c19">19</xref>) and RZ53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c3">3</xref>).

YCp<italic>GAL1&#x0002f;MOT3</italic> was constructed in two steps: first a plasmid containing the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter region (&#x02013;820 to &#x02013;9) was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment amplified from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter with primers homologous at those sites (5&#x02032;: gagaggtacc<underline>gaattc</underline>gacaggttatcagcaac; 3&#x02032;: gaga<underline>ggatcc</underline>ttctccttgacgttaaagtatagagg); the fragment was digested at EcoRI and BamHI sites in the primer segments and inserted into YCpLac33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c20">20</xref>) at the same sites, generating YCpp<italic>GAL1</italic>.

Complementing plasmids carried the YMR070W open-reading frame, previously identified as <italic>MOT3</italic>, encoding a zinc finger protein that regulates expression of a number of different genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c15">15</xref>), but which had not been associated with oxygen regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Synergistic aerobic repression of <italic>ANB1</italic> and <italic>DAN1</italic> by Mot3 and Rox1</title><p>As expected from the constitutive phenotype of the <italic>rox7</italic> alleles, disruption of <italic>MOT3</italic> caused partial loss of repression of <italic>ANB1</italic> and <italic>DAN1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref>), indicating that Mot3 functions along with Rox1 as an aerobic repressor of both genes. We focused on the roles of the two repressors on <italic>ANB1</italic> expression, since the regulation of <italic>DAN1</italic> is complicated by the contributions of two other oxygen-sensitive factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c9">9</xref>) and shows a lesser dependence on Rox1 and Mot3. Disruption of <italic>ROX1</italic> caused an apparent full loss of repression of the <italic>ANB1</italic> gene: expression in the <italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; strain was equal under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref>); moreover, expression in aerobic <italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; cells was equal to that in anaerobic <italic>mot3</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref>B), representing the fully de-repressed output of the promoter. Hence, Mot3 has no repression function on its own under these conditions, and even though Rox1 represses weakly by itself, the efficient repression observed in normal aerobic cells occurs only when the two proteins function in concert, i.e. &#x02018;synergistically&#x02019;. Negative synergy is a less well defined concept than positive, but a reasonable index for synergisic inhibition is a comparison of the residual activities when one or both repressors are present. These were determined to be 100 or 20&#x02013;40&#x00025;, respectively, with Mot3 or Rox1 alone, versus &#x0003c;1&#x00025; when both are functioning. Hence, the residual expression with both repressors present is much less than that with either one alone, i.e. the combined inhibitory effects are clearly more than multiplicative (see Discussion).</p><p>Differences in the expression of <italic>DAN1</italic> and <italic>ANB1</italic> in these mutants reveals a variable degree of participation in repression by the two factors at different promoters. The full loss of repression of <italic>ANB1</italic> in the <italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; strain compared with partial loss in the <italic>mot3</italic>&#x00394; strain implies that Rox1 plays a more important role than Mot3 at this promoter, presumably reflecting the preponderance of Rox1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c1">1</xref>). In contrast, aerobic repression of <italic>DAN1</italic> was more affected by loss of Mot3 than of Rox1, also consistent with the relative numbers of Mot3 and Rox1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c7">7</xref>). The greater overall sensitivity of <italic>ANB1</italic> to both <italic>rox1</italic> and <italic>mot3</italic> mutations compared with <italic>DAN1</italic> may reflect the fact that <italic>DAN1</italic> is also repressed by at least two other oxygen-sensitive mechanisms in aerobic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c9">9</xref>). The results show constitutive expression of both genes in the absence of the Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 complex. The fact that expression in anaerobic <italic>tup1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssn6</italic>&#x00394; cells is lower than in wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref>A) may result from de-repression of <italic>ROX1</italic>or <italic>MOT3</italic>, which are both regulated by the heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c6">6</xref>, and see below); the same could hold for the relatively lower expression in aerobic <italic>tup1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssn6</italic>&#x00394;cells compared with <italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; cells (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Mot3 function is independent of oxygen</title><p>The role of Mot3 in aerobic repression suggested that it might be converted to a repressing form in the presence of oxygen (or heme).

Both genes were repressed in cells expressing high levels of Mot3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f2">2</xref>), implying that inhibition of transcription by the repressor is concentration dependent and not the result of a conformational change occurring as a result of the presence of oxygen and&#x0002f;or heme.

Neither Hap1 nor Hap2 were required for expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f4">4</xref>A). However, rather than activating aerobic <italic>MOT3</italic> expression, Hap1 functions by repressing in the absence of heme, as indicated by higher levels of <italic>MOT3</italic> mRNA in <italic>hap1</italic>&#x00394; cells during anaerobic growth. Heme regulation of <italic>MOT3</italic> is not attributable solely to Hap1, since <italic>MOT3</italic> mRNA levels in the <italic>hap1</italic>&#x00394; strain were still higher in the presence of oxygen. This implicates another unknown oxygen-sensitive factor in the regulatory pathway. Anaerobic repression of <italic>MOT3</italic> also depends on Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 more than on Hap1, as indicated by the presence of de-repressed levels of mRNA in anaerobic <italic>tup1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssn6</italic>&#x00394; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f4">4</xref>B). Whether the co-repressor complex is recruited by Hap1 and&#x0002f;or another repressor is not clear. Thus, <italic>MOT3</italic> and <italic>ROX1</italic> expression are co-regulated in four respects: heme induction, repression of basal expression by Hap1, regulation by a second heme-responsive system, and repression by Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6.</p><p>We tested for auto-repression of <italic>MOT3</italic> analogous to that observed for <italic>ROX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c6">6</xref>), but saw no increase in expression of the <italic>MOT3-lacZ</italic> reporter in the <italic>mot3</italic>&#x00394; strain (data not shown). We also observed that neither factor regulates expression of the other (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f4">4</xref>A and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Rox1 requires Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6, but Mot3 functions through another mechanism</title><p>Tup1 and Ssn6 are co-repressors of the hypoxic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c25">25</xref>) and of the <italic>DAN</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>TIR</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ERG</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c9">9</xref>) (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref>). It has been assumed that the heterodimer is recruited by Rox1, as with other repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c27">27</xref>). If Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 is required for Rox1 function, loss of either the repressor or the co-repressor would be expected to cause similar levels of constitutive expression. However, it has been repeatedly observed that constitutive expression of <italic>ANB1</italic> in aerobic <italic>tup1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssn6</italic> cells is significantly lower than in <italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref>). This difference doesn&#x02019;t mean that Rox1 and Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 don&#x02019;t interact, since Rox1 might be able to repress inefficiently by itself. Another explanation might be that the weaker Mot3 repressor, rather than Rox1, recruits the heterodimer. To test for these interactions, we made use of the observation that Gal4-driven expression of either factor causes efficient repression of <italic>ANB1</italic> and <italic>DAN1</italic> in wild-type anaerobic cells. In a <italic>tup1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssn6</italic> strain, Gal4-induced expression of <italic>MOT3</italic> still caused efficient repression of <italic>ANB1</italic>, but expression of <italic>ROX1</italic> did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f5">5</xref>). Hence, Rox1 requires the Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 co-repressor in this context, while Mot3 evidently functions through a different mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Mot3 and Rox1 are independent synergizing repressors</title><p>The failure of Rox1 and Mot3 to repress by themselves is in striking contrast to the highly stringent repression observed when both factors are present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref>). The mutual dependence of Mot3 and Rox1 could arise either because both are essential parts of a single mechanism (e.g. Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6) or because they act independently in a synergistic fashion. We tested whether either factor is sufficient when over-expressed, starting from the observation that Gal4-driven expression of either <italic>MOT3</italic> or <italic>ROX1</italic> in anaerobic cells resulted in efficient repression of both <italic>DAN1</italic> and <italic>ANB1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f2">2</xref>). This observation had implied that each factor is mechanistically sufficient for repression, since under these conditions high levels of Mot3 were paired with very low (uninduced) levels of Rox1, or vice versa. To rule out the possibility that low levels of the non-induced factor assisted the over-expressed one, we repeated the experiment in <italic>mot3</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. In both cases, expression of <italic>ANB1</italic> was still almost fully inhibited, in both aerobic and anaerobic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f6">6</xref>), each repressor compensating for the absence of the other. Thus, either one of the two independent repression mechanisms is effective at high operator occupancy. It was clear, however, that repression is significantly more efficient in aerobic wild-type cells with both factors present (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f6">6</xref>B), even at their relatively low endogenous levels. Hence, even though both Mot3 and Rox1 can repress independently at artificially high levels, stringent regulation in aerobic cells depends on a synergistic interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified Mot3 as a repressor that functions synergistically with Rox1 to suppress aerobic expression of genes in two different anaerobic regulons. Mot3 and Rox1 are part of a complex regulatory network which mediates heme regulation through several different pathways (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f7">7</xref>). Remarkably, heme regulation of the <italic>DAN</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>TIR</italic> genes, exemplified by <italic>DAN1</italic>, depends on four independent mechanisms, functioning at four different promoter sites: the Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6-dependent Rox1 mechanism; the Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6-independent Mot3 mechanism; an inhibitory mechanism which operates at the &#x02018;AR1&#x02019; site through a regulatory domain in the oxygen-regulated Mox4&#x0002f;Upc2 activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c9">9</xref>); and a fourth anaerobic induction mechanism involving an unidentified activator operating at a second anaerobic response element (AR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c7">7</xref>). Regulation through the AR1 and AR2 sites by heme is not highly stringent, and the combined action of Mot3 and Rox1 bound to their respective operators serves to enhance aerobic repression, reducing basal expression to undetectable levels. In the simpler <italic>ANB1</italic> promoter, Mot3 and Rox1 appear to be solely responsible for heme regulation, providing a useful model for their possible interaction.</p><p>The mutual dependence of Mot3 and Rox1 was originally inferred from the strongly constitutive expression of <italic>ANB1</italic> in <italic>rox1</italic> and <italic>mot3</italic> mutants, which implies that neither factor can repress on its own at endogenous levels. We have demonstrated that the highly stringent repression of the <italic>ANB1</italic> gene results from true synergy between the two repressors, i.e. through concerted action by independent mechanisms, rather than through obligatory co-participation in a single mechanism. The independent function of Mot3 and Rox1 was shown by the fact that over-expression of either can compensate for lack of the other. Strikingly, however, even when titrated by high levels of either Mot3 or Rox1, single-factor repression is still less stringent than in cells containing low levels of both repressors. One possible explanation for synergistic co-dependence might be cooperative binding, though <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have indicated that this does not occur on naked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c17">17</xref>). Perhaps more likely is the possibility that the two factors act through different targets in the PolII initiation complex, to produce concerted inhibition analogous to numerous examples of synergistic activation. A two-target model is strengthened by the indication that Mot3 and Rox1 utilize different mechanisms, with only the latter requiring Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 for its function.</p><p>This regulatory system has solved the problem of allowing some anaerobic genes to be expressed at low or moderate levels in aerobic cells while others are stringently repressed. Apparently, during evolution of the regulatory pathway, the levels of Mot3 and Rox1 have been calibrated in such a way that on some promoters they are able to fully repress, and at others, less so, depending on the number and quality of operator sites &#x0005b;which vary considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c1">1</xref>)&#x0005d;, and possibly on the type and strength of activation mechanism driving expression of each gene.</p><p>The response to oxygen depends on the fact, established here for <italic>MOT3</italic> and earlier for <italic>ROX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c6">6</xref>), that expression of the repressors is de-repressed from an inhibited state by heme. This occurs, at least in part, through a regulatory system which controls both genes, with repression in anaerobic cells being fully dependent on Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6, and partly dependent on the heme-unbound form of Hap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c6">6</xref>). A second factor which appears to play a role in repression of <italic>ROX1</italic> and <italic>MOT3</italic> has not been identified, nor have factors responsible for activation under aerobic conditions.</p><p>We have concluded that the Rox1 repression mechanism requires the participation of the Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 co-repression complex as originally suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c23">23</xref>), and that Mot3 functions in a different way. This is based on the observation that repression of <italic>ANB1</italic> caused by over-expression of <italic>ROX1</italic> in anaerobic cells is lost in a <italic>tup1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssn6</italic>&#x00394; strain, whereas repression resulting from over-expression of <italic>MOT3</italic> is still in effect. However, the role of Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 is not clear. For example, though expression of <italic>ANB1</italic> under anaerobic and aerobic conditions is equal in the absence of the heterodimer (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f1">1</xref>A), the mRNA level is consistently lower than in anaerobic wild-type cells or in aerobic <italic>rox1</italic>&#x00394; cells. The de-repression of <italic>ROX1</italic> in <italic>tup1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssn6</italic>&#x00394; cells may cause reduced expression of <italic>ANB1</italic>, though this seems unlikely in view of the dependence of Rox1 on Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f5">5</xref>). More likely, reduced expression of <italic>ANB1</italic> results from de-repressed expression of Mot3 (in glucose cultures) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg792f4">4</xref>). In addition, the absence of Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 may lead to reduced expression through some other perturbation of the regulatory circuits in this system. The genetic interaction of Rox1 and Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 suggests that Rox1 recruits Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 to the promoter during aerobic growth. However, recent evidence of constitutive binding of Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 to the <italic>ANB1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg792c28">28</xref>) suggests that the functional relationship between Rox1 and Tup1&#x02013;Ssn6 may not be one of recruitment.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg792f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Effect of regulatory mutations on expression of anaerobic genes.
