A naturally occurring variation of the terminal carbohydrates on the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) molecule correlates with altered disease states. Here, we investigated the interaction of different stable gonoccocal LOS phenotypes with human dendritic cells and demonstrate that each variant targets a different set of receptors on the dendritic cell, including the C-type lectins MGL and DC-SIGN. <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> LOS phenotype C constitutes the first bacterial ligand to be described for the human C-type lectin receptor MGL. Both MGL and DC-SIGN are locally expressed at the male and female genital area, the primary site of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> infection. We show that targeting of different C-type lectins with the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> LOS variants results in alterations in dendritic cell cytokine secretion profiles and the induction of distinct adaptive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T helper responses. Whereas <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> variant A with a terminal <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine on its LOS was recognized by DC-SIGN and induced significantly more IL-10 production, phenotype C, carrying a terminal <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine, primarily interacted with MGL and skewed immunity towards the T helper 2 lineage. Together, our results indicate that <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> LOS variation allows for selective manipulation of dendritic cell function, thereby shifting subsequent immune responses in favor of bacterial survival.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> is a species of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea. Although effective antibiotic treatments are available, little is known about the host immune response to this pathogen. Here, we analyzed three well-characterized gonococcal variants that only differ in the outer sugar present on the lipooligosaccharide of the bacteria. We found that human dendritic cells use different receptors, including the C-type lectins MGL and DC-SIGN, to detect the three <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> phenotypes. Dendritic cells carrying the MGL and DC-SIGN receptor were present in the human genital tissues, the site of gonoccocal invasion. DC activation with the gonococcal variants resulted in different cytokine secretion profiles and alterations in the subsequent adaptive T cell response. In particular, LOS containing a terminal <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine induced more T helper 2-type responses, which are unfavorable for clearing the bacteria.

Although gonorrhea can remain asymptomatic, complications of the disease include pelvic inflammatory disease with a subsequent risk of infertility, and invasive and potentially life-threatening disseminated gonoccocal infection.

The interaction between GC and the epithelial layer has been well characterized and involves the interaction of several GC virulence factors, including pili, porin and Opa proteins, to their respective receptors. Whereas GC pili may adhere to CD46 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Kallstrom1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, the PorB porin attaches to heat shock protein Gp96 and the scavenger receptor SREC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Rechner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The opacity (Opa) proteins are divided into two major classes which adhere to either syndecans or CD66 family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Hauck1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>After traversion of the epithelial cell barrier GC enter the submucosa, where they first encounter cells of the immune system, such as dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are the most potent antigen presenting cells of the immune system, capable of linking innate and adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Steinman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Villadangos1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Immature DCs reside in all peripheral tissues where they act as sentinels to screen their surroundings for incoming pathogens. Upon microbial encounter immature DCs undergo a transitional process termed maturation, which involves migration to draining lymph nodes, upregulation of costimulatory molecules and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the lymph node mature DCs activate na&#x000ef;ve T cells, thereby inducing adaptive immunity. In contrast to GC-epithelial interaction, little is known about the recognition of GC by DCs.</p><p>To detect pathogens DCs are equipped with a vast array of pattern recognition receptors (PPRs), including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the C-type lectin receptors (C-type lectins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Figdor1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-West1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from enteric bacteria, GC express lipooligosaccharide (LOS), lacking the O-antigen. LOS can act as a GC virulence factor through recognition of its lipid A part by TLR-4/MD2 complex. The carbohydrate moiety of GC LOS is subject to phase variation, creating a GC population with different terminal carbohydrate residues on their LOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Danaher1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Apicella1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These carbohydrate moieties may serve as ligands for sugar-dependent receptors, such as the C-type lectin DC-SIGN. Increasing evidence indicates that TLR and C-type lectin signaling cooperate and influence each other, thereby ensuing and controlling immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Gantner1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Gringhuis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, variation of the terminal sugar of GC LOS could have a major impact on how GC modulates DC function.</p><p>We investigated three well-defined GC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000625-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which only differ in their terminal LOS glycosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Gotschlich1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, on DC recognition and their immunomodulatory properties.

After inactivation of the glycosyltransferases genes <italic>lgtD</italic> and <italic>lgtB</italic> stable LOS variants were obtained that exhibit a terminal galactose and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), respectively. <italic>In vivo</italic> this variation occurs via slipped-stand mispairing of polynucleotide tracts within the <italic>lgtD</italic> gene, leading to exposure of a terminal GalNAc when the <italic>lgtD</italic> gene is functionally present and a terminal galactose residue when the gene is switched off <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000625-Shafer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Their results indicate that GC LOS variants containing a terminal GalNAc residue have a selective advantage compared to variants ending in a terminal galactose.

Different terminal glycans can target different C-type lectin receptors on human DCs thereby modifying DC function and possibly also host immune responses. LOS of variant A induces high IL-10 secretion by the DC, which might aid the outgrowth of regulatory T cells. Our data indicates that the terminal GalNAc residue, as found on LOS of GC phenotype C, skews T helper differentiation towards unfavorable Th2-type responses.
