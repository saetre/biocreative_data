The signaling dynamics of endogenous NF-&#x003ba;B in single cells remain poorly understood. To examine real time dynamics in living cells, we monitored NF-&#x003ba;B activities at multiple timescales using GFP-p65 knock-in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Oscillations in NF-&#x003ba;B were sustained in most cells, with several cycles of transient nuclear translocation after TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation. Mathematical modeling suggests that NF-&#x003ba;B oscillations are selected over other non-oscillatory dynamics by fine-tuning the relative strengths of feedback loops like I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. The ability of NF-&#x003ba;B to scan and interact with the genome in vivo remained remarkably constant from early to late cycles, as observed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Perturbation of long-term NF-&#x003ba;B oscillations interfered with its short-term interaction with chromatin and balanced transcriptional output, as predicted by the mathematical model. We propose that negative feedback loops do not simply terminate signaling, but rather promote oscillations of NF-&#x003ba;B in the nucleus, and these oscillations are functionally advantageous.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammalian cells, various signals such as hormones, cytokines, and cell-cell interfaces elicit changes in gene expression mediated by inducible transcription factors. Many latent transcription factors also induce expression of genes that provide feedback loops upon their signaling pathways. The negative feedback genes are generally thought to functionally terminate the signaling action of the transcription factor. These feedback loops also create the potential for the transcription factor activity to oscillate between active and inactive states over hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-GevaZatorsky1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-Nelson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the significance of such oscillations is unclear. Are periodic cycles a mere side effect of the pathway settling back to the basal state, or do they have a functional role in signaling?</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is a classical example of a transcription factor subject to negative feedback loops. NF-&#x003ba;B regulates numerous cell signaling processes and its activity is controlled in part by the level of nuclear translocation. In resting cells, the predominant dimer p65&#x02236;p50 exists mostly as a cytoplasmic complex bound to its inhibitor I&#x003ba;B proteins. Numerous upstream signals induce degradation of the I&#x003ba;B proteins following phosphorylation by the I&#x003ba;B kinase complex (IKK). This release from latency in the cytoplasm allows active NF-&#x003ba;B to translocate into the nucleus and activate expression of target genes, including several feedback genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-Hayden1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. One such target is the <italic>Nfkbia</italic> gene which codes for I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. The re-synthesis of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; acts as strong negative feedback, causing the inactivation of NF-&#x003ba;B and its re-localization to the cytoplasm. However, previous biochemical and genetic investigations have indicated that the propensity to oscillate, driven by induction of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, is counteracted by mechanisms that modulate and dampen the oscillation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-Hayden1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-Cheong1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-Kearns1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-Werner1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Observations at least from cell populations show rapid down-regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B after activation. This has led to the view that NF-&#x003ba;B signaling is biphasic, i.e. its activity rises rapidly and is strongly attenuated by feedback inactivation, and an oscillatory behavior after the first cycle of NF-&#x003ba;B activity might be insignificant or even deleterious for cellular function.

The long-term dynamics of p65 in individual single cells ranged from 1&#x0223c;2 cycles to dramatic oscillations with 6&#x0223c;7 cycles. A minority of cells had a single cycle with subsequent minor and irregular fluctuations (8 oscillating cells and 2 non-oscillators are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Most cells showed multiple striking peaks; later peaks had gradually decreasing amplitudes but were clearly discernible. Often the p65 flux out of the nucleus between the periodic cycles was so efficient as to reduce the nuclear level to a basal state. We subjected the time course data from 95 cells to Fourier analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) and found that the majority of the cells (79&#x00025;) oscillated with a somewhat variable period with a median value of 2.2 hours (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;75, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

Distinct patterns were readily identifiable when the K-means clustering algorithm was applied to group similar time courses. Numerous optimizations of K-means with different numbers of clusters indicated that these eight clusters were reproducible and representative. The patterns that closely represent the experimentally observed oscillatory profiles (clusters 5, 7, and 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, left 8 plots) were from parameter values that occupy a significantly broad region in the 18-dimensional parameter space. This implies that oscillation is a robust feature of this network.</p><p>Our multi-parameter variation analysis also shows a pattern with non-oscillating, one-peak responses (cluster 2), which is similar to the experimentally observed profile of non-oscillating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, right 2 plots). This pattern resulted from parameter values for hyperactive I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; induction and/or fast IKK inactivation. Thus, with an appropriate choice of feedback parameter values, the NF-&#x003ba;B system could operate in a non-oscillating mode, which may be embodied by the non-oscillating cells. The absence of some computationally predicted scenarios (clusters 1, 3, 4, and 6) from the experimentally observed time course profiles could be partly due to some unrealistic combinations of parameter values in our variation analysis. Alternatively, it might reflect a preference of the NF-&#x003ba;B regulatory network for oscillations, suggestive of functional advantage.</p><p>Next we extensively examined the correlation of these distinct responses with the underlying parameter values, and found that 16 out of 18 parameters had no clear influence on system dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007163.s002">Fig. S2E</xref>), while inducible synthesis of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and post-stimulus IKK inactivation are the major processes that determine the kinetic behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Notably, these are precisely the mechanisms that represent the two classes of negative feedback loops in the regulatory network. For example, low I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; synthesis rate and/or persistent IKK activity explain the aberrant response pattern with no post-stimulus attenuation (cluster 3).</p><p>Taken together, observed dynamic patterns and modeling indicate that diverse behaviors, including non-oscillatory responses, are possible from the NF-&#x003ba;B network, and indeed a small fraction of cells do not oscillate. The above multi-parameter variations suggest that the relative strengths of the two classes of negative feedback is a strong determinant of NF-&#x003ba;B dynamics and that the oscillatory behavior represents a robust but selective pattern of the network dynamics. The prevalence of the oscillatory pattern, over other possible behaviors, suggests that it might be chosen for specific function and adaptive value, rather than imposed by the system design and thus inevitable.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>LMB or CHX co-treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; produces one cycle of nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B localization</title><p>Next we wished to investigate the functional role of NF-&#x003ba;B dynamics by altering the natural oscillations. Some commonly used perturbation methods, however, presented serious problems for our systems approach. For example, siRNA, widely used for specific down-regulation of genes, would be impossible to model at the single cell level because silencing action takes effect over a long time (&#x0223c;hours) with its own kinetics, and cell-to-cell heterogeneity is invariably significant. Similarly, genetically disrupted cells settle into altered steady states long before the experiments by compensatory mechanisms, complicating model-based comparison of mutant behavior to that of wild-type. Thus, we chose to use nearly instantaneous inhibitors that interfere with key steps in the NF-&#x003ba;B network, using Leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of nuclear protein export, and Cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis.</p><p>LMB blocks nuclear export of p65 into the cytoplasm, an enabling mechanism behind NF-&#x003ba;B oscillation. When cells are simultaneously treated with TNF-&#x003b1; and LMB, a single pulse of free nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B is expected to be followed by the formation of the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02236;I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; complex in the nucleus. This is also predicted by model simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, upper panel; Parameter values were from cluster 5, 7, 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, and all export rates were reduced by 10<sup>5</sup>-fold at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0; An example decomposition plot for TNF-&#x003b1; alone is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007163.s002">Fig. S2C</xref> for comparison).

Live imaging showed that CHX constrains p65 in the nucleus for hours, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lower panel). Nuclear p65 is predicted to be active (free of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;) under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, bottom panel; Parameter values were from cluster 5, 7, 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, and s was reduced by 100-fold at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The two contrasting perturbations of NF-&#x003ba;B oscillations reveal reverse nucleus-to-cytoplasm flux</title><p>We noticed an unexpected difference between the time lapse imaging data from TNF-&#x003b1; only, TNF-&#x003b1;/LMB co-treated, and TNF-&#x003b1;/CHX co-treated cells: The temporal profiles of nuclear GFP-p65 in cells treated with TNF-&#x003b1; and LMB showed significantly higher peak translocation, in comparison to cells treated with TNF-&#x003b1; alone or with CHX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007163.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). This suggests the existence of the reverse-translocating (nucleus-to-cytoplasm) p65 molecules even during the early activation phase of NF-&#x003ba;B after TNF-&#x003b1; treatment, which had not been appreciated previously. It also implies that the nuclear p65 level at a given moment is simply the net result of the constituent fluxes.</p><p>We therefore asked whether p65 molecules may be exported from the nucleus independently of I&#x003ba;B. First, we ran model simulations with the I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; synthesis rate set to zero (at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0), and also all nuclear import rates were reduced to zero when nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B level is maximal (at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;90 min). If there was no export, blockade of nuclear import at this time would not have any effect on the nuclear p65 level. The simulation results showed gradual efflux of p65 into the cytoplasm that is appreciable within minutes for a wide range of parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This was due to the slow export of free NF-&#x003ba;B that was allowed in the mathematical model, which was masked by the dominant I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-mediated export during the normal TNF-&#x003b1; induced dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007163.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>We then experimentally validated this somewhat neglected possibility by fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). When cells are treated with TNF-&#x003b1; and CHX together, no I&#x003ba;B molecules are present because their re-synthesis is blocked after their TNF-&#x003b1;-dependent degradation. When p65 nuclear translocation was apparently complete (30 to 60 minutes after co-treatment), a cytoplasmic spot was bleached repeatedly. This caused a decrease in nuclear GFP-p65 signal, indicating the presence of p65 export into the cytoplasm. The observed time course is in agreement with the predicted loss of nuclear p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), implying that NF-&#x003ba;B continuously exports out to the cytoplasm in an I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-independent manner. The retrograde flux of p65 was detectable only when the nuclear p65 level was maximal. When p65 was still accumulating in the nucleus 10 to 25 minutes after TNF-&#x003b1; and CHX, the same FLIP protocol did not produce a reduction in nuclear GFP-p65 level, most likely due to the import flux canceling out the loss by the export flux (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007163.s004">Fig. S4</xref>).

As a negative control, FLIP was applied to cells co-treated with TNF-&#x003b1; and LMB, which resulted in little or no reduction in nuclear GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). These data indicate an inherent tendency of NF-&#x003ba;B to shuttle out to the cytoplasm independently of I&#x003ba;B. We also confirmed that I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; increases p65 export efficiency upon TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation.</p><p>Taken together these results demonstrate that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NF-&#x003ba;B is bi-directional and does not require oscillations or I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. This implies that NF-&#x003ba;B shuttles continuously, sampling the full intracellular environment, with or without concurrent oscillations in the level of nuclear p65.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The characteristic genome-scanning activity of NF-&#x003ba;B is maintained through sustained oscillation</title><p>We predicted that the functional consequences of CHX and LMB perturbations would be extremely different on p65 activity, despite the similar effect on its nuclear localization.

To address this experimentally and compare perturbed conditions with the unperturbed behavior, we first evaluated features of the distinct p65 cycles in the nucleus using an assay with the temporal precision to resolve the asynchronous cycles in single cells.

A small fraction of cells that respond to TNF-&#x003b1; with a single cycle in our live imaging further support the idea that the system can avoid oscillation.

The late cycles, absent in LMB co-treatment, contribute significantly to late gene expression, while continuous presence of active NF-&#x003ba;B in the nucleus in CHX co-treatment produces exaggerated transcriptional responses. These results suggest that the oscillatory mode of NF-&#x003ba;B action may be a cellular trade-off between efficient pulse expression of immediate early genes and the need for NF-&#x003ba;B to monitor the signaling status for several hours before acting on the modified chromatin landscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-Dundr1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007163-RamirezCarrozzi1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).

The time delay parameter for I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; synthesis was constrained to vary between 30 and 55 minutes to avoid an unrealistic range. 1000 samples of parameter combinations were generated and used for DDE simulations.

(A) The 9-variable, 18-parameter delay differential equations model was adapted from &#x0005b;Sung et al. 2004 Mol. Pharm.&#x0005d; with the addition of a term that represents the post-stimulus attenuation of IKK activity (&#x02018;neg IKK&#x02019; for the equation for IKK). For simulating TNF-&#x003b1; treatment, we used stimulus input k(t) which was fixed for our parameter variations to produce a step-like activation of IKK at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0. We note here some simplifications implemented in the model. We combined certain multiple biochemical reactions into single terms. The parameter neg represents the rate of inactivation of IKK by multiple mechanisms. The model also simplifies the induced synthesis of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; which in fact comprises of transcription, RNA processing and transport, translation and protein folding. All of these are lumped into a single synthesis term with a delay. Similarly, the catalyzed degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; initiated by IKK (rate r1) represents a complex series of reactions including phosphorylation at two serines, ubiquitination, and degradation. Such signal induced degradation is distinguished from the basal degradation of free or NF-&#x003ba;B bound I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; that occur with rate dg1 or dg2. Notation for the molecule concentrations as model variables: NF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;NF-&#x003ba;B I&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; IKK&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;the active IKK complex A colon between two variables indicates a complex of the corresponding proteins, and variables with subscript &#x02018;n&#x02019; denote nuclear species. (B) The table describes all the molecular processes that are represented in the model and the reference values for the corresponding parameters. All values are from &#x0005b;Hoffmann et al 2002 Science&#x0005d; except for the following: tau, neg, and s are parameters for simplifying terms that represent multiple biochemical processes. Therefore, their values were estimated arbitrarily so that the TNF-&#x003b1; response profile from these reference parameter values is qualitatively similar to that in &#x0005b;Hoffmann et al 2002 Science&#x0005d;. In fact, we did not assume that any of the parameter values were appropriate for our cells, and instead relied on extensive parameter variations to look for all possible behaviors of the dynamical system from different parameter values. (C) The example below illustrates typical plots from model simulations for TNF-&#x003b1; induced p65 oscillations. The graphs show the time courses of free, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-complexed, and total p65 in the nucleus, as predicted by the model. The red curves indicate the three p65 species in the nucleus from a single run of simulation. (D) The time courses of free active IKK for the eight clusters are shown below. Clusters 1 through 8 correspond to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g003">Figure 3C</xref>. (E) The parameters other than s and neg do not correlate with the distinct patterns of p65 dynamics. The plots below show the parameters d1 (NF-&#x003ba;B:I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; complex dissociation rate) and r1 (IKK phospho-ubiquitin-degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;), for the eight clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g003">Figure 3C</xref>.

A circular spot in the cytoplasm was repeatedly bleached while the nuclear mean intensity was monitored. The plot in A shows the same data as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007163-g004">Figure 4D</xref> for comparison, FLIP time courses acquired 25 minutes after treatments, when p65 translocation is almost complete. Fluorescence profiles are the average of at least 4 cells from three independent experiments acquired at 25 min, 40 min and 55 min after treatment. In TNF-&#x003b1; &#x0002b; CHX there is a decrease in nuclear GFP-p65 signal, indicating the presence of p65 export into the cytoplasm. When cells are treated with TNF only, the rate of p65 export to the cytoplasm is slightly faster, possibly indicating a role of IkB&#x003b1; in removing p65 from the nucleus. In TNF &#x0002b; LMB treated cells, the retrograde flux is almost undetectable, as expected. The plot in B shows the FLIP time course during (not after) the massive nuclear translocation of p65 within 25 minutes after TNF-&#x003b1; or TNF-&#x003b1; &#x0002b; CHX co-treatment. Fluorescence profiles are the averages of at least 10 cells from five independent experiments acquired at 10 min after treatment. In TNF-&#x003b1; &#x0002b; CHX treated cells, there is a slight gain of nuclear p65, instead of a loss, due to a greater nuclear influx of p65 molecules from the unbleached cytoplasmic region in comparison to p65 influx from the bleached area. In TNF-&#x003b1; treated cells, there is a net nuclear loss indicating that p65 export is faster than its import.

We tested an analysis method that is widely used in audio signal processing, against various oscillatory profiles of GFP-p65 time courses in response to TNF-&#x003b1;. First, each time course data y (t) (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;nuclear:total ratio of GFP-p65) was adjusted by baseline subtraction and normalization: y_signal (t)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(y(t) - min y(t))/(max y(t) - min y(t)). Zeros were padded to extend toward negative t values. The y_signal (t) was further processed by Hanning window to produce y_hanning (t). Fast Fourier Transform was then applied to y_hanning and its Bode plot in log scales was generated. The plots in the left column show y_signal (t) as solid curves and y_hanning (t) as dashed. The corresponding Bode plots are shown in the right column. Although this analysis may show fine spectral features of the temporal profiles, it seems less obvious how to classify patterns from Bode plots.
