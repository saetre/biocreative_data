The possibility of using inhibitors on the BRAF pathway as became an interesting therapeutic approach. In thyroid cancer cells the target molecules, implicated on the cellular effects, mediated by inhibition of BRAF are not well established. In order to fill this lack of knowledge we studied the proliferation and survival pathways and associated molecules induced by BRAF inhibition in thyroid carcinoma cell lines harbouring distinct genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Suppression of BRAF pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines (8505C, TPC1 and C643) was achieved using RNA interference (RNAi) for BRAF and the kinase inhibitor, sorafenib. Proliferation analysis was performed by BrdU incorporation and apoptosis was accessed by TUNEL assay. Levels of protein expression were analysed by western-blot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both BRAF RNAi and sorafenib inhibited proliferation in all the cell lines independently of the genetic background, mostly in cells with BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>mutation. In BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>mutated cells inhibition of BRAF pathway lead to a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 levels and an increase in p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. Specific inhibition of BRAF by RNAi in cells with BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>mutation had no effect on apoptosis. In the case of sorafenib treatment, cells harbouring BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>mutation showed increase levels of apoptosis due to a balance of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results in thyroid cancer cells, namely those harbouring BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>mutation showed that BRAF signalling pathway provides important proliferation signals. We have shown that in thyroid cancer cells sorafenib induces apoptosis by affecting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>mutated cells which was independent of BRAF. These results suggest that sorafenib may prove useful in the treatment of thyroid carcinomas, particularly those refractory to conventional treatment and harbouring BRAF mutations.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A major event in the neoplastic transformation of thyroid follicular cells is the constitutive activation of a single signalling pathway, the RET/PTC - RAS - BRAF - MEK - ERK pathway. We, and others, have reported a high prevalence of BRAF point mutations (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>) in papillary thyroid carcinomas (30% to 69%) and in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (10% to 35%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

Although a significant increase in the level of apoptosis was seen in TPC1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), none of the studied apoptotis related proteins showed alterations. Interestingly, the different cell lines treated with sorafenib showed different levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 (two anti-apoptotic proteins). In 8505C cells, the decrease in Mcl-1 levels was transient, increasing after 48 h of treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). In C643 cells, we observed a decrease in Mcl-1 levels after 12 h and 24 h and an increase after 1 h and 48 h of treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). The decrease was more pronounced in the cell line with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. We also analyzed the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and observed that there was a pronounced decreased of Bcl-2 levels in 8505C cells after sorafenib treatment. In the remaining cell lines there was either no change, or only slight variations in the levels of Bcl-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). The balance in the levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 overtime might be, in part, responsible for the different effects of sorafenib on apoptosis in 8505C cells, in contrast to TPC1 and C643 cells. The results obtained on Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 levels roughly parallel those obtained in the study of the levels of apoptosis in the same cell lines (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The cell line that show a higher induction of apoptosis (8505C) by sorafenib is the one in which the decrease in the levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 after treatment were more pronounced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

In thyroid carcinomas the molecules and pathways associated to the effect of BRAF inhibition in cellular proliferation and survival are not fully understood. We aimed to characterize in thyroid cancer cell lines with different genetic background those molecules implicated in proliferation/survival using RNAi targeting BRAF and the kinase inhibitor sorafenib.</p><p>Our results show that both approaches induce inhibition of proliferation in all the cell lines, regardless of the genetic background, although RNAi leads to a more pronounced effect in proliferation in BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>mutated cell line. Our results support the hypothesis that thyroid cancer cells with activated BRAF are more dependent on the BRAF-ERK pathway for proliferation than those with RAS or RET/PTC1 activation.</p><p>BRAF is implicated in proliferation control through MAPK pathway downstream targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. BRAF inhibition by RNAi strongly reduces ERK activation in the cell line harbouring the BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>mutation, is also effective in the cell line with RAS<sup>G13R</sup>, but has no effect in ERK activation in the cell line with RET/PTC rearrangement. The higher levels of ERK inhibition achieved in the BRAF mutated cell line, by RNAi, demonstrates that in these cells BRAF is the main activator of ERKs. Our results in C643 cell line are in accordance with the activation of ERK proteins by activated RAS through BRAF dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The absence of effect in ERK phosphorylation after BRAF inhibition by RNAi in TPC1 cell line suggests that RET/PTC1 activates ERK by a mechanism independent of wild-type BRAF. Our results suggest that RET/PTC1-mediated cell proliferation requires BRAF kinase but not BRAF-MAP kinase pathway. Mitsutake <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] have shown that, in a background of RET/PTC3 activation, BRAF is required for MAPK activation in PCCL3 cells. Our results, in TPC1 cell line, suggest that in a background of RET/PTC1 other molecules may signal to the MAPK pathway. In TPC1 cells we have previously suggested that RAF-1 could be the preponderant RAF isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and this might explain that specific inhibition of BRAF in this cell line does not have an effect on ERK activation at variance with RAS and BRAF mutated cells.</p><p>We showed that sorafenib inhibits efficiently ERK activation in all the cell lines regardless of the underlying oncogenic alteration. However, the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation secondary to the treatment with sorafenib was variable and transient in the different cell lines, as previously demonstrated by Ouyang <italic>et al </italic>using other RAF kinase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This variation between cell lines can be associated to its effect against angiogenesis-related receptor tyrosine kinases such as VEGFR -2 and -3, along with other kinases such as PDGFR-&#x003b2;, Flt-3 and c-Kit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The level of ERK inhibition achieved in TPC1 by sorafenib, and not by BRAF RNAi, indicates that sorafenib targets other molecule(s) besides BRAF, namely RET/PTC oncogenic protein itself, as previously advanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The results we obtained with BRAF siRNA in cells with mutated BRAF (8505C) show that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-ERK signalling is important in the regulation of proliferation. Several proteins have been shown to be targeted by the BRAF/MEK/ERK signalling pathway in distinct tumours models (melanoma, colorectal and thyroid carcinomas); those proteins include cyclin D1 and p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, implicated in cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In normal thyrocytes cyclin D3 is the predominant D-type cyclin, but in papillary carcinoma cells with BRAF mutation cyclin D3-CDK4 activation is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In thyroid cancer cell lines with RET/PTC or BRAF oncogenic mutations cyclinD1-CDK4 complex is more abundant than cyclinD3-CDK4, suggesting the dominant character of cyclin D1 complexes formation in thyroid oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This is in accordance with our results showing that, in thyroid cancer cell lines a decrease in proliferation parallel with a decrease in cyclin D1 levels. Our results showed, furthermore, that in cells with RET/PTC1 rearrangement, inhibition of BRAF by RNAi besides decreasing cyclin D1 levels, increases the levels of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>and leads to the inhibition of proliferation, which was independent of ERK inhibition. In a background of RAS activation (C643 cell line), BRAF inhibition decreases the levels of phosphorylated ERKs and cyclin D1 and has no effect on the levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. This results support that p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>might be regulated directly by activated RAS, as previously advanced by Jones <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The variability observed in the expression levels of cyclin D1 and p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>in all cell lines after treatment with sorafenib, may also result from the ability of sorafenib to functioning as a multikinase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>We have shown that selective downregulation of BRAF does not induce apoptosis in thyroid cells with BRAF mutation at variance with sorafenib that induces marked apoptosis in BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>mutated cells. In melanoma cell lines it was shown that sorafenib treatment can induce cell death, leading to Bad dephosphorylation, decrease in the levels of Bcl-2 and Bax activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, sorafenib has also been shown to downregulate the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 which may be a mechanism through which the compound mediates its pro-apoptotic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our results suggest that in thyroid cells with BRAF<sup>V600E </sup>oncogenic activation the effect of sorafenib in apoptosis depends upon the balance in the levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 and not in the levels of Bad and Bax (data not shown), as previously demonstrated in melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We have also shown that NFk&#x003b2; and XIAP do not seem to be involved in that process. The most striking downregulation of the levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins was observed in the cell line harbouring mutated BRAF (8505C) in which sorafenib induced also the highest levels of apoptosis. These results fit with previous reports in melanoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These effects were not observed after BRAF specific inhibition by RNAi, suggesting a BRAF-independent mechanism for sorafenib in the regulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression and induction of apoptosis, in cells with mutated BRAF. Inhibition of BRAF by siRNA induces apoptosis only in TPC1 cells harbouring RET/PTC1 indicating that wild-type BRAF seems to be important in survival of these cells.</p><p>The mechanism by which sorafenib downregulated the levels of Mcl-1 is likely to depend on enhanced proteosome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This downregulation of Mcl-1 by sorafenib is not cell type dependent or selective for BRAF-mutated cell lines since this effect was observed in all cells lines analysed some of them without BRAF mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The mechanism by which sorafenib downregulates the levels of Bcl-2 is not well understood. This mechanism seems to be cell dependent as it was only observed in melanoma cell lines by Yu C <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and in thyroid carcinoma cells by us in the present study. Bcl-2 downregulation in melanoma cells after sorafenib treatment occurs in cell lines harbouring BRAF mutation but seems to be ERK-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, in our study we observed a more pronounced decreased of Bcl-2 levels in BRAF mutated thyroid cells which was dependent on ERK activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we described for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of both sorafenib and specific siRNA for BRAF in thyroid cancer cells and associated molecules. Our results show that BRAF plays a major role in the proliferation of thyroid carcinoma cells independently of the oncogenic activation, suggesting a role of wild-type BRAF also in RET/PTC and activated RAS signalling pathways. Our results also show that p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>and cyclin D1 proteins are important in the regulation of proliferation <italic>via </italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-ERK signalling and BRAF does not seem to be a major protein for the survival of thyroid cancer cells.</p><p>Treatment of thyroid carcinomas is usually achieved through the use of radioactive iodine (<sup>131</sup>I). Although the majority of thyroid carcinomas respond well to radioiodine therapy, there are thyroid tumours resistant to this therapy, that are inoperable and have lost radioactive avidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Taking into account the high prevalence of BRAF mutations in thyroid tumours it is tempting to consider the use of BRAF inhibitors as a therapeutic approach in these cancers. A recent phase II clinical trial of sorafenib showed a significant anti-tumour activity in advanced thyroid cancer without molecular characterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results indicate that sorafenib might be particularly potent in thyroid tumours harbouring BRAF mutations since, in addition to inhibition of proliferation it is also able of inducing apoptosis in these settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AP conceived the study and its design, performed the analysis and interpretation of data and drafted the manuscript.
