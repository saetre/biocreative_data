The SNARE motif of SNARE proteins on vesicles and on the plasma membrane assemble into a very stable four-helix bundle called the SNARE complex. Although SNARE complex formation is thought to provide the driving force for membrane fusion, accessory proteins influence SNARE assembly and help couple SNARE assembly to fusion and ensure membrane traffic at the correct time and place within a cell.</p><p>The yeast exocytic SNAREs consist of the synaptobrevin homologues Snc1/2p on the secretory vesicle and the syntaxin homologues Sso1/2p and SNAP25 homologue Sec9p on the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Gerst1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Analogous to the neuronal SNARE complex, Snc1/2p and Sso1/2p each contribute one helix to the SNARE complex, while Sec9p contributes two helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Sutton1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>SEC9</italic> is an essential gene originally identified through the isolation of recessive temperature-sensitive alleles, such as <italic>sec9-4</italic>, that cause defects in secretion at the non-permissive temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Novick2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

One such component is the vacuolar H&#x0002b; ATPase (V-ATPase), a multi-subunit complex whose primary function is acidification of intracellular organelles by coupling ATP hydrolysis with translocation of protons across membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Kane1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The V-ATPase is composed of two distinct and separable sectors: the V1 sector is cytosolic and contains the ATPase activity, while the trans-membrane V0 sector forms the proton translocation channel. Three lines of evidence support a role for the V-ATPase in membrane fusion. First, studies of homotypic vacuolar membrane fusion have suggested that the V0 sectors on opposing membranes can form a proteolipid fusion pore and that radial dissociation and expansion of V0 sectors results in membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Bayer1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Peters1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, genetic analysis in different model systems has suggested that the V-ATPase can contribute to membrane fusion, independent of vesicle acidification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Hiesinger1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Peri1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, V-ATPase subunits and SNARE proteins have been shown to interact on synaptic vesicles, although the functional significance of this interaction has not been established. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Hiesinger1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Galli1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>Another possible regulator of SNARE function is Sro7p and its redundant homologue <italic>SRO77</italic>. Sro7p and Sro77p have been implicated in secretion based on genetic studies demonstrating decreased secretion of invertase and an accumulation of secretory vesicles in the absence of <italic>SRO7</italic> and <italic>SRO77</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Lehman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>SRO7</italic> was initially isolated as a high-copy suppressor of <italic>rho3</italic> mutants, suggesting a role for Sro7p in maintenance of actin polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Kagami1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Matsui1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, further studies have established that the primary role for Sro7p is in membrane fusion. First, Sro7p binds directly to Sec9p, and the interaction between Sro7p and SNAREs is essential for Sro7p function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Gangar1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Hattendorf1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, Sro7p is an effector of the Rab GTPase Sec4p, which has multiple functions during secretion, one of which occurs after vesicle transport to sites of secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Grosshans1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, tomosyn, which is closely related in sequence with Sro7p, has been implicated directly in vesicle fusion in different systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Cheviet1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Gracheva1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. While Sro7p is likely to be involved in membrane fusion through an interaction with Sec9p, a role for Sro7p in SNARE complex assembly has not been determined.</p><p>Here, we describe genetic and physiological influences on SNARE complex formation. A forward genetic selection was performed to isolate mutations that suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of <italic>sec9</italic>-4 mutants. This screen revealed that disruption of the V-ATPase suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype caused by mutations in <italic>SEC9</italic>. Suppression was not accompanied by increased SNARE complex formation, suggesting that suppression involves a mechanism other than restoration of SNARE complex formation between Sso1/2p, Snc1/2p, and mutant alleles of Sec9p. Improved growth of <italic>sec9</italic> mutants was also observed under conditions in which SNARE complex assembly and the growth rate of wild-type cells was reduced. Thus, suppression is likely the result of lowering the secretory demands of the cell to match the reduced level of Sec9p function. Furthermore, our results suggest that SNARE complex formation is highly responsive to the physiological state of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Disruption of the V-ATPase suppresses <italic>sec9-4</italic></title><p>The <italic>sec9-4</italic> mutation disrupts the first SNARE-forming helix of Sec9p, preventing the formation of dimeric SNARE complexes between Sec9-4p and Sso1/2p and partially inhibiting the formation of trimeric SNAREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Brennwald1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Suppressors were obtained by plating <italic>sec9-4</italic> cells on rich media and selection of colonies that formed at the non-permissive temperature. These colonies were then screened for secondary phenotypes to facilitate cloning of the suppressor gene. The isolated strains were backcrossed to determine if the suppressor was genetically linked to the secondary phenotype and to separate the suppressor from the <italic>sec9-4</italic> mutation. Two independent suppressing mutations shared the secondary phenotypes of cold-sensitivity and poor growth on glycerol in <italic>SEC9</italic> cells. In both cases the suppressor locus was tightly linked to the secondary growth defects and segregated 2&#x02236;2 during tetrad analysis, indicating that they were the result of a single mutation. Furthermore, both the suppression and the secondary phenotypes were found to be genetically recessive to wild type, suggesting that they are the result of a loss-of-function mutation.</p><p>Although the phenotypes caused by these two mutations were indistinguishable, they complemented each other indicating that they represent alleles of different loci (data not shown). The wild-type allele of each mutant gene was isolated and identified by complementation cloning: mutants were transformed with a genomic library and colonies able to grow on glycerol were selected. The plasmids conferring rescue were recovered and the genomic fragment contained within the rescuing plasmid was identified by restriction analysis and sequencing. From each strain, the rescuing plasmid contains a genomic fragment encoding a subunit of the V-ATPase (<italic>VMA1 and VMA16</italic>), suggesting that mutations in V-ATPase genes are able to suppress <italic>sec9-4</italic>.</p><p>To directly test whether disruption of the V-ATPase is able to suppress mutations in <italic>SEC9</italic>, we generated a deletion allele of the V1 sector <italic>VMA1</italic> and asked whether the deletion allele suppresses <italic>sec9-4</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Hirata1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

This led us to hypothesize that the observed suppression of <italic>sec9</italic> might be the result of culture conditions that decrease growth. Slower cell growth would be expected to reduce the rate of secretory vesicle formation and thereby lower the requirement for SNARE function. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether reducing overall growth rates by another means would also result in suppression of <italic>sec9</italic>.

Our hypothesis was that <italic>sec9</italic> suppressing conditions (either by extragenic suppressors or changes in culture media) would be due to an increase in SNARE complex formation. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that suppressing conditions led to a decrease in SNARE complex formation as assayed by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, we observed suppression of two different alleles of <italic>sec9</italic> that have intrinsic differences in their ability to form SNARE complexes. As an alternative test of whether suppression is linked to increased SNARE complex formation, we examined if genetic enhancement of SNARE complex formation results in suppression of <italic>sec9</italic> mutations. Overexpression of <italic>SRO7</italic> results in increased SNARE complex levels, but does not suppress <italic>sec9</italic> mutations. Together these results exclude the possibility that suppression is due to increased SNARE complex formation.</p><p>The results of our screen revealed that disruption of the yeast V-ATPase is able to suppress <italic>sec9</italic> mutations. This was initially intriguing, as V-ATPase subunits physically interact with SNAREs and the V-ATPase has been implicated in membrane fusion in other genetic model systems. In these studies, loss-of-function mutations in V-ATPase subunits produce phenotypes that are attributable to defects in membrane fusion independent of acidification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Hiesinger1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Peri1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In each of these cases, the loss of the V-ATPase results in defects in membrane fusion, suggesting a facilitatory role for the V-ATPase in membrane fusion. However, our results indicate that loss of V-ATPase function suppresses two different <italic>sec9</italic> mutations. This is inconsistent with a facilitatory role for the V-ATPase in secretory vesicle fusion, which predicts that disruption of the V-ATPase would enhance the phenotype of mutations in <italic>sec9</italic>. Although our results establish a genetic interaction between the V-ATPase and SNAREs, this interaction is likely a secondary consequence of the growth defect of V-ATPase subunit mutations.</p><p>The results presented here suggest that a function of Sec9p and SNARE complex formation is influenced by the physiological state of the cell. One common feature of the different suppressing conditions is that they all confer a reduction in the growth rate of wild-type cells, while mutant backgrounds that do not affect growth (<italic>pep4&#x00394; prb1&#x00394;</italic>) fail to suppress <italic>sec9</italic> mutations. Our interpretation of these results is that mutations in <italic>SEC9</italic> affect a constitutive function, but that the temperature-sensitive phenotype is a manifestation of greater cellular requirement for this absent function under the increased physiological demands of higher temperature. This is consistent with previous observations that the level of SNARE complexes can be controlled by the availability of Sec9p, suggesting that Sec9p is limiting for SNARE complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005449-Munson2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.
