A region of 1701 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 567 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 63,599 was identified as the most probable sequence for the recN structural gene. The proposed initiation codon is preceded by a reasonable Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a promoter region containing two 16 bp sequences, separated by 6 bp, that match the consensus sequence (SOS box) for binding LexA protein. DNA fragments containing this putative promoter region are shown to bind LexA in vitro and to have LexA-regulated promoter activity in vivo. The amino acid sequence of RecN predicted from the DNA contains a region that is homologous to highly conserved sequences found in several DNA repair enzymes and other proteins that bind ATP. A sequence of 9 amino acids was found to be homologous to a region of the RecA protein of E. coli postulated to have a role in DNA/nucleotide binding.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0062-a" xlink:role="5047"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5041"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5042"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5043"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5044"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5045"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5046"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5047"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5048"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5049"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
