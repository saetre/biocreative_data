In screens for proteins that bind to the HECT ubiquitin ligase WWP1, we identified Spartin, which is also known as SPG20. This protein is truncated in a neurological disease, Troyer syndrome. In this study, we show that SPG20 associates with the surface of lipid droplets (LDs) and can regulate their size and number. SPG20 binds to another LD protein, TIP47, and both proteins compete with an additional LD protein, adipophilin/adipocyte differentiation-related protein, for occupancy of LDs. The mutant SPG20 present in Troyer syndrome does not possess these activities. Depletion of SPG20 using RNA interference increases the number and size of LDs when cells are fed with oleic acid. Binding of WWP1 to SPG20 and the consequent ubiquitin transfer remove SPG20 from LDs and reduce the levels of coexpressed SPG20. These experiments suggest functions for ubiquitin ligases and SPG20 in the regulation of LD turnover and potential pathological mechanisms in Troyer syndrome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>HECT (homologous to the E6AP C terminus) ubiquitin ligases share a common protein organization, encoding an N-terminal C2 domain involved in membrane binding, several centrally located WW domains that bind to PPxY motifs, and a C-terminal HECT domain possessing the ubiquitin binding and ligase activities. HECT ubiquitin ligases have diverse functions in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingham et al., 2004</xref>), largely through their ability to modify target proteins with mono- or polyubiquitin, thereby affecting protein localization, interactions, and stability. For example, HECT ubiquitin ligases modulate the levels or localization of proteins involved in the control of the actin cytoskeleton (RhoA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>), surface receptors such as CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marchese et al., 2003</xref>), transcription factors in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), and factors that modulate Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bray, 2006</xref>) as well as several tumor suppressors, including Smad4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moren et al., 2005</xref>) and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laine and Ronai, 2007</xref>). HECT ubiquitin ligases are also exploited by several enveloped viruses to initiate the recruitment of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery that mediates viral budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Serrano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Usami et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In two independent screens for proteins that bind to HECT ubiquitin ligases, we identified Spartin as a WWP1-binding protein. Spartin, also know as SPG20, is mutated in a rare neuronal disease, termed Troyer syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patel et al., 2002</xref>). This syndrome is a complicated hereditary spastic paraparesis, which is characterized by distal muscle wasting, mental retardation, and dysarthria in addition to the lower extremity paraparesis and spasticity that characterize &#x0201c;pure&#x0201d; hereditary spastic paraparesis. SPG20 is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a microtubule interaction and trafficking (MIT) domain at its N terminus, which is also found in the related protein SPG4 (Spastin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciccarelli et al., 2003</xref>) as well as in the class E vacuolar protein sorting ATPase, VPS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>), both of which bind to components of the ESCRT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurley and Yang, 2008</xref>). Additionally, SPG20 encodes a domain of unknown function toward its C terminus, which is defined by homology to proteins that are up-regulated during plant senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciccarelli et al., 2003</xref>). There is some confusion as to the function of SPG20 in cells, as some investigators have reported that it binds to EPS15 and plays a role in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakowska et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2007</xref>), whereas others have suggested that it localizes to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2006</xref>). Additional experiments have suggested that SPG20 has a complex pattern of subcellular distribution, including transient localization with the TGN, as well as synaptic vesicles and discrete undefined puncta within terminally differentiated neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robay et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that rather than associating with endosomal compartments and ESCRT proteins, SPG20 associates with the surface of lipid droplets (LDs). LDs are dynamic organelles that are the primary site for the storage of neutral lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Welte, 2007</xref>). They are believed to form within membranes of the ER, are transported along microtubules, and can be mobilized for lipolysis by adipose triglyceride lipase in response to changes in metabolic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brasaemle, 2007</xref>). LD surfaces display several specific proteins, including proteins of the perilipin (PAT) family such as adipophilin/adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP) as well as TIP47 (tail-interacting protein of 47 kD), OXPAT/myocardial LD protein, and S3-12. These proteins may dynamically exchange between cytoplasmic- and LD-associated fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Londos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Listenberger et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We also find that SPG20 binds to the LD-localized protein TIP47. Interestingly, a mutant SPG20 present in Troyer syndrome fails to localize to LDs and does not bind TIP47. Moreover, ADRP and SPG20 appear to compete for LD surfaces and mutually exclude each other from LDs. Importantly, depletion of SPG20 from cells using RNA interference causes increases in both the number and size of LD when cells are fed with oleic acid (OA). Finally, SPG20 is ubiquitinated, does not accumulate on the surfaces of LDs, and is degraded under conditions of HECT ubiquitin ligase (WWP1) overexpression, suggesting that the protein composition of LDs, and by inference lipid storage, may be regulated by HECT ubiquitin ligases. Overall, these experiments suggest potential molecular mechanisms for the pathology of Troyer syndrome and a role for ubiquitin ligases and SPG20 in the regulation of LD turnover.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of Spartin/SPG20 as a HECT ubiquitin ligase&#x02013;binding protein</title><p>In screens to identify proteins that interact with HECT ubiquitin ligases, we used yeast two-hybrid and tandem affinity purification (TAP) approaches using full-length WWP1 as bait. Both screens identified several cellular proteins (unpublished data), but only one, namely SPG20, was identified by both approaches. SPG20 consists of an N-terminal MIT domain linked to a poorly characterized domain, which also contains a PPxY motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

In reciprocal experiments, GST-WWP1 coprecipitated YFP-SPG20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The coprecipitation of SPG20 and WWP1 was dependent on the SPG20 PPxY motif, but deletion of either of the MIT domain or residues C terminal to position 1,110 (mimicking the <italic>SPG20</italic> mutation in Troyer syndrome) had no effect on WWP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These results were confirmed using yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Further yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the central WW domains of WWP1 were necessary and sufficient for interaction with SPG20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Thus, SPG20&#x02013;WWP1 interaction appeared to be mediated exclusively by the PPxY motif in SPG20 and the WW domains in WWP1. Yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that SPG20 could bind to the WW domains from several HECT ubiquitin ligases, specifically WWP1, WWP2, Itch, Smurf1, and Smurf2, but did not bind to WW domains of other HECT ubiquitin ligases, namely Nedd4, Nedd4-L, and Bul-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Colocalization of SPG20 and WWP1</title><p>Overexpression of CFP-SPG20 in 293T cells resulted in the formation of large, apparently spherical, clustered vesicular structures within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Upon coexpression of CFP-SPG20 with YFP-WWP1, the localization of both proteins changed, and extensive colocalization was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Ordinarily, YFP-WWP1 localizes primarily at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Serrano et al., 2005</xref>). However, when coexpressed with CFP-SPG20, a portion of WWP1 relocalized to the CFP-SPG20&#x02013;labeled vesicular structures. Moreover, a portion of CFP-SPG20 was relocalized to the plasma membrane when coexpressed with WWP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Colocalization experiments using overexpressed WWP1 fragments (YFP<sub>WW-HECT</sub>, YFP<sub>C2-WW</sub>, YFP<sub>HECT</sub>, and YFP<sub>WW</sub>) revealed that fragments that included the WW domain colocalized extensively with CFP-SPG20, and YFP<sub>C2-WW</sub> overexpression caused CFP-SPG20 to relocalize to the plasma membrane (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808041/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Conversely, upon coexpression of CFP-SPG20 with YFP<sub>HECT</sub>, there was no colocalization or any change in the distribution of either protein (Fig. S1, bottom). Thus, the WW domain of WWP1 meditates WWP1 recruitment to SPG20-containing structures, which is consistent with the finding that the WW domains of WWP1 bind to SPG20.</p></sec><sec><title>Use of virus release-based assays to demonstrate HECT ubiquitin ligase recruitment by Spartin/SPG20</title><p>Several enveloped viruses, including murine leukemia virus (MLV), engage cellular machinery required for virus particle release using PPxY-based &#x0201c;late-domain&#x0201d; peptide motifs that recruit ubiquitin ligases. If the SPG20 PPxY motif indeed bound to HECT ubiquitin ligases in a cellular environment, we reasoned that it should substitute for a motif within the MLV Gag protein that is known to recruit HECT ubiquitin ligases and thereby induce viral budding. Therefore, we substituted the MLV late domain with a motif corresponding to 14 aa residues centered around the PPxY motif in SPG20. Notably, this construct, termed MLV-SPG20, efficiently generated infectious MLV virions, at least 200-fold more efficiently than the background level generated by an MLV lacking the PPPY motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Moreover, MLV-SPG20 release was highly sensitive to the inhibition by a C-terminally truncated version of WWP1 lacking the HECT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>), which is a potent inhibitor of wild-type MLV budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Serrano et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, an isogenic control virus, MLV-p6, that contains a PTAP late domain and does not require HECT ubiquitin ligases for budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) was not inhibited by the truncated WWP1 protein. Thus, transplantation of the SPG20 PPxY motif into a heterologous context conferred the ability to recruit HECT ubiquitin ligases.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Virus particle release assays to demonstrate interactions between SPG20 and HECT ubiquitin ligases within cells.</bold> (A) Release of virions from cells transfected with MLV constructs encoding either the unmodified PPPY domain or one in which the PPPY motif was replaced with a region encompassing the SPG20-PPxY sequence (MLV-SPG20).

We reasoned that if the interaction of SPG20 and WWP1 was authentic, SPG20 might compete with MLV Gag that normally binds to WWP1, block WWP1 recruitment, and inhibit virus particle release. Coexpressed CFP-tagged MLV Gag and YFP-WWP1 extensively colocalized in puncta at the plasma membrane (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808041/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). Notably, simultaneous overexpression of SPG20, but not SPG20 possessing a mutated PPPY domain (SPG20dPY), blocked YFP-WWP1 recruitment to MLV Gag-CFP puncta (Fig. S2, B and C). Additionally, overexpression of either full-length SPG20 or the MIT domain&#x02013;deleted variant substantially reduced the release of MLV virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>) but had no effect on MLV-p6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This inhibition of MLV release was largely dependent on the SPG20 PPxY motif, as expression of SPG20dPY had only marginal effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Intact SPG20 but not the Troyer syndrome variant is an LD-associated protein</title><p>We generated cell lines constitutively expressing SPG20 with both N- and C-terminal fusions of YFP, Cherry fluorescent protein (Che), or the HA antigen tag. In each cell line, the tagged SPG20 protein localized in spherical, apparently vesicular structures. Because SPG20 was reported to bind EPS15 and because proteins encoding MIT domains often bind to cellular factors involved in endosomal trafficking, we determined whether stably expressed YFP-SPG20 colocalized to endosome markers. These included endogenous markers for early and late endosomes (EEA1 and CD63) and late endosome to Golgi transport vesicles (mannose-6-phosphate receptor [M6PR]) as well as transfected markers for recycling endosomes (CFP-Rab11) and markers of secretory granules (Che-Vamp2 and pCDNA-prolactin).

The PPxY motif, and by inference the ability of SPG20 to bind to WWP1, was not required for LD localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

The addition of the fatty acid OA has been shown to stimulate LD formation in a variety of nonadipose cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smirnova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bostrom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fei et al., 2008</xref>), and, strikingly, a significant proportion of the diffuse YFP-SPG20 was redistributed to LDs upon addition of OA to the culture medium of 293T/YFP-SPG20 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). However, stably expressed YFP-SPG20-1110mt did not respond to OA in this way, confirming that the recruitment of SPG20 to LDs was dependent on the C-terminal portion of the protein that is missing in Troyer syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that the LD localization of YFP-SPG20 and Che-SPG20 was not an artifact of fluorescent protein tagging, we generated a HeLa cell line stably expressing HA-tagged SPG20 (HA-SPG20).

In these cells, a diffuse cytoplasmic staining was evident with some degree of HA-SPG20 localization on LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, top). However, notably, when the HeLa/HA-SPG20 cells were cultured in the presence of OA, localization of HA-SPG20 to BODIPY-positive LDs became prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, bottom) without effects on the HA-SPG20 expression levels (Fig. S3 B).

To accomplish this, we coexpressed a GST-tagged version of SPG20 (or MLV Gag as a control) with WWP1 and HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-ubiquitin). Western blot analysis of glutathione-agarose&#x02013;precipitated proteins revealed that a small fraction of SPG20 was monoubiquitinated in the absence of overexpressed WWP1. Notably, SPG20 ubiquitination was stimulated by overexpression of WWP1 and inhibited by a catalytically inactive WWP1 point mutant (C890S; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). The predominant ubiquitinated SPG20 species observed was monoubiquitinated, as indicated by the &#x0223c;10-kD larger form of SPG20 that was sometimes detected in whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>) and the dominant anti-HA reactive species in glutathione-agarose precipitates.

Other LD resident proteins (expressed as GST fusion proteins), including TIP47, were either not ubiquitinated or only exhibited traces of ubiquitination upon coexpression with WWP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>WWP1 can ubiquitinate SPG20 and prevent its accumulation on LDs.</bold> (A) Ubiquitin transfer experiment performed in 293T cells cotransfected with GST-SPG20 or MLV Gag&#x02013;GST along with HA-ubiquitin and unfused YFP, YFP-WWP1, or catalytically inactive YFP-WWP1 (C890S).

Incubation of SPG20-depleted 293T cells with the fluorescent LD marker BODIPY 493/503 did not reveal any effect on LDs under basal conditions (unpublished data). However, when cells were cultured with OA for 2 d, SPG20 depletion had a marked effect on LD accumulation. Specifically, SPG20-depleted cells contained a clearly increased amount of BODIPY 493/503&#x02013;stained LDs as compared with control vector&#x02013;transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). We quantitated this difference by measuring the total number and size of LDs in randomly selected fields in the cell monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Both parameters were increased in SPG20-depleted cells as compared with control vector&#x02013;transduced cells, and when both LD size and numbers were accounted for and assuming that LDs are spherical, we estimated that SPG20-depleted cells bore an approximately three- to fivefold greater total burden of LD volume as compared with control vector&#x02013;transduced cells.

Notably, we found a striking localization of SPG20 on LDs in several cell lines, including HeLa, 293T, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. At low expression levels, approximating those of the endogenous levels found in HeLa cells, SPG20 fusion proteins were found to be diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm with some degree of accumulation on LDs. However, SPG20 localization to LDs was stimulated by OA feeding without affecting SPG20 expression levels in a manner quite similar to that observed with PAT proteins such as TIP47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wolins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brasaemle, 2007</xref>). Overexpressed YFP, Che, or HA-tagged SPG20 proteins clearly localized on LDs and, in fact, induced clustering of LDs.</p><p>Other studies have described diverse patterns of localization for SPG20, including within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2006</xref>), early and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakowska et al., 2007</xref>), the nucleus, and the TGN as well as synaptotagmin-positive synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robay et al., 2006</xref>). However, in some of these previous studies, the morphological pattern of SPG20 localization depicted is reminiscent of the LD staining described in this study. Indeed, other proteins that had been previously thought to reside in the mitochondria or endosomes have since been reclassified as LD-localized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puri et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to the previous studies, we did not detect an SPG20 colocalization with endosomal markers (EEA1 or CD63), swollen late endosomes induced by expression of dominant-negative VPS4, or with mitochondria marked by either a resident fluorescent protein (DsRed-Mito) or MitoTracker (unpublished data). However, we did detect LDs labeled with YFP-SPG20 in the vicinity of both VPS4-induced endosomes and mitochondria. Interestingly, two studies have found that LDs exist in close proximity to mitochondria within adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brasaemle, 2007</xref>), and it is quite likely that the localization of SPG20 to mitochondria or endosomal compartments that has been reported was actually SPG20 on LDs. This may have been difficult to resolve using the microscopic techniques used in those studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakowska et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, we found that the SPG20-1110mt protein failed to associate with LDs. The portion of SPG20 that is disrupted in the SPG20-1110mt protein contains a poorly defined plant-related senescence domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciccarelli et al., 2003</xref>), and, therefore, it is plausible that the senescence domain is an LD-targeting domain. Indeed, targeting of SPG20 to LDs may stabilize SPG20 levels in vivo because a recent study has shown that cells isolated from Troyer syndrome patients contain undetectable levels of SPG20-1110mt mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakowska et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although several recent studies have identified numerous proteins associated with LDs using either proteomic or functional genomic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beller et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenberg and Obin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2008</xref>), SPG20 has yet to be identified as LD associated. This is in keeping with the diffuse pattern of localization that we found upon low levels of SPG20 expression. Indeed, SPG20 only became highly enriched on LDs when overexpressed or when cells were fed with OA. Nonetheless, consistent with the notion that SPG20 can genuinely localize to LDs, we also found that SPG20 interacted with TIP47. Importantly, this interaction required the C-terminal region of SPG20 that is lost in the Troyer syndrome mutant protein and is also required for LD association. Moreover, we found that overexpression of a YFP-tagged version of SPG20 caused a dramatic accumulation of endogenous TIP47 to clustered LDs that were also SPG20 positive. Notably, previous work has shown that TIP47 and ADRP mark distinct populations of LDs that appear to be at different stages of maturation. Specifically, shortly after OA treatment of adipocytes, TIP47 has been found to be associated with small lipid accumulations at the cell periphery that subsequently develop into mature LDs, and TIP47 is simultaneously replaced by ADARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wolins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohsaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Listenberger et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, another protein associated with the LD, Rab18, has been shown to displace ADRP from LDs upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ozeki et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we found a similar relationship between SPG20 and ADRP, as the presence of SPG20 and ADRP on LDs appeared to be mutually exclusive. Cells expressing high levels of SPG20 had quite low or undetectable levels of ADRP on LDs and vice versa. Thus, SPG20 behaved similarly to TIP47 and bound to TIP47. Therefore, TIP47/SPG20 may compete with ADRP for binding sites on the LD surface. Curiously, a similar phenotype was observed upon overexpression of the hepatitis C virus core protein such that hepatitis C virus core proteins were found to coat the LD and to exclude ADRP as well as cause LD aggregation in a rather similar manner to SPG20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boulant et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, both overexpression and underexpression of SPG20 induced the accumulation of LDs in cultured cells. The reasons for this are not clear, but we speculate that perhaps SPG20 functions as part of a protein complex, whose stoichiometry (and function) could be disrupted by either overexpression or underexpression of SPG20. However, SPG20 overexpression appeared to induce tightly clustered LDs, whereas SPG20 depletion induced LDs that appeared to be dispersed throughout the cell. The precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined.</p><p>Using a variety of assays, we found that SPG20 binds to HECT ubiquitin ligases via a PPxY domain in SPG20 and the WW domains in the HECT ligases. We also found that binding of WWP1 to SPG20 results in ubiquitin transfer to SPG20. Previous experiments have shown that SPG20 is monoubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakowska et al., 2007</xref>), and, concordantly, the major species that we observed resulting from WWP1 overexpression was monoubiquitinated SPG20. In addition, we found that WWP1 overexpression reduced the levels of coexpressed SPG20 in cells. Although we have not defined a direct role for WWP1 in LD morphogenesis, it is likely that HECT ubiquitin ligases control SPG20 localization and/or protein levels via ubiquitination and, therefore, could influence LD protein composition and turnover.</p><p>The symptoms of SPG20 mutation in Troyer syndrome include lower limb spasticity and are consistent with the degeneration of long axons. However, no defects in general lipid metabolism such as obesity or fat deposition have been reported. This is perhaps surprising given our findings with SPG20, although inspection of subcellular architecture, in particular that of LDs, in Troyer syndrome patients has not been undertaken as far as we are aware. It may be that axons may simply be more sensitive than other cell types to perturbations in LD turnover. There are interesting precedents linking genes involved in lipid turnover with diseases that have a similar presentation to Troyer syndrome. For example, a motor neuron disease can be caused by mutations of the gene encoding the neuropathy target esterase (NTE) or inhibition of NTE by organophosphorus compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rainier et al., 2008</xref>). NTE is partially localized to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and appears to be important for the proper balance of membrane lipids and the maintenance of axon integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glynn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zaccheo et al., 2004</xref>). NTE is a phospholipase and is a member of the superfamily of patatin domain lipases that also includes the closely related lysophospholipase NTE-related esterase that is found on LDs and adipose triglyceride lipase, which can regulate LD size in nonadipocyte cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smirnova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kienesberger et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, mutation of another human protein, Seipin (BSCL2), has also been shown to be associated with motor neuron disorders, including wasting of distal limb muscles and lower limb spasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Garg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito and Suzuki, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, yeast lacking a functional homologue of Seipin (FLD1) contain increased levels of neutral lipids and possess irregularly clustered/fused and enlarged LDs, a defect that can be rescued by introduction of human or mouse Seipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szymanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fei et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, misregulation of lipid and/or LD morphogenesis/metabolism can apparently lead to axonal damage. Collectively, these studies and our study suggest a potentially important requirement for proper LD function in the health of motor neurons.</p><p>Overall, these data identify a likely function for SPG20 and expand the range of cellular activities that are potentially regulated by ubiquitination and, in particular, by the HECT ubiquitin ligases. Further work will be required to determine precisely how SPG20 mutation leads to disease, but data from this and other studies indicate that improper regulation of LDs can have profound effects on neuronal health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells and transfections</title><p>293T and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin. Derivatives expressing YFP, Che, HA-tagged SPG20 or ADRP proteins, or TAP-YFP/WWP1 were generated by transduction with MLV-based LNCX2 or LPCX viral vectors and selected with either 1.0 mg/ml G418 or 500 &#x000b5;g/ml puromycin, respectively. Stable SPG20 knockdown cells were created by transducing 293T cells with an HIV-based retroviral vector, pLENTI-shSPG20. This vector was derived from pLENTI-3&#x02032;-U6-EC-EP7 (provided by D. Boden, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York, NY) by inserting an oligonucleotide that generated an shRNA sequence, 5&#x02032;-GTAACTGCCTACAATATTAACAA-3&#x02032; (nt 1,795&#x02013;1,817), targeting a 3&#x02032; region of the SPG20 mRNA. The HA-tagged shRNA-resistant forms of SPG20 and the SPG20 mutant (HA-SPG20-R and HA-SPG20-1110mt-R, respectively) were introduced into the SPG20 knockdown 293T cells by transduction with LHCX-based vectors and selected with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml hygromycin.

The coding sequences of SPG20, TIP47, ADRP, Rab11, Rab18, and Cav1 and 3 were amplified by PCR from human placenta&#x02013;derived cDNA and inserted into the pCR3.1/YFP/CFP/Che, LNCX2/YFP, or LNCX2/Che plasmids for transient or stable expression of fluorescent fusion proteins. Mutant forms of YFP-SPG20 were created by recombinant PCR-based techniques and include YFP-SPG20dPY (PPAY to PAAA at aa position 170&#x02013;174), YFP-SPG20dMIT (deletion of aa 1&#x02013;129), and YFP-SPG20-1110mt (deletion of A at nt position 1,110). The shRNA-resistant form of SPG20 contains the sequence 5&#x02032;-GTcACgGCaTAtAAcATcAAtAA-3&#x02032; from position 1,795&#x02013;1,817 of the cDNA sequence (silent mutations are in lower case).</p></sec><sec><title>Virus release assays</title><p>MLV particle release assays were conducted using wild-type MLV or a variant, termed MLV-p6, in which a fragment of HIV-1 was inserted in place of the PPPY motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, an MLV construct containing a fragment of SPG20, termed MLV-SPG20, was created by inserting a 14-aa stretch of residues centered around the SPG20 PPPY sequence (PAEAPPAYTPQAAE) in place of the MLV PPPY motif. These mutations were introduced into a full-length MLV proviral plasmid and as well as into an MLV GagPol expression vector. 293T cells were plated in 12-well dishes and transfected with 700 ng MLV, MLV-p6, MLV-SPG20 proviral, or GagPol expression vector along with 300 ng pCR3.1/YFP or pCR3.1/YFP-SPG20 and derivates. Included in the transfection was 350 ng of a transfer vector that was either pMSCV-Tat or pMSCV-GFP as well as 150 ng of a plasmid expressing the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein envelope protein. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection, and cells and extracellular virions were harvested at 45 h after transfection. Supernatants were filtered (0.2 &#x000b5;m), and virions were harvested by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge (5417R; Eppendorf) at 4&#x000b0;C for 90 min. Cells, along with the viral pellet, were lysed in protein sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotting. When using the pMSCV-Tat vector, infectious virions in culture supernatants were measured using TZM cells as targets (TZM cells contain an integrated HIV long terminal repeat driving the expression of LacZ). At 48 h after infection, cells were lysed, and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was measured.
