MBP messenger RNA (mRNA) is transported in RNA granules to oligodendroglial processes in a translationally silenced state. This process is regulated by the trans-acting factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2 binding to the cis-acting A2 response element (A2RE). Release of this repression of MBP mRNA translation is thus essential for myelination. Mice deficient in the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn are hypomyelinated and contain reduced levels of MBP. Here, we identify hnRNP A2 as a target of activated Fyn in oligodendrocytes. We show that active Fyn phosphorylates hnRNP A2 and stimulates translation of an MBP A2RE&#x02013;containing reporter construct. Neuronal adhesion molecule L1 binding to oligodendrocytes results in Fyn activation, which leads to an increase in hnRNP A2 phosphorylation. These results suggest that Fyn kinase activation results in the localized translation of MBP mRNA at sites of axon&#x02013;glia contact and myelin deposition.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: A2RE, A2 response element; CNS, central nervous system; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; MBP, myelin basic protein; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; UTR, untranslated region.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>During central nervous system (CNS) myelination, oligodendrocytes extend membrane processes toward an axonal contact site followed by ensheathment, resulting in a compacted multilamellar myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartline and Colman, 2007</xref>). This axon&#x02013;glia unit facilitates rapid saltatory propagation of action potentials along the axon. The protein content of myelin is dominated by proteolipid protein and myelin basic protein (MBP). The establishment and maintenance of myelin thus requires the specific delivery of large amounts of proteolipid protein and MBP to the axon&#x02013;glia contact site, which is precisely regulated in time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simons and Trotter, 2007</xref>). MBP protein is involved in compaction of the myelin sheath: the importance of MBP is exemplified by the naturally occurring mouse mutant <italic>shiverer</italic>, in which a large part of the MBP gene is deleted, resulting in a failure to synthesize MBP protein. This culminates in an inability to myelinate the CNS, although oligodendrocyte processes contact and start to wrap axons. The mutant phenotype can be rescued by introduction of transgenic MBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Popko et al., 1987</xref>). Interestingly, the level of MBP expression correlates with the amount of myelin synthesized. Similarly, the <italic>Long Evans shaker</italic> (<italic>les</italic>) rat is severely dysmyelinated in the CNS, which results from a lack of MBP expression due to a large insertion in the MBP gene causing aberrant MBP mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O'Connor et al., 1999</xref>). Glial signals initiating myelination are still largely unknown, but mice deficient in the Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fyn also exhibit severe hypomyelination in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sperber et al., 2001</xref>). Fyn kinase is up-regulated in oligodendrocytes concomitantly with active myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 1999</xref>) and is involved in the regulation of process outgrowth in cultured oligodendrocytes by binding to microtubules and the microtubule-associated protein tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osterhout et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klein et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Ribosomal subunits and MBP mRNA were isolated from purified myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colman et al., 1982</xref>), which suggests the localized translation of MBP mRNA in the myelin compartment. It was later shown that MBP mRNA is transported in a translationally silenced state in RNA granules to the distal processes of cultured oligodendrocytes. These granules contain RNA-binding proteins including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2). HnRNP A2 binds to a cis-acting element in the MBP mRNA 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) termed the A2 response element (A2RE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Munro et al., 1999</xref>). HnRNP A2 is thought to bind to MBP mRNA in the nucleus, and the complex is then exported to the cytoplasm, where granules are formed and transported in a microtubule-dependent manner along the oligodendrocyte processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carson and Barbarese, 2005</xref>). The formation of MBP-RNA&#x02013;containing polysomes is prevented, resulting in translational inhibition that must be relieved when the granule reaches its destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kosturko et al., 2006</xref>). The signals that result in the induction of localized translation of MBP mRNA are unknown, but because the timing of myelination is precisely regulated concordant with axonal maturation, it is likely that a signaling cascade originating from the neuronal compartment of the axon&#x02013;glia unit initiates the termination of translational repression of MBP mRNA.</p><p>Antibody-induced cross-linking of F3 expressed by oligodendrocytes results in an activation of Fyn kinase in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 1999</xref>). We proposed that in vivo, a neuronal interaction partner binds to oligodendroglial F3, activating Fyn and initiating the myelination process at this axon&#x02013;glial contact site. Here, we show that activated Fyn in oligodendrocytes leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of hnRNP A2 and translation of an A2RE-containing reporter. We show that L1 binding to oligodendrocytes results in activation of Fyn kinase and the Fyn-dependent phosphorylation of hnRNP A2. We demonstrate that oligodendroglial F3 is a binding partner for neuronal L1. Fyn activation may thus be a critical regulatory element of the myelination process by triggering hnRNP A2 phosphorylation and local activation of MBP mRNA translation at sites of glia&#x02013;neuronal contact.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>hnRNP A2 is phosphorylated by activated Fyn</title><p>To identify downstream targets of F3-triggered signaling events mediated by Fyn activation, we activated Fyn kinase by antibody-mediated cross-linking of oligodendroglial F3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 1999</xref>) followed by purification of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography and their identification by mass spectrometry. HnRNP A2 was one of these proteins (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200706164/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200706164/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>We generated expression vectors coding for the wild type (FynWT) and a constitutively active Fyn mutant (Fyn<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sette et al., 2002</xref>) by site-directed mutagenesis. The oligodendroglial progenitor cell line Oli-<italic>neu</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jung et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trajkovic et al., 2006</xref>) was transfected with control EGFP or Fyn<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> constructs, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were purified from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosine-specific antibody-coupled beads. HnRNP A2 was immunoprecipitated in the presence of Fyn<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), which suggests that hnRNP A2 is either phosphorylated directly by Fyn or binds to another protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activated Fyn. In contrast, hnRNP E1, a binding partner of hnRNP A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kosturko et al., 2006</xref>), which is not a target of Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ostareck-Lederer et al., 2002</xref>), was not coimmunoprecipitated. To demonstrate that hnRNP A2 is a direct target of Fyn kinase, we performed in vitro kinase assays with purified proteins. Incubation of endogenous hnRNP A2 immunoprecipitated from Oli-<italic>neu</italic> cells with purified recombinant Fyn kinase in vitro resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of hnRNP A2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).

These results demonstrate that Fyn binds and phosphorylates hnRNP A2 directly.</p></sec><sec><title>Activated Fyn enhances translation of an A2RE-containing luciferase reporter in the oligodendroglial cell line Oli-<italic>neu</italic></title><p>In a variety of cells, including oligodendrocytes, distinct mRNAs are transported in a translationally silenced state in RNA&#x02013;protein complexes termed RNA granules until they reach their destination, where a specific signal triggers local translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czaplinski and Singer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kiebler and Bassell, 2006</xref>). Src family kinases have been shown to phosphorylate RNA-binding proteins in these granules, leading to the liberation of the mRNA and triggering local protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ostareck-Lederer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huttelmaier et al., 2005</xref>). HnRNP A2 has been shown to bind to an 11-nucleotide&#x02013;containing region in the 3&#x02032; UTR of distinct mRNAs including MBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Munro et al., 1999</xref>). This cis-acting element is termed A2RE, and in oligodendrocytes, the binding of the trans-acting factor hnRNP A2 to the A2RE of MBP mediates localization of MBP mRNA to the distal tips of oligodendroglial processes. It has been further suggested that translational repression is dependent on the recruitment of hnRNP E1 by hnRNP A2 to A2RE-containing mRNAs in granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kosturko et al., 2006</xref>). To assess if Fyn affects translation of MBP mRNA, a region of the 3&#x02032; UTR of MBP including the A2RE was cloned downstream of a firefly luciferase reporter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huttelmaier et al., 2005</xref>). This translational reporter was cotransfected with EGFP (control), FynWT, or Fyn<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> into Oli-<italic>neu</italic> cells, and a DualGlo luciferase assay was performed to quantify the amount of translated luciferase reporter. The activities of the A2RE <italic>firefly</italic> reporter and <italic>renilla</italic> luciferase were normalized to compensate for potential effects of Fyn on general cellular translation processes or transfection variations. Compared with EGFP-transfected control cells, the overexpression of FynWT significantly increases the amount of normalized A2RE luciferase reporter activity. Furthermore, overexpression of Fyn<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> further augments reporter activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). To verify that Fyn overexpression does not affect the mRNA stablility of the A2RE luciferase reporter, total RNA was isolated from the transfected Oli-<italic>neu</italic> cells used in the luciferase assays and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, the amount of normalized <italic>firefly</italic> luciferase A2RE reporter mRNA does not differ significantly in FynWT- and Fyn<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-transfected cells compared with EGFP control cells. These experiments thus show that Fyn activity stimulates translation of the A2RE-containing region of MBP mRNA. Intriguingly, it has been reported that Fyn activity leads to enhanced MBP gene transcription, which is mediated by a distinct region in the MBP promoter that was not included in our construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Umemori et al., 1999</xref>). As Fyn kinase activation is crucial for myelination, it is likely that Fyn activity affects both synthesis and translation of MBP mRNA. The observed reduction of MBP protein levels in the Fyn knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Umemori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sperber et al., 2001</xref>) can be explained by the observed effect on MBP transcription and, furthermore, by the role of Fyn activation in stimulating MBP mRNA translation reported here.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Fyn kinase enhances translation of A2RE containing mRNA.</bold> (A) An A2RE-containing region of the 3&#x02032; UTR of MBP14 mRNA was cloned downstream of the <italic>firefly</italic> luciferase coding sequence (CDS) and used as a translational reporter in the DualGlo luciferase assay.

In contrast, F3 knockout mice show myelination abnormalities in the CNS (Fernandes, F., U. Bergstrom, and B. Ranscht. 2007. Society for Neuroscience, Neuroscience Meeting. Abstr. 459). The cis association of F3 in oligodendrocytes with another transmembrane molecule such as Caspr or protein tyrosine phosphatase &#x003b1;, as shown in neurons, may aid in F3-mediated signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zeng et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>HnRNP E1 and A2 are released from granules.</bold> (A) Oli-<italic>neu</italic> cells and primary oligodendrocytes were transfected with full-length hnRNP A2 and immunostained for hnRNP A2 or MBP.

Western blot bands were analyzed densitometrically from 8 and 15 experiments for RNase treatment and L1-Fc binding, respectively. The control values (RNase A and C-Fc) were set to 1 and the mean relative increase of hnRNP E1 and A2 in the granule-free fraction was plotted in response to RNase A treatment or L1-Fc binding.

(C) The model illustrates the proposed events: During initial axon&#x02013;glial contacts, neuronal L1 binds glial F3 (1), leading to an activation of Fyn (2), which phosphorylates hnRNP A2 (3). This leads to a release of hnRNP A2 and E1 from the granule and liberation of MBP mRNA (4) at the axon&#x02013;glial contact site, allowing localized synthesis of the MBP protein (5) required for generation of the myelin sheath. The dotted lines illustrate potential alternative activation pathways of Fyn kinase mediated by L1 binding.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810579f05"></graphic></fig></sec><sec><title>L1-Fc binding triggers the release of hnRNP E1 and hnRNP A2 from RNA granules</title><p>HnRNP A2&#x02013;containing RNA granules can be detected in processes of Oli-<italic>neu</italic> cells as well as in primary mouse oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). In oligodendrocytes, hnRNP E1 has been shown to be associated with granules, and it has been suggested that release of this protein from the granules may be critical for releasing translational repression of MBP mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carson et al., 2006</xref>). This release of hnRNP E1 would result in an increase of soluble hnRNP E1 in the cytoplasm. We treated a postnuclear supernatant of an Oli-<italic>neu</italic> cell lysate with RNase A to degrade the RNA and dismantle these ribonucleoprotein complexes. High-speed ultracentrifugation was used to pellet the remaining RNA granules and other cellular organelles, yielding a granule-free cytosolic fraction containing soluble proteins. RNase A treatment followed by high-speed ultracentrifugation leads to increased levels of hnRNP A2 and E1 in the supernatant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Furthermore, an increase of hnRNP E1 and hnRNP A2 could be detected in the granule-free supernatants of Oli-<italic>neu</italic> cells in response to L1-Fc binding, which was not seen after incubation with human IgG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>).</p><p>As depicted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), we propose that oligodendroglial Fyn is activated by the binding of neuronal L1 to glial receptors including F3. L1 is down-regulated on myelinated axons in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coman et al., 2005</xref>), which suggests that there is a functional role of L1 in the early phases of myelination. Activated Fyn phosphorylates hnRNP A2 in granules that have reached the axon&#x02013;glia contact site. HnRNP E1 and hnRNP A2 are then released from the transport granules, resulting in termination of repression of MBP mRNA, which is then translated locally at the site of axon&#x02013;glia contact. Synthesis of MBP protein at the site of myelin formation is thus ensured. Because of the basic nature of MBP and the large amounts required for myelin biogenesis, MBP translation at other locations could result in the association and compaction of intracellular membranes and dysfunction. We proposed that Fyn stabilizes and recruits microtubules toward the axon&#x02013;glia contact site by binding tau and tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klein et al., 2002</xref>). RNA granules are transported on microtubules, and thus local activation of Fyn at sites of axon&#x02013;glia contact could recruit microtubules that direct MBP mRNA in RNA granules to this location. Localized MBP synthesis could then be initiated by phosphorylation of hnRNP A2. This is in agreement with the proposed role of Fyn in early myelinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osterhout et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sperber et al., 2001</xref>) and the interplay of L1 and Fyn we report here. Our findings present a functional link between axon&#x02013;glia signaling and myelinogenesis and suggest the involvement of translational control of myelin proteins in site-specific myelin deposition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Polyclonal antibodies against Fyn, hnRNP E1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and Src-pY418, which recognizes activated Fyn (Invitrogen), were used.
