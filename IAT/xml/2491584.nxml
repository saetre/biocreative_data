CC-chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) is a trait of tissue-homing effector T cells and has recently been described as a receptor on T helper type 17 (Th17) cells. Th17 cells are associated with autoimmunity and the defence against certain infections. Although, the polarization of Th cells into Th17 cells has been studied extensively in vitro, the development of those cells during the physiological immune response is still elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We analysed the development and functionality of Th17 cells in immune-competent mice during an ongoing immune response. In na&#x000ef;ve and vaccinated animals CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cells produce IL-17. The robust homeostatic proliferation and the presence of activation markers on CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cells indicate their activated status. Vaccination induces antigen-specific CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th17 cells that respond to in vitro re-stimulation with cytokine production and proliferation. Furthermore, depletion of CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cells from donor leukocytes prevents recipients from severe disease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In conclusion, we defined CCR6 as a specific marker for functional antigen-specific Th17 cells during the immune response. Since IL-17 production reaches the highest levels during the immediate early phase of the immune response and the activation of Th17 cells precedes the Th1 cell differentiation we tent to speculate that this particular Th cell subset may represent a first line effector Th cell subpopulation. Interference with the activation of this Th cell subtype provides an interesting strategy to prevent autoimmunity as well as to establish protective immunity against infections.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the late 80ies Mossman et al. designated Th1 and Th2 cells according to their capacity to secrete the cytokines IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Mosmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The increasing knowledge about the heterogeneity of the Th cell subpopulations helped to explain how most infections are resolved. Nevertheless, the involvement of Th cells in the elimination of extracellular bacteria and fungi, and in the development of autoimmune disorders could not be adequately explained with the T effector cell subpopulations as defined in the literature so far. Recent studies on the role of the APC-derived cytokine IL-23 for the development of autoimmunity and clearance of infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Happel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Murphy1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> expanded our knowledge in T cell immunology by pointing to a new Th cell subtype involved in these mechanisms.

Once the Th cells are differentiated, the cytokine milieu influences the functionality of each of the Th cell subsets; Thl, Th2, and Th17 cells produce cross-regulatory cytokines that are mutually inhibitory for the respective other subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Harrington1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Bogdan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how the development and maintenance of Th17 cells is regulated during the immune response in vivo. One of the reasons for this is the lack of well-characterised surface markers identifying Th17 cells. Based on the findings that Th17 cells express CCR6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-AcostaRodriguez1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Hirota1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> we examined the generation of IL-17 producing Th cells in a non-infectious vaccination model with ovalbumin (OVA), and analysed the functionality of Th17 cells during the immune response in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice. For the first time, we demonstrated that CCR6 is a selective marker for the identification of Th17 cells during an immune response. Furthermore, CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th17 cells were present even in na&#x000ef;ve mice and this population showed signs of activation in the steady state. During the acute phase of the immune response, the proportion of IL-17 producing Th cells in the lymph nodes decreased compared to the Th1 cell subpopulation. Nevertheless, antigen-specific IL-17 producing responder cells arose in the lymph node. The functionality of CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th17 cells was demonstrated in adoptively transferred experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (at-EAE); transfer of lymph node cells containing CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th17 cells led to severe disease while depletion of CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cells attenuated the course of at-EAE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p>Inbred C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany), inbred SJL/J mice were obtained from Harlan Winkelmann (Borchen, Germany).

During the acute phase of the T cell response on day six after vaccination lymph node cells had a reduced capacity to produce IL-17 protein after polyclonal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002951-g002">Fig. 2A left panel</xref>).

Following immunisation IFN-&#x003b3; became the dominant cytokine produced by lymph node cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002951-g002">Fig. 2A, right panel</xref>).

The ablation of CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cells from lymph node cells of PLP immunised mice almost completely prevented IL-17 production. This experiment places emphasis on the correlation between IL-17 production and CCR6 expression. Interestingly, in vitro re-stimulation of primed lymph node cells that were depleted for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, led to the emergence of CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells but not Th17 cells. As we were not able to completely block EAE development by deletion of CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th17 cells, it is conceivable that those cells regain functionality in vivo irrespective of their inability to produce IL-17 during in vitro culture.</p><p>Up to now the generation of murine Th17 cells is accomplished by polarizing these cells in vitro in the presence of cytokines such as IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Veldhoen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Bettelli1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Those toll-like-receptor-activating substances trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by antigen presenting cells that further induce Th cell differentiation towards the Th17 subtype. Thus, our non-infectious vaccination scheme provides the opportunity to follow the formation of Th17 cells in vivo.</p><p>In fact, we were able to induce antigen-specific Th17 cells by our protocol. These cells were functional by producing IL-17 protein and expanding in response to their specific antigen without the presence of additional polarizing cytokines. The presence of IL-17 in antigen-specifically re-stimulated cell cultures suggested the differentiation of Th17 cells from non-committed na&#x000ef;ve T cells after vaccination. However, since Th17 cells are most abundant in na&#x000ef;ve mice we cannot completely rule out whether that cytokine is derived from pre-existing CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory cells. This implies the presence of cross-reactive T cells within the IL-17 producing Th cell subpopulation.

Since we observed a reduction of Th17 cells under Th1, and Th2 polarizing conditions these observations might reflect the differential temporary needs for Th1 or Th2 cells and Th17 cells during the course of an infection, and account for the different kinetics underlying the development of these Th cell subtypes. Th17 cells are equipped with homing receptors that allow them to reside in peripheral tissues. We also noticed a robust proliferation and expression of activation-induced receptors within the CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cell subset in non-vaccinated mice. This pointed to a Th cell subpopulation that is constantly on the alert. Th cell-derived IL-17 induces the production of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines by stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Witowski1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Fossiez1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Subsequently, during the peak of the immune response Th1 cells assume their role in promoting the functionality of CTL and macrophages.</p><p>An open question still remains: is ligation of CCR6 required for in vivo activation of Th17 cells? Since blocking CNS-expressed CCL20, the cognate ligand of CCR6, in active EAE results in an attenuation of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Kohler1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002951-Ambrosini1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> CCR6 expression seems to be necessary for the generation of functional Th17 cells.

These inflammatory conditions also test primed Th cells for their functionality. One likely explanation is that in those models the CCR6-mediated migration of Th cells into the target organs is needed for a sufficient activation of Th17 cells.

That indicates once activated CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th17 cells remain functional. They react against endogenous antigen and cause autoimmunity. Together, these findings point to a defect in the differentiation towards the Th17 subtype in the absence of CCR6.</p><p>From our observations, we conclude that CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cells represent an activated Th cell subpopulation.
