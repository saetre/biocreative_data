It has been shown that the ectopic expression of Dpl in the brains of some lines of PrP-knockout mice provokes cerebellar ataxia, which can be rescued by the reintroduction of the PrP gene, suggesting a functional interaction between the two proteins. It is, however, still unclear where, and under which conditions, this event may occur. In the present study we addressed this issue by analysing the intracellular localization and the interaction between Dpl and PrP<sup>C</sup> in FRT (Fischer rat thyroid) cells stably expressing the two proteins separately or together. We show that both proteins localize prevalently on the basolateral surface of FRT cells, in both singly and doubly transfected clones. Interestingly we found that they associate with DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes) or lipid rafts, from where they can be co-immunoprecipitated in a cholesterol-dependent fashion. Although the interaction between Dpl and PrP<sup>C</sup> has been suggested before, our results provide the first clear evidence that this interaction occurs in rafts and is dependent on the integrity of these membrane microdomains. Furthermore, both Dpl and PrP<sup>C</sup> could be immunoprecipitated with flotillin-2, a raft protein involved in endocytosis and cell signalling events, suggesting that they share the same lipid environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>doppel (Dpl)</kwd><kwd>epithelial cell</kwd><kwd>lipid raft</kwd><kwd>prion protein (PrP)</kwd><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>CNS, central nervous system</kwd><kwd>CNX, calnexin</kwd><kwd>Dpl, doppel</kwd><kwd>DRM, detergent-resistant membrane</kwd><kwd>EEA1, early endosome antigen 1</kwd><kwd>endo H, endoglycosidase H</kwd><kwd>ER, endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>FBS, fetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>FRT, Fischer rat thyroid</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol</kwd><kwd>HRP, horseradish peroxidase</kwd><kwd>hu, human</kwd><kwd>MDCK, Medin&#x02013;Darby canine kidney</kwd><kwd>MEV, mevinolin</kwd><kwd>M&#x003b2;CD, methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin</kwd><kwd>mo, murine</kwd><kwd>PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F</kwd><kwd>PrP<sup>C</sup>, cellular prion protein</kwd><kwd>PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, scrapie prion protein</kwd><kwd>TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine &#x003b2;-isothiocyanate</kwd><kwd>TSE, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The PrP<sup>C</sup> (cellular prion protein) is a cell-surface glycoprotein of unknown function expressed in mammalian tissues, particularly in the CNS (central nervous system) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PrP<sup>C</sup> can be misfolded into the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (scrapie prion protein) isoform, which is the essential component of the prion agent causing TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathie) or prion diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Whereas some lines of PrP-knockout mice display a normal phenotype, the <italic>Ngsk, Zurich II</italic> and <italic>Rcm0</italic> lines of PrP-knockout mice develop a late-onset ataxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This phenotype was not associated with the absence of PrP<sup>C</sup>, but rather with the ectopic brain expression of a PrP<sup>C</sup> paralogue, named doppel (Dpl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Dpl is present in the CNS during embryogenesis and in the early post-natal life, whereas in adults it is expressed at high levels mainly in the testis, where it plays a key role in spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Dpl is composed of 179 amino acids encoded by the <italic>Prnd</italic> [prion protein 2 (dublet)] gene, located approx. 20&#x000a0;kb downstream of the PrP gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is homologous with the structured C-terminal end of PrP<sup>C</sup>, but lacks both the octa-repeat and the hydrophobic domains present in the flexible N-terminal tail of PrP<sup>C</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Examination of post-translational modifications of Dpl and PrP<sup>C</sup> have shown that the two proteins share several biochemical features: both have two N-linked oligosaccharide groups, are anchored to the external cell surface by a GPI (glycophosphatidylinositol) moiety and form intramolecular disulfide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the expression of Dpl, or of some PrP-deletion mutants closely resembling Dpl, in transgenic PrP-knockout mice causes cerebellar degeneration that is antagonized by wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup>. This has led to the suggestion that the two proteins may functionally interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. More specifically, it has been proposed that Dpl competes for a putative PrP<sup>C</sup> ligand that is necessary to transduce a cell survival signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or that PrP<sup>C</sup> could block a neurotoxic signal induced by Dpl by competing for its binding to a third molecule, &#x003b1;-2-macroglobulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Contrasting results on the putative interaction of Dpl with PrP<sup>C</sup> have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Indeed, whereas in neuronal cells the results support an interaction between the two proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], in testis such an interaction was not found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, and differently from the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in cells of neuronal origin both proteins seem to share common membrane microdomains and internalization pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Specifically in neuroblastoma cells PrP<sup>C</sup> and Dpl were shown to associate, independently from each other, to membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, known as DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes) or lipid rafts. DRMs are thought to modulate several cellular events, such as polarized sorting of lipids and proteins, signal transduction and endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and could also be the site of PrP<sup>C</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Intriguingly, Uelhoff et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] have shown that the co-expression of Dpl with PrP<sup>C</sup> in polarized MDCK (Madin&#x02013;Darby canine kidney) cells prevented the basolateral sorting of PrP<sup>C</sup>, which was sorted to the apical membrane together with Dpl. Although a direct interaction between the two proteins was not demonstrated, the authors hypothesized that the apical mis-sorting of PrP<sup>C</sup> could be caused by the capacity of Dpl to interact with PrP<sup>C</sup>, masking the basolateral sorting signal possibly present on this protein, but absent in Dpl.</p><p>Having characterized previously the intracellular trafficking and raft association of PrP<sup>C</sup> in FRT (Fischer rat thyroid) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we set out to investigate the behaviour of Dpl either transfected alone or together with PrP<sup>C</sup> in this cell line. We focussed our attention on their trafficking and possible physical and/or functional interaction. In the present study we report that, in contrast with MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], both proteins localize prevalently on the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane and in the Golgi complex of FRT cells and associate with DRMs. Interestingly we demonstrate that, when expressed together, Dpl and PrP<sup>C</sup> co-immunoprecipitate in DRMs and that this interaction is impaired by cholesterol depletion. In addition we found that each protein immunoprecipitates with flotillin-2, a scaffold protein involved in both endocytosis and signalling in rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], both independently and together.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>The following reagents were used: cell culture reagents from Euroclone; Protein A&#x02013;Sepharose from GE Healthcare; Lysotracker Red DND-99 from Molecular Probes; biotin and HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated streptavidin from Pierce Chemicals; FBS (fetal bovine serum) from Hyclone; and M&#x003b2;CD (methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin) and MEV (mevinolin), as well as all the other reagents, from Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich.

Alternatively, we transfected FRT clones, stably expressing moPrP<sup>C</sup> and carrying the resistance to zeocin, with a plasmid coding for huDpl, and carrying neomycin resistance. The two different genes were under the control of the strong cytomegalovirus promoter.

As the glycosylation of proteins has important implications for their trafficking, function and for their interaction with other partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], we characterized the glycosylation pattern of PrP<sup>C</sup> and GFP&#x02013;Dpl in FRT cells. After immunoprecipitating the proteins (using antibodies against PrP<sup>C</sup> or GFP), cell lysates were digested with three different de-glycosylating enzymes, namely PNGase F, endo H and sialidase. We found that, differently from PrP<sup>C</sup>, which was digested by PNGase F and sialidase, but not by endo H, GFP&#x02013;Dpl was partially sensitive to all of the tested enzymes both in doubly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) and singly (results not shown) transfected cells. The sensitivity of Dpl to endo H suggests that the protein could be in part retained in the ER and/or in the <italic>cis</italic>-medial Golgi, as modifications of oligosaccharides that render proteins resistant to the enzyme take place later in the secretory pathway (i.e. in medial- or <italic>trans</italic>-compartments of the Golgi network). Immunofluorescence experiments using specific antibodies against ER- or Golgi-resident proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) indicated that GFP&#x02013;Dpl does not reside in the ER. However, because we followed the fluorescence of GFP, it was necessary to discount the possibility that GFP failed to fluoresce properly in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We thus performed double immunofluorescence experiments, using an antibody against Dpl together with an antibody against the ER marker CNX or an antibody against p58K, which labels the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi compartment.

The discrepancy between the two cell lines could be explained by the fact that FRT and MDCK cells differ in the polarized sorting of GPI-anchored proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]; Dpl therefore represents another model GPI protein which has an opposite localization in the two cell lines.</p><p>As glycans are important modifiers of the behaviour of secretory proteins, we also analysed the glycoforms of Dpl expressed alone (results not shown) or together with PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Intriguingly, and differently from PrP<sup>C</sup>, the unglycosylated band of Dpl could be detected only upon digestion with PNGase F, suggesting that the attachment of glycans to this protein occurs very efficiently in FRT cells. Alternatively the degradation process of unglycosylated Dpl might be very efficient in our model cell system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Another distinct feature of Dpl is that it displayed a partial sensitivity to digestion by endo H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>D). Accordingly, we found that Dpl (most probably its monoglycosylated form) was partially retained in the <italic>cis</italic>- to medial-Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). In addition we found Dpl was also sensitive to endo H digestion in MDCK cells both when expressed alone (results not shown) or together with PrP<sup>C</sup> (Supplementary Figure S1C) suggesting that differences between the two cell lines in the polarized sorting of Dpl, and the mis-sorting of PrP<sup>C</sup>, are not regulated by endo H-sensitive glycan modification. Thus, despite the homologous glycosylation sites, a diverse sugar remodelling might occur for the two proteins and this may be linked to their different function and/or to their different susceptibility to conformation transition, which is typical of PrP<sup>C</sup>, but not of Dpl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>As both proteins have been found associated with DRMs in different cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we next analysed their raft association in singly and doubly transfected FRT clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>E). Whereas the association of Dpl with DRMs remained approximately the same in the two clones (65&#x000b1;5.3 and 62&#x000b1;2.4%), the amount of PrP<sup>C</sup> floating to the DRM-rich fractions in the doubly transfected cells was lower compared with the singly transfected ones (36&#x000b1;1.8 and 60&#x000b1;2.1% respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, in cells expressing both PrP<sup>C</sup> and Dpl, cholesterol depletion was not able to induce the dissociation of the two proteins from DRMs (from 62&#x000b1;2.4 to 60&#x000b1;1.5% for GFP&#x02013;Dpl and from 36&#x000b1;1.8 to 33&#x000b1;1.5% for PrP<sup>C</sup>), which was observed in singly expressing clones (from 65&#x000b1;5.3 to 35&#x000b1;2.4% of GFP&#x02013;Dpl and from 60&#x000b1;2.1 to 30&#x000b1;1.3% of PrP<sup>C</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We speculate that the expression of Dpl could modulate the capacity of PrP<sup>C</sup> to associate with lipid rafts inducing it to move to a less-ordered lipid microenvironment. Nevertheless, we show that the two proteins co-immunoprecipitate exclusively from DRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, the integrity of these domains appeared to be essential for the interaction of the two proteins, as demonstrated by the reduction in the co-immunoprecipitated protein levels after cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>A and B). Although the interaction between PrP<sup>C</sup> and Dpl has been suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], our results provide the first clear evidence that this interaction occurs in specific membrane microdomains (rafts) and is dependent on cholesterol. Our results are consistent with the finding that in neuronal cells the two proteins were found to reside in the same membrane microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and with the fact that in testis, where the two proteins do not co-immunoprecipitate, they reside in different membrane environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The demonstration that PrP<sup>C</sup> and Dpl interact in rafts could be of importance, considering the relevance of membrane microdomains in the pathogenesis of prion and other neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The association of these proteins to different or the same rafts could account for their different function in different tissues, supporting the hypothesis that PrP<sup>C</sup>, when interacting with Dpl in rafts of neurons, is able to block its toxicity. Finally, on the basis of co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we show in the present study that PrP<sup>C</sup> and Dpl form a complex with flotillin-2 in singly and doubly transfected clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This finding is quite interesting considering that interaction with flotillins has been suggested to have a role in the physiological function of PrP<sup>C</sup>; it can lead to activation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 upon PrP<sup>C</sup> capping in T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and can trigger the formation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent PrP<sup>C</sup>-mediated cell adhesions in S2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Moreover, on one hand flotillin-1, which forms a heterocomplex with flotillin-2 in N2a cells, has been reported to interact with neuroglobin, a protein involved in neuroprotective pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and on the other hand flotillin levels are increased in Alzheimers-disease-affected brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Interestingly PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was shown to accumulate in flotillin-1-positive vesicles in infected GT1-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], suggesting a possible involvement of these raft proteins in neurotoxic processes. Thus considering the antagonistic behaviour of Dpl and PrP<sup>C</sup> regarding the onset of neurodegeneration, it will be interesting to investigate further whether and how this mutual or exclusive interaction with flotillin is involved in the signalling function of both proteins and/or in the pathways leading to neurodegeneration. Indeed it is tempting to speculate that during embryogenesis, when both proteins are present, PrP<sup>C</sup> and Dpl together transduce a beneficial signal through a complex containing flotillin-2. Accordingly, one could hypothesize that the complex gets disrupted, and/or malfunctions, if Dpl does not interact with PrP<sup>C</sup> (i.e. in the absence of PrP<sup>C</sup>) thus reversing the beneficial effect of a neuroprotective signal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4250341add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Chiara Zurzolo conceived and co-ordinated the project, wrote the manuscript and helped with the experimental planning and analysis of results.
