The purpose of this work was to study possible interactions between corepressors human SIN3B (hSIN3B) and the ETO homologues &#x02013; ETO (eight twenty-one), MTG16 (myeloid-transforming gene 16) and MTGR1 (MTG-related protein 1).

Furthermore, nuclear extract of primary placental cells showed complexes between hSIN3B and ETO. The interaction between hSIN3B and ETO required an intact amino-terminus of ETO and the NHR2 domain. A nucleolar localization of hSIN3B and all the ETO homologues was demonstrated upon overexpression in COS-7 cells, and confirmed for the endogeneously expressed proteins in K562 cells. However, hSIN3B did not colocalize or interact with the leukemia-associated AML1 -ETO.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data from protein-protein interactions and immunolocalization experiments support that hSIN3B is a potential member of a corepressor complex involving selective ETO homologues.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Genes are regulated by sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors and interacting partner proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These physically interacting partners form complexes that are responsible for chromatin modifications. The SWI-Independent (SIN3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (also called SDI1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] corepressor serves as an essential scaffold for several proteins. By recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), it forms a deacetylase complex which generally catalyzes the silencing of the promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. SIN3 can either interact directly with transcription factors or indirectly through adapter molecules like NCoR (the nuclear receptor corepressor) and/or SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor). The SIN3 homologues have four evolutionarily conserved paired amphipathic helix (PAH) regions, a histone deacetylase interaction domain (HID) and a highly conserved region (HCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. An increasing number of nuclear proteins have been observed to interact with SIN3 in a flexible manner. As a result, SIN3 can both suppress and activate gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The SIN3 family consists of SIN3A and SIN3B, which are highly homologous. Human SIN3B (hSIN3B) contains 1,130 amino acids, which share 90% identity with murine SIN3B (mSIN3B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Interactions between murine SIN3A (mSIN3A) and corepressor proteins such as the ETO homologues have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The ETO homologues include the transcriptional corepressors ETO (or MTG8), MTG16 and MTGR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. mSIN3A has been shown to associate with ETO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but not with ETO-2, the murine homologue of MTG16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Endogenously, ETO is known to associate with mSIN3A, N-CoR and HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, interaction studies between hSIN3B and the ETO homologues have not yet been reported.</p><p>The ETO homologues are evolutionarily related to the Drosophila protein Nervy, sharing four conserved regions: Nervy homology regions (NHR) 1&#x02013;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. NHR2 and the flanking regions to NHR2 are required for the interaction of ETO with mSIN3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The ETO homologues do not bind directly to DNA but rather repress transcription indirectly by binding to nuclear corepressor proteins such as NCoR, SMRT and mSIN3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Obviously, mSIN3A is part of a corepressor complex that can include ETO as one element. In the present work, we investigated whether hSIN3B can also bind to the ETO homologues.</p><p>Both ETO and MTG16 are known to carry out transcriptional repression as components of chimeric proteins generated by chromosomal translocations in certain subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The t(8;21) gives rise to the AML1-ETO fusion gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and the t(16;21) gives rise to the AML1-MTG16 fusion gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The leukemia fusion proteins can recruit corepressors and HDACs, leading to dysregulated transcriptional repression that is responsible for a block in cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. AML1-ETO retains the DNA-binding region of AML1, but the transactivation domain is deleted. However, the ETO partner of AML1-ETO retains the conserved regions NHR1-4, allowing interactions with corepressors. AML1-ETO has been shown to interact with mSIN3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Additional studies of the interactions between different isoforms of SIN3 and their partners in the transcriptional deacetylase complex may provide new knowledge about gene regulation. Therefore, in the current study we examined the interactions of hSIN3B with the ETO homologues as well as with AML1-ETO. Our results demonstrate formation of complexes between hSIN3B and selective ETO homologues both upon ectopic coexpression in COS-7 cells and, more importantly, endogeneously in primary placenta cells and the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line. Furthermore, immunolocalization studies showed that hSIN3B and ETO homologues colocalized to the nucleolus. Our results suggest that hSIN3B is a member of a corepressor complex involving specific ETO homologues.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tissue and cell line expression of hSIN3B and the ETO homologues</title><p>First, an attempt was made to determine the general expression of hSIN3B by investigating several tissues. Results from RT-PCR showed hSIN3B mRNA to be expressed in all tissues and cell lines examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Because the transcript levels reach saturation during RT-PCR, the results may not reflect the true number of transcripts. Therefore, we also carried out real-time PCR, which showed that hSIN3B and ETO homologues are ubiquitously expressed with a variable number of transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;E</xref>). The highest expression of hSIN3B was found in thymus, placenta, pancreas, brain, heart and lung. In general, these tissues also had the highest expression of the ETO homologues confirming earlier results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, liver and muscle showed the lowest transcript levels for both hSIN3B and the ETO homologues. The other tissues showed no covariation between hSIN3B and ETO homologues.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Tissue expression of hSIN3B and the ETO homologues</bold>.

SIN3 proteins are large and thus suitable for cooperation with multiple nuclear partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For these reasons, we investigated possible interactions between hSIN3B and ETO homologues. To determine this, transient transfections were carried out in COS-7 cells followed by IP-Western analyses. Control experiments showed that none of the antibodies used in these experiments (&#x003b1;-ETO, &#x003b1;-MTGR1, &#x003b1;-MTG16 and &#x003b1;-SIN3B) bound non-specifically (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Three independent experiments were performed and typical data is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. IP was performed with &#x003b1;-ETO and Western blotting with &#x003b1;-hSIN3B on extracts from cells co-expressing hSIN3B and ETO. As a result, a protein of approximately 135 kDa was pulled down, corresponding to the size of hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 2). Thus, ETO co-precipitated hSIN3B. The reciprocal IP-Western experiment demonstrated that hSIN3B co-precipitated ETO as a 75 kDa protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 5) further strengthening the conclusion that hSIN3B and ETO can form a complex. As hSIN3B interacted with ETO, we also investigated whether hSIN3B can interact with the chimeric oncoprotein AML1-ETO. However, hSIN3B was not co-precipitated by AML1-ETO and in the reverse experiment AML1-ETO was not co-precipitated by hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lanes 2 and 5) indicating a lack of interaction. An interaction was also shown between hSIN3B and MTG16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), but not between hSIN3B and the ETO homologue MTGR1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>hSIN3B interacts with ETO homologues, but not with AML1-ETO</bold>. COS-7 cells were transfected with ETO (E), MTGR1 (R), MTG16 (16) or AML1-ETO (AE) in combination with hSIN3B (S). Cell lysates were analyzed by IP-Western, as described in Materials and Methods. IP and Western were performed with &#x003b1;-E (ETO specific), &#x003b1;-R (MTGR1 specific), &#x003b1;-16 (MTG16 specific) and &#x003b1;-S (hSIN3B specific). (<bold>A-C</bold>) ETO and MTG16 co-precipitated hSIN3B (lane 2 of A and C). Reciprocal experiments showed that hSIN3B co-precipitated ETO and MTG16 (lane 5 of A; lane 6 of C).

Three independent experiments were performed by expression in COS-7 cells and typical data is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. hSIN3B pulled down ETO-V5 and MTG16-V5 but not MTGR1-V5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In the reverse experiment ETO-V5 and MTG16-V5 but not MTGR1-V5 pulled hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), Thus, the results confirmed the specificity of interaction between SIN3B and ETO homologues; SIN3B interacted with ETO and MTG16 but not with MTGR1. From the present results, we conclude that hSIN3B can form stable interactions with selective ETO homologues, but not with AML1-ETO.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>hSIN3B interacts with V5-tagged ETO homologues</bold>.

However, a repressor activity of the ETO homologue constructs might have lowered the signals making it difficult to differentiate between interaction of the molecules in this system (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The ETO domain NHR2 and the amino-terminus are required for interaction with hSIN3B</title><p>Of the four evolutionary conserved regions (NHRs) of ETO homologues, a region spanning from NHR2 to NHR4 has been described to associate with corepressors such as SIN3A, N-CoR and SMRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Similarly, we wanted to identify the regions of ETO involved in the interaction with hSIN3B. For this we used ETO mutants lacking individual NHRs in cotransfection experiments in COS-7 cells. Three independent experiments were performed and typical results are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Immunoprecipitation was performed with &#x003b1;-SIN3B followed by Western blotting with &#x003b1;-ETO. Deletion of NHR2 abrogated co-precipitation of the ETO mutants by hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 3). In contrast, deletion of NHR1, NHR3 or NHR4 did not interfere with the formation of complexes with hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 2, 4 and 5). The expression of hSIN3B was confirmed by performing IP-Western with &#x003b1;-hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5), while the expression of ETO mutants was confirmed by Western blotting with &#x003b1;-ETO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>NHR2 and amino terminal domain of ETO are involved in interaction with hSIN3B</bold>.

Therefore, it was important to determine whether these are important for the interaction with hSIN3B. Deletion of these amino acids from the amino terminal region of ETO abrogated co-precipitation by hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, left panel, lane 4). The reciprocal experiment showed that this mutant did not co-precipitate hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, right panel, lane 5). Full length ETO was used a control to show normal interaction between hSIN3B and ETO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, right panel, lane 1 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, left panel, lane 2). Importantly, as evident from our previous result (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), AML1-ETO was unable to bind to hSIN3B. Our data indicate that both the amino-terminal part and NHR2 of ETO are required for the interaction with hSIN3B.</p></sec><sec><title>Endogeneous hSIN3B co-immunoprecipitates ETO</title><p>The previous conclusions on interactions between hSIN3B and ETO homologues are based on data from overexpression in COS-7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, it was important to confirm the interactions between endogeneous proteins. For this purpose cells from the central villous part of the placenta were isolated. Results from Western blotting showed that hSIN3B and all the ETO homologues are present in the placental cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). To investigate whether ETO homologues were present in hSIN3B associated nuclear complexes, we immunoprecipitated nuclear placental cell extracts with &#x003b1;-SIN3B and performed Western blotting using ETO homologue specific antibodies. The reverse experiment was also carried out. The results show that ETO pulled down a protein of approximately 135 kDa, corresponding to hSIN3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, lane 2), and in the reverse experiment hSIN3B pulled down a protein of approximately 75 kDa, corresponding to ETO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, lane 4). However, no co-immunoprecipitation was observed between hSIN3B and MTGR1 or MTG16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, lanes 6 and 8) though input data confirm the presence of MTGR1 and MTG16 in IP lysates. We were not able to show input of hSIN3B protein because of a low protein level in the lysate.

(3) In primary placenta cells, hSIN3B was found to interact with ETO but not with MTG16 or MTGR1. (4) A nucleolar localization of hSIN3B and ETO homologues was observed both for overexpressed proteins in COS-7 cells and endogenous proteins in the K562 leukemia cell line.

Our data show that NHR2 is required for an interaction between hSIN3B and ETO. Beyond this, our results also show a role for the amino-terminal part of ETO for an interaction with hSIN3B.

Previous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and present studies show lack of targeting of AML1-ETO to the nucleolus. This is in contrast to the nucleolar targeting of ETO. Furthermore, upon coexpression with hSIN3B, AML1-ETO and ETO showed separate nuclear localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). Therefore our data suggest that AML1-ETO is not a part of a possible hSIN3B-associated complex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our data indicate that hSIN3B is a potential member of a core repressor complex involving the ETO homologues. The NHR2 domain of ETO and its flanking regions are involved in making contact with the corepressor mSIN3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and our data suggests that NHR2 and the amino-terminus of ETO are required for contact with hSIN3B. This difference may be attributed to the difference in the structure of the PAH2 domain of SIN3 homologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. We speculate that a corepressor complex involving ETO homologues may contain either SIN3A or SIN3B. It is unlikely that both SIN3A and SIN3B are part of the same complex involving ETO homologues. Previous studies have shown that ETO pulls down a complex of about 600 kDa that contains mSIN3A, NCoR and HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A nucleolar repressor complex of this limited size is unlikely to be able to hold both SIN3A and SIN3B, as both are large proteins. We propose a model in which a corepressor complex contains either hSIN3A or hSIN3B, but not both. The ETO homologues of this complex may be interchangeable. Finally, the finding of hSIN3B as an interacting partner for specific ETO homologues in the nucleolus suggests an epigenetic control of nucleolar transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reverse transcription PCR</title><p>The expression of hSIN3B in various human tissues and cell lines was determined by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).
