STAT5A and STAT5B (STAT5), the most promiscuous members of this family, are highly expressed in specific populations of hypothalamic neurons in regions known to mediate the actions of cytokines in the regulation of energy balance. To test the hypothesis that STAT5 signaling is essential to energy homeostasis, we used Cre-mediated recombination to delete the <italic>Stat5</italic> locus in the CNS. Mutant males and females developed severe obesity with hyperphagia, impaired thermal regulation in response to cold, hyperleptinemia and insulin resistance. Furthermore, central administration of GM-CSF mediated the nuclear accumulation of STAT5 in hypothalamic neurons and reduced food intake in control but not in mutant mice. These results demonstrate that STAT5 mediates energy homeostasis in response to endogenous cytokines such as GM-CSF.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The central nervous system modulates feeding and energy expenditure to maintain energy balance and metabolism within a precise homeostatic window. Many of the neural circuits that underlie this regulation lie within the hypothalamus, where basomedial &#x0201c;satiety&#x0201d; centers, including the arcuate nucleus (Arc), relay homeostatic information to regions that regulate satiety and energy expenditure, such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) and brainstem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Elmquist1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) conversely mediates a variety of appetite-promoting signals. Cytokines mediate many of the physiologic cues that activate neuronal signaling in these regions to regulate energy balance. Notably, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), the adipocytokine leptin, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-6 regulate food intake and body weight via the activation of endogenous hypothalamic cytokine receptors that mediate signaling via the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. Mouse genetics has demonstrated that STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Bates1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Gao1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Ghilardi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Xu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> is essential for the regulation of energy balance in response to leptin and other endogenous cytokines. Similarly, neural SOCS3, an inhibitor of JAK2 and a variety of STATs, blocks signaling by several cytokines and thereby increases feeding and body weight by attenuating cytokine signaling in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Mori1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Reducing leptin signaling stimulates food intake and weight gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Friedman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Like leptin, central administration of the proinflammatory cytokine GM-CSF suppresses food intake and GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are heavier and more obese than control mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Reed1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike leptin and CNTF, which activate STAT3 more robustly than STAT5A/B (STAT5), GM-CSF preferentially activates STAT5.

Based on the knowledge that STAT5 and the GM-CSF receptor are present in hypothalamic neurons, we asked whether STAT5 contributes to the regulation of energy homeostasis and whether the action of GM-CSF on the regulation of energy balance depends on its ability to increase STAT5 activity in the CNS.

In a well-characterized neural circuit in the ARC, leptin activates anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) neurons that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and inhibits the orexigenic (appetite-promoting) neurons that co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related protein (AgRP).

LHA OX neurons promote wakefulness and activity, and alteration of their function could underlie part of the decreased metabolism of the <italic>Stat5<sup>fl/fl; Nestin-Cre</sup></italic> mice, although it is unlikely to account for the entire phenotype of these animals. We do not propose that STAT5 or GM-CSF constitute the only regulators of LHA OX neurons, nor do we suggest that OX is the only mediator of the metabolic action of Stat5. Indeed, the normalization of OX expression in the <italic>Stat5<sup>fl/fl; Nestin-Cre</sup></italic> mice by GM-CSF treatment suggests that alterations in OX expression do not underlie the defects in GM-CSF action in the <italic>Stat5<sup>fl/fl; Nestin-Cre</sup></italic> mice. Rather it is likely that STAT5 controls a multitude of genes involved in food intake and energy expenditure in the metabolically-important LHA OX neurons and elsewhere, and that the regulation of OX by STAT5 represents a single example of this.</p><p>STAT5 is also expressed and activated by cytokines in somatostatin neurons of the periventricular nucleus and dopamine neurons of the arcuate nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001639-Bennett1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

We furthermore demonstrate that STAT5 is critical to the anorexic response to GM-CSF, a known regulator of energy homeostasis.

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent. For determination of relative RNA concentration, total RNA was subjected to automated fluorescent RT-PCR on an ABI 7700. GAPDH control, STAT5A, STAT5B, orexin and SOCS3 primers and probes were also supplied by ABI. POMC, AgRP and NPY primers and probes were as previously described (1). Each predicted RT-PCR product spanned an intron/exon junction.

Serum FA and triglyceride levels were analyzed in fed mice using a commercial FA kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and the GPO-Trinder kit (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), respectively. Insulin and glucose tolerance test were performed in fasted animals after i.p. injections of either insulin (0.75U/kg body weight) or glucose (2 g/kg body weight). Blood glucose values were measured immediately before and 15, 30 and 60 min after insulin injection, and before and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection.

The same experiment was repeated twice with the same set of mice at the same age. Metabolic rate was measured in fed mice 6 month of age by indirect calorimetry using the Oxymax system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Data were collected for 24 h at room temperature (23&#x000b0;C) and for 24 h at thermoneutral temperature (30&#x000b0;C).

Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of avertin (0.2 ml/g). Scalp fur was shaved and mice were placed in a stereotaxic device (Kopf Instruments; Tajunga, CA) with lambda and bregma at the same vertical coordinate. Coordinates for cannula placement were 0.825 mm posterior to bregma and on the midline. A small skull window was outlined with a fine dremel bit and removed with forceps; the sagittal sinus was displaced laterally prior to lowering a 26-gauge stainless steel cannula (Plastics One; Roanoke, VA) such that the cannula tip was 4.8 mm below bregma. Dental acrylic was used to secure the cannula to the skull. Cannulas were sealed with fitted obturators from the same vendor. Cannula placement was verified after the mice had regained presurgical body weight by measuring food intake in response to an i3vt (intra-third ventricular) injection of NPY. Food was removed for 2hr in the middle of the light phase, and at the end of that interval, 1&#x003bc;l NPY &#x0005b;5&#x003bc;g/1&#x003bc;l&#x0005d; was injected.

Mice were weighed and assigned to weight-matched groups, and food was removed from cages at about 5 hr prior to onset of dark. GM-CSF or vehicle was drawn up in microinjectors and PE50 tubing (Plastics One; Roanoke, VA) fitted to Hamilton syringes and 1&#x003bc;l was injected at about 4hr prior to the onset of dark. Food hoppers were weighed and placed in cages just prior to onset of the dark, and food intake was measured 4 hrs later. Mice were allowed to rest for 1 week with ad libitum chow access. The groups were then reversed, and mice received a second i3vt injection of the alternate treatment, with food intake and body weight monitored at 4 hrs as in the first trial. Mice consuming at least 1 g of food within 4 hrs were included in the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001639.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Body weight of 20 week-old <italic>Stat5<sup>fl/fl; ObRb-Cre</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Stat5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> littermate controls.</p><p>(5.69 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001639.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001639.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Wholemount analysis of mammary glands from 24 week-old female mice.
