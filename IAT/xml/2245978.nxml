Fifteen percent of CRC are hereditary, whereas the other 85% are considered as being sporadic. CRC development involves multiple genetic events like genetic mutations and aberrant gene expression that have been well documented by Vogelstein and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These authors proposed a multistep model leading to colorectal tumorigenesis. One of the first genetic mutations in CRC development is a mutation in the APC/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, resulting in adenoma formation. Then, a mutation in another growth pathway, either Ki-Ras/BRAF, Smad4/TGF&#x003b2;, PI3K, or TP53/BAX occurs when the adenoma becomes larger, leading to carcinoma. Besides this well-characterized model, it appears that a large number of genes (mainly identified by microarray) could present an altered expression pattern and may play a role in initiation, progression, and drug response of CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>CRC primary treatment is surgery but the risk of recurrence due to undetected micrometastases is high. To reduce this risk, chemotherapy can be administrated after removal of the primary tumor in the advanced stages. Combination of the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid with the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan and/or the platinum compound oxaliplatin appears to be the most effective treatment, with a response rate between 40 and 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recently, new biological therapeutic agents like the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and bevacizumab have emerged and improved the clinical outcome of patients with colorectal metastatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, since 50% of patients are still not responsive to chemotherapy because of drug resistance, prediction of patient response and development of alternative treatments is of prime importance in the CRC field. Using genome-wide transcriptional analysis, several authors have identified new predictive markers and therapeutic targets implicated in the development and drug response of colon carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The phosphoserine aminotransferase PSAT1 is an enzyme implicated in serine biosynthesis and has been linked with cell proliferation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Two studies reported that PSAT1 mRNA is overexpressed in colon adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and increases with tumor stage in colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was also shown that high PSAT1 mRNA levels in breast cancer are associated with a poor clinical response to endocrine therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These studies showed that there is a clear rational for studying PSAT1 as a pro-proliferative and pro-survival factor in the context of colon cancer.</p><p>This report addresses the role of the phosphoserine aminotransferase PSAT1 in CRC. We first observed that PSAT1 was overexpressed in tumor samples from CRC patients, and that its level of overexpression after chemotherapy is correlated with poor regression of the tumour metastases. Then, we demonstrated that PSAT1 ectopic expression promoted cell growth and made the cells more resistant to oxaliplatin treatment. Overall, the data presented here identify PSAT1 as a potential new therapeutic target in CRC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PSAT1 is overexpressed in colorectal tumor samples</title><p>To investigate the role of PSAT1 in colorectal cancer, we first analyzed the PSAT1 mRNA expression in tumors from 29 patients with advanced colorectal cancer. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> are shown the expression levels of PSAT1 measured both by Affymetrix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and Q-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) experiments in 23 colon tumors (TC), 22 hepatic metastases (HM) and 17 normal mucosas (NC). Using both methods, we found that the phosphoserine aminotransferase PSAT1, was significantly overexpressed in tumors (NC <italic>vs </italic>TC, p &#x0003c; 0.0001 and NC <italic>vs </italic>HM, p &#x0003c; 0.0001). The fold change was less important when measured by Q-PCR than by microarray (3.0 compared to 7.9 for TC/NC and 2.9 compared to 7.2 for HM/NC). This can be explained by the difference in sensitivity of each technique or by the variation of the microarray data which were performed only once for each sample, whereas the Q-PCR measurements were done in triplicates.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>PSAT1 mRNA expression level and clinical correlation between PSAT1 mRNA expression level and tumoral regression</bold>.

PSAT1 was expressed in all the colon cancer cells tested, with the lowest expression level found in normal colon.</p></sec><sec><title>Increase of PSAT1 expression after chemotherapy is linked with tumor progression in CRC patients</title><p>To determine whether the high PSAT1 mRNA levels is associated with clinical response, we explored the correlation between PSAT1 expression levels and tumor regression after chemotherapy. Microarray and RT-Q-PCR analyses were performed with mRNA extracted from hepatic metastases from four patients with metastatic colon cancer before and after FOLFIRI treatment (leucovorin, 5-FU and irinotecan). We defined the percentage of regression for each patient on the basis of anatomic indicators (tumor lesions) according to WHO criteria. Among the four patients, one was highly sensitive to FOLFIRI, with a tumoral regression close to 85%; two were partially sensitive, with tumoral regression ranging from 65% to 25%; and one was considered as resistant, with no measurable tumoral regression. The PSAT1 expression ratio (ratio of the mRNA level in hepatic metastases after to before FOLFIRI treatment) for each patient has been calculated using Affymetrix microarrays (data not shown) and RT-Q-PCR values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). For the patient showing the best tumor regression (patient 4), the PSAT1 ratio was very low. For patients showing mild tumor regression (patients 2 and 3), the PSAT1 expression ratio increased, and this increase was greater when tumor regression was poor. Finally, the patient showing no tumor regression (patient 1) had a high PSAT1 ratio. This inverse correlation between clinical progression and the PSAT1 ratio in tumor specimens was obtained using both RNA quantification methods, Affymetrix microarrays (data not shown) and RT-Q-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This suggests that an increase in PSAT1 overexpression after chemotherapy may be correlated with a poor treatment response.</p></sec><sec><title>SW480-PSAT1 colon carcinoma cells present an advantage in proliferation and survival in low serum conditions</title><p>To determine the PSAT1 overexpression effect in human adenocarcinoma cells, we stably transfected PSAT1 in SW480 using the Flp-In System. In this system, the recipient cell line contains a single integrated Flp recombination site where the ectopically expressed gene can be inserted. This system produces isogenic cell lines in which all the transfected clones produce equivalent levels of the protein of interest, thereby eliminating the need to analyze multiple subclones. As a control, we used the SW480-FlpIn cell line, stably transfected with the empty vector to avoid the possibility of observing a phenotype caused only by an integration effect. PSAT1 was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-PSAT antibody. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows that PSAT1 was endogenously expressed in the control SW480-FlpIn cells with an apparent molecular weight of 40 000. In the stable SW480-PSAT1 clone, the ectopic PSAT1 protein displayed a higher molecular weight of 45 000. This higher molecular weight for the transfected protein is due to the presence of the C-terminal V5 tag in our construct. Two forms of human phosphoserine aminotransferase have been reported, PSAT1&#x003b1; and PSAT1&#x003b2;, encoding, respectively, a protein of 35 200 and 40 000. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows that the SW480-FlpIn and SW480-PSAT1 cells only expressed the PSAT1&#x003b2; form, which has been reported to be the physiologically functional enzyme.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of PSAT1 overexpression on cell proliferation and tumor xenograft</bold>.

The proliferation assay showed that SW480-PSAT1 grew faster than SW480-FlpIn in standard culture conditions (10% of FBS), with an average doubling time of 22.05 &#x000b1; 1.58 hours and 30.54 &#x000b1; 3.88 hours, respectively (data not shown). Thus, expression of PSAT1 in the SW480 cells conferred a proliferative advantage since the doubling time decreased by about eight hours. The same results were obtained in HEK293 epithelial kidney cells (data not shown), indicating that this effect is not cell line dependent. In low-serum medium (1% of FBS), proliferation of both cell lines decreased but SW480-PSAT1 grew still faster than SW480-FlpIn, with an average doubling time of 36.3 &#x000b1; 5.9 hours and 53.5 &#x000b1; 6.5 hours, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). SW480-PSAT1 growth rate in low-serum conditions is comparable with the SW480-FlpIn's in 10% FBS (36.3 hours compared to 30.54 hours, respectively) indicating that SW480-PSAT1 showed partial growth factor independence, which is a hallmark of malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>SW480-PSAT1 colon carcinoma cells present a high tumorigenic potential in tumor xenografts</title><p>To evaluate the tumorigenic potential of SW480-FlpIn and SW480-PSAT1, we compared the ability of both cell lines to give rise to subcutaneous tumors in nude mice.

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, the SW480-PSAT1 tumor grew much faster than the SW480-FlpIn tumor, indicating that colon cancer cells overexpressing PSAT1 proliferated faster <italic>in vivo</italic>, as was also the case <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, 18 days after cell inoculation, 86% of SW480-PSAT1 grafted mice developed a tumor whereas only 33% of SW480-FlpIn grafted mice developed one (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Moreover, even after 30 days only half of the mice developed a tumor when grafted with SW480-FlpIn whereas all the mice grafted with SW480-PSAT1 developed a tumor after only 22 days.</p></sec><sec><title>SW480 colon carcinoma cells overexpressing PSAT1 are more resistant to drug treatment</title><p>We further characterized the SW480-FlpIn and SW480-PSAT1 cell lines for their responses to chemotherapy. Both cell lines were treated with the three drugs commonly used in the treatment of colon cancer: 5-FU, SN38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), and oxaliplatin. The cells were exposed for 72 hours to increasing concentrations of each drug and their growth was measured using the sulforhodamine B assay. When treated with SN38, SW480-PSAT1 cells (IC50 = 10.3 &#x000b1; 0.57 nM) were only marginally more resistant (p = 0.05) than the control SW480-FlpIn (IC50 = 9 &#x000b1; 0.11 nM), indicating that PSAT1 is not playing a role in SN38 resistance (data not shown).

Twenty nM of SN38 during 72 hours induced a G2/M arrest with a high number of polyploid cells (up to 38%) for both cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Following a 10 &#x003bc;M treatment of 5-FU, both cell lines presented the same increase in the number of cells in the G2/M phase and a diminution in the G0/G1 and S phases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These data indicate that SN38 and 5-FU effect on the cell cycle did not depend on PSAT1 expression. Finally, 2 &#x003bc;M oxaliplatin induced a lost of the S phase coupled with an enrichment of the G2/M phase, and this phenotype was enhanced in SW480-PSAT1 cells compared with SW480-FlpIn cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Oxaliplatin induced appearance of polyploid cells in SW480-FlpIn (17%) but not in SW480-PSAT1 (4%). These data indicate that PSAT1 does not seem to be implicated in cell cycle changes after 5-FU and SN38 exposure but rather plays a role in oxaliplatin-induced cell cycle modifications.</p><p>Cells in the subG1 phase are representative of late apoptosis. SN38- (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and 5-FU- (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) induced apoptosis were comparable, with values for SW480-PSAT1 and SW480-FlpIn, respectively, of 7% and 4% for SN38 and 12% and 17% for 5-FU. On the contrary, oxaliplatin induced more apoptosis in SW480-FlpIn (10%) than in the PSAT1 overexpressing SW480 (3%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PSAT1 effect on oxaliplatin resistance is mediated by cell death inhibition</title><p>Both cell lines were then characterized for drug induced apoptosis by measurement of annexin V-positive and PI-negative cells, representing early apoptosis (compared with late apoptosis, quantified previously by counting the subG1 cells). Cells were treated for 72 hours with either 10 &#x003bc;M of 5-FU, 20 nM of SN38, or 2 &#x003bc;M of oxaliplatin. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, 5-FU and SN38 induced apoptosis did not vary between SW480-FlpIn and SW480-PSAT1 cell lines, in accordance with the results indicated above on cells in subG1. Combined with the cell cycle data, it appears that SW480-PSAT1 resistance to 5-FU is not due to apoptosis resistance or cell cycle modification but rather to a growth advantage or resistance to apoptosis-independent cell death. Concerning oxaliplatin, SW480-PSAT1 cells displayed less apoptosis (up to two times) than the mock transfected SW480-FlpIn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), and this may explain in part the resistant phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>PSAT1 overexpression effects on cell death after drug treatment</bold>.

SW480-FlpIn and SW480-PSAT1 cells were treated for 72 hours with 1 &#x003bc;M, 2 &#x003bc;M and 3 &#x003bc;M of oxaliplatin. Both cell lines displayed increased apoptosis as the oxaliplatin concentration increased, but SW480-PSAT1 showed for each dose a 50% reduction of the apoptotic response compared with SW480-FlpIn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). We next investigated the total number of dead cells in response to oxaliplatin treatment to determine if apoptosis was the only mechanism of cell death responsible for this drug toxicity. We counted the trypan blue-labeled dead cells in a cell population treated with oxaliplatin at 1 &#x003bc;M, 2 &#x003bc;M and 3 &#x003bc;M for 72 hours. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, cell death increased with the oxaliplatin concentration, and the SW480-PSAT1 population exhibited a smaller number of dead cells than the control SW480-FlpIn population, as was also the case when apoptosis was monitored (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In addition, the total number of dead cells was greater than the number of apoptotic cells, and the difference between the two cell lines was also higher than what we observed with apoptosis. This suggests that PSAT1 overexpression inhibited not only the apoptotic response but also another cell death mechanism induced by oxaliplatin treatment. Besides apoptosis, it appears that mitotic catastrophe, autophagy, and necrosis can participate in tumor cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], indicating that PSAT1 may play an inhibitory role in one of these biological processes. The observation that SW480-FlpIn cells treated with oxaliplatin displayed G2/M arrest and appearance of polyploid cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) prompted us to analyze the two phenomena in more detail.</p><p>To this end, SW480-FlpIn and SW480-PSAT1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of oxaliplatin (from 0 to 8 &#x003bc;M) during 48 hours, and the cell cycle was monitored by flow cytometry. The analysis presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> shows an increase in G2/M arrest with increasing concentrations of oxaliplatin in SW480-FlpIn and SW480-PSAT1 and polyploidy formation only in the SW480-FlpIn cells. The number of cells with a DNA content greater than 4N was much lower in SW480-PSAT1 (4% at 8 &#x003bc;M) than in SW480-FlpIn (22% at 8 &#x003bc;M). Furthermore, observation of cell morphology showed the appearance of huge multinucleated cells with unusual shapes consequent to oxaliplatin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These cells are similar to the multinucleate giant cells previously reported in curcumin-treated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Such a morphological feature along with appearance of high DNA content is compatible with death through mitotic catastrophe, a form of non-apoptotic cell death caused by aberrant mitosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Cell death resistance in response to oxaliplatin treatment</bold>.

The cells were exposed to oxaliplatin for 72 hours, then washed and resuspended in growth medium. We counted viable cells at the end of the oxaliplatin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, D0) and 3 days after drug removal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, D3). For oxaliplatin concentrations of 1 &#x003bc;M and 2 &#x003bc;M, SW480 mock transfected cells failed to recover from treatment, as suggested by the fact that the cell number at D3 was lower than the cell number at D0. This was not the case for the SW480-PSAT1 cells, which were able to grow between D0 and D3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). It must be noted that the drug concentrations used in this assay correspond to almost twice that of the IC50 determined by the sulforhodamine assay, namely, 0.54 &#x003bc;M for SW480-FlpIn and 0.81 &#x003bc;M for SW480-PSAT1, indicating that the difference between cell lines was not simply due to a difference in IC50 and may be called the "long-term drug resistance effect".

In this study, we observed that the phosphoserine aminotransferase PSAT1 is overexpressed in colon carcinoma compared with normal mucosa. Its overexpression enhances cell proliferation even under low serum condition indicating that PSAT1 may be implicated in cell survival under stress conditions. In addition, we showed that PSAT1 is implicated in drug resistance and, in particular, we demonstrated that the effect of PSAT1 on oxaliplatin resistance is due to cell death inhibition.</p><p>PSAT1 belongs to subgroup IV of aminotransferases and catalyses the conversion of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to l-phosphoserine. PSAT1 regulates the biosynthesis of serine from intermediates of the glycolytic pathway, and its activity is broadly distributed among the organs but is increased in tissues with a high rate of cell turnover. PSAT1 mRNA is expressed at high levels in the brain, liver, kidney, and pancreas; but at low levels in the thymus, prostate, testis, and colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Previously, two studies reported that phosphoserine aminotransferase is overexpressed in colon adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and increases with tumor stage in colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, Martens and colleagues reported that PSAT1 is overexpressed in some breast cancer samples and that this overexpression is associated with unfavorable clinical outcome in patients treated with the antiestrogen tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This last result combined with ours suggests that PSAT1 overexpression is connected to therapy resistance.</p><p>It has been reported that treatment of adenocarcinoma colon cells with SN-38, oxaliplatin or 5-FU induces G2/M cell cycle arrest, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and our data showed that this is also the case in PSAT1-overexpressing cells. However, in the case of oxaliplatin, cell cycle modifications were amplified by PSAT1 overexpression since, in the transfected cell line; more cells were blocked in G2/M phase. In addition, in oxaliplatin-treated SW480 cell cultures; there was an accumulation of large cells with a high DNA content, as seen by FACS analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. This phenotype is reminiscent of a cell death mechanism called mitotic catastrophe, which results from aberrant mitosis and leads to the formation of large nonviable cells with numerous micronuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To date, induction of mitotic catastrophes by oxaliplatin has not been reported, but the fact that oxaliplatin causes DNA strand breaks and G2/M arrest is in good agreement with previously described mechanisms that induce mitotic catastrophe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We propose that oxaliplatin induced cell death in SW480 cells is due to both apoptosis and mitotic catastrophes and that the resistance phenotype of the PSAT1 overexpressing cells results from a decrease in the induction of both mechanisms. This suggests that prevention of mitotic catastrophes could be a new mechanism for drug resistance in colon adenocarcinoma cells.</p><p>The study reported herein suggest that PSAT1 may be a gene whose expression pattern before and after treatment is associated with poor response to FOLFIRI in colorectal cancer patients. Our <italic>in vitro </italic>results indicating that PSAT1 overexpression impairs the effect of the chemotherapy fit well with these clinical data. We are aware that data on four clinical samples is not statistically significant and that this result must be confirmed on more samples. We are planning to collect such metastatic samples taken from the same patient before and after drug therapy, especially patients treated with FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-FU and oxaliplatin).</p><p>PSAT1 is implicated in catabolism, catalyzing the second step in the biosynthesis of the amino acid serine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The serine synthesis pathway provides the precursors for cellular proliferation as it is required for the synthesis of purine nucleotides. Knowing that PSAT1 is implicated in purine nucleotide synthesis, one drug that could overcome chemoresistance due to PSAT1 overexpression may be the antimetabolite purine antagonist mercaptopurine (thioguanine), which inhibits several enzymes in the purine synthesis pathway. This family of compounds is widely used for autoimmune disorder and for patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting to note that among all the amino acids, serine has an important role in cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This was demonstrated for the first time in 1956 when McCoy demonstrated that cells in culture grew better when serine and glycine were added to the culture medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, it was shown by Snell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] that 3PGHD activity (enzyme that catalyses the initiating step in serine biosynthesis) is increased in human colon carcinoma. These two reports along with our data indicate that the L-serine synthesis pathway may be important in colon tumor formation and growth and deserves further investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our results point to PSAT1 as a novel gene that stimulates colorectal cancer cells proliferation and modulates chemotherapy sensitivity, both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines, tissues and reagents</title><p>The tissues used in our study belong to a set of clinical specimen already described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Tumoral regression evaluation took into account measurements of the target lesions according to WHO recommendations for the evaluation of cancer treatment in solid tumors.

Stained cells were mounted in Moviol, and images were recorded using a 63XNA objective on a Leica inverted microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To compare PSAT1 RNA expression between the 3 different tissues (NC, TC and HM) the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Differences were considered significant when <italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.05. The Pearson's test was used to calculate the correlation coefficient.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NV performed the major part of experiments and drafted the manuscript.
