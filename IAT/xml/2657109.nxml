The tetraspanin family comprises 33 different members, among which the most studied are CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82 and CD151. These proteins have a role in the regulation of many biological processes such as cell-cell adhesion, fusion, signal transduction, proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The exact mechanism by which these proteins function is still poorly understood. Tetraspanins probably function in the form of complexes since they interact with each other and with different partners including transmembrane proteins such as adhesion molecules, receptors and intracellular signalling/cytoskeletal proteins, creating a network of interacting proteins called the tetraspanin web [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Their ability to also interact with cholesterol has led to the concept that tetraspanins might be organizers of specific lipid microdomains which are referred to as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Tetraspanins also play a role in the dissemination of pathogens that cause malaria and diphtheria and in viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, several tetraspanins are involved in the life cycle of certain viruses, beginning from their initial cellular attachment and ending with virus production. In this respect, CD81 is probably the best known example in its role as a binding partner of the E2 envelope protein of HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Recent investigations have focused on the involvement of tetraspanins in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly. In fact, HIV-1 assembly has been shown to take place mainly at the plasma membrane, but also in multivesicular body (MVB)/late endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], even though this latter location for HIV-1 has been recently challenged by investigators who reported that the endosomal HIV-1-containing compartments in macrophages could actually be deep invaginations of the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, it remains that HIV-1 assembly seems to favour tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Tetraspanins can be found at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments: CD63, which possesses an interacting motif with the adaptor AP-3 protein, is mainly targeted to the endocytic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] while most of the other tetraspanins are found both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Indeed, late endosomes/MVBs are highly enriched in the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD82, which contribute to their fusion with the plasma membrane and the release of 50&#x02013;90 nm vesicles called exosomes that resemble viral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>If HIV-1 assembly takes place on tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), proteins from these domains would be expected to be incorporated during virus formation into newly made virions. In agreement with this notion, HIV-1 budding structures and newly made HIV-1 particles can be labeled by anti-CD63 antibodies, as shown by immuno-electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We previously reported the association of CD63 with HIV-1 particles and HIV-1-containing compartments in an infected T-lymphoblastic cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, CD63, found mainly in MVBs, is incorporated into HIV-1 virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Yet, recent works have reported a contradictory role of CD63 on the late steps of HIV replication in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>It was thus proposed that HIV-1 exploits the exocytic vesicular pathway for its assembly and budding. However, CD81 was also found to co-localize with HIV-1 Gag protein at the surface of Jurkat T cells and in exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], as well as with HIV-1 virions accumulated in CD81 and CD9 enriched intracellular compartments of dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Finally, a recent report showed that CD63 and CD81 are recruited within the virological synapse and contributed to the formation of this structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These findings indicate that CD63, CD81 and possibly other tetraspanins can be involved in HIV-1 assembly, but their precise role in HIV-1 biogenesis remains to be determined.</p><p>To address this question, we investigated the relationships between Gag, which is the major structural polyprotein of HIV-1, and several tetraspanins such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82 in chronically infected T lymphoblastic cells (MOLT/HIV-1 cells). This cell line appears to be a good model to study the last steps of the virus life cycle because the expression of CD4, the HIV-1 receptor, is downregulated below detectable level; thus, this lack of CD4 should prevent reinfection of the cells. We have previously reported in MOLT/HIV-1 cells a phenotype atypical of HIV-1 infected T cells in which there is a high level of late endosome-associated viral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. By means of confocal microscopy imaging, viral and cellular biology technics, we report that in the MOLT/HIV-1 cell line, there is a clustering of the tetraspanins CD63, CD81 and CD82 together with the viral structural proteins Gag and Env. In addition, the latter tetraspanins co-purified with HIV-1 virions. However, not all of the tetraspanins seem to have a critical role in HIV-1 formation since our results showed that intracellular Gag protein was part of protein complexes containing mainly CD81 and much less CD82, suggesting a possible major role of CD81 in virus assembly. As a consequence, CD81 and limited CD82 were incorporated in purified HIV-1 virions. Finally, when HIV-1 producing cells were treated with anti-CD81 antibodies, or when CD81 was downregulated by RNA interference, HIV-1 production was impaired and Gag became evenly distributed at the cell surface.</p><p>Our results show that HIV-1 assembly can occur on tetraspanin-enriched microdomains in MOLT/HIV-1 cells and that the tetraspanin CD81 recruited in the viral particles plays a critical role in the late steps of HIV-1 replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Chronically HIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>infected MOLT lymphocytes were used in this study and were a kind gift of J.

At the cell surface of MOLT/HIV-1 cells, CD81 co-localized with both Gag and Env in discrete plasma membrane clusters while CD63 and CD82 mainly co-localized with Gag and partially with both Gag and Env (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, merge in white color). CD45 remained evenly distributed at the cell surface and only sometimes co-localized with Gag and Env. In contrast, both CD9 and Lamp2 were undetectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). One could notice that in the absence of permeabilization, some Gag protein was found at the cell surface. This might be explained by the fact that cell fixation by PFA can partially permeabilized cells or viruses at the cell surface rendering Gag accessible to the antibody even if Gag molecules are within the virions that are departing the cell as shown by electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of HIV-1 Gag and Env with tetraspanins at the cell surface of HIV-1 infected MOLT cells</bold>.

RT activity (data not shown), and the CAp24 and TMgp41 proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 11&#x02013;15) were found in fractions where HIV-1 virions are known to sediment (density of 1.15 &#x02013; 1.18 g/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Interestingly, CD81 and CD82 were also detected in a slightly lighter density fraction (lane 10), which could be due to their high cell surface expression and/or the potential contamination of viral particles by plasma membrane microdomains of a lighter density. In fact, contamination of HIV-1 sucrose density-equilibrium gradients with plasma membrane derived vesicles (microvesicles) has been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].

The fact that CD45 was hardly detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 12&#x02013;14), suggests that these fractions contain only minimal amounts of microvesicles. We cannot completely exclude the presence of exosomes in the virus fractions because their range of sedimentation may vary from 1.08 to 1.22 g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] which overlaps with the HIV-1 virion density.

A weak signal appeared using an anti-CD82 antibody (lane 8). No signal was detected in immunoprecipitates from the mock sample ("vesicles" of uninfected cells, data not shown), which indicates that the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation did not cross-react with the anti-CAp24 antibody.

In this work, we examined the putative association of HIV-1 with cellular tetraspanins such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82, that can be found in endosomal and cell surface membranes of T cell lines. We found that HIV-1 Gag and Env structural proteins co-localized with these tetraspanins, but only CD63, CD81 and CD82 clustered at the cell surface together with the major viral structural proteins (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These tetraspanins co-purified with HIV-1 virions, but only anti-CD81 and anti-CD82 antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate viral particles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We were unable to immunoprecipitate HIV-1 virions with an anti-CD63 antibody in contrast to previous studies which reported anti-CD63 mediated immunoprecipitation of HIV-1 particles that were produced by macrophages (19, 20). In agreement with our data, Gag containing TEMs of MOLT/HIV-1 cells showed only a low level of CD63 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Next, we showed that intracellular Gag and capsid (CAp24) proteins were engaged in complexes with CD81, and much less with CD82, suggesting that HIV-1 proteins specifically interact, directly or indirectly, with CD81, which is part of a CD81/CD82/CD63 TEM in infected MOLT/HIV-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This result is consistent with the fact that purified HIV-1 virions produced by these cells contain CD81, implying that CD81 might have a role during HIV-1 assembly in MOLT/HIV-1 cells. In agreement with this, incubation of MOLT/HIV-1 cells with an anti-CD81 antibody significantly impaired virus release (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Moreover, silencing CD81 expression by shRNA also resulted in a partial inhibition of viral particle production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>Nyddeger and collaborators were the first to propose that tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) can function as gateways for HIV-1 egress in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. This was also found to occur in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and in HIV-1 infected Jurkat T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We previously reported that in MOLT/HIV-1 cells, viral particles and intracellular Gag can associate with the CD63 tetraspanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our last findings showed that in these T cells, HIV-1 assembly can occur on TEMs (i.e. that Gag proteins use TEMs, composed at least of CD81/CD82/CD63), as a platform for particle assembly with a notable interaction, direct or indirect, between Gag and CD81.</p><p>CD82 could have been a good candidate for Gag assembly as it was found to co-localize with intracellular Gag and Env (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>); however, an anti-CD82 antibody had a very moderate effect at immunoprecipitating intracellular Gag or inhibiting HIV-1 release. Either the targeted epitope of the anti-CD82 is less accessible or there is no major functional role for CD82 in virus formation and/or release, in comparison with CD81. Indeed, several monoclonal anti-tetraspanin antibodies were tested and were able to reproduce the results shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> (data not shown). Thus only the effect of CD81 downregulation in MOLT/HIV-1 cells was investigated on HIV-1 release and infectivity. We showed that CD81 downregulation decreased virus production by 3-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, B</xref>) and the resulting virus was more infectious (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), suggesting that CD81 tetraspanin incorporation is able to modulate HIV-1 infection, as this was recently proposed for HIV-1 infected CD4+ activated lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Thus one has to understand how CD81 segregation in TEM favors Gag assembly and release, and at the same time CD81 incorporation into virion renders viruses less infectious. In fact, the high concentration of Gag in TEM should certainly accelerate virus assembly at one cell pole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>), resulting in the favoring of HIV-1 transmission by cell-cell contacts via the virological synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Tetraspanins, like other membrane cellular proteins present in the viral envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], can tell us about the nature of the cellular compartment from which the virus buds or where HIV-1 accumulates.

It appears that HIV-1 can accumulate in intracellular compartments not only during virus formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but also after assembly at the cell surface followed by an endocytosis of Gag complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This intracellular compartment where HIV-1 is targeted is enriched in specific tetraspanins that can vary from one cell to another. In fact, virus-containing compartment (VCC) was proposed to be enriched in (i) CD63 and MHC II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or (ii) CD9, CD53, CD81 and not CD63 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] for monocyte derived primary macrophages (MDM); (iii) CD9 and CD81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or (iv) CD63 and CD81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] for dendritic cells; and (v) CD63, CD81 and rarely CD9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] for T cells. In MOLT/HIV-1 cells, the virus-containing compartment seems to be enriched in CD81 and CD82. Therefore, it appears that a different set of tetraspanins can be recruited in tetraspanin-enriched VCC, where CD81 is always present. It was suggested that this compartment is different from the conventional endosomes, and its formation is induced by the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. What can differ between the VCC and the LE/MVB is the lack of acidification, permitting the persistence of infectious HIV-1 particles within cells for a long time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The pH in VCC is mildly acidic due to the de-localization of the V-ATPase which is responsible for the acidification of the endosomal vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This might be due to the recruitment of specific tetraspanins within VCC which might counteract the V-ATPase subunits and consequently ensure an optimal environment for HIV-1 formation and/or storage. Indeed, it was shown that CD63 can associate with gastric H+, K+ ATPase and target it for degradation in lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This could explain why we observed intracellular co-localization of CD63 with Gag and Env, but no effect from anti-CD63 on HIV release. Another explanation could be, as it was shown in previous work, that HIV infected T cells are resistant to inhibition of HIV-1 infection by a CD63 antibody, but sensitive to CD63 down regulation by siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, CD63 could have a role in modulating the trafficking of these associated proteins and not play a direct role in HIV-1 assembly <italic>per se</italic>. Actually, there is some discrepancy on the role of CD63 in the late steps of HIV-1 replication, as Ruiz-Mateos et al. have shown that CD63 is not required for either the production or the infectivity of HIV-1 in MDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] while Chen and colleagues found the opposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Tetraspanins may serve as molecular facilitators, collecting proteins together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], which suggests, in the context of HIV-1, that tetraspanins could facilitate virus assembly and release by bringing together Gag proteins and cellular factors, such as Tsg101, Alix, and others which are required at the budding site of HIV-1. Indeed, CD63 was found to participate in protein trafficking by inducing functional associations between protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Consistent with these hypotheses, we observed the association of HIV-1 Gag and Env with CD81 and CD82. Our results showed that CD81 and CD82, and less CD63, are clustered with Gag in the VCC or at the plasma membrane. Thus, in reference to published views on the potential roles of cellular proteins in HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], either CD81/CD82 or CD63 are incorporated into virion particles simply because of their presence at the assembly site (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), or because of their interaction with Gag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Therefore, either these tetraspanins were swept up into the budding virions by this specific location (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) but have no function, or they are purposefully incorporated to perform a function for the virus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In the light of our results, only CD81 appeared to be functionally important for HIV-1 production in MOLT/HIV-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). We may speculate that CD81, CD82 and CD63 are useful for the achievement of an optimal environment for HIV-1 assembly, while only CD81 interacts, directly or not, with the viral protein Gag and facilitates virus formation and egress. We report that there is an interaction between Gag (also CAp24) and the tetraspanin web within the infected cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It will be of interest to define the exact domain of HIV-1 Gag that interacts with CD81. In fact, in HTLV-1 (another human retrovirus), the MA domain of Gag associates with CD82 and CD81 inner loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, we show a relationship between CD81 silencing in HIV-1 producing cells and Gag de-localization from the TEM which resulted in an inhibition of HIV-1 release. However, the downregulation of CD81 allowed the virus to be more infectious (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), suggesting that CD81 could also act as a cellular defense response against HIV-1 infection. Interestingly, the upregulation of CD81 mRNA synthesis was observed in primary CD4+ T lymphocytes infected by HIV-1 from patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Along this line, HIV-1 replication can be positively or negatively regulated through multiple interactions with host cell proteins, as we recently reported for the cellular human Disc Large scaffold protein (hDlg1) which restricts HIV-1 infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our study highlights the role of the CD81 tetraspanin in the late steps of HIV-1 replication in T lymphoblastic cells. Further investigations will be needed to reveal the sequential events that lead to TEM formation, cellular factor recruitments and the nature of the interaction between CD81 and the retroviral Gag proteins in the late steps of HIV-1 replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TEM: tetraspanin-enriched microdomains; PM: plasma membrane; HIV-1: human immunodeficiency virus type 1; MVB: multivesicular bodies; MA: matrix protein; CA: capsid protein; Env: envelope glycoproteins, LV: lentiviral vectors.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BG carried out the virology work, confocal microscopy and quantification, lentiviral vectors assays and infections.
