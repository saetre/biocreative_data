Sequence analysis showed that GmERF3 contained an AP2/ERF domain of 58 amino acids and two putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains. It belonged to a group IV protein in the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily as typified by a conserved N-terminal motif [MCGGAI(I/L)]. Expression of <italic>GmERF3</italic> was induced by treatments with high salinity, drought, abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and soybean mosaic virus (SMV), whereas there was no significant <italic>GmERF3</italic> mRNA accumulation under cold stress treatment. GmERF3 could bind to the GCC box and DRE/CRT element, and was targeted to the nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. The GmERF3 protein fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to activate transcription of reporter genes in yeast. Ectopic expression of the <italic>GmERF3</italic> gene in transgenic tobacco plants induced the expression of some <italic>PR</italic> genes and enhanced resistance against infection by <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum, Alternaria alternata</italic>, and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and gave tolerance to high salinity and dehydration stresses. Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>GmERF3</italic> in transgenic tobacco led to higher levels of free proline and soluble carbohydrates compared to wild-type plants under drought conditions. The overall results suggested that <italic>GmERF3</italic> as an AP2/ERF transcription factor may play dual roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Abiotic stress</kwd><kwd>biotic stress</kwd><kwd>ethylene response factor</kwd><kwd>pathogen</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>AP2/ERF transcription factors belong to one of the largest plant transcription factor families, and are characterized by conserved AP2/ERF DNA binding domains of 57&#x02013;66 amino acids in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okamuro <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The AP2/ERF genes constitute a large multigene family divided into four subfamilies named AP2, CBF/DREB, ERF, and RAV based on their sequence similarities and numbers of AP2/ERF domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). AP2 subfamily proteins contain two AP2/ERF domains, and genes in this subfamily participate in the regulation of developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elliott <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boutilier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The RAV subfamily proteins contain one AP2/ERF domain and a B3 domain, which differ in biological functions and are involved in distinct types of the transcription. Recently, the involvement of RAV subfamily members in ethylene response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), brassinosteroid response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and biotic and abiotic stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sohn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) was reported. In contrast to the AP2 and RAV subfamily members, the CBF/DREB and ERF subfamily proteins contain single AP2/ERF domains. The genes in the CBF/DREB subfamily play a crucial role in the resistance of plants to abiotic stresses by recognizing the dehydration responsive or cold-repeat element (DRE/CRT) with a core motif of A/GCCGAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomashow, 1999</xref>). The ERF subfamily is mainly involved in the response to biotic stresses like pathogenesis by recognizing the <italic>cis</italic>-acting element AGCCGCC, known as the GCC box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Many of the ERF subfamily members also bind DRE/CRT elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>ERF transcription factors have been identified in various plant species, such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O&#x000f1;ate-S&#x000e1;nchez and Singh, 2002</xref>), tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischer and Dr&#x000f6;ge-Laser, 2004</xref>), and tomato (<italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tournier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The ERF proteins involved in defence responses against pathogen infection have also been extensively documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gutterson and Reuber, 2004</xref>), and overexpression of ERF genes in transgenic tobacco or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants induces expression of several PR genes, resulting in enhanced resistance to bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischer and Dr&#x000f6;ge-Laser, 2004</xref>). Recent studies revealed the role of some ERF proteins during hormone and abiotic stress responses in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shinozaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The pepper ERF gene, <italic>CaPF1</italic>, was induced by ET, JA, and cold stress, and overexpression of <italic>CaPF1</italic> in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants gave tolerance to freezing temperatures and enhanced resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato DC3000</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of <italic>CaPF1</italic> in transgenic Virginia pine (<italic>Pinus virginiana</italic> Mill.) conferred tolerance to heavy metals (cadmium, copper, and zinc), heat, and to pathogens (<italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus, ERF proteins play an important role, not only in pathogen defence responses but also in tolerance to abiotic stresses.</p><p>Although ERF subfamily transcription factors have been identified in different plant species, only a few have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O&#x000f1;ate-S&#x000e1;nchez and Singh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In fact, in soybean, only the role of <italic>GmEREBP1</italic> has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazarei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002, 2007</xref>). In this study, a new member of the soybean ERF subfamily was isolated, designated <italic>GmERF3</italic>, and its expression patterns in response to different stress conditions were analysed. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tournier <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>, <italic>GmERF3</italic> belongs to a novel ERF class IV, which is typified by a conserved N-terminal signature sequence (MCGGAII/L). Interestingly, full-length GmERF3 protein was able to bind with both the GCC box and DRE/CRT motifs with different binding affinities. <italic>GmERF3</italic> as a transcriptional activator can activate expression of reporter genes in yeast. Previous research has demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>ERF</italic> genes enhances resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Further evidence is provided here that resistance to bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens (biotic stress), and also to high salinity and drought stresses (abiotic stress), can be engineered by overexpression of the <italic>GmERF3</italic> transcription factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and stress treatments</title><p>Soybean cultivar &#x02018;Tiefeng 8&#x02019;, a genetic resource for salinity tolerance and &#x02018;Zhongpin 95-5383&#x02019;, a soybean mosaic virus-resistant variety, were used throughout the study. Plant treatments were performed at the two true-leaf stage. &#x02018;Tiefeng 8&#x02019; was used for salt, dehydration, cold, and ABA stress treatments. &#x02018;Zhongpin 95-5383&#x02019; was used for SA, ET, and JA treatments and SMV inoculation. Stress treatments were performed as follows: For salt stress, the roots of seedlings were dipped into solutions of 200 mM NaCl. For chilling treatment, seedlings were put into a 4 &#x000b0;C growth chamber. For dehydration, the root systems of whole plants were washed gently with water to remove soil and then the plants were put on filter paper for drought induction. For ABA, SA, and JA treatments, soybean seedlings were sprayed with 200 &#x003bc;M ABA dissolved in 0.01% ethanol, 2 mM SA in water, and 100 &#x003bc;M JA in 0.01% ethanol, respectively. Ethylene treatment was performed in a gas-tight plexiglass chamber by dissolving 2 ml 40% ethephon and 1 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in 200 ml H<sub>2</sub>O (under these conditions ethephon will liberate ethylene gas). For SMV treatment, mechanical inoculation was carried out by rubbing leaves with a brush dipped in a mixture of carborundum and an extract of infected leaves ground in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After inoculation, the leaves were rinsed with tap water.

According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref>, the DREB and ERF subfamilies differ by two conserved amino acid residues in the AP2/ERF domain. That is, the 14th valine and the 19th glutamic acid are conserved in the DREB proteins, whereas alanine and aspartic acid residues are conserved at the corresponding positions of ERF proteins. In agreement with other ERF proteins, GmERF3 has the 14th alanine and 19th aspartic acid in the 58 amino acid AP2/ERF domain, suggesting that <italic>GmERF3</italic> is a member of the ERF subfamily. ERFs have been shown to act as activators or repressors of transcription. NtERF3, AtERF3/4, and AtERF7-12 characterized by the well-defined EAR repressor domain, were shown to be active repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Tobacco NtERF2/4, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtERF1/2/5, periwinkle ORCA2/3, and tomato Pti4 function as activators of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Menke <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van der Fits and Memelink, 2000</xref>). In this study, stretches of acidic amino acids in GmERF3 were located at the N termini. These are capable of activating transcription of reporter genes in yeast cells, suggesting that GmERF3 is a transcriptional activator. In addition, GmERF3 contains two basic amino acid stretches (K<sub>32</sub>KRK and R<sub>94</sub>KRK) and a conserved N-terminal MCGGAII/L sequence. Recombinant GmERF3 protein localized to the nucleus and bound specifically to the GCC box and DRE/CRT sequences <italic>in vitro</italic>. The function of the N-terminal MCGGAII/L motif is unknown, but is unlikely to be required for nuclear localization or for binding to the GCC box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tournier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tournier <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> isolated four new members of the ERF subfamily from tomato (<italic>LeERF1&#x02013;4</italic>), and phylogenetic analysis indicated that LeERF2 belonged to a new ERF class characterized by a conserved N-terminal MCGGAII/L sequence. This N-terminal motif is found only in ERF genes. In addition to GmERF3, CaERFLP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), TaERF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), Tsi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and CaPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) also contain the N-terminal signature sequence and belong to the class IV ERF subfamily, which specifically binds both the GCC box and DRE/CRT element. It is worth noting that the AP2/EREBP domain fragment of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CBF1 can interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with the sequence containing not only the DRE/CRT motif, but also the GCC element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). This dual-binding activity was probably due to the common core sequence &#x02013;CCGNC&#x02013;, which occurs in two different upstream elements. This, in conjunction with our data, may be indicative of possible cross-functionality between the ERF and DREB transcription factors.</p><p>In plants, SA, JA, and ethylene are important inducers of defence-related genes. By contrast, the plant hormone ABA regulates interacting signalling pathways involved in plant responses to several abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shinozaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), such as drought, salt, and cold, as well as plant growth and development. Recent research showed that ABA is implicated in increasing the resistance of plants towards pathogens via its positive effect on callose deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2005</xref>). In the present study, the expression of <italic>GmERF3</italic> was induced not only by SA, JA, ET, and SMV, but also by ABA, high salinity, and drought. It was proposed that biotic and abiotic stresses induce overlapping sets of genes in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Biotic stress (SMV infection), abiotic stress (high salinity and drought) or plant hormones (JA, SA, ET, and ABA) induce <italic>GmERF3</italic> expression in soybean. This has led to the hypothesis that <italic>GmERF3</italic> might act as a connector linking different signalling pathways that mediate biotic and abiotic stress responses.</p><p>ERF subfamily genes play various roles in plant growth, development, and response to different environmental stress factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okamuro <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). It is a common observation that certain transcription factors serve as targets for different signalling pathways. In this study, transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the <italic>GmERF3</italic> gene showed increased resistance to <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>, and TMV, and enhanced tolerance to high salinity and drought stresses. This may be due to the increased expression of stress-inducible genes induced by the overexpression of <italic>GmERF3</italic>. GmERF3 binds specifically to the GCC box sequence <italic>in vitro</italic>; this motif is present in the promoter regions of many ethylene-inducible genes, including <italic>PR</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohme-Takagi and Shinshi, 1995</xref>), and also binds to the DRE/CRT element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), present in the promoter regions of drought-, salt-, and freezing-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaglo-Ottosen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasuga <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In this study, overexpression of <italic>GmERF3</italic> in transgenic tobacco activated the expression of several <italic>PR</italic> genes, such as <italic>PR1</italic>, <italic>PR2</italic>, <italic>PR4</italic>, <italic>Osmotin</italic>, and <italic>SAR8.2</italic> under normal unstressed conditions. Analysis of these <italic>PR</italic> promoters revealed that GCC <italic>cis</italic>-elements were crucial for pathogen-induced gene activation. Therefore, it is possible that biotic and abiotic stresses regulate <italic>GmERF3</italic> expression; the abundance of <italic>GmERF3</italic> transcriptional activator then most likely up-regulates the transcription of several stress-inducible genes, and their protein products contribute to the increased levels of endurance under the stress conditions. In addition, soluble sugars and free proline accumulation may play a highly protective role in plants that are exposed to biotic or abiotic stresses. In wheat, many studies showed that wheat cultivars with higher K<sup>+</sup>, Pro, and soluble sugar, and lower MDA at different growth stages had better stress resistances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hongbo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The involvement of proline in response to water deficit was demonstrated in transgenic tobacco overexpressing proline biosynthesis enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roosens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing <italic>CBF3/DREB1A</italic> were shown to accumulate proline even under unstressed control conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilmour <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In this study, <italic>35S::GmERF3</italic> transgenic tobacco also accumulated higher levels of free proline and soluble sugars than wild-type plants under unstressed and drought stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). Those results together prove that the function of ERF genes is conservative in different plant species. However, more evidence is needed to support the conclusion that the accumulation of sugars or proline is a direct reason for more stress tolerance in transgenic plants, such as Gene Chip or MicroArray analysis.</p><p>Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the <italic>GmERF3</italic> gene showed increased resistance to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> and the fungal pathogen <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>, which exhibited significantly reduced disease lesions compared with wild-type controls. What kind of mechanism(s) will inhibit or kill these pathogens? The high antioxidant capacity of plants may play an important role in resistance to necrotic symptoms caused by abiotic or biotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mittler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Tobacco plants exhibiting high antioxidant capacity develop multi-resistance to several stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barna <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Breeding plants for high antioxidant capacity is one effective way to create multi-resistant crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kira'ly, 2000</xref>). In addition, an increase in the activity of chitinases and some other cell-wall-degrading enzymes or the accumulation of antimicrobial compounds may have a role in arresting the spread of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kira'ly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Increased activity of chitinases degrades chitin in fungal cell walls (van Loon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006). Interestingly, the activity of chitinases is characteristic of plants resistant to viral or bacterial attack. In the case of bacterial infections, a likely explanation is that most chitinases exhibit lysozyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kira'ly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Using Gene Chip or MicroArray analysis tools in further studies should indicate whether or not elevated antioxidant capacity, induced expression of chitinases, or antimicrobial compounds in <italic>GmERF3</italic> transgenic plants cause the enhanced resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogens. In contrast to <italic>NtERF5</italic>, which when overexpressed, resulted in enhanced resistance to TMV by suppressing viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischer and Dr&#x000f6;ge-Laser, 2004</xref>), resistance to TMV in <italic>GmERF3</italic> overexpressing tobacco plant might be due to significantly suppressed viral spread. <italic>GmERF3</italic> transgenic lines failed to exhibit significantly reduced lesion size and leaf lesion numbers compared with wild-type plants in the infected leaves. However, the rate of collapse of the apex tissues of the infected transgenic plants was clearly delayed relative to infected wild-type plants. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the suppression of viral spread was a consequence of the reduced TMV propagation. The mechanism of this effect remains unknown. In order to demonstrate whether <italic>GmERF3</italic> is part of a naturally-occurring resistance pathway, RNAi plants will need to be analysed. In conclusion, the data presented in this report suggest that <italic>GmERF3</italic> as a positive transcription factor might have a role in cross-talk between the biotic and abiotic stress signal pathways in plants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Dr RA McIntosh (Plant Breeding Institute, University of Sydney, Australia) for reviewing this manuscript.
