Yeast and mammals share the initial steps of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation in the ER, even if the pathways diverge between mammals and yeast in the Golgi apparatus. Indeed, in this cellular compartment, the extension of the oligosaccharide chain involves many specific glycosyltransferases. This specificity generates the observed diversity of glycan structures between different species and cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>the glycosyltransferases are constituted by mannosyltransferases, which lead to the formation of two main types of mannan outer chain. Many proteins of the cell wall and periplasm receive a large mannan structure that contains a long <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1,6-linked backbone of about 50 mannoses with short <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1,2 and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1,3 side chains. In contrast, the proteins of the internal organelles display a smaller core-type structure, with only a few mannoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The structure of the mannan outer chain has been investigated by the study of <italic>mnn </italic>(mannan defective) mutants isolated by Ballou and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The analysis of the partial <italic>N</italic>-glycan structures in these mutants has allowed the ordering of the steps of mannan synthesis. The work of Munro suggests a model for the complete <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In this model, the formation of the mannan outer chain is initiated by the Och1p protein, a type II membrane <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1,6-mannosyltransferase that defines an early Golgi compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Upon arrival in the Golgi, all <italic>N</italic>-glycan cores receive a single &#x003b1;-1,6-mannose added by Och1p. The formation of the long &#x003b1;-1,6-linked backbone is generated by two enzyme complexes: the M-Pol I and M-Pol II complexes.</p><p><italic>Kluyveromyces lactis </italic>is a yeast species related to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>; its outer mannan chains differ from those of <italic>S.cerevisiae </italic>by having terminal N-acetylglucosamine and no mannose phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Previous studies from our laboratory reported that the <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>mutation of <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis </italic>yeast was mapped at 738 bp of the <italic>KlOCH1 </italic>gene and we found that the corresponding wild type allele encodes the functional homologue of the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>&#x003b1;1,6-mannosyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Quantitative analysis of cell-wall components indicated a noticeable increase of chitin and &#x003b2;1,6-glucans and a severe decrease of mannoproteins in the <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells as compared to the wild-type counterparts. In addition, fine-structure determination of the &#x003b2;1,6-glucan polymer showed that, in the <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>strain, the &#x003b2;1,6-glucans are shorter and have more branches than in the wild-type strain. Moreover, the <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells showed a significantly improved capability of secreting heterologous proteins.</p><p>Recent reports provide evidences that defects in protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation can cause mitochondrial deficiencies. An ER-derived oxidative stress from misfolded proteins in an <italic>erv29 </italic>mutant of <italic>S.cerevisiae </italic>has been shown to led to UPR activation, which cause the accumulation of ROS from both the ER and mitochondria, and resulted in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has also been reported that dosage attenuation of Dol-P- dependent GlcNAc-1-P transferase, <italic>ALG7</italic>, in haploid cells led to the loss of mtDNA and respiratory deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Also Eos1, a protein involved in the <italic>N-</italic>glycosylation, was required for tolerance to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, in most of the cases the mechanisms linking glycosylation and mitochondrial dysfunctions need to be elucidated. In this work we found that altered mitochondria functionality in cells deprived of the Golgi &#x003b1;-1,6-mannosyltransferase is caused by a defective calcium homeostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Altered mitochondrial biogenesis in Kloch1-1 cells</title><p>The <italic>K. lactis KlOCH1 </italic>gene encodes the &#x003b1;-1,6-mannosyltransferase localized in the Golgi apparatus and involved in the glycosylation process and in cell wall morphogenesis. The <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>mutant strain showed enhanced heterologous protein production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells displayed a higher generation time in rich fermentable medium in comparison with wild type cells, and in the presence of respiratory carbon source, the biomass yield was strongly reduced. This prompted us to investigate if the lack of the &#x003b1; 1,6-mannosyltransferase activity in <italic>K. lactis </italic>cells could be associated with altered mitochondrial functionality. To this end cells were incubated with DASPMI, a fluorescent probe that is taken up by mitochondria as a function of membrane electrochemical potential. We found indeed a different distribution of the dye in the two strains: in the <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>background the cells showed a punctuate pattern and some ring structures instead of the regular tubular network of the wild type counterpart (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In order to analyze possible alterations of the mitochondria structures, we transformed the mutant and wild type strains with a plasmid carrying the GFP fused to the mitochondrial signal sequence from the subunit 9 of the F<sub>0</sub>-ATPase from <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>; this construct has been demonstrated to correctly deliver functional GFP into yeast mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The fluorescence microscope observation of the mitochondrial matrix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) showed, for the mutant cells, an hyperbranched mitochondrial net not revealed by the DASPMI staining, whereas the mitochondrial morphology of the wild-type cells resulted identical to the one observed with DASPMI. To further study the altered mitochondrial morphology, the mutant strain and its isogenic wild type counterpart were analyzed by electron microscopy. In ultrathin sections of the wild type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) the mitochondria appeared as tubular structures, with normal morphology and typical cell peripheral distribution. The <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells showed instead mitochondria that were either stretched and without crests in the middle part either round swollen at the ends, in agreement with the altered morphology observed by DASPMI staining.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Morphological and functional analysis of mitochondria in cells lacking &#x003b1;1,6-mannosyltransferase activity</bold>.

This compound accumulates inside the cells and it is oxidized to the corresponding fluorescent chromophore by ROS. The fluorescence microscope observation revealed that 28% of <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells accumulated ROS as compared to 5% of the parental strain; these values increased up to 48% and 18% in the mutant and wild type cells respectively after challenge with a generator of oxidative stress, such as the hydrogen peroxide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

Three of the plasmids, isolated from the corresponding clones that survived the selection procedure, resulted to be identical and were further analyzed.

Notably, in cells depleted of &#x003b1;1,6 mannosyltransferase activity but transformed with the pKlCNB1 and pKlCNA1 plasmids, the thickness of the cell wall resembled that of the wild-type parent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In agreement with the electron microscopy observations, we found that the ability of the mutant cells to grow in presence of the cell wall-perturbing agent calcofluor white was completely restored only when the cells were transformed with both subunits of calcineurin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Identical results were also obtained when congo red, another molecule interfering with the cell wall, was used (data not shown). This phenotype has to be ascribed to the increased activation of the calcineurin signaling pathway that generates a rescue of a normal biogenesis of cell wall.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation is one of the fundamental metabolic pathways in cell fate. Deciphering how <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation controls specific metabolic and signaling events has become important to unraveling the underlying basis of cellular behavior. In yeasts, outer chain branching is initiated in the Golgi apparatus by the &#x003b1;-1,6-mannosyltransferase Och1p. Here, we reported that altered mitochondrial functionality and oxidative stress take place in <italic>K. lactis </italic>cells carrying a mutation in <italic>KlOCH1 </italic>gene. The mutant cells showed also a reduction in the calcium content and in the expression of genes related to calcium signalling.</p><p>Although a direct link between <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation defects and mitochondrial functionality has not been reported, underglycosylation of proteins destined for the mitochondria could interfere with, or abolish, the import of these proteins into the organelle. Indeed, a 45 kDa <italic>N</italic>-glycoprotein has been identified in rat liver inner mitochondrial membranes that physically interacts with complex I and the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; Tim11p, its yeast homologue, has one potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site. Also, mutations in the signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor have been shown to disrupt the reticular structure of both the ER and mitochondria in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], suggesting that a proper ER structure and/or functionality is required for maintaining the mitochondrial network. It is conceivable that the underglycosylation of proteins has adverse effects on the early secretory compartments structure and functionality, which, in turn, influences mitochondria characteristics.</p><p>Moreover, we found that <italic>KlCMD1 </italic>gene was a suppressor in <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells of either ROS accumulation or sensitivity to the oxidative stress, when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>was added in the growth medium. On the other hand, the increased dosage of this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signalling gene was not able to increase the survival rate of the mutant cells undergoing a treatment with cytotoxic concentration of the same oxidant agent. These data suggest that, in the mutant cells, the altered defence mechanisms against high concentration of a ROS generator were not fixed by calmodulin itself.</p><p>The <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells also showed a reduction in the calcium content, accompanied by a reduction in the expression of the <italic>KlCMD1</italic>, <italic>KlCNA1 </italic>and <italic>KlCNB1 </italic>genes, encoding for key components of the calmodulin/calcineurin signalling pathway. In fungi, conserved signal transduction pathways control fundamental aspects of growth, development and reproduction. Two important classes of fungal signalling pathways are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and the calcium-calcineurin pathway. They are triggered by an array of stimuli and target a broad range of downstream effectors such as transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, protein kinases and other enzymes, thereby regulating processes such reproduction, morphogenesis and stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We can thus hypothesize a possible activation of a MAPK signaling in <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells that in turn could down modulate the calcium signaling pathway. It has been found that in <italic>K. lactis </italic>cells deleted in <italic>PMR1 </italic>gene and sharing phenotypes with the <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>mutant, such as cell wall defects, oxidative stress and altered calcium homeostasis, the HOG1 MAPK cascade resulted activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>calmodulin, a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>binding protein, regulates many cell processes both depending or not upon the intervention of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ions. Among those Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent is the organization of the actin cytoskeleton; moreover mutations in <italic>CMD1 </italic>resulted colethal, suggestive of functional interactions, with the inactivation of genes encoding components of the glycosylation pathways like ANP1, CWH8 and MNN10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; mutations in such genes also result in altered morphology of actin cytoskeleton. We should also take into account that, although <italic>och1 </italic>deletion mutant of <italic>S.cerevisae </italic>in the BY4741 background was sensitive to EGTA, the mutant strain was not altered in the expression of calmodulin and calcineurin genes (Zanni <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished results). However, we can not exclude the possibility that a reduction in the activity of the calcium signalling proteins can occur in the <italic>OCH1 </italic>deleted cells.</p><p>Mitochondrial plasticity and functionality strongly depend upon the interactions between mitochondria and cytoskeleton. Several shape-related proteins have been described in S.cerevisiae, localized on the mitochondria surface and reported to interact with actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; however the individual role and underlaying mechanisms are still unsolved.</p><p>Another unanswered question is how do cells change the mitochondrial shape upon cell signals. In the case of calcium signalling, a relevant player could well be Gem1p, a member of the Miro GTPase family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; Gem1p is also localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane with its GTPase domain and, most notably, its EF-hand calcium binding domain exposed in the cytosol.</p><p>We are tempting to speculate that the altered calcium availability we observed in <italic>Kloch1-1 </italic>cells could be originated by a defective calcium membrane channel Mid1/Cch1. In fact, it has been demonstrated that <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Mid1 requires a full glycosylation to correctly localize and assemble at the level of the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In mammalian cells Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx through voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels (VDCCs) causes a rapid halt in mitochondrial movement and induces mitochondrial fission. VDCC-associated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling stimulates phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at serine 600 via activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I&#x003b1; (CaMKI&#x003b1;). In neurons and HeLa cells, phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine 600 and dephosphorylation at serine 637, both calcineurin-dependent, are associated with increase in Drp1 translocation to mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, one cannot exclude that defective <italic>KlOCH1 </italic>gene induce reduced glycosylation of other proteins relevant for calcium handling; scrutiny of such picture will deserve future work.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A proper functioning of outer chain-extension of mannoproteins in <italic>K. lactis </italic>is required for correct calcium homeostasis. The impairment of <italic>KlOCH1 </italic>results in a low calcium/calmodulin based signaling and altered mitochondria morphology and functionality. The reported data strongly indicate a novel link between relevant cell processes taking place in separate compartments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions</title><p>The strains used in this study were MW278-20C (MAT a, <italic>ade2</italic>, <italic>leu2</italic>, <italic>uraA</italic>), CPV3 (MAT a, <italic>ade2</italic>, <italic>leu2</italic>, <italic>uraA, Kloch1-1</italic>) and CPK1 <bold>(</bold>MAT a, <italic>ade2, leu2, uraA</italic>, <italic>KlPMR1::Kan </italic>R).
