This hypothesis is further supported by the exchange of membrane fragments occurring between gametes prior to fusion that we recently reported.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sperm-egg interaction is a complex molecular process leading to gamete fusion mediated by a series of molecular interactions. Evidences have been put forward suggesting the involvement of members of the ADAMs, tetraspanins and integrins families in this mechanism. Recently, Izumo, a sperm protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, was found to be essential for the fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Three groups reported that <italic>Cd9</italic>-deficient female mice present a dramatic reduction of their fertility due to a lack of fusion ability of their oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We recently showed that double knock-out <italic>Cd9</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>Cd81</italic><sup>-/- </sup>female mice are completely infertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and that, upon fertilization, CD9 tetraspanin controls &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin relocation in patches on the egg membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Integrins have also been implicated in sperm-oocyte interaction. Based on several experiments, mouse egg &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin was described to function as a receptor of the sperm fertilin &#x003b2;. During further experiments, the function-blocking mAb directed against the &#x003b1;6 integrin subunit, GoH3, turned out to inhibit sperm-oocyte binding, and peptides derived from the sperm fertilin &#x003b2; disintegrin domain sequence bind to &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, mouse gamete binding and fusion tests using GoH3 mAb gave disparate results, partly according to the technique used for ZP removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The binding of sperm to mouse oocytes was not inhibited when ZP had been removed using an acidic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the fertilization rate (FR) of cumulus-intact mouse oocytes was not reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, we have shown that GoH3 strongly inhibited human sperm-egg fusion when the ZP had been removed by microdissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, oocytes from &#x003b1;6 integrin-deficient mice show normal binding and fusion with sperm, suggesting that the &#x003b1;6 integrin is not essential for gamete binding and fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These results suggested that the &#x003b1;6 integrin function could be redundant, possibly with another member of the integrin family also expressed on oocyte membrane. However, according to experiments performed by He <italic>et al</italic>., none of the integrins known to be present on the oocyte are essential for gamete fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Major questions about integrins' roles in sperm-oocyte fusion remain unsolved. The possible effect of anti-&#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 antibodies on mouse sperm functions has never been addressed, whereas expression of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin on human spermatozoa has already been reported. The integrin subunits &#x003b1;4, &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;6 have also been detected on normal human sperm using flow cytometry, their expressions being reduced in cases of terato- or oligoasthenoteratozoospermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The &#x003b2;1 integrin subunit has been detected by histochemistry on basement membrane of the tubuli seminiferi, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the expression of &#x003b2;1 integrin on human spermatozoa and their fertilizing ability has been demonstrated suggesting that sperm integrins may be determinant in egg-sperm recognition and interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Hence, Reddy <italic>et al</italic>. proposed &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin as a clinical marker to evaluate sperm quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Several other studies performed on human sperm demonstrated correlations between their level of integrin expression and their fertilization ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The presence of sperm integrin in human raises the question of its possible expression by mouse sperm. In spite of numerous experiments involving the anti-&#x003b1;6 mAb GoH3 in mouse gamete interaction, this point has never been investigated and discussed, whereas it can account for some of the reported data discrepancies.</p><p>Another point deals with the model of ZP-free oocyte that was most frequently used to study gamete interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To focus the studies on events that occur at the plasma membrane level, the ZP was removed by chemical, enzymatic or mechanical methods. Indeed, this model prevents any interference between both gamete membranes and is considered to be more convenient for studying their interaction. However, ZP removal dramatically modifies the local conditions of gamete interaction and may also explain some contradictory results that have been previously reported. We recently showed that upon ZP removal, several integrin subunits, including &#x003b1;6, and tetraspanins are relocated and clustered into patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Simultaneously, several oocyte functions related to fusion are modified. Hence, in human oocyte, the mAb anti-CD9 is effective in inhibiting gamete fusion only if it is introduced in the medium before zona removal and not after [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that CD9 tetraspanin function is bypassed by this membrane remodeling. In this study, we now demonstrate the expression of &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b2;1 integrin subunits by mouse sperm. We performed IVF assay after preincubation of sperm and/or oocyte with antibodies. Experiments were performed using both acid Tyrode (AT) ZP-free and cumulus-intact oocytes. Thus, we demonstrated that mouse sperm express &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin and that this integrin is involved in the sperm-oocyte interaction process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Alpha6 and beta1 integrin subunits are expressed on mouse sperm membrane</title><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Expression of &#x003b1;6 integrin subunit on cauda epididymal sperm was evaluated by immunoblot analysis.

We evaluated, in the presence or in the absence of antibodies, the percentage of fertilized eggs (FR) in both cumulus-intact and acid Tyrode (AT) zona-free egg assays and the average number of sperm fused per egg (fertilization index: FI) in AT zona-free egg assays. As these integrin subunits are also expressed by the oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we determined to what extent each gamete is involved in the inhibition process. Different groups were studied. The group 1 was the control IVF. In groups 2 and 3, only one of the two gametes (oocytes or sperm, respectively) was preincubated with function-blocking antibodies, washed and inseminated without antibodies. In group 4, both gametes were separately preincubated with the function-blocking antibodies, washed and then inseminated without any antibody as in previous groups. In group 5, oocytes were inseminated in presence of antibodies without any preincubation. In groups 6, 7 and 8, anti-&#x003b2;1 antibody was present during the insemination while oocytes, sperm or both had been preincubated with it. Results differed according to the presence or the absence of ZP. When experiments were performed with isotype (rat IgG2a) or with medium containing sodium azide at 0,02% final concentration as controls, no inhibition was detected (data not shown). It is important to note that none of the function blocking antibody used altered the sperm motility.</p><sec><title>Effect of GoH3 on cumulus-intact egg insemination (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)</title><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effects of alpha6 and beta1 integrin subunits antibodies on sperm-egg fusion</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Groups</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Antibodies preincubation</td><td align="center">Antibodies during IVF</td><td align="center">FR (%) cumulus-intact (<italic>n</italic>. oocytes)</td><td align="center">FI* AT zona-free (<italic>n</italic>. oocytes)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">Sperm</td><td align="center">Oocytes</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" colspan="6"><bold>Anti-&#x003b1;6 (GoH3) </bold>at 200 &#x003bc;g/ml</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">91 &#x000b1; 3 (85)</td><td align="center">4,6 &#x000b1; 0,3 (51)<sup>e</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">68 &#x000b1; 6 (64)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center">4,8 &#x000b1; 0,3 (49)<sup>e</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">50 &#x000b1; 6 (81)<sup>b,<italic>c</italic></sup></td><td align="center">2,5 &#x000b1; 0,2 (44)<sup>b,<italic>e</italic></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">31 &#x000b1; 7 (44)<sup>b</sup></td><td align="center">2,6 &#x000b1; 0,2 (34)<sup>b,<italic>e</italic></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">10 &#x000b1; 3 (77)<sup>b,d</sup></td><td align="center">4 &#x000b1; 0,3 (38)<sup>e</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="6"><bold>Anti-&#x003b2;1 (L16) </bold>at 50 &#x003bc;g/ml</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">72 &#x000b1; 5 (82)</td><td align="center">4,5 &#x000b1; 0,2 (56)<sup>e</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">5-6-7-8<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td><td align="center">&#x000b1;</td><td align="center">&#x000b1;</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">20 &#x000b1; 5 (269)<sup>b</sup></td><td align="center">2,6 &#x000b1; 0,2 (108)<sup>e</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>FR, fertilization rate; FI, fertilization index; Ab, antibody; AT, acid Tyrode; *, Number of spermatozoa per oocyte;<sup>&#x000a7;</sup>, In groups 2 to 4 of the anti-&#x003b2;1 tests, the antibody was absent during insemination and FR and FI were comparable to the control (group 1) (data not shown), FR and FI in groups 5 to 8 were no significantly different between them and values given here are means; a, significantly different from control, P &#x0003c; 0.0002; b, significantly different from control, P &#x0003c; 0.0001; c, significantly different from group 2, P &#x0003c; 0.03; d, significantly different from group 4, P &#x0003c; 0.003; e, FR on AT zona-free assay was 100%; Results represent the mean &#x000b1; s. e. m from three different experiments.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Control FR was 91% &#x000b1; 3.

This could be explained by the inhibition of lately recruited GoH3 binding sites during the incubation.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of G0H3 on acid Tyrode zona-free egg insemination (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)</title><p>In all groups of AT zona-free egg assay, membrane gamete interaction is immediate. Because of this extremely rapid process, all eggs were fertilized (FR = 100%). GoH3 mAb had no effect on AT zona-free oocytes since the FI of group 2 was not modified when compared to the control group, showing that ZP removal by AT renders oocytes insensitive to GoH3 effects. Only sperm preincubation (group 3) with GoH3 significantly reduced the FI. Interestingly, if both gametes were inseminated in presence of GoH3, without preincubation (group 5), the FI was not reduced. In contrast, if the same experiment was performed with cumulus-intact eggs, an almost complete inhibition was observed. Therefore: 1) the AT zona removal induced a disappearance of the GoH3 effects on the oocytes, 2) sperm GoH3 effect is not immediate and requires a delay to be effective. This explains that sperm preincubation inhibits ZP-intact but not AT-ZP-free oocytes fertilization and suggests that the time to get through the ZP could be a necessary delay for sperm inhibition to appear.</p></sec><sec><title>Cumulus-intact and acid Tyrode zona-free egg assays with anti-beta1 integrin subunit antibody (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)</title><p>Gamete preincubation with anti-&#x003b2;1 mAb (L16), both in cumulus-intact and AT ZP-free assays, had no effect (groups 2 to 4, data not shown) while the presence of the antibody during insemination impaired gamete interaction (groups 5&#x02013;8) and was not modified by any preincubation.

These data reinforce the role of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin in the process of gamete interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We also confirm that AT-ZP removal bypasses the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin function in mouse oocyte at the time of gamete interaction.</p><p>We show that mouse sperm express &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin by western blot analysis, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. This last technique enables to localize the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin on the surface of capacitated and capacitated and AR spermatozoa. Alpha6beta1 integrin clusterisation at the surface of the spermatozoon head in a dotty pattern suggests its activation. As the fertilizing spermatozoon normally present in the perivitelline space is AR, is more likely to present this staining pattern. As the fusion starts at the equatorial and post acrosomal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], this localization of the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 sperm integrin reinforces its probable implication in the adhesion/fusion process.</p><p>Our results are different from those of other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In our study, when zona pellucida was totally removed by acid Tyrode, oocytes were insensitive to GoH3 effect. Consequently, we observed gamete interaction inhibition only when sperm was preincubated with GoH3, while Almeida <italic>et al</italic>. reported a total inhibition by GoH3 (after oocyte preincubation) of oocyte-sperm binding and therefore of fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This inhibition could have been due to GoH3 effect on both oocyte and sperm. Indeed, in these experiments, very brief chymotrypsin treatment was used and may not have completely removed the zona pellucida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Hence, oocytes were probably not totally insensitive to GoH3 effect. Furthermore, in their experiment, GoH3 have not been washed out from oocyte preincubation medium before sperm addition, contrary to what we did. Therefore, the delay necessary for the spermatozoon to get through the zona pellucida may have stood for the time of GoH3 sperm preincubation. Actually, these experimental conditions were closer to our cumulus-intact IVF ones, accounting for similar results in apparently different IVF conditions. In our previous study, we probably also misinterpreted the GoH3 effect on the human IVF by allotting it exclusively to the oocyte integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This effect may have mainly been mediated by the spermatic one.</p><p>Two previous studies, using zona-intact or cumulus-intact eggs assays, reported GoH3 lack of inhibition on gamete fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the first one, the IVF test was run in small volumes (10 &#x003bc;l). As stated in the report itself, it is known that IVF is inefficient in these conditions (Control FR = 30%). This might have hidden the GoH3 inhibition effect. In the second experiment, contrary to the 3 hours incubation commonly used and as used in our study, insemination lasted 24 hours. Therefore, the evaluation of the FR was not performed according to the presence of decondensed sperm head within the ooplasm, but to the two cell stage criteria. This is not the usual criterion to evaluate fertilization per se, but that of egg activation which can also be achieved by parthenogenetic process.</p><p>The most frequent argument to rule out the possible role of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin in gamete interaction is the fertility of &#x003b1;6 or &#x003b2;1 integrin subunits deleted mice oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, all the experiments performed with deleted oocytes, including mating, used wild-type spermatozoa. According to our present results which show the presence of the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin on sperm, these spermatozoa carried the &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b2;1 integrin subunits that had been deleted on the oocyte. This means that, prior to fusion, at the gamete membrane merge, these molecules were present. We therefore have to hypothesize that the presence of this integrin on one of the two fusing membranes is sufficient for fusion. Such hypothesis is supported by the sperm oocyte membrane exchange occurring prior to fusion we reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this work, we have shown that CD9 tetraspanin is transferred with the exchanged membrane fragment from oocyte to sperm. One can hypothesize that sperm &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin could transfer too and, therefore, may have rescued adhesion and fusion in deleted oocytes. The way to definitively answer the question of the implication of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin in gamete interaction during fertilization is the deletion of &#x003b1;6 and/or &#x003b2;1 integrin gene in both gametes. This part of study is under current evaluation.</p><p>In our study, AT zona-free eggs were all fertilized whatever the anti-&#x003b1;6 or anti-&#x003b2;1 integrin subunits antibodies used. This could be explained by the direct free access for sperm to oocyte membrane, preventing the effect of the antibody on the sperm. But, importantly, the FI was not affected even when oocytes were preincubated with GoH3 showing that they had become insensitive to its effects. Thus, the oocyte &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin is in such a situation that it is no longer needed. As fusion still occurs, we have to conclude that it had been bypassed by the AT ZP removal. This is another reason for the FR being poorly affected by GoH3 on AT ZP-free eggs. Similar bypasses have already been described in human eggs upon mechanical ZP removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. When mouse intact <italic>Cd9</italic><sup>-/- </sup>eggs are inseminated, spermatozoa swim into the perivitelline space without binding to the oolemma. On the contrary, large amounts of spermatozoa tightly bind to the oolemma of AT zona-free <italic>Cd9</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>To investigate this hypothesis, we studied &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b2;1 integrin subunits distribution on ZP-intact and AT ZP-free oocytes. &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b2;1 integrin subunits were evenly distributed on the surface of zona-intact mouse eggs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e,g</xref>). On the oocyte surface of AT ZP-free eggs, these integrins were detected as well, but in larger regularly arranged patches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f,h</xref>). The same relocation had been observed in human egg upon ZP removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We also have reported a relocation of the &#x003b1;6 integrin subunit upon fertilization of mouse zona-intact eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] suggesting that the two phenomena are linked. We can then hypothesize that fertilization and &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin redistribution are physiologically linked. Once this relocation has happened, &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin has less or no function in the process of gamete binding and fusion. This means that anti-&#x003b1;6 antibodies have few or no effect on AT ZP-free mouse oocytes. For all these reasons and also because is closer to what the physiology should be, experiments using zona-intact eggs have to be preferred to the zona-free oocytes ones.</p><p>Takahashi reported an &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin clustering at the point of gamete contact on ZP-free oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The presence of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin on the capacitated and AR sperm suggests another non exclusive interpretation. The cluster of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin at the point of gamete contact could also be due to the superimposition of oocyte and sperm &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin detection. The fact that &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 is not detectable on the surface of fresh sperm may explain why clusterisation was not reported when using non capacitated sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In our study, the fertilizing index of AT ZP-free oocytes was reduced only when sperm had been preincubated with GoH3, supporting the existence of a direct effect of this antibody on sperm functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The presence of functional &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin on mouse sperm raises the question about the role of this integrin in gamete interaction. It appears as one piece of a multimolecular binding and fusion complex which should be present on both oocyte and sperm membranes. As it can be bypassed by the oocyte membrane reorganization upon ZP removal, we can hypothesize that binding of its ligand to oolemma &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin is one of the first steps of gamete membrane interaction process. The only essential molecules that had been recognized so far for sperm-egg binding and fusion are the CD9 tetraspanin on the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and on the sperm membrane, the Izumo immunoglobulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which are up to date the unique unilaterally distributed molecules. It could be interesting to study its relation to the sperm &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin. A similar interest should be granted to the integrin potential ligands on the sperm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The function blocking rat mAbs against the integrin &#x003b1;6 (GoH3) or polyclonal goat anti-&#x003b2;1 integrin (L16) subunits were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems (France) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA) respectively.
