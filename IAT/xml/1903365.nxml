Apoptosis is important for tissue morphogenesis during development, maintenance of homeostasis in adulthood, and defense and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In apoptosis, activation of a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases induces the proteolytic cleavage of many critical proteins, leading to cell suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In mammals, 15 caspases have been identified. Of these, caspases-2, -8, -9 and -10 play roles as initiators, while caspases-3, -6 and -7 function as downstream effectors. The activation of effector caspases is the converging point of two major signal pathways: the extrinsic pathway initiated by ligation of cell surface receptors called "death receptors", including Fas (APO-1/CD95) and receptors for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and the intrinsic pathway triggered by cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol.</p><p>The extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway following Fas ligation has been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Oligomerization of Fas by its natural ligand or an agonistic antibody recruits the adaptor molecule FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein, also termed MORT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to the death domain (DD) of the Fas intracellular region. Procaspase-8 (also known as FLICE/MACH1/Mch5), which is an inactive zymogen, associates in turn with FADD by interactions between their death effector domains (DED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Within the Fas-FADD-procaspase-8 complex, called the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], procaspase-8 undergoes auto-cleavage to convert to an active form. Through cleavage, activated caspase-8 activates downstream effector caspases and Bid, a member of the Bcl-2 family, eventually leading to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Deficiency in caspase-8 leads to suppression of Fas-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Although most studies examining the extrinsic apoptosis pathway have utilized mammalian systems, homologs of the apoptosis signaling molecules, including death receptors and caspases, have recently been identified in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), including two death receptors, the zebrafish hematopoietic death receptor (ZH-DR) and the ovarian TNFR (OTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Caspase-3 and two additional caspases that are homologous to human caspases-1 and -5 have been characterized in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Caspases-3, -6, -7 and -9 are also identified and characterized in salmon and sea bass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Several genes with homology to mammalian regulators of apoptosis, including <italic>caspase-8</italic>, <italic>bid </italic>and <italic>fadd</italic>, have been identified in the zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, the apoptotic machinery appears to be conserved between fish and mammals. No extensive functional analyses of these apoptotic regulators have been performed in fish.</p><p>To understand the general mechanisms regulating cell death in vertebrates, we studied the apoptotic machinery governing the extrinsic signaling pathway in fish. In this study, we identified and characterized orthologs of mammalian Fas, FADD and caspase-8 that might be indispensable for extrinsic apoptotic signaling in Medaka fish (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>). We report that these molecules act as pro-apoptotic molecules and are able to substitute for the functions of their mammalian counterparts in mammalian cells. These results suggest the evolutionary conservation between fish and mammals of the core components essential for the extrinsic pathway. We also discuss the development of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in conjunction with the appearance of vertebrates during evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Primary structure of Medaka Fas, FADD, and Casp8 molecules</title><p>We searched the GenBank DNA database for the fish homologs of mammalian <italic>FAS </italic>(<italic>TNFRSF6</italic>), <italic>FADD </italic>and <italic>caspase-8 </italic>(<italic>CASP8</italic>), three essential components of Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling. We identified an expressed sequence tag (EST) clone ([GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AU176749">AU176749</ext-link>]) similar to <italic>FAS</italic>, an EST clone ([GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AU242372">AU242372</ext-link>]) similar to <italic>FADD </italic>and two EST clones ([GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BJ006125">BJ006125</ext-link>] and [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AV670945">AV670945</ext-link>]) similar to <italic>CASP8 </italic>in the Medaka cDNA library. Sequencing of these EST clones confirmed that the full-length cDNAs encoded open reading frames of 306, 192, and 481 amino acids, exhibiting homology to Fas, FADD and caspase-8, respectively, by a BLAST search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Protein structure analysis using the Pfam database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] showed that the predicted Fas-like molecule contained a DD in the cytoplasmic region, the FADD-like molecule possessed both DED and DD, while the caspase-8-like molecule contained two DEDs and a protease domain. Therefore, these proteins might be orthologs to mammalian Fas, FADD and caspase-8; we termed the molecules encoded by these cDNA clones Medaka Fas, FADD and caspase-8. Alignments of the Medaka and human Fas, FADD and caspase-8 molecules revealed 24%, 34% and 34% identity and 42%, 52% and 52% similarity at the amino acid sequence level, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Comparison of Medaka Fas to the zebrafish death receptors, zebrafish hematopoietic death receptor (ZH-DR) and ovarian tumor necrosis factor receptor (OTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] identified 22% and 20% identity at the amino acid level, respectively. These results suggest that Medaka Fas is more similar to human Fas than to fish ZH-DR and OTR. Thus, we identified structurally similar molecules potentially orthologous to mammalian Fas, FADD and caspase-8, core components of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, in the Medaka fish.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid sequence comparison of Fas, FADD and caspase-8 between Medaka and humans</bold>.

By comparing the genomic and the cDNA sequences, we determined the organization of the Medaka <italic>fas</italic>, <italic>fadd </italic>and <italic>casp8 </italic>genes. The Medaka <italic>fas </italic>gene consisted of 9 exons and 8 introns, corresponding to those in the human and chicken <italic>FAS </italic>gene with coincident splice junction sites (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2B</xref>). The nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron boundaries in the Medaka <italic>fas </italic>gene [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>] completely conformed to the GT-AG rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The Medaka <italic>fadd </italic>gene possessed two exons, identical to that of the human gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Additionally, search of the GenBank and Ensembl genome databases revealed that the <italic>fadd </italic>genes in the human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), West African clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>) and two species of fish, stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) consisted of two exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In the Medaka <italic>fadd </italic>gene, the GT-AG rule was also observed at the exon-intron boundaries [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. By comparing genomic sequences to the obtained Medaka <italic>casp8 </italic>cDNA sequence, we confirmed that the <italic>casp8 </italic>gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, 2F</xref>). The nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron boundaries of the Medaka <italic>casp8 </italic>gene agree with the GT-AG rule [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]. The genomic organization of the Medaka <italic>casp8 </italic>gene was similar to that of the human and chicken <italic>CASP8 </italic>genes with mostly coincident splice junction sites, but additional exons comprising a portion of the first DED and the protease domain were present in the Medaka <italic>casp8 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). We also determined the genomic structure of the stickleback and zebrafish <italic>casp8 </italic>genes, and detected additional exons in the stickleback <italic>casp8 </italic>gene but not the zebrafish <italic>casp8 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). This corresponded to the phylogenetic relationships, indicating that Medaka and stickleback are more closely related to each other than either of them is to zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, these conserved structures of the <italic>Fas</italic>, <italic>FADD </italic>and <italic>Casp8 </italic>genes within vertebrates strongly suggest that these genes share their origin respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Analyses of the genomic structure of the Medaka <italic>fas, fadd </italic>and <italic>casp8 </italic>genes</bold>.

The human <italic>FAS </italic>gene localizes to chromosome 10 (Chr. 10), according to LocusLink (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Search of the zebrafish genome sequence in the Ensembl database identified a <italic>fas-like </italic>gene on scaffold862 that was highly homologous to the human and Medaka <italic>FAS </italic>genes [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>].

The predicted amino acid sequence of the Casp8-like molecule was highly similar to the protease domain of mammalian caspase-8 proteins (Casp8) by BLASTP searches. Phylogenetic studies also suggested that the protease domain of the Casp8-like molecule is most similar to that of CASP8 but not to that of other caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The putative orthologous genes for this Medaka <italic>casp8-like </italic>gene were also found in the fugu, stickleback and zebrafish genomes, localizing next to the <italic>casp8 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]). These gene products similar to Casp8 lack two DED motifs in its N-terminus but contain a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which were revealed by the InterProScan program using the Interpro database (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In the present study, this <italic>casp8-like </italic>gene was tentatively termed as <italic>card-casp8</italic>. Therefore, we suggest that the <italic>card-casp8 </italic>gene is derived from a copy occurred by a tandem duplication of the ancestral <italic>casp8 </italic>gene in the fish lineage, and that one of the duplicated copies might acquire a CARD and probably a new function at the same time.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular phylogenetic analysis of Fas, FADD and Casp8</title><p>Domain organizations, genomic structures and syntenies between the vertebrate genomes strongly suggest that these Medaka genes identified in this study are true orthologs for <italic>Fas</italic>, <italic>FADD </italic>and <italic>Casp8</italic>. Molecular phylogenetic analyses for these genes also reinforced the orthologies of these genes. For constructing a molecular phylogenetic tree for FAS and FADD proteins, we used Fas and FADD sequences manually predicted from the chicken, zebrafish and stickleback genomes together with published catfish (<italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>), frog, human and mouse Fas and FADD sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>]. A molecular phylogenetic tree for the Fas and FADD families based on an alignment of the death domain indicated that Medaka Fas and FADD were most similar to fish Fas and FADD, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The generated tree suggests that Medaka Fas is closest to zebrafish Fas-like molecule (bootstrap value = 44%), and supports its orthology for Fas proteins encoded in the genome of amphibians and amniotes (bootstrap value = 61%). Additionally, we could not find any typical death receptors bearing a DD in invertebrates from the public databases (data not shown). This was supported by reports describing no orthologs of the death receptors in spite of extensive screens of decoded genomes, even in the genome of <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, a close relative of vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, these lines of evidence suggest that the death receptor such as Fas appears early during vertebrate evolution.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular phylogenetic analysis of Fas and FADD molecules</bold>. (A) A molecular phylogenetic tree of Fas and FADD generated by the neighbor-joining method based on an alignment of death domains.

However, alignment of the C-terminal amino acid sequences of these FADD molecules revealed diversity among mammals and other vertebrates including fish (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In the C-terminal portion of the molecule neighboring the DD, human and mouse FADD are phosphorylated at Ser residues (194 in human and 191 in mouse) for the regulation of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This C-terminal extension is not present in birds, frogs, or fish. A gene encoding a putative FADD is also found in an ascidia, <italic>Molgula tectiformis</italic>. Although the <italic>Molgula </italic>FADD molecule certainly possesses both DED and DD motifs, it is highly divergent from that of vertebrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Moreover, a gene for FADD was identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but the structure of <italic>Drosophila </italic>FADD is distinct from those of chordate FADD molecules because of lacking a definite DED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore, the origin of FADD, which might be present in a common ancestor of chordates, is older than that of Fas, which may have arisen in the vertebrate lineage. Similarly, Medaka <italic>casp8 </italic>is suggested to be a member of the caspase-8 and caspase-10 family, (caspase-10 is a putative paralogous gene of caspase-8). Thus, the genes encoding core components of the extrinsic signaling pathway, Fas, FADD and Casp8, are present in the fish genome but are not completely in the non-vertebrate chordate and other invertebrate genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka Fas, FADD and Casp8</title><p>As the predicted amino acid sequences of Medaka Fas, FADD and Casp8 exhibit homology to their mammalian counterparts, these proteins likely play an equally critical role in the regulation of apoptosis. To confirm the universal function of Fas, FADD and Casp8 in vertebrates, we investigated the killing activity of these Medaka molecules following exogenous expression in mammalian cells. We generated several expression constructs coexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and transiently introduced them into mammalian cell lines. The cell viability of transfectants expressing Medaka molecules was examined by monitoring EGFP expression by microscopy. The pME18S-h/oFas and pME18S-hFAS plasmids, carrying the chimeric <italic>h/oFas </italic>gene and human <italic>FAS </italic>cDNA, respectively, or the control pME18S empty vector were cotransfected with a construct carrying the <italic>egfp </italic>gene into mouse NIH3T3 cells. After 48 h, transfected cells were stimulated with the agonistic anti-human FAS antibody CH11, a potent apoptotic stimulant specific for human FAS-expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], for 14 h. The viability of transfectants bearing the control empty vector was unaffected by the presence of CH11, which does not recognize mouse Fas on NIH3T3 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, panel b). In contrast, treatment with CH11 induced cell death in transfectants expressing chimeric h/oFas molecules. Both a reduction in the numbers of EGFP-positive cells and an increase in the numbers of apoptotic bodies were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, panels d and e), comparable to those changes seen in human FAS-expressing transfectants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, panel g). To confirm that the cell death induced by chimeric h/oFas is apoptotic cell death, we examined caspase-3 (Casp3) activation, which occurs during apoptosis, in transfectants. The pME18S-h/oFas or pME18S-hFAS plasmid was cotransfected with a construct carrying the <italic>lbr-egfp </italic>fusion gene into NIH3T3 cells. After 48 h, transfected cells were stimulated with or without CH11 for 12 h. Activation of Casp3 in cells expressing EGFP in the nucleus was analyzed by immunocytochemical staining with an anti-cleaved Casp3 antibody. Following proteolytic processing of the inactive zymogen, Casp3 forms subunits and becomes active. Following treatment with CH11, we detected activated Casp3 in EGFP-positive cells coexpressing either h/oFas or hFAS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). However, no Casp3 activation was observed in EGFP-negative or untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These data indicate that chimeric h/oFas is a functional molecule with killing activity; the putative death domain in Medaka Fas cytoplasmic tail is capable of transmitting apoptotic signals to mammalian cells in response to exogenous stimuli.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Functional analyses of Medaka Fas, FADD and Casp8</bold>. (A) Schematic diagram of the plasmid constructs for the expression of human and Medaka chimeric Fas (h/oFas), Flag/oFADD-EGFP and EGFP/oCasp8 proteins. The chimeric h/oFas consists of the extracellular domain of human FAS and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of Medaka Fas. The Flag/oFADD-EGFP construct translates both Flag-tagged Medaka FADD and EGFP molecules from a bicistronic mRNA. The EGFP/oCasp8 is a fusion of Medaka caspase-8 with EGFP at the N-terminus.

As HeLa cells preserve the Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway, they are suitable for examining the potency of pro-apoptotic molecules such as FADD and caspase-8. Exogenous expression of Medaka FADD induced cell death in HeLa transfectants, resulting in reductions in the numbers of EGFP-positive cells associated with increased apoptotic bodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, panel a). The addition of zVAD-fmk, however, inhibited the killing activity of Medaka FADD, permitting the survival of the majority of EGFP-positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, panel b). Using MEF cells isolated from both wild-type and <italic>Casp8</italic>-deficient embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], we examined the pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka FADD. We assumed that <italic>Casp8</italic>-deficient MEF cells, but not wild-type MEF cells, are unable to transmit apoptotic signals triggered by Medaka FADD. Indeed, ectopically expressed Medaka FADD induced cell death in wild-type MEFs, as evidenced by the reduced numbers of EGFP-positive cells and the appearance of apoptotic bodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, panel c). In contrast, Medaka FADD failed to induce cell death in <italic>Casp8</italic>-deficient MEF cells, as the majority of EGFP-positive cells survived and retained normal morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, panel d). To confirm the pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka FADD, we examined the DNA content of cells expressing Medaka FADD by flow cytometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). Overexpression of Medaka FADD in HeLa cells increased the cellular population in a sub-G<sub>1 </sub>fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, 16.0% in panel b), one indicator of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In contrast, coexpression of the anti-apoptotic molecule p35, a known pan-caspase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], with Medaka FADD reduced this population of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, 3.6% in panel c). These data indicate that Medaka FADD is able to transmit apoptotic signals into transfected cells via activation of mammalian caspase-8.</p><p>To assess the pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka caspase-8, the EGFP/oCasp8 fusion protein was expressed in HeLa cells in the absence or presence of either zVAD-fmk or cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Exogenous expression of Medaka Casp8 induced cell death in transfected cells. However, Casp8-induced killing was inhibited by both zVAD-fmk and CrmA. Following transfection, the number of EGFP-positive cells was reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, panel a), while the number of EGFP-positive cells increased after culture in zVAD-fmk or following CrmA coexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, panels b and c). As CrmA acts as a specific inhibitor by blocking the protease activity of mammalian caspase-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], our data indicate that protease activity is absolutely required for Medaka caspase-8-mediated cell death. Aggregates of death-effector filaments, identified in a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], were observed in the surviving cells that expressed EGFP/oCasp8 in the presence of either zVAD-fmk or CrmA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, panel d and data not shown). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, expression of Medaka caspase-8 led to an increase in the sub-G<sub>1 </sub>fraction in transfected HeLa cells, but this was abrogated by the co-expression of p35 (12.8% and 3.5% in panels d and e). These data suggest that Medaka caspase-8 is a pro-apoptotic molecule requiring homotypic oligomerization, a characteristic shared by mammalian DED-containing molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified and characterized the DISC components Fas, FADD and caspase-8 from Medaka fish. Our determination of the genomic structure of the <italic>fas</italic>, <italic>fadd </italic>and <italic>caspase-8 </italic>genes revealed that the genomic organization of these genes is preserved between fish and mammals. These gene products also exhibited similar protein structures and functions to their mammalian counterparts. In cytotoxic assays, Medaka Fas, FADD and caspase-8 exhibited pro-apoptotic activity even in mammalian cells. Thus, these results clearly showed that the apoptotic machinery downstream of cell surface death receptors is functional in fish as well as mammals.</p><p>Six death receptors have been identified in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], and it was assumed that at least one fish ortholog of mammalian death receptors could be found. Indeed, two death receptors, ZH-DR and OTR have been previously identified in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A recent report proposed that they are counterparts of mammalian TRAIL receptors, but not Fas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this study, we identified a molecule exhibiting the closest homology to mammalian Fas. We concluded that this molecule is a bone fide fish ortholog for mammalian Fas by several lines of evidence: its domain structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), similarity of its genomic structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the conservation of synteny of the <italic>Fas </italic>gene-containing genomic region between humans and Medaka (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), a molecular phylogenetical evidence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and the functionality of the Medaka Fas death domain for the transmission of apoptotic signals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, fish possess several death receptors including Fas that show similar protein structures and potencies to mammalian receptors. In contrast to the fish, no death receptors containing a DD motif have yet been identified in the insect, ascidian and sea urchin genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Therefore, we argue that death receptors, such as Fas, appear to be unique to vertebrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Additionally, further analysis in the genome of jawless vertebrates such as lamprey will be helpful for confirming our inference.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of evolutionary insights provided in this study</bold>. The constructed molecular phylogenetic trees for Fas, FADD and Casp8 colored with green, red and blue lines, respectively, are shown together. Gene rearrangements and the appearance of divergent genes, domains, or domain architectures are indicated by an arrow at the appropriate evolutionary timepoint. Death receptors including Fas appear to be unique to vertebrates because no orthologs of death receptors have been identified in the decoded genomes of non-vertebrates [41,42,53,54]. Gene rearrangements of the segment including the <italic>fadd </italic>gene were detected by comparative gene mapping in the present study. In addition, the extended C-terminal portion of FADD, which is phosphorylated for the regulation of mitosis [43,44], is uniquely detected in mammals. Early during vertebrate evolution, the <italic>casp8 </italic>and related genes arose from tandem duplication events of an ancestral <italic>casp8 </italic>gene as described [34]. Based on our computational analysis, it was hypothesized that the <italic>card-casp8 </italic>gene was originally generated in the fish lineage by local duplication.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-8-141-6"/></fig><p>Members of the FADD protein family have been identified and characterized in mammals, amphibians and insects. Although <italic>Drosophila </italic>FADD (dFADD, also termed CG12297-PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] physically interacts with and activates DREDD, a <italic>Drosophila </italic>counterpart of caspase-8, it does not interact with mammalian death receptors or caspase-8 in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. There are no orthologs of the death receptor in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It was recently reported that dFADD acts in concert with DREDD in immune defenses against bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], indicating a functional difference in FADD molecules between these species. We determined that Medaka FADD is able to induce apoptosis of mammalian cells. In addition, mammalian caspase-8 is required for the pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka FADD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which demonstrates that FADD function is conserved between fish and mammals. We previously demonstrated that <italic>Xenopus </italic>FADD could substitute functionally for mammalian FADD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. There is an evolutional divergence in the function of these proteins between vertebrates and insects. We identified <italic>fadd</italic>-like genes in the ascidian <italic>Molgula tectiformis</italic>, sea urchin <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus </italic>and cnidaria <italic>Hydra magnipapillata </italic>in the GenBank database ([see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>] and data not shown). The predicted amino acid sequences of these gene products reveal conservation of the DED and DD, but not the C-terminal extension present in mammals. This might be a universal function of FADD that has been conserved from simple Metazoans to vertebrates during evolution. We hypothesize that the adaptor molecule FADD has two functions; one is required for the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in vertebrates, while the second has not yet been defined, but is broadly conserved in bilaterian.</p><p>In humans, the <italic>CASP8</italic>, <italic>caspase-10 </italic>(<italic>CASP10</italic>) and <italic>CFLAR </italic>(also termed c-FLIP) genes, which localize in a cluster at the same chromosomal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], are thought to be arisen by duplication of an ancestral gene because of their common unique protein structure consisting of two DEDs and a protease domain and high similarity in amino acid sequences. In both birds and amphibians, these <italic>casp8</italic>, <italic>casp10 </italic>and <italic>cflar </italic>genes, which map to the same chromosome, have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We have searched for <italic>casp10 </italic>and <italic>cflar </italic>genes in fish, identifying <italic>casp10</italic>-like and <italic>cflar </italic>genes in the genomic database of zebrafish, Tetraodon and fugu. In these fish, the <italic>casp10 </italic>and <italic>cflar </italic>genes are uniquely segregated to distinct chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In Medaka, the <italic>casp10-like </italic>and <italic>cflar-like </italic>genes were also found in the genome database, but they localized in the contigs distinct from the <italic>casp8 </italic>gene (data not shown), suggesting the chromosomal segregation of these three genes in Medaka. Interestingly, we identified a gene, which encodes a protease domain highly similar to that of Casp8, next to the <italic>casp8 </italic>gene in the Medaka chromosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Based on the full-length sequence data for the <italic>casp8-like </italic>gene, we concluded that this gene represents a distinct caspase type containing the CARD motif from caspase-8 and caspase-10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) and termed as <italic>card-casp8</italic>. Moreover, this gene product exhibited pro-apoptotic activity similar to Casp8 [see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>]. Although the present study does not fully address the function of CARD-Casp8, our data suggest that the <italic>casp8 </italic>and <italic>card-casp8 </italic>genes diverged from an ancestral gene by local duplication (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]). The mechanisms by which caspase-8 and caspase-10 act independently or compensate for each other in these organisms and by which cflar regulates the activation of these caspases are important to understand the biological significance of these molecules in vertebrates. Further functional analyses of caspase-8 and its related molecules including CARD-Casp8 in fish will help resolve the relationship of caspase function to the divergence observed throughout evolution.</p><p>In the catfish, <italic>fas</italic>-, <italic>fadd</italic>- and <italic>casp8-like </italic>genes have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. As the amino acid sequences predicted from the catfish <italic>fas</italic>-like and <italic>fadd</italic>-like genes exhibited 37% and 43% identities to the Medaka counterparts, these genes are probably also orthologs of mammalian Fas and FADD. The functions of these catfish molecules, however, have not yet been defined. The catfish <italic>casp8</italic>-like gene is not likely to be an ortholog of mammalian <italic>caspase-8 </italic>because this gene product has no DED but possesses a CARD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Regardless, our study strongly suggests the evolutionary conservation of the pro-apoptotic ability of Fas, FADD and caspase-8, the core components of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, in Medaka fish. Our data is further supported by a recent report indicating that zebrafish components required for extrinsic pathway induce cell death in embryos when overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the <italic>fas</italic>, <italic>fadd </italic>and <italic>caspase-8 </italic>genes, the <italic>caspase-3 </italic>and <italic>bid </italic>genes, whose products play roles as effector and amplifier, respectively, downstream of caspase-8, were identified in the database ([GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAC00948">BAC00948</ext-link>], [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAC00949">BAC00949</ext-link>], and [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BJ707272">BJ707272</ext-link>]). The Medaka <italic>fas ligand-like </italic>gene was also detected in the Ensembl genome database ([Ensembl: UTOLAPRE05100113859]), and its predicted amino acid sequence was highly similar to Fas ligand previously identified in zebrafish and flounder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Thus, the molecular machinery required for the extrinsic pathway fully exists in Medaka fish, and Medaka is a representative model vertebrate suitable for studies of gene function and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Medaka will serve as a powerful tool in which to dissect both the basic mechanisms and the complexities of apoptosis induction throughout evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study clearly demonstrated that Medaka Fas, FADD and casapse-8 are functional molecules possessing pro-apoptotic capacity. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, Medaka and probably other fishes have completed these core components essential for the extrinsic pathway while chordates and other invertebrates lack one or more components in their genomes.

The pCMV-EGFP/oCasp8 plasmid was created by inserting the Medaka <italic>caspase-8 </italic>cDNA, amplified by PCR, into pEGFP-C1. To test the killing activity of Medaka Fas, we generated a chimeric gene <italic>h/oFas </italic>by PCR amplification. The DNA fragment encoding the extracellular region of human Fas was ligated to the DNA fragment encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of Medaka Fas. This fragment was cloned into pME18S to generate pME18S-h/oFas. The viral gene encoding CrmA, the kind gift of Dr. D. J. Pickup (Duke University), was cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] to generate pCX-CrmA.
