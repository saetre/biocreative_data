NALCN, a member of a protein family that is structurally related to the &#x003b1;1 subunits of voltage-gated sodium/calcium channels, was recently shown to regulate the resting membrane potentials by mediating sodium leak and the firing of mouse neurons. We identified a role for the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> NALCN homologues NCA-1 and NCA-2 in the propagation of neuronal activity from cell bodies to synapses. Loss of NCA activities leads to reduced synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions and frequent halting in locomotion. In vivo calcium imaging experiments further indicate that while calcium influx in the cell bodies of egg-laying motorneurons is unaffected by altered NCA activity, synaptic calcium transients are significantly reduced in <italic>nca</italic> loss-of-function mutants and increased in <italic>nca</italic> gain-of-function mutants. NCA-1 localizes along axons and is enriched at nonsynaptic regions. Its localization and function depend on UNC-79, and UNC-80, a novel conserved protein that is also enriched at nonsynaptic regions.

Therefore, both UNC-80 and UNC-79 are likely conserved auxiliary components of the NCA family channels.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Are the Functions of NCA Channels Conserved in Mammalian Neurons?</title><p>NCA-1 and NCA-2 have close sequence homologues in other invertebrate and vertebrate, including human. The mammalian member of this family, NALCN, has recently been characterized physiologically in HEK293 cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060055-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. In spite of its sequence homology and similar topology to the pore-forming &#x003b1;1 subunits of VGCCs, NALCN forms a voltage-insensitive and nonselective cation channel.</p><p>Two lines of indirect evidence support the hypothesis that <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> NCA and its mammalian homologues share common functional properties. First, <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> NCA proteins show at least similar properties to NALCN proteins when heterologously expressed in mammalian cell culture. In HEK293T cells, transfecting NALCN, or co-transfecting NCA-1 and UNC-80 induced cell death that was blocked by the NALCN blockers verapamil and gadolinium. Conversely, expressing mammalian NALCN proteins in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> could substitute functionally for the NCA proteins. Specifically, wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> expressing a mouse cDNA that carries the <italic>hp102</italic> equivalent mutation (NALCN(R329Q)) in neurons exhibited a locomotion pattern with exaggerated body bends, reminiscent of the <italic>nca(gf)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060055-se001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060055-sv013">Video S13</xref>). Thus <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> NCA and its mammalian homologues can mediate similar physiological functions, consistent with the possibility that NCA family proteins share similar channel properties.</p><p>Given the conservation in the functional properties of NCA family members, it is reasonable to speculate that these channels may also carry out similar functions in neurons. Our current studies suggest a specific function for the NCA channel in transmitting and regulating excitability along <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> neuronal processes, but do not rule out the possibility that NCA also controls neuronal firing. Since our calcium imaging analysis was performed under conditions that stimulated the constitutive firing of HSNs, an altered firing ability could be masked by the hyperactivation of neurons. While the enriched localization of NCA-1 and UNC-80 at nonsynaptic regions along axons is consistent with the propagation role of the NCA channel, we do not exclude the possibility that the reduced synaptic transmission at GABAergic and cholinergic NMJs in <italic>nca(lf)</italic> mutants may result from a combination of deficits in the propagation of depolarization signals, neuronal firing, and even vesicle release. The mouse NALCN affects the resting potential and controls the excitability/firing rate of hippocampal neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060055-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;; whether it is also involved in excitation propagation, however, is not examined. Therefore, it will be interesting to determine the subcellular localization of mouse NALCN channels and to examine whether they are also involved in such processes in mammalian neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains.</title><p>All strains were cultured at 22 &#x000b0;C unless specified otherwise. <italic>hp102</italic> was originally identified in a genetic screen for <italic>hpIs3</italic> defective mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060055-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; and was outcrossed eight times against wild-type N2. <italic>unc-80(hp369)</italic> and <italic>unc-79(hp424)</italic> were identified in a <italic>hp102</italic> suppressor screen and outcrossed three times against N2. <italic>e625</italic>, <italic>e1069</italic>, and <italic>e1272</italic> were identified through abnormal locomotion in previous <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> screens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060055-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>gk9</italic> and <italic>gk5</italic> were generated by the Gene Knockout Consortium and were outcrossed three times against N2. <italic>tm1591</italic> was generated by National Bioresource Project for the Nematode and was outcrossed once against N2.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Identification, mapping, and cloning of <italic>hp102</italic> and <italic>unc-77(e625).</italic></title><p><italic>hp102</italic> mutants were identified from an active zone marker <italic>hpIs3</italic> screen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060055-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.
