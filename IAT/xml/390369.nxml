It occurs mainly in the nucleolus, a specialized compartment in the nucleus. Current knowledge of ribosome biogenesis is largely derived from studies of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c2">2</xref>). This process starts with the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes by RNA polymerase I and III into 35S pre-rRNA and 5S pre-rRNA. The 35S precursor is extensively modified and cleaved into the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNA through the coordinated action of a variety of endonucleases, exonucleases, RNA helicases and other protein factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f1">1</xref>).</p><p>The U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), together with associated proteins, plays a central role in the 18S rRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c2">2</xref>) and is essential for the early cleavage events at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c3">3</xref>). Recently, protein complexes that contain the U3 snoRNA and participate in the biogenesis of 40S ribosome subunits have been identified. Dragon and colleagues identified a large nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (RNP), called the small subunit (SSU) processome, required for 18S ribosomal RNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>). It contains the U3 snoRNA and at least 28 proteins, including 17 polypeptides (Utp1&#x02013;17, for &#x02018;U three protein&#x02019;) that had not previously been shown to be associated with U3 or implicated in pre-rRNA processing events. We have recently discovered that the SSU processome consists of at least three distinct &#x02018;sub-complexes&#x02019; and each physically associates with U3 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>). Grandi and colleagues reported 90S pre-ribosomes formed at very early stages of ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c6">6</xref>). The purified 90S pre-ribosomes contained not only the U3-specific proteins, but also other nucleolar proteins with a known role in 18S rRNA processing and 40S subunit assembly and additional uncharacterized proteins. However, seven components identified in the SSU processome (Snu13p, Utp3p, Utp5p, Utp7p, Utp11p, Utp14p and Utp16p) were not found in the isolated 90S pre-ribosomes.</p><p>In addition to the U3 snoRNA, snoRNAs U14, snR10 and snR30 are required for early cleavages at sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> and hence also contribute to 18S rRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c9">9</xref>). However, the protein complexes containing these RNAs are less well-characterized than the U3-containing SSU processome. Furthermore, despite the application of several proteomic approaches to characterize early pre-ribosomal protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c6">6</xref>) it is likely that not all proteins involved have been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>).</p><p>We recently carried out a large-scale survey of non-coding RNA processing phenotypes in yeast mutants using a microarray-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c10">10</xref>). A mutated version of <italic>YDR365c</italic>, a gene that is co-regulated with established rRNA processing factors at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c11">11</xref>), displayed an array phenotype suggesting involvement in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c10">10</xref>). Ydr365cp has not been identified in the protein complexes described above, although it has been associated with different rRNA processing factors in other large-scale studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c13">13</xref>). Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that <italic>YDR365c</italic> is required for the early cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> that lead to 18S rRNA synthesis, although it does not appear to be a core component of the SSU proces some. Owing to its apparently direct role in 18S rRNA biogenesis, we have named the gene <italic>ESF1</italic> (Eighteen S rRNA Factor 1).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, media and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strains used for phenotypic analysis in this study are R1158 (wild type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c14">14</xref>) and TH&#x0005f;2070, the <italic>tetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub>-<italic>ESF1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c10">10</xref>).

The encoded Esf1 polypeptide has a coiled-coil region located between residue 426 and 492, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal near its N-terminus (from residue 447 to 464). We identified clear sequence counterparts in other organisms, including <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. The multiple sequence alignment reveals what appear to be several discrete conserved regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f2">2</xref>). In a systematic deletion analysis, Giaever and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c20">20</xref>) reported that <italic>ESF1</italic> is essential for viability.

To investigate this further, we analyzed the steady-state levels of mature and precursor rRNA molecules by northern blotting. Probes specific for mature 18S and 25S rRNAs confirmed that the level of 18S rRNA was dramatically reduced upon depletion of Esf1p, relative to 25S rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f3">3</xref>). Hybridizing the membrane with oligonucleotides complementary to D-A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>-A<sub>3</sub> regions (probes DA2 and A2A3) revealed that 20S pre-rRNA (the direct precursor to 18S rRNA) and the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA (normally a precursor to the 25S rRNA), were not detected in the <italic>tetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub>-<italic>ESF1</italic> mutant. We also observed accumulation of 35S pre-rRNA and appearance of aberrant 23S pre-rRNA in the mutant. The 23S pre-rRNA is generated by cleavage at A<sub>3</sub> in the 35S precursor without the early cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c2">2</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>ESF1</italic> is required for pre-rRNA processing at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> that lead to production of the mature 18S rRNA.</p><p>To further confirm that depletion of Esf1p affects pre-rRNA processing, we carried out pulse&#x02013;chase labeling of the pre-rRNA with &#x0005b;methyl-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methionine. In wild-type cells, the 35S precursor was processed into 25S and 18S rRNAs in &#x0223c;5 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f4">4</xref>). In contrast, <italic>tetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub>-<italic>ESF1</italic> mutant contained very little 20S pre-rRNA and 18S rRNA at any time point examined (up to 15 min). The formation of 25S rRNA was delayed, but it was produced much more rapidly than 18S rRNA. Processing of the 35S precursor was also delayed in the Esf1p-depleted strain, perhaps because cleavage at A<sub>3</sub> in the absence of cleavage at A<sub>2</sub> is not the primary pathway. This would also explain the delay in 25S formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f4">4</xref>), and the slight reduction in steady-state 27S levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of Esf1 does not affect the steady-state levels of box C/D snoRNAs U3, U14 and H/ACA snoRNAs snR10, snR30</title><p>To assess whether Esf1 is involved in the biogenesis or maintenance of the snoRNAs U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 &#x0005b;required for cleavage at A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c9">9</xref>)&#x0005d;, the steady-state levels of each RNA were monitored in the <italic>tetO</italic><sub><italic>7</italic></sub>-<italic>ESF1</italic> mutant strain.

Esf1p&#x02013;TAP co-purified with a number of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f6">6</xref>), including Nsr1p, Krr1p, Nop1p, Utp22p and Puf6p, all of which are involved in 18S rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c26">26</xref>).

As positive controls, we also affinity-purified Utp18p&#x02013;TAP, Utp22p&#x02013;TAP and Nop58p&#x02013;TAP, which are known to be associated with the U3 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>). Northern blotting revealed that Esf1p&#x02013;TAP, as well as the three positive controls, co-purified with U3 and U14 snoRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f7">7</xref>). The protein&#x02013;RNA associations were stable after washes in 400 mM NaCl. In contrast, TAP-purifications of two other proteins (Krr1p and Nop14p), which are also involved in 18S rRNA biogenesis, did not contain U3 and U14 snoRNAs in the precipitates, in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>). Other negative controls (a wild-type strain with no tag and other unrelated proteins Ths1p&#x02013;TAP, Pus1p&#x02013;TAP and Gln1p&#x02013;TAP) also failed to precipitate appreciable amounts of these RNAs. We also detected U14 snoRNA in the Utp18p&#x02013;TAP and Utp22p&#x02013;TAP pulldowns, even under very high stringent tandem affinity purifications in which a high-speed centrifugation step was added to the TAP procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>), which we note conflicts with previously published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>).</p><p>We also detected trace amount of 5&#x02032;-ETS-A<sub>0</sub> and 5&#x02032;-ETS-A<sub>1</sub> in the Esf1p&#x02013;TAP precipitate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f7">7</xref>), which we have previously shown to associate with components of the SSU processome in the TAP purifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>). However, we did not detect 20S precursor in the Esf1p immunoprecipitates (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We present several lines of evidence that Esf1p is involved directly in 18S rRNA biogenesis. First, depletion of Esf1p led to a virtually complete loss of 20S and 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursors, suggesting that the cleavage at site A<sub>2</sub> was blocked in the mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f3">3</xref>). In addition, the aberrant 23S RNA species and 35S precursor accumulated in the mutant, indicating inhibition of cleavage events at A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c2">2</xref>). Although 18S rRNA biogenesis was affected in the mutant, 25S rRNA levels remained largely normal, suggesting that the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs are formed normally following cleavage at A<sub>3</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f3">3</xref>). Studies of kinetics of rRNA formation in the mutant also suggested that Esf1p mainly affected the biogenesis of 18S rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f4">4</xref>).</p><p>Among the proteins that co-purified with Esf1p, several are involved in 18S rRNA biogenesis. The nucleolar protein Nop1p is a component of the SSU processome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>). Nop1p is also a core component of all Box C/D snoRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c2">2</xref>), which include both U3 and U14 snoRNPs. Krr1p is required for 40S ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c24">24</xref>) and subsequent export to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>) and was found in the 90S pre-ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>), although in our hands it does not co-purify with U3 or U14 RNAs, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c6">6</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f7">7</xref>). Nsr1p, a homolog of mammalian nucleolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c26">26</xref>), contains two RRMs (RNA recognition motifs) and a glycine/arginine-rich (GAR) domain. It is required for 18S rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c26">26</xref>). Utp22p is also involved in maturation of pre-18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c10">10</xref>) and has been described as a component of the SSU processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c27">27</xref>), although we have previously identified Utp22p in a distinct processome &#x02018;sub-complex&#x02019; containing Rrp7p and yeast casein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c5">5</xref>). Aside from Utp22p and Nop1p, we did not detect association of Esf1p with any of the components of the SSU processome, indicating that it is not a core component of this large RNP.</p><p>Hazbun and colleagues previously identified an Esf1p-associated complex which differs dramatically from ours, containing Bfr2p, Enp2p, Hca4p, Lcp5p, Nop58p and Utp9p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c21">21</xref>). Among these proteins, Hca4p, Lcp5p, Nop58p and Utp9p are involved in 18S rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c29">29</xref>). Hca4p is a putative DEAD box RNA helicase and over-expression of <italic>HCA4</italic> can suppress a U14 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c28">28</xref>). Lcp5p was found to be associated with U3 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c29">29</xref>) and Nop58p and Utp9p were found in both the SSU processome and 90S pre-ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c6">6</xref>), although Lcp5p was not found in the SSU processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>). Bfr2p was also found in the 90S pre-ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c6">6</xref>). Hence, Hazbun and colleagues&#x02019; data also support the general conclusion that Esf1p is involved in small-subunit biogenesis, although there is a complete lack of overlap with the specific associations we observed.</p><p>We propose that Esf1p-containing complexes may be dynamic. Although Esf1p co-purifies with two individual components of the SSU processome (Utp22p and Nop1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c27">27</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f6">6</xref>), as well as the U3 and U14 snoRNAs and the 5&#x02032;-ETS of the rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f7">7</xref>), all of the associations appear to be sub-stoichiometric, with the possible exception of the ribosomal proteins themselves. This is also clearly the case for the complex described in Hazbun <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh518c21">21</xref>). Dynamic complexes might explain why different laboratories obtain quite different results from affinity purifications, since the associated proteins might depend upon the growth phase at harvest, the extraction procedure and the purification protocol used. The presence of Esf1p in multiple pre-ribosomal processing intermediates might also underlie its association with protein components of both the large and small ribosomal subunits. Analysis of mutants in the conserved features of Esf1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh518f2">2</xref>) might help resolve the biochemical role of Esf1p in 18S biogenesis: presumably, they represent discrete domains that mediate physical interactions and/or catalytic functions.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh518f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The major pre-rRNA processing pathway in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. The primary transcript contains the sequences of mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNA separated by two internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and flanked by two external transcribed spacers (5&#x02032;-ETS and 3&#x02032;-ETS). Pre-ribosomal RNA processing is initiated by a cleavage in the 3&#x02032;-ETS by the endoribonuclease Rnt1p. Following 3&#x02032;-ETS processing, the 35S precursor is cleaved at A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub>, forming the 32S precursor. Cleavage at A<sub>2</sub> then splits the 32S precursor into the 20S and 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursors. The 20S precursor is exported to the cytoplasm and cleaved at site D, leading to the mature 18S rRNA. The 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursor is processed into 27SB precursor. The 27SB precursor is then cleaved at sites C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> to generate the mature 25S rRNA and the 7S precursor, which is then processed by the exosome into mature 5.8S rRNA.
