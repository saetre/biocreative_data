Clinical data show that mixed COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors such as aspirin, but not COX-2 selective inhibitors such as rofecoxib, induce bronchoconstriction and asthma in sensitive individuals. This anomaly has not yet been explained. Here, we have used tissue from genetically modified mice lacking functional COX-1 (COX-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), as well as airway tissue from &#x0201c;aspirin-sensitive&#x0201d; and control patients to address this issue. Bronchi from wild-type mice contained predominantly COX-1 immunoreactivity and contracted <italic>in vitro</italic> in response to acetylcholine and U46619. Bronchi from COX-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were hyperresponsive to bronchoconstrictors. Inhibitors of COX (naproxen, diclofenac, or ibuprofen) increased bronchoconstriction in tissue from wild-type but not from COX-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Cells cultured from aspirin-sensitive or control human donors contained similar levels of COX-1 and COX-2 immunoreactivity. COX activity in cells from aspirin-sensitive or tolerant patients was inhibited by aspirin, SC560, which blocks COX-1 selectively, but not by rofecoxib, which is a selective inhibitor of COX-2. These observations show that despite the presence of COX-2, COX-1 is functionally predominant in the airways and explains clinical observations relating to drug specificity in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma.&#x02014;Harrington, L.

Second, using cells cultured from the airways of patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma, we show that despite detectable levels of COX-2, COX-1 is the functionally relevant form. Taken together, these observations provide a scientific rationale as to why COX-2 inhibitors are safe in asthma and illustrates a remarkably clear cut function of COX-1 in airway function.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice and myograph studies</title><p>The COX-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice used in this study had an insertion into intron 11, resulting in transcription of an inactive &#x0201c;COX-1&#x0201d; protein <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref>. COX-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were backcrossed for more than 7 generations onto a C57BL6 background. C57BL6 mice were used as wild-type controls. Male mice of 12&#x02013;16 wk of age were used for this study. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, before lungs were removed and dissected clear of connective tissue. Segments of main bronchi were loaded into wire myographs in warmed (37&#x000b0;C) and gassed (95%O<sub>2</sub>:5%CO<sub>2</sub>) physiological salt solution (PSS; NaCl, 119 mM; KCl, 4.7 mM; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM; MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.17 mM; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 mM; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.18 mM; EDTA, 0.027 mM; and glucose, 5.5 mM), as described previously <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>. Isometric tension was initially calibrated to 0 mN. Optimal tensions for each bronchus were established by performing standard-length tension responses. In brief, bronchi were sequentially stretched by 0.25-mN increments (passive tension) and stimulated to contract actively (active tension) by the additions of a depolarizing concentration of potassium (124 mM). Optimal tension was taken at the point at which increased stretch ceased to increase active tension. Bronchi were then allowed to equilibrate for 20 min in PSS. Tissues were subjected to increasing concentrations of either acetylcholine or U46619, and tensions were recorded. In some experiments, NSAIDs or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) were added for 30 min prior to the addition of acetylcholine or U46619.</p></sec><sec><title>Human tissue</title><p>All subjects in the aspirin-sensitive asthma group had a history of aspirin-induced reaction, in that they developed a respiratory-type reaction following aspirin or NSAID ingestion. The reactions included bronchospasm, coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, as well as upper airway symptoms of rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction. These patients had their aspirin sensitivity confirmed by an intranasal challenge with lysine-aspirin, as we have described previously <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">(9)</xref>. All patients (except for one) were receiving regular inhaled corticosteroids and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor stimulants, for use as required. Nasal polyp tissue was removed as part of outpatient surgery, as we have described previously <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">(10)</xref>. Tissue was dissected to remove the core inflammatory cell component, which is easily dissociated from surrounding stromal tissue and consists of inflammatory cells, including leukocytes and mast cells. Once the inflammatory core was removed the stromal airway tissue was chopped into small pieces and placed in to culture flasks containing DMEM supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells began to grow out of the explants after 2&#x02013;3 wk. Cells were fibroblast-like in appearance. Cells were plated into individual wells of either 96- or 6-well culture plates and grown in supplemented medium until confluent. For some experiments, cells were incubated with interleukin 1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;; 1 ng/ml) for 24 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of COX activity and protein expression</title><p>At the beginning of the experiment, cells were incubated with a range of concentrations of aspirin, SC560, or rofecoxib for 30 min before the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 (3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>M) and incubation for a further 30 min. Medium was then removed, and COX activity over the incubation period was determined by measuring the level of PGE<sub>2</sub> within the medium using radioimmunoassay <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">(11)</xref>.

COX-1 and COX-2 are expressed in the airways of patients with asthma. However, unlike some other chronic inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, inhibition of COX with NSAIDs does not provide any anti-inflammatory or analgesic relief in asthma. In fact, for a subset of patients with asthma, ingestion of NSAIDs induces asthma (aspirin-sensitive responders). Paradoxically, while NSAIDs induce asthma in sensitive individuals, selective COX-2 inhibitors appear to be well tolerated <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">(6)</xref>.</p><p>In the current study, we confirm what is already known about the effects of NSAIDs on airway responses in tissue from wild-type mice. Pretreatment of bronchi with NSAIDs consistently increased the bronchoconstrictor effects of the thromboxane mimetic U46619 or acetylcholine. NSAIDs increase bronchoconstrictor responses by two potential mechanisms, both of which involve inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. First, prostaglandins produced by COX (including PGE<sub>2</sub>) functionally antagonize airway contraction and secondly tonically suppress the synthesis and release of bronchoconstrictor leukotrienes <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">(17)</xref>. NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2; it is, therefore, not possible to establish which isoform of COX predominates by the use of NSAIDs alone. Here, we found that airway tissue from laboratory mice contained predominantly COX-1, with no detectable COX-2 expression. In line with this, we found that the ability of NSAIDs to increase bronchoconstrictor responses in mouse airways was completely lost in tissue from COX-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Although this observation may, on the face of it, seem predictable from our studies on COX expression, it was essential to check. Low levels of COX-2 may have been strategically compartmentalized&#x02014;and therefore difficult to detect by Western blot analysis. Alternatively, NSAIDs may have been affecting airway responses by non-COX-dependent mechanisms known to be active in some tissues <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref>. However, our data clearly and definitively show that in mouse airways, COX-1, and not COX-2, is the target for NSAID action. It is conceivable that disruption of the COX-1 gene could influence COX-2 expression as a compensatory mechanism. However, as in tissue from wild-type animals, we found no detectable COX-2 in airway samples from COX-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>In human airway tissue cultured from nasal polyps, we detected both COX-1 and COX-2. As was the case for mouse tissue, COX-1 predominated. This was true for tissue from non-aspirin-sensitive donors, as well as from patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. These observations are consistent with others in the literature showing that both isoforms of COX are present in the airways of patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">(5)</xref>. In our study, we went further, and investigated the functional capacity of COX in human airway cells and the COX isoform expressed. As expected, nasal polyp cells released detectable levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> when stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. Interestingly, although activation of cells with IL-1&#x003b2; did not induce COX-2 in these cells, it did increase the production of PGE<sub>2</sub> by the cells. This was true for cells cultured from both aspirin-sensitive and control subjects. Interestingly, after incubation with IL-1&#x003b2;, cells derived from patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma release higher levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> than cells cultured from control donors. Clearly, this was not mediated by increased expression of COX and most likely, therefore, was due to increased expression of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref>, the enzyme responsible for liberation of the substrate arachidonic acid.</p><p>In a previous study from our group using blood donated by these patients, we found that COX-1 or COX-2 was similarly inhibited by NSAIDs, including aspirin, irrespective of aspirin sensitivity <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">(9)</xref>. In the current study, we found that airway cells from aspirin-sensitive and aspirin-tolerant donors were inhibited similarly by aspirin or by SC560. Aspirin inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">(11</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">, 20)</xref>, whereas SC560 is a highly selective inhibitor of COX-1 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">(21)</xref>. Again, as with aspirin, the potency and efficacy of SC560 were identical in cells from aspirin-sensitive and control donors. Finally, we found that, despite the presence of detectable levels of COX-2, the COX-2-selective inhibitor rofecoxib, was inactive as an inhibitor of COX in cells derived from either aspirin-sensitive patients or control donors.</p><p>In summary, our findings using genetically modified animals and tissue from aspirin-sensitive individuals show that COX-1 is the dominant isoform in the airways, particularly with regard to mechanical function. Notably, these data explain why aspirin and other NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1, but not drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2, can be tolerated by aspirin-sensitive patients with asthma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Wellcome Trust, European Community FP6 funding (Eicosanox; LSHM-CT-2004&#x02013;0050333), European Community FP7 funding (Marie Currie Fellowship) and the Spanish Government.
