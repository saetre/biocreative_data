To identify genes required for damage survival, we used a cell-based RNAi screen against the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome and the alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS). Similar studies performed in other model organisms report that damage response may involve pleiotropic cellular processes other than the central DNA repair components, yet an intuitive systems level view of the cellular components required for damage survival, their interrelationship, and contextual importance has been lacking. Further, by comparing data from different model organisms, identification of conserved and presumably core survival components should be forthcoming. We identified 307 genes, representing 13 signaling, metabolic, or enzymatic pathways, affecting cellular survival of MMS&#x02013;induced damage. As expected, the majority of these pathways are involved in DNA repair; however, several pathways with more diverse biological functions were also identified, including the TOR pathway, transcription, translation, proteasome, glutathione synthesis, ATP synthesis, and Notch signaling, and these were equally important in damage survival. Comparison with genomic screen data from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> revealed no overlap enrichment of individual genes between the species, but a conservation of the pathways. To demonstrate the functional conservation of pathways, five were tested in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse cells, with each pathway responding to alkylation damage in both species. Using the protein interactome, a significant level of connectivity was observed between <italic>Drosophila</italic> MMS survival proteins, suggesting a higher order relationship. This connectivity was dramatically improved by incorporating the components of the 13 identified pathways within the network. Grouping proteins into &#x0201c;pathway nodes&#x0201d; qualitatively improved the interactome organization, revealing a highly organized &#x0201c;MMS survival network.&#x0201d; We conclude that identification of pathways can facilitate comparative biology analysis when direct gene/orthologue comparisons fail. A biologically intuitive, highly interconnected MMS survival network was revealed after we incorporated pathway data in our interactome analysis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cellular damage is known to elicit a pleiotropic response, but the relative importance of the constituent components in cell survival is poorly understood. To provide an unbiased identification of the proteins utilized in damage survival, we performed an RNAi survival screen in fly cells with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The genes identified are involved in 13 biologically diverse pathways. Comparison with analogous yeast data demonstrated a lack of conservation of the individual MMS survival genes but a conservation of pathways. We went on to demonstrate the MMS responsiveness for five representative pathways in both fly and mouse cells. We conclude that identification of pathways can facilitate comparative biology analysis when direct gene/orthologue comparisons fail. Incorporation of pathway data in interactome analysis also improved connectivity and, more importantly, revealed a biologically intuitive, highly inter-connected &#x0201c;MMS survival network.&#x0201d; This pathway conservation and inter-connectivity implies extensive interaction between pathways; for diseases such as cancer, such crosstalk may dictate disparate cellular responses not necessarily expected and confound treatments that are not tailored to the individual molecular context.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular damage is a normal component of life, with constant damage exposure from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Damage to DNA is considered to be the most biologically relevant lesion with the potential of mutagenic results, though most exogenous agents have the potential to damage many components of the cell. Responding appropriately to such insults, either mitigating cellular toxicity or initiating an appropriate cell death response, is critical, particularly in multi-cellular organisms. Inappropriate responses may facilitate deleterious effects, such as a destabilized genome and diseases such as cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Altieri1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, DNA damage response (DDR) components are critical suppressors of deleterious effects of genotoxic agents by controlling cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Shimada1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason, there have been many investigations using a variety of model organisms to identify components of DDR and subsequently to determine how they function and the consequences of their dysfunction. Recent reports suggest that DDR may involve pleiotropic cellular processes other than the central DDR components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Begley1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Matsuoka1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, yet an intuitive systems level view of the cellular components required for damage survival, their interrelationship, and their contextual importance has been lacking. The most comprehensive attempt at understanding the interrelationship of damage response and survival components in yeast at a systems level has been mapping identified genes to a network by integrating the general biological processes as distinct modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Workman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that the inclusion of well-defined biological pathways in protein networks might provide a better understanding of biological interactions therein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Kelley1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Ng1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to identify genes involved in damage response in an unbiased manner and to put them in a functional context, we used an RNAi library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Ramadan1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> to knock-down every predicted protein in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome and assessed whether knock-down of individual proteins significantly altered cell viability following methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) exposure. MMS is a prototypical alkylating agent that attacks nucleophilic groups, such as those found in nucleic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Drablos1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The resultant base methylation destabilizes the glycosidic bond, facilitating the production of the most biologically relevant cellular lesion of MMS, an abasic site in DNA. Other common sources of alkylation damage include endogenous S-adenoysyl methionine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Rydberg1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, the tobacco carcinogen N-nitorsoamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Hecht1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and chemotherapeutics such as temozolomide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Liu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, carmustine (BCNU) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Drablos1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and cyclophosphamide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-MaletMartino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering the physiological relevance of alkylation damage, several recent studies using yeast as model organism investigated the global effects of alkylation damage induced by MMS. Viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Begley2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Jelinsky1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and protein expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Lee1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> were measured in these studies, all of which provided insights into the diverse nature of biological responses to alkylation damage. However when transcriptional responses to various environmental stresses were compared between mammalian and yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Murray1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, Murray <italic>et al.</italic> reported clear distinctions and suggested that this might be the result of different selective pressures between multi-cellular organisms and single-cell organisms. In the attempt to understand diverse responses required for damage survival in a system that is evolutionarily closer to mammals than yeast, we performed a genome-wide, RNAi-based screen using cells derived from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Our experiments were based on &#x0201c;loss of function&#x0201d; and an assessment for cellular viability following exposure to MMS. Here we present results from this MMS survival screen, the pathways that were identified, and a comparative analysis of pathways to understand conservation of these pathways in yeast and mouse cells. Additionally, we present a novel approach of assembling a protein interaction network based on defined biological pathways, which facilitates network consolidation. By including biological pathways in our genomic data and protein network analysis, we were able to determine the commonality across species, which was obscured by direct orthologue comparison, and provide a simplified representation of the global survival responses that we identified.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genome-wide RNAi screen and validation</title><p>An RNAi screen was designed to identify those genes that modulate cellular survival following exposure to a level of MMS-induced damage that resulted in only a limited amount of cell death.

Whereas in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Wiles1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> we validated normalization methods, here we independently validated individual genes using dsRNA targeting a different region of each gene. 202 protein knock-downs validated with a significant MMS viability effect, while 55 more had a notable trend effect without meeting our stringent statistical criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s011">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s012">Table S2</xref>).

Surprisingly though, no significant enrichment between the gene orthologues for the two organisms was observed (G-test p-values of 0.29 and 0.057 or Fisher Exact test p-values of 0.37 and 0.08, yeast and fly, respectively). To further test this, we examined the MMS sensitivity following knock-down of 183 fly genes that were orthologues of to 118 yeast MMS survival genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Begley1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, but only found conservation of MMS survival phenotype with 20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s013">Table S3</xref>).

The gene enrichment with each pathway between species is highly supportive of a conservation of processes involved in MMS survival. A notable absentee in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> screen, which was observed in yeast, is 3-methyladenine-DNA-glycosylase (MAG1/AlkA), the principal protection against MMS-induced DNA damage in yeast, but no direct orthologues exist in animals. One of the two glycosylase found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that act at the same step in BER, namely Thd1, was found to be required for survival after MMS treatment. Furthermore, several of the pathways observed in both species, such as proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Burgis1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the TOR pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Shen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and DNA repair pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Rusyn1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, have been shown to be functionally responsive to MMS in yeast. Altogether, these results suggest a conservation of pathway function, if not individual genes, in response to MMS between species.</p><p>To demonstrate that the identified <italic>Drosophila</italic> pathways are functioning in the expected manner in response to MMS, five were selected for further examination &#x02013; base excision repair (BER), DDR, glutathione metabolism, proteolysis by proteasomal degradation (proteasome), and the TOR pathway. Two of these pathways, BER and DDR, are expected to play a role in MMS survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Drablos1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, while the others were selected for their apparent breadth of function and their non-canonical role in damage survival. For each pathway, an appropriate functional assay was chosen, and when possible, an appropriate upstream MMS survival protein within that pathway was knocked-down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s006">Figure S6A</xref>) to demonstrate modulation of the MMS induced response.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Functional conservation of MMS survival pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse</title><p>First, we tested the two expected MMS survival pathways BER and DDR. MMS-induced DNA damage results in the production of apurinic/apyrimidic (AP) sites, a DNA damage typically repaired by BER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Drablos1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore quantified the amount of AP sites per microgram of genomic DNA following MMS treatment and observed a statistically significant increase compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; p&#x02264;7.6E-8). Knock-down of the BER component XRCC1 resulted in an increased amount of AP sites in and of itself (p&#x02264;3E-3), but following MMS treatment, the amount of AP sites in the absence of XRCC1 was increased further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; compared with untreated XRCC1 knock-down, p&#x02264;3.3E-8; compared to MMS treated luciferase (Luc) control, p&#x02264;3.7E-3); MMS therefore produces the expected form of DNA damage to which BER appropriately responds. p53, a central component of the DDR pathway, is regulated at expression, protein stabilization, and posttranslational modification levels. As expected, p53 gene expression increased in response to MMS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; p&#x02264;1.6E-3).</p><fig id="pgen-1000527-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000527.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>An examination of the functionality of five of pathways utilized in MMS survival by <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</title><p>(A) MMS exposure results in an increase in AP sites. dsRNA knock-down of the BER component XRCC1 increases the quantity of AP sites observed following MMS exposure. (B) MMS exposure results in increased p53 expression by quantitative real-time PCR analysis; expression level is provided as fold change compared to an endogenous control (CG6905). (C) MMS results in an increased amount of total glutathione, and this increase is dependent upon the rate limiting glutathione metabolizing enzyme glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLc). The intracellular glutathione concentration is expressed as mmoles/L normalized per mg protein. This GCLc dependency correlates with the increased level of GCLc expression observed following MMS exposure. (D) Proteasome activity is increased following MMS exposure in a manner that is dependent upon proteasome components Rpn2 and Pros26.4. Proteasome activity is expressed as units of activity/cell, normalizing the activity to the number of cells using a parallel viability assessment. (E) MMS exposure results in a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of the dTor component p70S6K. This decrease is dependent upon the negative regulator of dTor, Tsc1. Statistically significant differences between unexposed and MMS exposed cells are denoted (&#x0002a;; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;; with p-values of &#x0003c;0.05; &#x0003c;0.01; and &#x0003c;0.001 respectively) as are differences between Luc control and each dsRNA knock-down (#; ##; ###; with p-values of &#x0003c;0.05; &#x0003c;0.01; and &#x0003c;0.001 respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000527.g004"/></fig><p>We then examined three MMS survival pathways that are not part of the canonical DDR and DNA repair process: glutathione metabolism, proteasome, and the TOR pathway. An increased activity of the glutathione synthesis pathway following MMS exposure was demonstrated by measuring total glutathione content per milligram of protein lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figure 4C</xref>; p&#x02264;3.4E-3), as well as by examining the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme for glutathione synthesis, GCLc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Dickinson1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> (p&#x02264;8.8E-4). Therefore, as expected, knock-down of this same protein, GCLc, significantly reduced the total amount of glutathione present compared with control (p&#x02264;3.4E-3), but its knock-down also prevented the cells from increasing the level of glutathione in response to MMS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Since glutathione synthesis is considered to be an oxidative stress response, we demonstrated that MMS resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the level of 8-oxoguanine, a DNA lesion normally associated with oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s007">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s018">Text S1</xref>). Thus it appears that MMS results in not only alkylation damage but also damage from oxidative stress.</p><p>For the analysis of the proteasome degradation pathway, we measured proteasome activity and found that it increased following MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figure 4D</xref>; p&#x02264;4.2E-2). Protein knock-down of the proteasome components Rpn2 or Pros26.4 significantly reduced proteasome activity compared to cells without knock-down that were either unexposed (Rpn2: p&#x02264;1.7E-2; Pros26.4: p&#x02264;3.7E-3) or exposed to MMS (Rpn2: p&#x02264;1.4E-4; Pros26.4: p&#x02264;7.0E-5). Following Rpn2 knock-down, cells were unable to mount a detectable increase in proteasome activity following MMS exposure, although we were unable to demonstrate this for Pros26.4 knock-down (p&#x02264;1.7E-3). Overall, it appears that MMS exposure results in increased proteasome activity.</p><p>Finally, to investigate TOR pathway activity, S6K phosphorylation status was monitored. TOR is a kinase that phosphorylates S6K to promote growth through ribosome biogenesis and is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor protein Tsc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Dann1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. MMS exposure resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in S6K phosphorylation, suggesting an inhibition of TOR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). This MMS-induced decrease in S6K phosphorylation was dependent on Tsc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). MMS exposure therefore elicited a down-regulation of the growth promoting TOR pathway, suggesting that this pathway is also a coordinated component of DDR similar to observations in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Shen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This supports a previously published observation by Matsuoka <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Matsuoka1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, who showed that some components of the mammalian TOR pathway are phosphorylated following ionizing radiation exposure. In conclusion, the results of these functional assays validate the identification of the &#x0201c;MMS survival pathways&#x0201d; by RNAi screening and that the functionality of these pathways, or lack thereof, affects MMS survival.</p><p>Having thus identified 13 <italic>Drosophila</italic> MMS survival pathways, we went on to investigate their functional conservation in mammals. Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we examined the same five pathways that were modulated following MMS exposure in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In general we observed comparable results in MEFs to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g005">5</xref>). MMS increased the amount of AP sites in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g005">Figure 5A</xref>); in the absence of XRCC1, however, we observed a significant increase in AP sites following MMS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; p&#x02264;3.7E-4). For DDR in MEFs, we assessed the phosphorylation status of Chk1 (a kinase that, once phosphorylated, phosphorylates p53) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Ou1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, total p53 protein, and the phosphorylation status of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), not to examine p53 expression levels, but to obtain a result equivalent to that of <italic>Drosophila</italic> result: that DDR is activated by MMS exposure. Also, similar to the observation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, MEFs had increased proteasome activity following MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g005">Figure 5D</xref>; p&#x02264;2.0E-4); knock-down of either proteasome component, PSMC1 or PSMD1 (orthologues to Rpn2 and Pros26.4, respectively), resulted in decreased proteasome activity following MMS exposure (PSMC1: p&#x02264;8.1E-5; PSMD1: p&#x02264;4.1E-4). These results are comparable with <italic>Drosophila</italic>: it is clear that proteasome activity is responsive to MMS in MEFs. It should also be noted that, though we were able to demonstrate the same dose-dependent decrease in S6K phosphorylation following MMS exposure in MEFs as seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) and that knock-down of TSC1 disrupted this MMS-induced effect, the disruption was not as evident as observed with <italic>Drosophila</italic>, probably due to inefficient knock-down of the TSC1 protein in MEFs (data not shown). Having observed the functionality of these pathways in response to MMS and the ability of the five siRNA to modulate the MMS response of their respective pathway, we also examined the effect of each knock-down on MMS survival in MEFs. Three of the protein knock-downs, GCLC, PSMC1 and PSMD1, affected MMS survival in MEFs (data not shown). Overall, it would appear that <italic>Drosophila</italic> could be used to accurately predict MMS survival pathways in mouse.</p><fig id="pgen-1000527-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000527.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Functional conservation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts of five pathways found to be utilized for MMS survival in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</title><p>(A) MMS exposure results in an increase in AP sites, siRNA based XRCC1 knock-down results in an increased quantity of AP sites following MMS exposure.

Because 161 MMS survival protein remain unassigned, we re-examined the inter-relationship between the identified MMS survival proteins using the currently available <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein:protein interactome (PPI) map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Kerrien1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Alfarano1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. To measure the connectivity among the MMS survival genes, we took the largest connected components of the PPI network and discarded the other, smaller components. The largest connected component contained 7364 of the 7504 proteins in the original PPI network. Taking the 202 original validated MMS screen hits as an unbiased starting point, we determined the number of proteins that were directly connected to one another, compared to a random set of the same number of proteins from the PPI, and observed a significant enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s017">Table S7</xref>; p&#x02264;2.1E-10). Similar results were obtained for other assessments of network connectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s017">Table S7</xref>). Because the MMS screen hits had more connections on average than a set of random genes, which might have biased the above analysis, we also compared the connectivity of the MMS screen hits in the real PPI network with the connectivity of the same set of proteins in a randomly rewired PPI network. Degrees were preserved in the random rewiring process. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s017">Table S7</xref>, the MMS screen hits have statistically significantly more direct interactions than would be expected in a randomly rewired network (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01). On the other hand, the randomized network had smaller average distance and higher global efficiency than the real network, which could be attributed to the well-known property of real-world networks: they usually have slightly longer average distances (and correspondingly, lower global coefficients) than their degree-preserving randomly rewired counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Watts1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1000527-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000527.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Protein network of MMS survival proteins reveals an integrated, highly connected MMS survival network.</title><p>(A) 150 of the validated MMS survival proteins (red nodes) are represented in the known <italic>Drosophila</italic> interactome, with protein:protein interactions represented by grey edges; 104 of these validated hits are &#x0201c;orphans,&#x0201d; not connected to other proteins.

This increased the size and significantly improved the connectivity within the resultant network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s017">Table S7</xref>; p&#x02264;1.3E-26). After pathway analysis, we identified an additional 105 MMS pathway hits, which were validated. In order to expand the network to include the proteins in these relevant pathways, these hits were then incorporated and a larger, and equally well-connected network was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g006">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s017">Table S7</xref>; p&#x02264;4.6E-26). Considering the apparent importance of pathways over the individual genes, we then included all components of the 13 identified MMS survival pathways and observed that the connectivity of the resultant enlarged network was significantly improved yet again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g006">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s017">Table S7</xref>; p&#x02264;4.6E-52). Similar to the analysis of the 202 validated MMS screen hits, we also compared the connectivity of the subnetworks containing the essential genes or pathway hits with that of a randomly rewired network consisting of the same nodes. Although at a lower statistical significance, the same general trend was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000527.s017">Table S7</xref>). This more inclusive network allows a view of all interactions both within and connecting to a pathway, even if the pathway components themselves are not critical to survival after MMS. To qualitatively visualize this result, each protein known to be in a pathway was grouped together and assigned to a &#x0201c;pathway node&#x0201d; (a single node within the interactome that retains the interactions of its constitutive proteins to proteins that are external to that pathway). This resulted in a highly connected interactome, or &#x0201c;MMS survival network&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), that now encompassed 179 of the 233 MMS survival proteins that are present in the PPI network (77&#x00025;). Of the remaining 54 orphan proteins, 47 are only one protein removed from the MMS survival network, six are two proteins away, and only one is not connected at all. At each step in this analysis, we observed an improved network, either enlarged or better connected, not only when comparing the entire set of proteins in that network to a random set of proteins in the PPI, but also when randomizing the additional proteins added at each step (data not shown). Overall, our observations with the MMS survival network suggest that despite the general interconnectivity within protein interactomes, a pathway analysis is highly relevant because it may improve interactome connectivity and it simplifies a systems biology overview.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies performed using yeast as a model organism to predict network response to MMS reported an astounding involvement of diverse biological pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Begley3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering that the genes that respond to environmental stress differ between mammalian and yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Murray1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, we presumed that damage response might be different or more complex in higher eukaryotes, especially considering the presence of paralogues and thus increased genetic redundancy. We therefore performed a genome-wide, RNAi based screen with <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells to investigate which genes are essential for survival following damage exposure with MMS. We were able to identify and validate 307 MMS survival genes, the majority of which had not previously been associated with alkylation damage survival. Of these genes, 146 were components of 13 different MMS survival pathways. With the five pathways examined in detail, we observed that four were functionally conserved in yeast and all five conserved in mouse with regard to their utilization following MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In yeast, experimental validation of response to MMS by proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Burgis1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the TOR pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Shen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and DNA repair pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Rusyn1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> was previously reported. Similarly, glutathione response to MMS was observed in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Lynn1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, and our observation of an increase in GCLc expression provides an underlying mechanism for this phenomenon. Our demonstration of a dose-dependent increase in 8-oxoguanine after MMS exposure indicates that MMS also results in oxidative stress damage, as previous studies suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Mizumoto1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, several recent studies have demonstrated a role for the proteasome in regulating several DNA repair pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Harper1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>), supporting our observation of increased proteasome activity in response to MMS. Thus, our screen and pathway identification have revealed a conserved set of MMS survival pathways.</p><p>Our <italic>Drosophila</italic> based study has provided novel insights to the global cellular response to alkylation damage by identifying biological pathways whose functions are required for survival after this damage. The only other analogous genome-wide, loss-of-function screen for MMS survival genes was performed in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Begley2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. That study highlighted the general biological processes required for MMS survival based on gene ontology and integrated the identified proteins into a disorganized network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Begley2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering that pathways, whether signaling, metabolic, or enzymatic, have long been identifiable entities, it is logical to consider them as units within a network. Thus our experiments focused on identifying pathways required upon exposure to damage and validating the biological responsiveness of pathways following this damage exposure. Our results confirmed that these biological pathways are indeed functional in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mouse cells and therefore functional contribution of these biological pathways are pertinent to damage response in a network representation.</p><p>In addition to the functional conservation of the survival pathway in response to alkylation damage, these same biological pathways appear to have roles in response to other types of damages. It is interesting to compare our results with an elegant study by Matsuoka <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Matsuoka1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, which identified proteins that are phosphorylated following ionizing radiation in human cells. Their study identified proteins that are components of nine of our 13 MMS survival pathways, including four of the DNA repair pathways, DDR, mTOR, proteasome, basal transcription, and ribosome. These results suggest that different types of damage, not just alkylation damage, may utilize different components of a DNA damage survival network in a functionally conserved manner and reemphasize the functional conservation of pathways, if not the individual genes, between species.</p><p>Our emphasis to reorganize the MMS survival network based on pathways is to facilitate the observation of biologically relevant interactions. Often protein:protein interaction networks may appear chaotic, but may be interrogated for simple sub-networks associated with protein(s) and pathways of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Rusyn1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, when working with pleiotropic responses that encompass so many different biological processes, such as DDR, a chaotic network representation appears non-intuitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, the integration of pathways within the conceptual framework of systems biology networking is logical. An additional advantage of including pathways is highlighted by our demonstration of MMS survival protein enrichment by detailed examination of pathways. Even with this detailed analysis and convincing evidence that the pathways were indeed functioning as expected, we were not able to assign every protein within each pathway as an &#x0201c;MMS survival protein.&#x0201d; There are many possible explanations for this, but nonetheless, considering the pathways as a whole provide a framework within the network that highlights novel interactions, cross-talk, and identified proteins not mapped to a canonical pathway, but present within the network, would unlikely be observed in a &#x0201c;chaotic network view&#x0201d; and encourages their investigation. This approach is similar to computational clustering of networks based on signaling pathways using interactome datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Baudot1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, but our approach includes both identified proteins and pathway components.

This simplified pathway inclusive representation reveals a highly organized network, consistent with the requirement of each pathway for cellular survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), and provides an effective strategy to integrate modular components into the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Hwang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and thereby inferring biological properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Vidal1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The interconnectivity between the survival pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) suggests potential pathway cross-talk. If such cross-talk exists, it would be highly pertinent to cancer therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of a global level analysis, allowing identification of altered pathway function in complex diseases such as the Notch pathway in pancreatic cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Jones1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and similarly the DDR pathway in breast and colorectal cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Lin1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering our identification of Notch, TOR, DDR, and the proteasome as &#x0201c;survival pathways,&#x0201d; all of which are currently being explored as targets for cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Ghobrial1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Rizzo1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, our identified survival network would suggest the possibility of combining pathway-specific pharmacological agents in cancer therapy. Some of the pathway connections and potential cross-talk represented in our survival network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000527-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) have already been observed. For example, protein phosphatase, PP2A, a downstream component of the TOR pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Dann1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, interacts with the DDR component to regulate phosphorylation of ATM and ATR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-McConnell1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Matsuoka1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>; DDR interacts with BER via CHK2 and XRCC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Chou1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>; Notch interacts with DDR via Mastermind and p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Zhao1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>; the glutathione pathway interacts with the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Langie1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>; and the proteasome interacts with various DNA repair components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Harper1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Jelinsky2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, it would appear that our model of an integrated network of conserved damage survival pathways is both valid and biologically relevant.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a network of pathways that have a functional role in damage response by affecting viability; we also demonstrated the functional conservation between species of the MMS survival pathways. By considering the protein interactions between the MMS survival proteins and by incorporating the MMS survival pathways, a highly interconnected damage survival network is observed that encompasses at least 58&#x00025; of the identified MMS survival proteins directly. This interconnectivity suggests a strong functional interrelationship between constitutive components of the survival network and the possibility of pathway cross-talk and coordination at a level greater than just their instigation by the DDR pathway. Although these MMS survival pathways have already been implicated in MMS damage response, we have identified these seemingly disparate pathways in a single screen, and with the network analysis, this lends to direct connection of these pathways in response to damage. The pleiotropic effects of alkylation damage therefore require a wide-variety of functioning pathways in order for the cell to survive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Tissue culture</title><p><italic>Kc<sub>167</sub></italic> cells were grown in Schneider medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10&#x00025; heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (65&#x000b0;C, 10 minutes), penicillin and streptomycin at 22&#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber.</p><p>Primary MEFs were obtained by harvesting 14.5 day C57BL/6 embryos as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Barlow1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Data from the three databases were combined into a single interactome, using the CG number of each gene as the identifier of the protein. Interactomes were visualized using Cytoscape 2.6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">http://www.cytoscape.org/</ext-link>). Pathway nodes were created external to Cytoscape by renaming all nodes representing protein in the pathways with the name of the pathway. If a protein was found in multiple pathways, it is represented in all relevant pathway nodes. Interactions between pathways were trimmed if the only interaction between them also existed within both pathways. For instance, if a protein:protein interaction occurs between two members of the NER pathway, and these two proteins also exist in the BER pathway, then the interaction is more likely to be pathway specific and not cross-talk between pathways and was therefore removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>Connectivity analyses</title><p>Four measurements of connectivity were made: (1) Counting the number of pairs of MMS survival proteins that directly interact in the interaction network, (2) computing the average geodesic distance (i.e., the number of edges in a shortest path) between each pair of MMS survival proteins in the interaction network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Costa1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, (3) the global efficiency of the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Costa1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, and (4) the clustering coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Costa1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. The number of direct interactions provides an intuitive measure of the connectivity of a subnetwork, while the average distance measures the global connectivity of the sub-network. Global efficiency provides a similar measure to average distance, but allows for disconnected components. The global efficiency was measured by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000527.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of vertices in the network and <italic>d<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the geodesic distance between vertices v<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>j</sub>. The clustering coefficient is a measure of local connectivity of the network. For each vertex v<sub>i</sub>, let g<sub>i</sub> be the subnetwork that consists of direct neighbours of v<sub>i</sub> (excluding v<sub>i</sub> itself) and the edges between them. The clustering coefficient of v<sub>i</sub> was measured by the total number of edges in g<sub>i</sub> divided by the maximum number of edges that could possibly exist in g<sub>i</sub>. The clustering coefficient of a network is given by the average of the clustering coefficient of each vertex, with a high clustering coefficient indicating a distinction between a real network from a random one. To assess the statistical significance of each measurement, the same number of proteins or proteins pairs, as appropriate, were randomly sampled from the PPI or PPI subnetwork. This sampling was repeated 1,000 times to estimate a p-value that the difference could be expected by chance.</p></sec><sec id="s4p"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To determine if knock-down of genes resulted in increased sensitivity to MMS, raw data obtained from the viability assays was normalized and statistically analyzed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000527-Wiles1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

From these analyses, significant hits were selected as death hits if there was no greater than 55&#x00025; viability in treated wells as compared to untreated if a p-value of less than 0.05 resulted from at least one of the T-tests. For those genes with an essential phenotype of less than 40&#x00025; viability of non-targeting dsRNA, more stringent requirements were made on the viability effect after MMS treatment, such that 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; viability when untreated needed 15&#x00025; viability after MMS treatment, 20&#x02013;30&#x00025; needed 10&#x00025; after treatment, 10&#x02013;20&#x00025; needed 5&#x00025; after treatment, and 0&#x02013;10&#x00025; was too dead to determine if MMS had an effect. Genes were considered &#x0201c;trend death hits&#x0201d; if they exhibited less than 55&#x00025; viability after treatment but did not have a p-value with significance or if they exhibited 55&#x02013;65&#x00025; viability after MMS treatment with a significant p-value. Knock-down of genes resulting in resistance to MMS were confirmed as those with greater than 85&#x00025; viability after treatment as compared to untreated wells, with one of the two p-values of less than 0. 0001 and viability after no treatment to be at least 60&#x00025; that of non-targeting knock-down.</p><p>To determine if a gene was essential for viability, a T-test was performed on untreated wells comparing values for non-targeting dsRNA against luciferase and dsRNA targeting the gene.
