However, the placenta forms an efficient barrier between maternal and foetal circulations and plays a crucial role in the regulation of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1. The trophoblasts are the placental cells in direct contact with maternal circulation. It has been observed that transmission of HIV-1 between T lymphocytes and trophoblasts is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and that cell-to-cell contact between HIV-1 infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cells of trophoblast origin led to the passage of virus from the apical to the basolateral side of a trophoblast barrier reconstituted <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Soluble factors such as RANTES and MIP-l&#x003b2; decrease viral passage through this placental trophoblast barriers inoculated with HIV-1 infected cells while TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 increase it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, isolated primary trophoblasts or malignantly transformed human cell lines of trophoblast lineage are highly resistant to infection with cell-free HIV-1 particles. This resistance has been shown to be bypassed when HIV-1 envelope are substituted by the vesicular-stomatitis virus G protein in the HIV-1 pseudotypes used to infect trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Vidricaire and colleagues observed that cell-free viruses are able to enter with high efficiency into trophoblast cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However viral entry is mediated in large part through endosomal vesicles which ends up in the degradation of a majority of these viral particles but the initial presence of HIV-1 within the endosomes seems to be mandatory for infection to take place in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Production of fully infectious HIV-1 particles by trophoblast cells was only seen following treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-1 and subsequent co-culture with indicator cells bearing a reporter gene. This confirmed a previous study showing that cytokines, notably TNF-&#x003b1;, stimulate replication of HIV-1 in trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Few studies have been carried out on term placental tissue <italic>ex vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Maury et al. showed that term placental tissue can support a low HIV-1 replication when infected with cell-free laboratory viral strain used at high doses and after coculture with indicator PBMCs. No study to the best of our knowledge addressed the effect of TNF-&#x003b1; on HIV-1 replication within the placental tissue. Since TNF-&#x003b1; is known to be expressed in the placenta environment especially during viral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or parasitic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], HIV-1 placental tissue infection was studied in the presence or absence of recombinant human TNF-&#x003b1; using the placental histoculture system recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and a single-cycle viral replication system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Placental histocultures replicate VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 in a time and viral dose dependent manner in the absence of TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation</title><p>As shown on Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, only background level of luciferase activity was detected after 48, 96 and 120 h of histoculture when the envelope deficient (delta-Env) pseudotyped HIV-1 was used.</p><p>When placental fragments were infected by the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1, a dose dependent replication was observed with an increase of luciferase activity overtime. At the lowest dose of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 used (0.2 ng of p24 antigen/placental fragment), after an increase at 96 h, the luciferase activity dropped at 120 h. In contrast with higher doses, the increase remained up to 120 h.</p><p>No luciferase activity was observed in preliminary results obtained after infection kinetics of placental fragments (48&#x02013;120 h post infection) with R5 and X4 pseudotyped HIV-1 despite the fact that control cells (HeLa P4P) were highly infected by both pseudotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We therefore left placental fragments after overnight contacts with R5 and X4 pseudotyped viruses in culture for longer periods (120&#x02013;216 h post infection). For the R5 envelope pseudotyped HIV-1, a modest increase of replication was observed at 168 h post infection at the highest concentration used (50 ng of p24 antigen/placental fragment) for 3 placentas out of 5 tested in the whole range of kinetics. These data show that despite the extended culture periods, the placental fragments remained resistant to infection with HIV-1 pseudotypes bearing X4 (HXB2) envelopes even at concentration as high as 100 ng of p24 antigen/placental fragment. It should be noted that the very same placentas were readily infected by the HIV-1 pseudotype bearing the VSV-G envelope.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Titration of Ba-L and HXB2 pseudotyped HIV-1 on HeLa P4P cells</bold>. 10<sup>4 </sup>HeLa P4P cells/well/100 &#x003bc;l were seeded in 96 flat-bottomed well plates.

When R5-Env pseudotyped HIV-1 is used, a low level of transient infection can be detected for some of the placentas tested. In contrast when X4-Env pseudotyped HIV-1 is used, no infection is detected.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that malignantly transformed human cell lines of the trophoblast lineage are resistant to cell-free HIV-1 pseudotypes bearing the R5 and X4 envelopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this study we demonstrate that the human placental chorionic villi are not permissive to X4-Env pseudotyped HIV-1 and display limited permissivity to R5-Env pseudotyped HIV-1 as exemplified by the low luciferase activity values observed even in the presence of the highest dose of TNF-&#x003b1;. This lack of activation of the HIV-1 replication with TNF-&#x003b1; contrasts with the results obtained with choriocarcinoma cell lines by Vidricaire and colleagues who reported an increase of luciferase activity in these cells after infection with R5 or X4-Env pseudotyped HIV-1 in the presence of TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These apparent contradictory findings might be explained by different experimental conditions. Our study was performed on human term placental tissue and not on cell lines. R5 or X4-Env pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses were used in a dose range of 20 to 100 ng of p24 antigen to infect human placental fragments in contrast to the 250 to 400 ng of p24 antigen used by Vidricaire and colleagues to infect cells. Finally in our experiments, the TNF-&#x003b1; treated placental fragments were not co-cultured with indicator cells to amplify replication because we used non productive single-cycle replicating viral pseudotypes.</p><p>The fact that 3 placentas out of 5 were modestly and transiently infected by R5-Env pseudotyped HIV-1 might have some biological relevance in the context of HIV-1 MTCT. Indeed, HIV-1 MTCT occurs mainly with R5 viruses. Additionally, 5&#x02013;10% of infants born to HIV infected mothers are infected <italic>in utero </italic>in the absence of any prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus, there might be a difference in the susceptibility of some placentas to cell-free R5 virus infection and transmission.</p><p>The chorionic villi are made up of several cell types such as syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, Hofbauer cells and stromal cells which has been shown to express variable levels of surface CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The expression of CD4 on the surface of trophoblasts is still a matter of debate, however even if they express CD4, they do not produce detectable viral particles when infected with fully competent infectious cell-free viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>A dose dependent infection was observed with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 whose replication is increased by TNF-&#x003b1;. This implies that TNF-&#x003b1; would increase viral replication in the placenta when the initial resistance to cell-free HIV-1 infection <italic>in vivo </italic>is bypassed, after cell-to-cell infection for example. In fact, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 have been shown to increase viral replication in different cell lines, isolated primary cells or cervical explant tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, in our study, TNF-&#x003b1; appeared to be capable of stimulating HIV-1 replication in term placental chorionic villi with the various cell subpopulations present. It should be recalled here that VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 are able to infect any cell type, regardless of receptor and coreceptor surface expression, due to its amphotropic nature. It has been previously described that the mechanisms by which TNF-&#x003b1; enhance HIV-1 replication occurred via the NF-kB pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; activates HIV-1 LTR-driven transcriptional activity in choriocarcinoma cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and isolated primary trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Such a mechanism might also occur in placental chorionic villi. The fact that the TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation of HIV-1 replication is not dependent of the dose tested (5 and 50 ng/ml) is consistent with a recent finding demonstrating that the temporal profile of the NF-kB activity is invariant to a wide range of TNF-&#x003b1; doses going from 0.01 ng/ml up to 10 ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that the TNF-&#x003b1; effect is time and VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 concentration dependent. Hence, at 0.2 ng of p24 antigen of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1/fragment, the increase of replication by TNF-&#x003b1; is only observed at 120 h post-infection whatever the cytokine concentration. At 2 ng of p24 antigen of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1/fragment, the effect of TNF-&#x003b1; is only significant when data were analyzed globally for all the time points tested whereas at 20 ng of p24 antigen/fragment, the TNF-&#x003b1; effect is barely significant due to an already high basal replication without TNF-&#x003b1; (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, as shown by the Xenogen system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), not all the placental fragments from the same experimental wells were infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 to detectable levels even in the presence of TNF-&#x003b1;. This suggests that the susceptibility to infection is not homogeneous for all the chorionic villi from a given placenta and thus explains the high variability observed between placentas. However, we cannot exclude that this non homogeneous infection is also due to the non saturating dose of pseudotypes used for this experiment. This result might also explain why there was no detectable stimulation of luciferase activity in the presence of TNF-&#x003b1; with the R5-Env pseudotyped HIV-1 while there was a modest and transient infection.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Hiv-1 pseudotype replication in the human placental histoculture system in the absence of TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left" colspan="5">Luciferase Activity (Relative Light Units/mn): mean (SE), n</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Time post-infection:</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>48 h</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>96 h</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>120 h</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>168 h</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>216 h</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>HIV-1/Delta-Env (20 ng*)</bold></td><td align="left">2,660 (356), 3</td><td align="left">3,300 (1,637), 3</td><td align="left">2,830 (911), 6</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>HIV-1/VSV-G (0.2 ng*)</bold></td><td align="left">4,010 (1,224), 3</td><td align="left">14,110 (9,591),3</td><td align="left">5,420 (4,152), 3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>HIV-1/VSV-G (2 ng*)</bold></td><td align="left">14,520 (16,718), 3</td><td align="left">77,880 (22,016), 3</td><td align="left">93,640 (34,095), 7</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>HIV-1/VSV-G (20 ng*)</bold></td><td align="left">213,190 (195,249), 3</td><td align="left">1,266,430 (449,346), 3</td><td align="left">1,397,280 (861,789), 3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>HIV-1/Ba-L (20 ng*)</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">2,562 (312), 6</td><td align="left">2,535 (475), 5</td><td align="left">2,670 (286), 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>HIV-1/Ba-L (50 ng*)</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">3,830 (3,612), 6</td><td align="left">10,380 (7,478), 5</td><td align="left">2,625 (772), 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>HIV-1/HXB2 (50 ng*)</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">2,620 (827), 3</td><td align="left">3,010 (135), 3</td><td align="left">2,210 (399), 3</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>HIV-1/HXB2 (100 ng*)</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">2,950 (458), 3</td><td align="left">2,860 (255), 3</td><td align="left">2,580 (1,046), 3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* : of p24 antigen</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Ex vivo </italic>bioluminescence imaging of HIV-1 infected placental chorionic villi stimulated or not with TNF-&#x003b1;</bold>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This is of particular public health concern in regions of the world where HIV-1 and malaria are both endemic. Malaria has been shown to reach peak transmission periods during the raining seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In an earlier work, a peak in HIV-1 MTCT was reported three months after the peaks of the rains in Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], suggesting that the observed increase in HIV-1 MTCT could have been due to an increase of TNF-&#x003b1; in the placental environment as a result of malaria. The present study showing an increase of HIV-1 replication by TNF-&#x003b1; within the placental tissue supports this hypothesis. However direct evidence are still required before we can conclude that placental malaria is linked with an increase transmission of HIV-1 from mother-to-child via an increase of placental proinflammatory cytokines. As discussed in a recent review, several published studies show no, little or significant association of malaria with HIV-1 MTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Some studies done on cohorts of pregnant women found no correlation between placental malaria and <italic>in utero </italic>HIV-1 MTCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Others studies have demonstrated that the effects of malaria on HIV-1 MTCT depends on placental malaria parasitemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, data presented here show, by using a single-cycle replication system, that TNF-&#x003b1; enhances HIV-1 replication in chorionic villi of the human placental tissue once viral entry is overcome, as seen with the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1. This implies that <italic>in vivo </italic>TNF-&#x003b1; would increase viral replication in the placenta when the initial resistance to cell-free HIV-1 infection is bypassed, after cell-to-cell infection for example. Altogether, these results highlight the subtle equilibrium within the placental environment between the viral load, the timing of proinflammatory cytokine expression and the regulation of viral replication that might ultimately influence HIV-1 MTCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Placenta collection and preparation</title><p>Term placentas from HIV-1 negative women were collected in accordance with French ethical guidelines after programmed caesarean section at the Antoine B&#x000e9;cl&#x000e8;re (Clamart, France) and Robert Debr&#x000e9; (Paris, France) hospitals. Placentas were processed within 2 to 3 hours following collection to isolate chorionic villi. After extensive washes with normal medium (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% L-Glutamine and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin), each placenta was cut to obtain several villi blocks of 2 to 3 mm.

Results of the luciferase activity without TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation are presented globally as mean &#x000b1; se. To take into account the fact that the activities without and with stimulation were evaluated on the same placentas, the effect of each dose of pseudotype was expressed as the ratio of the activity with each dose of TNF-&#x003b1; to the activity without TNF-&#x003b1; in the same experimental condition, noted ratio of infection, R. Then, for each type and dose of pseudotype, these ratios were analysed through analysis of variance using a factorial design including 2 factors, TNF-&#x003b1; dose (5 or 50 ng/ml) and duration of histoculture (either 48, 96, 120 hours, or 120, 168, 216 hours), and 3 to 4 replicates of placentas. For the duration of histoculture of 120 and 168 hours, 5 to 7 replicates were available for some type of pseudotype. First, it was tested if TNF-&#x003b1; dose effect varied with the duration of histoculture (interaction between TNF-&#x003b1; dose and duration of histoculture). Second, if no interaction was evidenced, the homogeneity of TNF-&#x003b1; effect across doses was tested independently of the duration of histoculture, whereas, in presence of interaction, the homogeneity of TNF-&#x003b1; effect across doses was tested for each duration of histoculture. Finally, the TNF-&#x003b1; dose effect was tested, either globally if homogeneity was evidenced or for each dose otherwise, by comparing the mean of the corresponding ratios to 1, using the residual error derived from the analysis of variance. The TNF-&#x003b1; dose effect was expressed as the mean of the corresponding ratios (mR) and its standard error (mR &#x000b1; SE). Therefore a mR of 4.0 for a given dose of TNF-&#x003b1; means that the luciferase activity was multiplied on an average by 4 after stimulation when compared to no stimulation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AKWK has conceived and performed all the histoculture experiments and drafted the manuscript.
