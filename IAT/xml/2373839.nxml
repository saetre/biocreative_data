We show that like IL-17, IL-17F regulates proinflammatory gene expression in vitro, and this requires IL-17 receptor A, tumor necrosis factor receptor&#x02013;associated factor 6, and Act1. In vivo, overexpression of IL-17F in lung epithelium led to infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages and mucus hyperplasia, similar to observations made in IL-17 transgenic mice. To further understand the function of IL-17F, we generated and analyzed mice deficient in IL-17F or IL-17. IL-17, but not IL-17F, was required for the initiation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mice deficient in IL-17F, but not IL-17, had defective airway neutrophilia in response to allergen challenge. Moreover, in an asthma model, although IL-17 deficiency reduced T helper type 2 responses, IL-17F&#x02013;deficient mice displayed enhanced type 2 cytokine production and eosinophil function. In addition, IL-17F deficiency resulted in reduced colitis caused by dextran sulfate sodium, whereas IL-17 knockout mice developed more severe disease. Our results thus demonstrate that IL-17F is an important regulator of inflammatory responses that seems to function differently than IL-17 in immune responses and diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; CC10, Clara cell 10; CNS, central nervous system; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; FAP, allergenic fungal proteinase; H&#x00026;E, hematoxylin and eosin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; PAS, periodic acid Schiff; TRAF6, TNFR-associated factor 6.</p></fn><fn><p>X.O.

IL-17, the best-studied member in this family, is a proinflammatory cytokine that was historically associated with many inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and allograft rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In vitro, mRNA expression of genes encoding several chemokines (CCL2, CCL7, CXCL1, and CCL20<italic>)</italic> and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and MMP13 was significantly up-regulated after IL-17 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Moreover, IL-17 and TNF-&#x003b1; exhibit strong synergy in promoting inflammatory gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In vivo, overexpressing IL-17 in the lungs resulted in chemokine up-regulation and tissue infiltration by leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of IL-17 signaling led to impaired host defense against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and resistance to autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>IL-17 binds to and signals through IL-17RA, a member of the IL-17R family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Recently, it was reported that IL-17RA might form a heteromeric complex with IL-17RC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). IL-17 activates NF-&#x003ba;B and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). IL-6 induction by IL-17 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) is dependent on TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Recently, we identified Act1 adaptor protein as an immediate and essential signaling component of IL-17RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a new subset of Th cells named Th17 was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). The hallmark of Th17 subset is the production of IL-17. Interestingly, Th17 cells also express IL-17F, which shares the strongest homology to IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). <italic>IL-17</italic> and <italic>IL-17F</italic> genes are localized in the same chromosome region, and we previously found that this locus undergoes chromatin remodeling associated with Th17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Recently, an IL-17&#x02013;IL-17F heterodimer was found to be expressed in Th17 cells together with IL-17 and IL-17F homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). IL-17F did not bind to IL-17RA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). However, an anti&#x02013;IL-17RA antibody blocked IL-17F&#x02013;mediated function, whereas IL-17RA&#x02013;soluble protein did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). IL-17RC was recently discovered to serve as a receptor for IL-17F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, the requirements of IL-17RA or IL-17RC in IL-17F signaling in vivo remain unclear.</p><p>IL-17F was reported to induce various cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in human airway epithelial cells, vein endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). IL-17F was found in the airways of allergic asthma patients upon allergen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Interestingly, a mutation in the IL-17F gene was shown to be associated with human asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). This literature suggests a linkage of IL-17F with human asthma. To analyze the function of IL-17F in airway inflammation, adenoviral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) or lipofectamine-mediated gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) were adopted to acutely overexpress IL-17F in vivo, which resulted in the pulmonary recruitment of neutrophils.</p><p>In our current study, we have analyzed the expression, function, and signaling mechanisms of IL-17F. We demonstrate that IL-17&#x02013;expressing T cells also produce IL-17F protein. IL-17F regulates the expression of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, which is dependent on IL-17RA, Act1, and TRAF6 proteins. Lung-specific overexpresssion of IL-17F in mice leads to infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages and mucus production. The examination of IL-17&#x02013; and IL-17F&#x02013;deficient animals in multiple models has revealed the distinct requirements of these two genes in different inflammatory responses. Thus, IL-17F plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammatory reactions.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Expression of IL-17F protein in IL-17&#x02013;expressing T cells</title><p>Although IL-17F has been shown to be coexpressed with IL-17 in Th17 cells, whether other IL-17&#x02013;expressing T cells in vivo also express IL-17F has not been clear. To allow measurement of IL-17F protein expression, we prepared a biologically active IL-17F&#x02013;Ig fusion protein; we observed IL-6 or CXCL1 production in MEFs and peritoneal macrophages after IL-17F&#x02013;Ig treatment (unpublished data). A polyclonal antibody against IL-17F was raised in rabbits. After affinity purification, we first tested the polyclonal antibody by intracellular staining of 293T cells transfected with a mouse IL-17F expression vector. Anti&#x02013;IL-17F stained IL-17F but not the vector transfectant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Moreover, this polyclonal antibody did not stain 293T cells expressing IL-17 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Thus, the antibody we raised appears to be specific for IL-17F.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>IL-17F is produced by IL-17&#x02013;expressing T cells.</bold> (A) 293T cells transfected with pcDNA&#x02013;IL-17 or pcDNA&#x02013;IL-17F, or vector only, were fixed and stained with the indicated antibodies.

Data are representative of at least two independent experiments with similar results (percentages are shown).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051063f01"></graphic></fig><p>To analyze IL-17F protein expression in different Th subsets, we differentiated OT-II cells into Th1, Th2, and Th17 lineages. Using our anti&#x02013;IL-17F antibody for intracellular staining, IL-17F protein was found expressed in Th17 cells that also expressed IL-17 but not in Th1 or Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The protein expression of IL-17F was consistent with its mRNA expression (unpublished data). Excessive amounts of IL-17 inhibited staining by anti&#x02013;IL-17 but not anti&#x02013;IL-17F (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071978/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071978/DC1</ext-link>), further supporting the specificity of our antibody. After Th17 differentiation, almost all cells expressing IL-17 also expressed IL-17F (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), indicating that they are regulated by a similar molecular mechanism. However, there appears to be an IL-17F single-positive population, suggesting the existence of heterogeneous subpopulations in the Th17 lineage.</p><p>We also examined IL-17F expression in vivo. In addition to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, it has been reported that IL-17 is also produced by &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Also, during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, IL-17 production seems to be dominated by &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In agreement with these studies, we found that splenic CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells expressed IL-17 upon activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). As seen in in vitro&#x02013;generated Th17 cells, IL-17F was coexpressed with IL-17 in these cells, though there were some IL-17 single-positive cells.</p><p>In addition to Th17 cells generated in vitro, IL-17F was coexpressed with IL-17 in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from the central nervous systems (CNS) of mice subject to the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Interestingly, most of the T cells that expressed IL-17F also expressed IL-17, and there were few IL-17 or IL-17F single-positive cells. IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have also been found constitutively in the lamina propria, dependent on IL-21, ROR&#x003b3;t, and ROR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). We found that IL-17<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the lamina propria and intestinal intraepithelium expressed IL-17F (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), but in these tissues, there existed a lot more IL-17 single-positive cells than Th17 cells generated in vitro and recovered from the CNS. Thus, analysis of IL-17F protein expression has revealed that IL-17F is generally coexpressed with IL-17 in T cells and has suggested the possibility of differential ratios of these two cytokines in different T cell states or in different tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>IL-17F regulates inflammatory gene expression via IL-17RA, Act1, and TRAF6</title><p>We previously used a microarray analysis to identify the molecular targets of IL-17 and observed the up-regulation of chemokines and MMPs by IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). To address the biological function of IL-17F, we first treated MEFs with IL-17F. We found that IL-17F induced <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL7</italic>, and <italic>MMP13</italic>, similar to the action of IL-17 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The levels of gene expression induced by IL-17F were typically more moderate than IL-17 at the concentration used (100 ng/ml). A detailed dose comparison of IL-17 versus IL-17F in IL-6 induction in MEFs also revealed that IL-17 is more potent than IL-17F (unpublished data). Moreover, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, a molecule involved in allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), was induced by both IL-17 and IL-17F (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Because thymic stromal lymphopoietin is a potent inducer of Th2 responses, our result suggests a cross-regulatory mechanism of different Th subsets.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>IL-17F induces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in vitro via IL-17RA, TRAF6, and Act1.</bold> (A) MEFs were treated with 100 ng/ml IL-17 and IL-17F, and RNA samples were analyzed for expression of the indicated genes using real-time PCR.

Because TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013; or IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated IL-6 or CXCL1 productions were normal in IL-17RA&#x02013;deficient fibroblasts, IL-17 and IL-17F effects were both impaired in these cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Moreover, injection of IL-17 or IL-17F into mouse peritoneum resulted in the recruitment of neutrophils within 4 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In IL-17RA&#x02013;deficient mice, however, IL-17 and IL-17F both lost their ability to recruit neutrophils (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These results indicate that IL-17RA is required for IL-17F as well as IL-17 signaling in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>IL-17 and IL-25 both use TRAF6 as their signaling intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).

We tested the requirement of these molecules in IL-17F&#x02013;induced inflammatory gene expression. Induction of CXCL1 was impaired in TRAF6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs upon IL-17F treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

Our results thus indicate that similar to IL-17, IL-17F requires both Act1 and TRAF6 for its signal transduction leading to inflammatory gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>IL-17F overexpression induces airway inflammation</title><p>IL-17F thus uses similar signaling mechanisms as IL-17 to regulate similar downstream genes. Because IL-17F has been implicated in airway inflammation, we treated the mouse lung epithelial cell line MLE12 with IL-17F. IL-17F induced several chemokines in MLE12, as we found in MEFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To understand the chronic effects of IL-17F function in vivo, we generated lung-specific transgenic mice that selectively overexpress IL-17F by epithelium cells using the Clara cell 10 (<italic>CC10</italic>) gene promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Three founder lines were generated, and their offspring exhibited greatly increased <italic>IL-17F</italic> mRNA expression in the lung tissues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and similar pathological symptoms. IL-17 mRNA expression in <italic>IL-17F</italic> transgenic mice remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Transgenic mice but not their control littermates developed abnormal lung pathology starting at 5 mo of age. Often, <italic>CC10&#x02013;IL-17F</italic> transgenic mice developed substantial infiltration by macrophages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Also, similar to IL-17 transgenic mice, <italic>IL-17F</italic> transgenic mice exhibit peribronchial and perivascular infiltration of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). However, we did not observe any neutrophil recruitment in transgenic mice. Occasionally, in severe cases, transgenic mice were found with a Charcot-Leyden&#x02013;like crystal structure in the airway similar to that reported in the lung of IL-13 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Increased mucus production was observed in lung tissues from transgenic mice via periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>).

Intracellular cytokine staining also revealed no IL-17 and IL-17F expression in the corresponding animals (Fig. S1 B).

This indicates that IL-17 but not IL-17F is required for the initiation of neuronal inflammation. When we examined infiltrating mononuclear cells in the CNS, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were greatly reduced in both IL-17F KO and IL-17 KO compared with WT mice, whereas CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were slightly increased in IL-17F KO animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). We then assessed the molecular basis for the reduced recruitment of T cells into the CNS in the mice deficient in IL-17F or IL-17 by real-time RT-PCR to assess chemokine expression in CNS tissue after induction of EAE. The expression of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL7 was greatly reduced in IL-17F KO compared with WT CNS, but more profoundly in IL-17 KO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>).

However, although IL-17 has been relatively well studied, the function of IL-17F is poorly understood. In this study, we describe the expression, signaling pathway, and in vivo function of IL-17F. Our study for the first time indicates that although IL-17F has very similar regulation and function as IL-17 in vitro, analysis of animals deficient in either of the two genes has revealed their distinct functions in inflammatory responses.</p><p>IL-17F is expressed in Th17 cells and other types of IL-17&#x02013;expressing T cells in vivo. Previous papers describe similar regulation of IL-17 and IL-17F expression by cytokines IL-23, TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-21, as well as transcription factors ROR&#x003b3;t, ROR&#x003b1;, and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Moreover, we found that <italic>IL-17</italic> and <italic>IL-17F</italic> gene promoters share the same pattern of chromatin remodeling in differentiated Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Several conserved noncoding sequences in this locus, including CNS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), likely mediate the coordinated expression of IL-17 and IL-17F. However, our analysis also revealed different ratios of IL-17 and IL-17F expression in different T cell populations in vitro and in vivo. This suggests differential cytokine expression in differentiated Th17 cells. What accounts for this differential regulation is unknown at this point. The biological or pathological significance of this regulation is also unclear. In Th2 cells, we previously found that the inducible co-stimulator&#x02013;c-Maf pathway only controls IL-4 but not IL-5 or IL-10 expression in the effector stage, and inducible co-stimulator deficiency selectively abrogates IL-4&#x02013;dependent IgE production but not IL-5&#x02013;mediated airway eosinophilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Moreover, expression of IL-22 by Th17 cells appears to be more dependent on IL-23 than IL-17 and IL-17F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). More studies are necessary in the future to comprehend the differential regulation of Th17 cytokines. Interestingly, our recent work revealed that ROR&#x003b1; mutant T cells had a selective defect in IL-17 but not IL-17F or IL-22 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>Compared with IL-17, IL-17F has weaker activity in inducing proinflammatory molecules in vitro. However, this activity is meaningful as in vivo, transgenic overexpression of IL-17F led to pathological airway phenotypes. Why, then, do we need two similar cytokines? The situation is even more complex considering the heterodimeric IL-17A/F molecule with intermediate activity in vitro as compared with the IL-17 and IL-17F homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). One possible explanation is that these cytokines may differentially use different cytokine receptors that are differentially expressed or alternatively spliced. IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-17A/F depend on IL-17RA for signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). How IL-17RA mediates IL-17F signaling is unclear at this point. Previous literature showed that IL-17F did not bind to IL-17RA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). We also found normal binding of IL-17F&#x02013;Ig to IL-17RA<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (unpublished data). Thus, IL-17RA may not directly mediate binding of IL-17F to the cell surface but rather may regulate its signaling with other receptor components. IL-17 signaling also requires IL-17RC, which forms a complex with IL-17RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In our preliminary analysis, we found that siRNA reduction of IL-17RC expression in MEFs also decreased IL-17F&#x02013;induced gene expression (unpublished data), suggesting the involvement of IL-17RC in IL-17F signaling. These results are consistent with a recent paper demonstrating the binding of IL-17F to IL-17RC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the receptors used by these cytokines. Although IL-17 and IL-17F may potentially bind to different receptors on the target cells, they appear to use the same signaling components. In the current study, we for the first time show the requirements of Act1 and TRAF6 in IL-17F induction of downstream inflammatory genes.</p><p>In vitro<italic>,</italic> IL-17F appears to have a weaker proinflammatory function. One may predict that IL-17F may be less important than IL-17 in vivo. This may be true in the EAE model in which IL-17F is not required for the initiation of EAE with only a minor role in maintaining inflammation in the CNS. Our results using IL-17F KO mice are consistent with our unpublished data that anti&#x02013;IL-17F did not ameliorate EAE (unpublished data). In contrast, IL-17 KO mice, similar to mice treated with anti&#x02013;IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), exhibited greatly delayed onset and progression of EAE. Thus, IL-17 is thus a dominating pathogenic factor in EAE. However, our current study using mice deficient in either the IL-17 or IL-17F gene has for the first time provided a surprising insight into the differential function of these two cytokines in immune responses. During T cell priming in vivo in response to KLH or MOG peptide immunization, IL-17&#x02013; but not IL-17F&#x02013;deficient mice exhibited increased IFN-&#x003b3; expression in the spleen. Because IL-17 has not been found to regulate Th cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), this regulation may be indirect, for example, by acting on myeloid cells. On the other hand, IFN-&#x003b3; expression was found reduced in draining lymph nodes in these animals, suggesting a possibility that IL-17 regulates the localization of Th1 cells. In IL-17F&#x02013;deficient animals, IL-17 expression was reduced in the spleen although not significantly in the lymph nodes. However, in the late phases of EAE, such a defect was not found, suggesting that IL-17F regulation of IL-17 expression could be overcome by chronic immune responses. Furthermore, IgG2a production was consistently up-regulated only in IL-17F&#x02013;deficient animals. Because IFN-&#x003b3; production was not affected significantly in the same setting, it is possible that IL-17F may regulate B cell responses to IFN-&#x003b3;, which is known to be important for IgG2a switching. B cells express the receptors for IL-17F (unpublished data). Whether they respond to IL-17F and what effect will be caused need to be investigated further. Nonetheless, our data suggest differential but clear involvement of IL-17 and IL-17F in the early phases of immune responses.</p><p>Evidence such as its presence in asthmatic CD4 T cell clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) or its mutations in asthma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>) suggests that IL-17F might be relevant to asthma. Our current study using IL-17 and IL-17F KO animals indicates that IL-17 is not required for neutrophil recruitment in innate responses to an allergen; instead, IL-17F appears more prominent in recruiting neutrophils. However, when we examined the effect of IL-17 or IL-17F deficiency on an asthma model, IL-17 KO mice, as predicted from the literature, exhibited reduced Th2 cytokine expression, whereas IL-17F KO mice had enhanced clinic symptoms such as elevated type 2 cytokines and eosinophil functions compared with WT mice. Thus, IL-17 and IL-17F may have opposite functions in chronic allergic airway diseases. The contrasting effects of IL-17 and IL-17F have also been observed in acute experimental colitis induced by DSS. IL-17F KO mice were protected, whereas IL-17 deficiency increased the colon damage. At this stage, it is difficult to comprehend the functional differences of IL-17 and IL-17F in these models. Perhaps the receptors for them are differentially expressed on target cells or these cytokines transduce differential signals that may, in turn, activate feedback antiinflammatory mechanisms. Further studies will be needed, and our data represent a first step toward a better understanding of IL-17 and IL-17F functions in vivo.</p><p>In summary, in addition to IL-17, IL-17F is expressed in Th17 cells and IL-17&#x02013;expressing &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells. These two cytokines may use the same signaling components, such as IL-17RA, Act1, and TRAF6, to induce similar downstream inflammatory genes. In vivo, transgenic overexpression of IL-17 or IL-I7F in the lung led to similar pathological phenotypes. However, our analysis using mice deficient in either gene has revealed their distinct functions in different types of inflammatory responses. Our results have revealed complex mechanisms underlying tissue inflammation. A further understanding of these mechanisms may shed light on cytokine targeting in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as allergic asthma and multiple sclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Reagents.</title><p>Mouse IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4, and IL-17 staining antibodies; IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4, IL-17, and IL-6 ELISA antibodies; and CD4, CD8, B220, and isotype control antibodies used in immunohistochemistry analysis were purchased from BD Biosciences.
