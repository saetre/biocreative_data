While many modifiers of NF-&#x003ba;B activity were identified in cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, the regulatory apparatus that determines JNK inputs into the IMD pathway is relatively unexplored. In this manuscript, we present the first quantitative screen of the entire genome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> for novel regulators of JNK activity in the IMD pathway. We identified a large number of gene products that negatively or positively impact on JNK activation in the IMD pathway. In particular, we identified the Pvr receptor tyrosine kinase as a potent inhibitor of JNK activation. In a series of <italic>in vivo</italic> and cell culture assays, we demonstrated that activation of the IMD pathway drives JNK-dependent expression of the Pvr ligands, Pvf2 and Pvf3, which in turn act through the Pvr/ERK MAP kinase pathway to attenuate the JNK and NF-&#x003ba;B arms of the IMD pathway. Our data illuminate a poorly understood arm of a critical and evolutionarily conserved innate immune response. Furthermore, given the pleiotropic involvement of JNK in eukaryotic cell biology, we believe that many of the novel regulators identified in this screen are of interest beyond immune signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Innate immunity is the sole immune response in the overwhelming majority of multicellular organisms and drives the sophisticated antigen-specific adaptive defenses of vertebrates.

The developmental requirement for dJNK and other components of the dJNK arm of the IMD pathway has hampered the study of dJNK signaling events in innate immune signaling. Thus, the processes that regulate dJNK phosphorylation in the IMD pathway are poorly understood and many of the mechanisms that regulate dJNK signaling remain unknown.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue culture cells provide an ideal environment to study these events, as PGN-induced activation of the IMD pathway induces a transient dJNK activation that is easily quantified. To understand the regulation of PGN-induced dJNK phosphorylation in the IMD pathway, we performed a high-throughput, quantitative RNAi screen for modulators of dJNK phosphorylation. To this end, we treated the embryonic macrophage-like S2 cell line with 15,683 individual dsRNAs that cover all annotated genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. In contrast to previous RNAi screens of the IMD pathway, our assay did not rely on indirect reporter constructs. Instead, we used phospho-JNK specific monoclonal antibodies in a quantitative plate-based assay to directly quantify the impact of each dsRNA on the extent of PGN-induced dJNK phosphorylation. In this manner, we identified enhancers and suppressors of dJNK activation. As a testament to the accuracy of this screen, we unambiguously identified fifteen established IMD pathway components as modifiers of dJNK activation. In addition, we identified numerous novel regulators of dJNK activation. Given the involvement of dJNK in cellular events as diverse as development, cell migration, immune signaling and cell death, we believe that many of the regulators identified in this screen will be of broad interest to the study of metazoan cell biology.</p><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of a novel regulator of dJNK in IMD pathway signaling &#x02013; the PDGFR and VEGFR receptor (Pvr) tyrosine kinase.

We uncover a novel inhibitory circuit in the IMD pathway, where dJNK drives the expression of the Pvr ligands, Pvf2 and Pvf3, which subsequently contribute to the downregulation of dJNK activity via a Pvr/dERK signal transduction cassette. We also demonstrate that Pvr attenuates the expression of Rel-responsive transcripts by regulating the extent of Rel phosphorylation. We confirm a regulatory role for Pvr in the IMD pathway with data that loss of Pvr in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> enhances the infection-induced expression of <italic>att</italic>.

We used monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylated JNK (P-JNK) and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies to directly visualize PGN-induced dJNK phosphorylation. We simultaneously monitored filamentous actin (f-actin) levels with fluorescently labeled phalloidin as a control measure of total cell numbers. We then quantified the ratio of P-JNK:f-actin for each well to determine the relative extent of dJNK phosphorylation in each sample. To identify genes that modulate the intensity and duration of dJNK phosphorylation, we screened the entire genome at fifteen and sixty minutes. We reasoned that depletion of gene products that are required for optimal PGN-induced dJNK phosphorylation will decrease dJNK phosphorylation at fifteen minutes and we defined such gene products as enhancers of dJNK phosphorylation.

Secondary dsRNA analysis was consistent with the screen results as nine of the eleven dsRNAs significantly modified dJNK phosphorylation relative to f-actin compared to control dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000655-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Even though we excluded actin modifiers from our primary data analysis, we considered the possibility that a fraction of the phenotypes observed may be indirectly caused by effects on f-actin, as opposed to dJNK phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we depleted each gene in the cohort and monitored PGN-induced dJNK phosphorylation relative to total dJNK by ICW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000655-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed that the P-JNK:JNK analysis essentially mirrored the P-JNK:f-actin analysis for each gene in the cohort. Thus, we have confidence that our screen primarily identified regulators of PGN-dependent dJNK phosphorylation. To map relationships between the identified modulators of PGN-induced dJNK phosphorylation, we mined known genetic and physical interaction databases to develop an interaction network for all hits in our primary screen. We restricted the interaction network to direct physical or genetic interactions between genes identified as modifiers of dJNK phosphorylation. Within this direct interaction network we identified a branch with a high density of interactions that spanned the IMD and the dJNK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000655-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

We believe that <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells present an ideal system for the study of the JNK signal transduction pathway, as S2 cells are readily accessible to large-scale RNAi screens, reproduce key elements of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> innate immune response and serve as a convenient gateway for whole animal studies in the genetically tractable <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Given the evolutionary conservation of the JNK signal transduction pathway, we believe that our studies are of direct relevance to JNK activity in the immune response of higher organisms.</p><p>We also consider it likely that we have serendipitously identified general regulators of the JNK pathway with roles that extend beyond immune signaling. For example, we identified core elements of the JNK activation cassette such as <italic>misshapen</italic> (<italic>msn</italic>, M4K ortholog), <italic>hemipterous</italic> (<italic>hep</italic>, MKK4 orthologs) and <italic>dMKK7</italic> (MKK7 ortholog) as required for activation of dJNK in the IMD pathway. A recent RNAi-based survey of four hundred eighty two <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes identified seventy seven core JNK pathway regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Bakal1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, the authors detected gene products that modified basal dJNK phosphorylation levels in a number of genetically compromised backgrounds. In our assay, we excluded six of these JNK modifiers from analysis as they caused a significant depletion of f-actin. Of the remaining seventy one gene products, twenty three were significant modifiers of PGN-mediated dJNK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000655.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, despite the large differences between both screens, we noticed a considerable overlap in our identification of dJNK modifiers.</p><p>We consider the false negative rate for IMD pathway members a more pertinent measure of the success of our screen. In contrast to previous RNAi screens of signal transduction pathways, our assay did not rely on indirect reporter assays. Instead, we measured the contribution of each annotated gene within the fly genome to the IMD-responsive phosphorylation of dJNK. We believe that the direct quantitative nature of our assay combined with the ease of RNAi in S2 cells greatly minimizes the likelihood of false negatives in the primary screen. Indeed, preliminary analysis of our primary screen data identified the bulk of the IMD signal transduction pathway (PGRP-LC, Imd, dFADD, Dredd, Pirk, dTAB2, dIAP2, dTAK1, dMKK4/7, dJNK, dFos, Key, Ird5 and Rel) as essential modifiers of JNK activation in the IMD pathway. In each case, the phenotype was consistent with the established molecular function of the respective IMD pathway element as either negative or positive modifiers of JNK activation. Thus, we are satisfied that false negatives do not obfuscate interpretation of our data in any meaningful manner. Ironically, the only anticipated hit we failed to identify was dJun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Delaney1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> receptor tyrosine kinase Pvr shows considerable similarity to members of the mammalian PDGF and VEGF receptor families and Pvr is considered an evolutionary ancestor of PDGF/VEGF receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Duchek1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

The molecular basis for Pvr-mediated cell movements requires clarification. While functional redundancies appear to exist between individual Pvf ligands, several studies indicate a potential preference for Pvf-1 in the guidance of cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Macias1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-McDonald2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In thorax closure and border cell migration, migratory cues proceed through the Pvr adaptor proteins Mbc, Ced-12 and Crk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Bianco1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Ishimaru1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of thorax closure and dorsal closure of male genitalia it appears that Pvr induces the corresponding cell movements through the JNK pathway. Thus, Pvr appears to be a positive regulator of JNK activity in the context of cell movements. This is logical given the extensive involvement of JNK in the coordination of cell migration during development. However, our data strongly indicate that Pvr is a negative regulator of JNK activity during immune signaling. We did not detect any requirements for Mbc, Ced-12 or Ckr in the regulation of innate immune signaling. These data suggest that distinct adaptor molecule configurations may discriminate between the impacts of Pvr on immune responses and cell migration.</p><p>In addition to requirements for Pvr in cell migration, a parallel body of literature indicates a distinct function for Pvr in the regulation of hemocyte proliferation. The disruptions to embryonic hemocyte migration in <italic>pvr</italic> mutants were originally interpreted to indicate that Pvr detects migratory guidance cues in hemocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Cho1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. More recent studies demonstrated that expression of the anti-apoptotic p35 molecule in the hemocytes of <italic>pvr</italic> mutants rescues the majority of the migratory phenoptye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Bruckner1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies confirmed that the bulk of the <italic>pvr</italic> hemocyte phenotype is the result of cell death and that there are only minor guidance requirements for Pvr in hemocyte migration. Pvr activates the dERK pathway, which induces hemocyte proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Bruckner1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Sims1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with a role for Pvr in hemocyte proliferation, overexpression of Pvf2 drives massive hemocyte proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> and incubation of embryonic mbn-2 hemocytes with Pvr antibodies blocks cellular proliferation in a dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Munier1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, overexpression of Pvf-1 did not substantially alter hemocyte proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> and a recent study indicated that proliferative signals for hemocytes are preferentially provided by Pvf2 and Pvf3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000655-Sims1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, we consider it particularly striking that our data reveal that signal transduction through the IMD pathway results in dJNK-mediated expression of Pvf2 and Pvf3.</p><p>Our study reveals a novel role for the Pvr/dERK pathway in the attenuation of the IMD pathway and illuminates our understanding of the network of regulatory checks and balances that fine tune the level of IMD/dJNK activity. Our data are most consistent with a model whereby activation of the IMD pathway results in dJNK-dependent expression of the Pvr ligands Pvf2 and Pvf3. Pvr then signals through dERK to negatively regulate the IMD pathway. On a molecular level, our data show that Pvr signaling dampens the dTAK1-dependent phosphorylation of dJNK and Rel. However, we believe that our data may also uncover an additional physiological role for Pvr. We speculate that the infection-driven production of Pvf2 and Pvf3 engages Pvr receptors on hemocytes and thereby stimulates the Ras/dERK-responsive proliferation of hemocytes. Such an increase in hemocytes numbers would provide a timely measure for the phagocytic elimination of invading extracellular microbes at early stages of infection.</p><p>We find it intriguing that proliferative signals inhibit activation of immune pathways. It may be that both processes require major metabolic commitments and that hemocytes preferentially reserve resources for proliferation. An alternative and non-exclusive hypothesis reflects the primary role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocytes in immunity. Hemocytes are the major phagocytic cell type in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and are ideally suited for the engulfment of extracellular microbes. We consider it possible that induction of immune responses drives Pvr-mediated proliferation of hemocytes to facilitate rapid neutralization of extracellular microbes through phagocytosis. In this situation, it is advantageous for proliferative signals to suppress JNK activation, as hyper or prolonged activation of JNK in <italic>Drosophila</italic> often results in cell death. Preliminary data in our lab suggest that links between Pvr and immune signaling may be evolutionarily conserved, as we detected suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B activity through the PDGF receptor superfamily member c-Kit in human cell culture assays (Anja Schindler and Edan Foley, unpublished).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and KC167 cells were cultured at 25&#x000b0;C in HyQ TNM-FH medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10&#x00025; heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50U/ml of penicillin and 5 &#x000b5;g/ml of streptomycin (GIBCO).

Z-scores were calculated by subtracting the sample value by the plate median value and dividing by the plate standard deviation.
