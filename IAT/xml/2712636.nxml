The GU patients' lymphocytes stimulated by <italic>H. pylori</italic> specifically disrupted heat-stressed HGC-27 cells in a cytotoxic assay. In flow cytometry, the effector cells (lymphocytes) from GU patients were significantly differentiated to T helper type 1 lymphocyte (Th1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) as opposed to those from CG patients. The target cells (HGC-27) expressed EF-2K and MHC-class I together with costimulatory molecules from heat stress.

Introduction</title><p><italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>(<italic>H. pylori</italic>) infection causes acute gastritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Persistent infection of <italic>H. pylori </italic>results in chronic gastritis with inflammatory infiltrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Multiple studies have demonstrated that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is associated with the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. But not all patients infected by <italic>H. pylori</italic> experience these clinical manifestations. It has been proposed that the variety of pathologies depends on the virulent factors of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, such as Cag A, Vac A, Oip A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Yet, the clinical consequences vary among patients infected by <italic>H. pylori</italic> possessing the same virulent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Further, some studies have suggested that host factors, including the immune response to alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, and interleukin 1 (IL-1) gene family polymorphism, et al., might mainly affect the clinical outcome of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Our previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>H. pylori</italic> itself or its components elicited innate immune responses via toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR 4 on gastric epithelial cells and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Especially, IL-8 released from these cells is involved in the activation of neutrocytes and lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These inflammatory participants release further cytokines such as IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and bring stress to the gastric epithelial cells. Indeed, overexpression of MHC class II dependent on IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and heat shock proteins (HSPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] were observed in gastric epithelia infected by <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Several recent studies have demonstrated that HSPs could help antigenic peptides (of self or foreign origin) transfer onto MHC molecules and that HSP-chaperoned antigenic peptides could induce antigen specific CTL and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. </p><p>In our previous studies, we discovered the pathogenesis of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma evoked by autoimmune reactions against HSP60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Further, we demonstrated that the heat stress mediated antigen could concern peptic ulcer. Peptic ulcers are a common disease caused by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and are easily improved by eradication in contrast to MALT lymphoma. Yet, the detailed mechanism of the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers is unclear. We herein identify the antigenic protein in gastric ulcer patients' sera and clarify the immune pathogenesis of peptic ulcers induced by this antigen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Patients and Cells</title><p>Sera were obtained from patients suffering from gastric ulcers (GU; <italic>n</italic> = 20) and chronic gastritis (CG; <italic>n</italic> = 20) that consulted at the Okayama University Hospital and its associated hospitals. They received treatment with neither steroidal nor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. All patients were diagnosed with CagA positive <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection by the detection of anti-CagA antibodies in their sera. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were also obtained from patients (GU; <italic>n</italic> = 8, CG; <italic>n</italic> = 8) before and after eradication therapy. The samples of healthy volunteers (HC; <italic>n</italic> = 10) who have not been infected by <italic>H. pylori</italic> were also obtained in the same way. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of each institute. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Diagnosis of these diseases was based on the findings of a gastroduodenal endoscopy and histology of biopsy specimens.</p><p>We employed the human gastric cell line HGC-27, which was established from a gastric cancer patient (kindly provided by Professor Tadashi Yoshino, Okayama University, Japan).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Cell ELISA and Western Blotting for Autoantibodies</title><p>Serum autoantibody levels against gastric cells were measured by cell ELISA as in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In brief, HGC-27 cells were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates as a monolayer. Adherent cells in plates were washed with PBS and fixed by 2% formaldehyde in PBS. The cells in an additional plate were induced to express stress-oriented proteins by heat treatment at 42&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes. After heat treatment, the cell viabilities were checked by microscopy. Since the induction of stress proteins in HGC-27 cells was at a maximum 1 hour after heat stress, HGC-27 cells were incubated and then fixed as previously mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The two plates of cells (nontreated and heat treated) were incubated with PBS containing 10% skim milk in order to prevent nonspecific reactions. The patients' sera, which were diluted with PBS containing 10% skim milk, reacted with both plates of cells for 2 hours at room temperature and then washed with PBS three times. Autoantibodies against gastric cells were detected by a peroxidase conjugated antihuman IgG and a substrate of <italic>o</italic>-phenylenediamine (OPD, Dako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in a citrate buffer (pH 5.5). The color developments in the plates were measured using a BioRad plate reader. </p><p>The antigens of autoantibodies were analyzed by Western blotting. HGC-27 cells were treated at 42&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and then were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour. Nonheat-treated cells were employed as a control. The proteins of the HGC-27 cells were extracted with a Subcellular Proteome Extraction Kit (Merck Ltd. Japan, Tokyo, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions of cell membranes and cytoplasm were employed. Both (heat-stressed and nonheat-stressed) cell fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% running gels. The proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes (Nihon Millipore K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were washed three times with PBS for five minutes and blocked with PBS containing 10% skim milk for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing Tween 20 (0.1%, v/v) (PBST), the membranes were incubated with human sera diluted to 1:100 in PBS containing 10% skim milk overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Following three washes with PBST, the blots were incubated with an antihuman IgG HRP-linked antibody (Dako, Kyoto, Japan) for 2 hours at room temperature. After three washes with PBST, bands were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England) and exposure to an LAS-1000 mini Bio-imaging Analyzer System (FUJIFILM Co., Tokyo, Japan). The band recognized only by the sera of GU patients was separated. The amino acid sequences were then analyzed with an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer model 491HT (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, Calif, USA). HGC27 cells infected by <italic>H. pylori </italic>ATCC43504 strain were also used in Western blotting, as previously mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. EF-2K was detected by antihuman EF-2K antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Protein, EF-2K and ELISA for Antibodies Against EF-2K</title><p>The putative antigen of autoantibody, elongation factor 2 kinase (EF-2K), was expressed as recombinant protein.

The concentration and purity of the RNA were determined by measuring the A<sub>260</sub> and the A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> ratio with a Beckman DU-7000 (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, Calif, USA). Total cellular RNA (1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L) was reverse transcribed using a superscript III transcription kit (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, Calif, USA).

Protein was expressed by an EasyXpress Protein Synthesis kit (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan). Soluble fusion proteins were purified with a nickel column (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England) by affinity chromatography. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions.

Autoantibodies Against Gastric Cells in Patients</title><p>Autoantibodies to gastric epithelial cells were detected by cell-ELISA in GU and CG patients infected by <italic>H. pylori</italic> and the HC group.

Heat Stress-Induced Antigens in Gastric Epithelial Cells</title><p>The antigens induced by heat stress in gastric epithelial cells were analyzed by Western blotting. The 90 kDa antigen extracted from heat-stressed HGC-27 was recognized by all of the GU patients' sera but not by the CG group at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Nonheat-stressed antigens (control) did not express common antigens recognized by any patients' sera. Therefore, only GU patients had immune reactivity to this 90 kDa protein which was generated in HGC-27 with a stressful state. Amino acids sequence analysis revealed that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this 90 kDa antigen was MADEDLIFRL, which was identical to that of elongation factor 2 kinase (EF-2K) (NP_037434). The recombinant protein expressed and purified as EF-2K was also verified as 100 kDa protein in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The titer of anti-EF-2K recombinant protein antibody of GU patients was significantly higher than that of CG patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>). The subclass of IgG in the anti-EF-2K recombinant protein antibodies of GU patients was IgG2 (data not shown). These results suggested that the immune reaction against EF-2K was causative of GU. To evaluate the EF-2K expressions in HGC-27 cells infected by <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the amounts of EF-2K in HGC-27 cells cocultured with <italic>H. pylori</italic> were quantified. <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection enhanced the EF-2K expressions in HGC-27 cells as much as heat stress did, regardless of the duration of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>).

Cytotoxicity Against Gastric Cells by Patients' Lymphocytes</title><p>We evaluated whether lymphocytes from the GU patients possessed any cytotoxicity against gastric cells.

Further, the patients' sera did not affect the cytotoxicities. These results suggested that this cytotoxity could target the antigenic peptide of EF-2K which was overexpressed on HGC-27 cells by heat stress and that the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) did not occur.

This result suggested that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection could provoke the host to generate the autoimmunity against some self proteins which were overexpressed by heat stress in the gastric epithelium. Further investigations revealed that gastric ulcer patients have antibodies which recognize the protein expressed in stressed epithelial cells. We report here that elongation factor 2 kinase (EF-2K) could be a candidate for the epitopic protein of antibodies in gastric ulcer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Intrinsically, EF-2K phosphorylates and inactivates elongation factor 2 (EF-2), resulting in the inhibition of peptide-chain elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. EF-2K is chaperoned by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and its activities are regulated by Ca2<sup>+</sup> ions and calmodulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Also, EF-2K is affected by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in response to elevated cAMP levels, which were increased in the stressed condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. HSP90 also contributes to not only the transduction of steroidal hormone signals but also to the transport of endogenous antigens in cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the present study, heat stress might affect EF-2K abnormally and induce the expression of antigenic peptide derived from EF-2K in HGC-27 cells. Since HSP90 was not detected on the HGC-27 cell surface (data not shown), the whole molecule of EF-2K complexed with HSP90 was not presented. More detail about the antigen presenting procedure is unknown and should be clarified in following studies.</p><p>In prokaryote including <italic>H. pylori</italic>, elongation factor G (EF-G) is the counterpart of EF-2 in eukaryotic cells. And EF-G is also phosphorylated and inactivated by ribosomal enzymes, for example, by PrkC of <italic>Bacillus subtlis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Since the threonines in these two factors were phosphorylated by each kinase equally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the amino acid sequences of EF-2K could be highly identical to those of EF-G kinase in the enzymatic active site. Therefore, this molecular mimicry might elicit the &#x0201c;autoimmunity&#x0201d; which generated antibodies against self EF-2K.</p><p>In order to evaluate the pathogenesity of anti-EF-2K antibodies, the cytotoxic activities were investigated. GU patient's sera themselves did not have antibody-complement mediated cytotoxicities against heat-stressed gastric cells. In contrast, the cytotoxic activities of GU patients' lymphocytes were observed only against heat-stressed HGC-27 cells regardless of treatment with patients' sera (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(d)</xref>). These results suggest that anti-EF-2K antibodies do not have a direct effect on gastric epithelial cells, but that lymphocytes, which recognize antigenic peptide expressed by heat stress (i.e., EF-2K peptide), play a dominant role in cytotoxic effects. These cellular-dominant immune responses were confirmed by the detection of a subclass of anti-EF-2K IgG2 antibodies.</p><p>The effector cells of GU patients, which were stimulated with <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens, enhanced their cytotoxicities more strongly than those with no stimulation. The additional stimulation of effector cells with IL-12 or IL-4 brought similar enhancement compared to stimulation with only <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(e)</xref>). The Th1/Th2 balance, which was inclined to Th1, did not differ between GU and CG in IL-12 stimulated effector cells, and the population of CD8<sup>+</sup> and IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> positive lymphocytes significantly increased in GU patients' effector cells stimulated with <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens. These parallel relations between cytotoxicities and the population of CD8<sup>+</sup> imply that <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens specific cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes cross-reacted against heat-stressed epithelial cells and disrupted them. Further, CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes' cross-reactivities were observed only in GU patients' lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(e)</xref>). These enhanced cytotoxicities against gastric epithelial cells would result in a gastric ulcer in vivo.</p><p>In this study, we also revealed the differences in cytotoxicities between the lymphocytes from gastric ulcer patients before and after eradication therapy. The lymphocytes after eradication therapy diminished their cytotoxicity significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(e)</xref>). This result indicates that the resting memory of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells is not fully activated by only 2 weeks of <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigen stimulation.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a cytotoxic immune response in gastric ulcer patients infected by <italic>H. pylori</italic>. In this immune response, <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes could damage gastric epithelial cells which overexpressed EF-2K. These autoreactive lymphocytes are generated only in ulcer patients with <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection. Our investigation will contribute to the realization of the pathogenesis of gastric ulcers caused by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Comprehensive Support Programs for the Creation of Regional Innovation by the Japan Science and Technology Agency; Grant name and no.: Research for Promoting Technological Seeds 10-036.
