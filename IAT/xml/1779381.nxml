Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large family of proteolytic enzymes responsible for degradation of extracellular matrix components and are thought to have a crucial role in RA joint destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. MMPs are classified into five subgroups according to their structural domains and substrate specificity:</p><p>1. Collagenases, such as interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13).</p><p>2. Gelatinases, including gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9).</p><p>3. Stromelysins, such as stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and stromelysin-2 (MMP-10).</p><p>4. Membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs), including MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, MT4-MMP, MT5-MMP, and MT6-MMP.</p><p>5. Other MMPs, such as matrilysin, stromelysin-3, metalloelastase, enamelysin, and MMP-19.</p><p>Despite distinct classification, the role of each individual MMP in a specific process, such as RA, is not clear yet. However, MMPs are thought to participate in extracellular matrix degradation in several pathologic conditions, including bone remodeling, atherosclerosis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Most MMPs are secreted as latent proenzymes and their activation requires proteolytic degradation of the propeptide domain. This activation occurs extracellularly and is often mediated by activated MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A number of different stimuli are known to promote MMP-2 activation through MT1-MMP, such as proteinase-3, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and thrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The present study focuses on MMP-2, which might contribute to the invasive characteristic features of the RA synovial fibroblast. MMP-2 degrades gelatin, collagen (types I, II, III, IV, V, VII, and X), fibronectin, elastin, and laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. MMP-2 is secreted by fibroblasts, keratinocytes, epithelial cells, monocytes, and osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Previous data suggest that MMP-2 has an important role in RA. RA patients with radiographic erosions have significantly higher levels of active MMP-2 in their synovial tissues than patients without erosions, suggesting that MMP-2 has a crucial role in articular destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, MMP-2 has been previously linked to invasion of RA synovial fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and implicated in angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Elevated MMP levels (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-13) are detected in RA compared with osteoarthritis synovial fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the RA synovium, MMP-2 is expressed in the lining and sublining layers, in addition to the synovial membrane&#x02013;cartilage interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was originally identified as a protein derived from T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. MIF is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. MIF induces the production of a large number of proinflammatory molecules, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, nitric oxide, and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, we and others showed MIF to be an important cytokine in angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and the pathogenesis of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Several independent studies described MIF enhancing angiogenesis and having a role in tumor neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In type II collagen-induced arthritis, a murine model of RA, treatment with neutralizing anti-MIF antibodies delays the onset, and decreases the frequency, of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice exhibit significantly less synovial inflammation than wild-type mice after arthritis induction with type II collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role and mechanism of action of MIF in RA synovial fibroblast MMP-2 production, which might lead to tissue degradation in RA, and describe significant signaling events leading to MIF-induced MMP-2 upregulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Recombinant human MIF, recombinant human TNF-&#x003b1; (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, ED<sub>50</sub>, 0.02&#x02013;0.05 ng/ml), recombinant human MMP-2, and recombinant human MMP-9 were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Under the conditions described, MIF stimulation showed no effect on secretion of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 proteins, because these proteins were not detected in 48-hour MIF-stimulated RA synovial fibroblast culture media by ELISA, whereas control experiments with TNF-&#x003b1; (1.5 nM) increased the concentration of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 in the supernatants (data not shown). By contrast, MIF-stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts produced significantly higher amounts of MMP-2 protein compared with nonstimulated controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). This effect was seen after 6 hours' stimulation (nonstimulated, 7.13 &#x000b1; 0.86 ng/ml of MMP-2 and MIF-stimulated, 16.28 &#x000b1; 1.71 ng/ml of MMP-2; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) and also after 24 hours' stimulation (nonstimulated, 23.88 &#x000b1; 7.49 ng/ml of MMP-2 and MIF-stimulated, 51.36 &#x000b1; 5.55 ng/ml of MMP-2; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>To analyze enzymatic activity of RA synovial fibroblast supernatants, a gelatinase assay was performed using fluorescein-labeled gelatin as the substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Fluorescence intensity was determined in cell culture supernatants of RA synovial fibroblasts stimulated with MIF (50 nM) for 24 hours. Gelatinase assay confirmed the enhanced enzymatic activity of MIF-stimulated compared with nonstimulated RA synovial fibroblast supernatants (mean fluorescence, 649 &#x000b1; 34 versus 503 &#x000b1; 19, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Gelatin zymography was performed to visualize the gelatin degradation mediated by MIF in RA synovial fibroblast culture media (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). RA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1; (1.5 nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] or MIF (50 nM) for 24 hours. Zymography revealed a band of gelatin degradation at 72 kDa, representing pro-MMP-2 protein.</p><p>In addition, RA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated with different concentrations of MIF (1 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM, 25 nM, and 50 nM). MMP-2 expression in RA synovial fibroblast supernatants was determined by gelatin zymography. We observed no stimulatory effect at 1 nM MIF, whereas increasing MMP-2 expression was seen in response to higher concentrations of MIF (data not shown). Similarly elevated MMP-2 levels were observed at concentrations of 25 nM and 50 nM MIF.</p></sec><sec><title>MIF-induced MMP-2 production is time-dependent</title><p>We stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts with MIF (50 nM) for different time periods (1 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours). MMP-2 secretion was visualized in supernatants by zymography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). We found that MIF-induced RA synovial fibroblast MMP-2 upregulation was time-dependent, beginning at 1 hour and increasing continuously over a period of 24 hours. Using immunofluorescence staining, we showed intracellular MMP-2 upregulation after stimulation for 1 hour by MIF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), confirming the role of MIF in MMP-2 induction. Immunofluorescence staining for MMP-2 showed a strong perinuclear and discrete diffuse cytoplasmic pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>RA synovial fibroblast survival</title><p>Previously, it has been shown that MIF (5&#x02013;500 ng/ml) stimulates RA synovial fibroblast proliferation during a 54-hour incubation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. To evaluate whether MIF-mediated MMP-2 production was not simply the result of this effect, cell numbers were evaluated using a CyQuant cell-enumeration kit. Equal RA synovial fibroblast numbers (<italic>n </italic>= 4 donors) were detected in the nonstimulated and MIF-stimulated (50 nM) wells after 24-hours incubation (mean fluorescence intensity, 495 &#x000b1; 25 versus 478 &#x000b1; 19, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003e; 0.05 (data not shown)).</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased production of MMP-2 in <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice</title><p>To evaluate the in-vivo role of MIF in MMP-2 production, we induced acute arthritis by intra-articular injection of zymosan in <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient and wild-type mice. ZIA is a model of acute inflammatory arthritis with early (day 1) and late (day 14) phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. After 24 hours, mice were euthanized and ZIA knee joints were harvested and homogenized. To compare MMP-2 production in joints of <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient and wild-type mice, MMP-2 concentrations of knee homogenates were measured by ELISA and normalized to total protein. We found significantly elevated MMP-2 protein levels in knee homogenates of wild-type mice compared with <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice (wild-type, 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.08 ng/mg of protein and MIF gene-deficient, 0.82 &#x000b1; 0.08 ng/mg of protein; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), pointing to an important role of MMP-2 in arthritis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we measured MMP-2 expression in the knee joints of mice after induction of AIA, a different murine model of RA. MMP-2 production of knee homogenates was measured on day 28 after AIA induction using gelatin zymography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). In parallel with our previous results, zymography showed enhanced MMP-2 production in wild-type mice compared with <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice. Interestingly, zymography revealed both the proform and the active form of MMP-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistological analysis of MMP-2 expression in ZIA joints</title><p>To evaluate the cell-type-specific expression of MMP-2 in the synovium of arthritic joints, we performed immunohistochemistry staining on ZIA joints of <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient and wild-type mice. ZIA was induced as we described above, knee joints were kept in OCT (optimal cutting temperature compound), and frozen joint sections were immunoassayed for MMP-2. We found that MMP-2 was mainly expressed by synovial lining cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a&#x02013;c</xref>), sublining nonlymphoid mononuclear cells, and endothelial cells. The immunostaining was quantified as the percentage of cells staining positively for MMP-2. Synovial expression of MMP-2 was enhanced in both lining cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>) and sublining nonlymphoid mononuclear cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>) of wild-type compared with <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice (synovial lining cells, 74% &#x000b1; 7 versus 38% &#x000b1; 7, respectively, and sublining nonlymphoid mononuclear cells, 72% &#x000b1; 4.9 versus 22% &#x000b1; 3.8, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). A similar trend was seen in endothelial cells, but the difference was not significant (41% &#x000b1; 13.5 versus 14.4% &#x000b1; 4.8, respectively; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PKC&#x003b4;, JNK, and Src mediate MIF-induced RA synovial fibroblast MMP-2 production</title><p>To examine the signal transduction pathways induced by MIF, RA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated with MIF (50 nM) in the presence of different signaling inhibitors. MMP-2 concentrations in RA synovial fibroblast supernatants were measured by ELISA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) and gelatin degradation was visualized by gelatin zymography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Several inhibitors were tested, including the PKC inhibitor Ro31-84-25 (1 &#x003bc;M), the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-8 (10 &#x003bc;M), the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (10 &#x003bc;M), the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 &#x003bc;M), the PI3K inhibitor LY29002 (10 &#x003bc;M), the Src inhibitor PP2 (10 &#x003bc;M), the Jak inhibitor AG 490 (10 &#x003bc;M), the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor PDTC (100 &#x003bc;M), the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 &#x003bc;M), the G-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (4.3 nM), and the STAT inhibitor peptide (100 &#x003bc;M). We observed that MMP-2 upregulation by MIF was suppressed by inhibitors of PKC (pan), JNK, and, in part, by Src, suggesting that these signaling pathways are involved in MMP-2 production by RA synovial fibroblasts. To determine the role of different PKC isoforms in MMP-2 production, we used a PKC&#x003b1;&#x003b2; specific inhibitor, G&#x000f6;6976 (1 &#x003bc;M), and a PKC&#x003b4; isoform-specific inhibitor, rottlerin (1 &#x003bc;M). We found that rottlerin inhibited the upregulation of MMP-2 by MIF, whereas the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoform-specific PKC inhibitor G&#x000f6;6976 did not. By contrast, none of the other specific signaling inhibitors mentioned above reduced MMP-2 expression of MIF-stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>MIF induces phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4;, JNK, and c-jun in RA synovial fibroblasts</title><p>To study signal transduction, we used MIF at a concentration of 25 nM, because we determined this dose to be sufficient for inducing MMP-2 production in RA synovial fibroblasts (see above). RA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated with MIF for different time periods (0 minutes, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The phosphorylation of JNK and the JNK substrate c-jun was determined by western blot using phospho-specific antibodies. MIF-activated JNK phosphorylation was observed at 1 minute, and a maximum response was seen at 15 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). MIF-induced c-jun activation was observed after 30 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). To confirm this data, we performed immunofluorescence staining of RA synovial fibroblasts using antibodies to phospho-specific signaling molecules. We found diffuse cytoplasmic staining of phospho-JNK in RA synovial fibroblasts stimulated by MIF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). The intracellular localization of phospho-c-jun was primarily nuclear but there was also a small amount of cytoplasmic staining. On MIF stimulation, immunofluorescence staining of phospho-c-jun showed a stronger nuclear pattern, suggesting nuclear translocation of c-jun (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>).</p><p>To determine which PKC isoforms are phosphorylated on MIF stimulation, we used different antiphospho-specific PKC antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We did not find activation of PKC (pan), PKC&#x003b1;<sub>I</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>II</sub>, or PKC&#x003b5; isoforms on MIF stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a&#x02013;c</xref>). Also, MIF did not induce phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4; at Tyr311 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7d</xref>), but specifically induced phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4; at Thr505 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7e</xref>). The reason for this effect could be that PKC&#x003b4; is not phosphorylated at Tyr311, but at Thr505 instead. MIF-induced activation of this PKC isoform was found after 1 minute, with a maximum response between 30 minutes and 45 minutes.</p><p>To determine the downstream and upstream signaling mechanisms, RA synovial fibroblasts were incubated with signaling inhibitors for 1 hour before MIF stimulation (at a concentration of 25 nM). Phosphorylation of JNK was abrogated by the Src inhibitor PP2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>), and c-jun phosphorylation was abrogated by JNK and Src inhibitors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>). These data suggest that Src is upstream of JNK, and phosphorylation of JNK leads to the activation of the nuclear protein c-jun. Activation of PKC&#x003b4; (Thr505) was inhibited by JNK and Src inhibitors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c</xref>), suggesting that Src and JNK are upstream of PKC&#x003b4;. The inhibitory activity of rottlerin results from the interaction with the ATP-binding site of PKC&#x003b4;, which explains why it did not inhibit the phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>RA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by an immunologic disorder that leads to joint destruction. The cellular components of inflamed synovium consist of inflammatory cells, predominantly macrophages, T lymphocytes, and an overgrowth of synovial fibroblasts. RA synovial fibroblasts are key mediators in the pathogenesis of RA because they have the ability to attach to the articular cartilage and invade cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. MIF is highly expressed in RA synovium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], where it regulates proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and induces the production of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in RA synovial fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In the present study, a novel role of MIF, the induction of MMP-2 production by RA synovial fibroblasts, and MIF-induced signaling events were analyzed. Previously, we reported the important role of MIF in angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and the contribution of MIF to arthritis was also shown by independent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. MMPs have the ability to degrade extracellular matrix components, including gelatin, collagens, fibronectin, and laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These enzymes have been implicated in several pathologic processes, such as tumor invasion, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In RA, angiogenesis is thought to be a key event in the expansion of the synovial lining of the joints. Angiogenesis requires proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells, in addition to synthesis of new matrix components. MMP-2 has an important role in this angiogenic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The evidence for this conclusion is that MMP inhibitors block angiogenic responses both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>MIF is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of RA. Previously, we showed the angiogenic potential of MIF both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. MIF induces human dermal microvascular endothelial cell migration and tube formation, and induces angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and in the corneal bioassay <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Two groups observed independently that in <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice or wild-type mice treated with neutralizing antibody against MIF the onset of arthritis was delayed and synovial inflammation was decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], although the specific role of MIF in tissue destruction is not clear yet.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effect of MIF on RA synovial fibroblast MMP production. In terms of MMPs and MIF, Onodera and coworkers showed a stimulatory effect of MIF on MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA levels in RA synovial fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and also on MMP-9 and MMP-13 production in rat osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Despite Onodera and coworkers finding increased levels of MMP-1 protein in supernatants of MIF-stimulated early passage (passage 3) RA synovial fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], we found no upregulation of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 by MIF in later passage (passage 8) cells. It is possible that these differences in responsiveness might result from differences in cell passage number, because similar in-vitro aging effects were shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Cell invasion and angiogenesis are crucial processes underlying diseases such as RA and cancer. Previously, Meyer-Siegler and coworkers showed a positive correlation between MIF and MMP-2 in prostate cancer cells. Addition of MIF to proliferating DU-145 prostate cancer cells resulted in a twofold increase in the relative amount of active MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In this study, we show that MIF induces MMP-2 production in RA synovial fibroblasts, which could lead to joint destruction in RA. Using in-vitro methods, including gelatin zymography, ELISA, and immunfluorescence staining of RA synovial fibroblasts, we show that MIF induces MMP-2 production by RA synovial fibroblasts. Stimulation of RA synovial fibroblasts with MIF results in a twofold increase in MMP-2 production. In addition, MIF enhances the gelatinase activity of RA synovial fibroblast-secreted proteins. Zymography analysis demonstrated an increase in pro-MMP-2 protein level in RA synovial fibroblasts stimulated by MIF. It is known, that fibroblasts alone routinely release MMP-2 in its proform. However, co-culture of fibroblasts and monocytes results in the activation of pro-MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Among other factors, neutrophil elastase is also known to augment the conversion of the 72-kDa form of MMP-2 to the 66-kDa form in lung fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate the in-vivo role of MIF in MMP-2 production, we induced acute inflammatory arthritis in <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient and wild-type mice with zymosan. The synovial inflammation mediated by zymosan is biphasic, with an initial peak at day 1, followed by a continuous decrease, and a secondary increase at day 14, as previously described using isotopic quantification of joint inflammation <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Our results confirmed the important role of MIF in MMP-2 production, because <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice exhibit less joint MMP-2 than wild-type mice. This observation could contribute to a less severe arthritis in <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In parallel with these results, we measured MMP-2 levels in AIA, a murine model of RA, using gelatin zymography. We found that both the proform and active form of MMP-2 are present in the AIA joints and both forms of MMP-2 are upregulated in wild-type compared with <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice. As with previous monocyte and fibroblast co-culture studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], these findings also suggest that activation of MMP-2 produced by RA synovial fibroblasts requires the presence of other cell types, possibly monocytes or neutrophils.</p><p>Immunohistochemical analysis of ZIA joints revealed that MMP-2 is mainly expressed by synovial lining cells, nonlymphoid mononuclear cells, and endothelial cells in the synovium. In addition, we showed that MMP-2 expression by lining cells and nonlymphoid mononuclear cells is upregulated in wild-type compared with <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient mice, suggesting an important role of MIF in MMP-2 induction by these cells.</p><p>In terms of in-vivo studies, it was previously shown that progressive joint destruction can be prevented by a novel synthetic MMP inhibitor in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis and also collagen-induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. By contrast, in antibody-induced arthritis, arthritis was found to be more severe in <italic>MMP-2 </italic>gene-deficient compared with wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>We assessed specific signaling pathways mediating MIF-induced MMP-2 production in RA synovial fibroblasts. We found that MIF-induced RA synovial fibroblast MMP-2 production was decreased in the presence of inhibitors of JNK, PKC, and Src signaling pathways. Pretreatment of RA synovial fibroblasts with a PKC&#x003b4; isoform-specific inhibitor, rottlerin, suppressed MIF-induced MMP-2 upregulation. Interestingly, we also found that MIF induced the phosphorylation of JNK, c-jun, and PKC&#x003b4; in RA synovial fibroblasts in a time-dependent manner and activation of JNK and PKC&#x003b4; by MIF required the interaction of Src. JNK and Src are upstream activators of PKC&#x003b4; and phosphorylation of JNK leads to the activation of c-jun.</p><p>A number of molecules are known to be important in MIF-mediated signaling. Tyrosine kinases, PKC, and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling molecules were reported to be activated by MIF, leading to IL-8 and IL-1&#x003b2; upregulation in RA synovial fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Onodera and coworkers showed that MIF-induced MMP-1, MMP-3 and IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA upregulation in RA synovial fibroblasts is inhibited by staurosporine (a broad-spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases such as PKC), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), a PKC inhibitor (H-7), and a transcription factor AP-1 inhibitor (curcumin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In another study, MIF increased MMP-9 and MMP-13 mRNA in rat osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Genistein and herbimycin A (two tyrosine kinase inhibitors), a selective MAPK kinase inhibitor (PD98059), and curcumin inhibited MIF-induced MMP-13 mRNA upregulation in rat osteoblasts. Consistent with these results, in rat osteoblasts MIF stimulates phosphorylation of tyrosine, autophosphorylation of Src, activation of Ras, activation of extracellular ERK1/2 (a MAPK), but not JNK or p38, and phosphorylation of c-Jun.</p><p>Other regulatory mechanisms, for example, transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of mRNA levels of MMP-2 by MIF could also be important and are currently under investigation. The transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2 are functionally important in regulating the expression of the MMP-2 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Previously, both Sp1 and AP-2 transcription factors were implicated in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Among these transcription factors, it is also known that c-jun interacts with Sp1 and the expression of Sp1 is decreased by the PKC&#x003b4; inhibitor rottlerin, suggesting a possible interaction of Sp1 with PKC&#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>However, the function of MMP-2 in RA is not yet clear. Several studies showed an important role of MMP-2 in RA: increased levels of MMP-2 were observed in serum and synovial fluid of patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], increased MMP-2 production was associated with enhanced RA synovial fibroblast invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and, additionally, MMP-2 also participated in angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. On the other hand, it is also known that gene polymorphisms for MMP-2 can affect susceptibility to development and/or severity of RA, and mutation of the <italic>MMP-2 </italic>gene causes a multicentric osteolysis and arthritis syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To summarize our findings, we demonstrated an important role for MIF in RA synovial fibroblast MMP-2 production, which might contribute to tissue destruction in RA. In-vivo MMP-2 upregulation by MIF was investigated in ZIA, an acute inflammatory arthritis model, and in AIA, a murine model of RA, using <italic>MIF </italic>gene-deficient and wild-type mice. In addition, we describe important pathways activated by MIF leading to MMP-2 upregulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).
