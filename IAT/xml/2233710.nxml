Osteoblast-like cells were incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies against integrin-&#x003b2;1 and integrin-&#x003b2;3 to block the integrin function. Subsequently, cells were seeded on Ti discs, either non coated or provided with a 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m carbonated hydroxyapatite coating using Electrostatic Spray Deposition. Results showed that on CaP coatings, cellular attachment was decreased after a pre-treatment with either anti-integrin-&#x003b2;1 or anti-integrin-&#x003b2;3 antibodies. On Ti, cell adhesion was only slightly affected after a pre-treatment with anti-integrin-&#x003b2;3 antibodies. Scanning electron microscopy showed that on both types of substrate, cellular morphology was not changed after a pre-treatment with either antibody. With quantitative PCR, it was shown for both substrates that mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;1 was increased after a pre-treatment with either anti-integrin-&#x003b2;1 or anti-integrin-&#x003b2;3 antibodies. Furthermore, after a pre-treatment with either antibody, mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;3 and ALP was decreased, on both types of substrate. In conclusion, osteoblast-like cells have the ability to compensate to great extent for the blocking strategy as applied here. Still, integrin-&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 seem to play different roles in attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells, and responses on CaP-coated substrates differ to non coated Ti. Furthermore, the influence on ALP expression suggests involvement of both integrin subunits in signal transduction for cellular differentiation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>For implants used in orthopedic or dental surgery the implant-to-bone contact is influenced by the characteristics of the implant, like the surface structure and chemical composition. Regarding the latter, calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings have shown to favor the bone response in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the mechanism responsible for the improved osteogenic response to CaP coatings is still not clear. Studying the mechanism in vivo is complicated by many factors. Still, cell culture models can be designed to study (parts of) the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>In vitro, it is known that cells attach to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which are adsorbed to the surface of the material. Specific transmembrane proteins, called integrins, connect the cells to the ECM proteins. These integrins consist of an &#x003b1;- and a &#x003b2;-unit. Osteoblasts generally express integrin subunits &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3, &#x003b1;4, &#x003b1;5, &#x003b1;6, &#x003b1;v, &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;3, and &#x003b2;5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, an overview is listed of combinations of integrin subunits and their protein ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Important ECM proteins for the attachment of osteoblasts are fibronectin, collagen type I, and vitronectin. For attachment to fibronectin and collagen type I, osteoblasts can express integrin subunit-&#x003b2;1. For attachment to vitronectin, they may use integrin subunit-&#x003b2;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Once cells have attached, the integrin is also involved in passing information from the ECM to the cell (&#x0201c;outside-in-signaling&#x0201d;), and from the cell towards the ECM (&#x0201c;inside-out-signaling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These signaling pathways can regulate cellular adhesion, migration, and subsequent behavior to a great extent. <table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>An overview of possible integrin subunits and their protein ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2">Subunits</th><th align="left">Ligands</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="10">&#x003b2;1</td><td align="left">&#x003b1;1</td><td align="left">Collagens, Laminins</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;2</td><td align="left">Collagens, Laminins</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;3</td><td align="left">Fibronectin, Collagen, Laminin</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;4</td><td align="left">Fibronectin, VCAM</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;5</td><td align="left">Fibronectin</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;6</td><td align="left">Laminins</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;7</td><td align="left">Laminins</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;8</td><td align="left">Fibronectin</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;9</td><td align="left">Tenascin, Osteopontin</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x00391;v</td><td align="left">Fibronectin, Vitronectin</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3">&#x003b2;2</td><td align="left">&#x00391;L</td><td align="left">ICAMs</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b1;M</td><td align="left">Fibrinogen</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x00391;X</td><td align="left">Fibrinogen</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">&#x003b2;3</td><td align="left">Iib</td><td align="left">Fibrinogen, Fibronectin, Vitronectin</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x00391;v</td><td align="left">Fibrinogen, Fibronectin, Vitronectin, BSP</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b2;4</td><td align="left">&#x003b1;6</td><td align="left">Laminin</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b2;5</td><td align="left">&#x00391;v</td><td align="left">Vitronectin</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x003b2;6</td><td align="left">&#x00391;v</td><td align="left">Fibronectin</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>In this study the importance of integrins in the bone-implant-interface was examined on two different implant materials (either CaP-coated or non coated Ti), with the functional blocking of integrins. We hypothesize that blocking integrin-&#x003b2;1 and integrin-&#x003b2;3 with specific antibodies will have an inhibitory effect on the initial attachment, and thus will delay proliferation and early differentiation of osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, we hypothesize that differences in cellular response exist between cultures on CaP coatings and non coated Ti. For this purpose, carbonated hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings were deposited with the electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique. Subsequently, anti-integrin-&#x003b2;1 and anti-integrin-&#x003b2;3 antibodies were added to primary osteoblast-like cells, and cells were cultured on both substrates. The initial cellular attachment, proliferation, and cell shape were evaluated. Further, gene expression for integrins &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3, and alkaline phosphatase, was examined with quantitative PCR. Results were compared to cultures without antibodies added to the cells on both materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Substrates</title><p>Disc-shaped commercially pure (cp) Ti substrates with a diameter of 12&#x000a0;mm and a thickness of 1.5&#x000a0;mm were cleaned ultrasonically in isopropanol for 5&#x000a0;min.

Furthermore, they are relevant for the signaling of the ECM with the cell and of the cell with the ECM, influencing cellular behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This study examined the effects of blocking integrin-&#x003b2;1 or integrin-&#x003b2;3 with specific monoclonal antibodies on the cellular behavior of primary osteoblast-like cells cultured on an ESD-derived CaP coating, or on non coated Ti substrates. The results showed an affected initial attachment, and an altered mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;1, integrin-&#x003b2;3, and ALP, when the function of integrin-&#x003b2;1 or integrin-&#x003b2;3 was inhibited.</p><p>First, general remarks have to be made regarding the method used to block the integrins. Osteoblast-like cells were pre-treated with monoclonal antibodies in PBS/BSA 0.5% and incubated at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min, as previously employed by multiple researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. No serum was added to the cell suspension while the antibodies were incubated to avoid competitive binding of the antibodies with serum proteins. In contrast, another study describes the addition of antibodies to the cells, in complete culture medium after seeding them on the substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Using this latter method, the antibodies only influenced cell signaling, as cells had already adhered. In the present study, the antibodies were added in suspension before cell seeding on the substrates. Using this method, all integrins on the surface were blocked, affecting the function of integrins in both attachment and cell signaling. Moreover, in the current study blocking antibodies were used at a concentration of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, which is very likely to be a saturating concentration. However, at high antibody concentrations, even nonspecific IgGs could possibly have had some inhibitory effect on cell adhesion. For future experiments, isotype-matched nonspecific IgGs should be studied also to control for nonspecific effects. However, such future studies on a comparative analysis of the functions of integrin-&#x003b2;1 versus integrin-&#x003b2;3 could also concentrate on other methods besides blocking the function with antibodies. General disadvantages of antibody blocking procedures are that the binding affinities, as well as the expression level can differ between the two integrins. More conclusive studies could be performed to compare the functions of integrin-&#x003b2;1 and integrin-&#x003b2;3, like using knock-out animals or siRNA techniques. Such studies then should encompass not only transcription (as studied here) but be complemented by experiments verifying that integrin protein expression changes (e.g. Western blots or flow cytometry). Integrins are highly regulated at many levels; transcriptional, translational, and post-translational. It is well established that changes in integrin mRNA levels do not always translate to greater integrin protein expression and/or activity.</p><p>Concerning the overall study results, it is evident that differences exist between the two performed runs. Several explanations can be given for these observations. First, it is known that integrin expression is a very dynamic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the proteins adsorbed to the surface are not immobile, and the cell itself produces ECM proteins, which influence the integrin expression. Finally, there might be variability between the heterogeneous cell populations of both runs. However, this in vitro-research was designed to determine the importance of integrins in the behavior of primary osteoblast-like cells. Despite the differences between the two runs, the same tendency was observed, confirming that the results are reliable.</p><p>CaP-coated and plain Ti materials are both commonly used for the production of dental implants. However, studies have shown a beneficial osteogenic effect of CaP-coated surfaces, compared to Ti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Studies attempting to clarify the mechanism behind these beneficial effects have shown that both the chemical composition and surface roughness are of influence on protein adsorption, integrin expression, and subsequently cellular behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the present study, the substrates differ in chemical composition, roughness, and morphology, and thus it is not possible to attribute effects on cell behavior to just one of these factors. Therefore, we separated the results of cell cultures on CaP-coated from non coated Ti substrates.</p><p>In the first run, cellular attachment early after seeding was affected on CaP-coated substrates following a pre-treatment with anti-integrin-&#x003b2;1 or anti-integrin-&#x003b2;3 antibodies. Furthermore, mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;1 was increased, and the mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;3 was decreased. In the second run, initial attachment and total cell amount were decreased when cells were pre-treated with anti-integrin-&#x003b2;1 or anti-integrin-&#x003b2;3 antibodies. Moreover, mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;1 was increased after 3&#x000a0;days of culture, and mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;3 was decreased, even in the control groups. From these data, it can be deducted that on the ESD-derived CaP-coated substrates mainly integrin-&#x003b2;1 is responsible for cellular attachment. These results corroborate the available literature, which shows that integrin-&#x003b2;1 always is highly expressed on CaP-coated substrates, whereas integrin-&#x003b2;3 is not always present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Indeed, many researchers state that integrin-&#x003b2;1 is the major subunit in osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>On non coated Ti substrates, cellular attachment was not affected by the blocking procedure in the first run. Still, mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;1 was upregulated, and mRNA of integrin-&#x003b2;3 was decreased. In the second run, again attachment was not affected by a pre-treatment with anti-integrin-&#x003b2;1 antibodies. However, early cellular attachment was decreased when cells were pre-treated with anti-integrin-&#x003b2;3 antibodies. The mRNA expression of integrin-&#x003b2;1 was increased after 3&#x000a0;days of culture, and the mRNA of integrin-&#x003b2;3 was increased after 1&#x000a0;day of culture. These results suggest an involvement of integrin-&#x003b2;1 and integrin-&#x003b2;3 in the attachment of osteoblast-like cells to non coated Ti. However, in the first run, there is only a small upregulation of mRNA of integrin-&#x003b2;1, and no effect on cellular attachment, which is the opposite of the results on CaP-coated substrates. Furthermore, in the second run, an increased mRNA of integrin-&#x003b2;3 was observed, but a decrease in early cellular attachment. On bare Ti, osteoblast-like cells have a considerable ability to compensate for cellular attachment, for example with the upregulation of other integrins.</p><p>Besides their role as adhesion molecule, integrins also function as signaling receptors. Integrin-&#x003b2;1-mediated adhesion to bone matrix induces proliferation, differentiation, and matrix synthesis by osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the present study, after a pre-treatment with either integrin antibody, the mRNA expression of ALP was decreased. This occurred in both runs, and on both types of substrates. Thus it seemed that, despite the increase in mRNA of integrin-&#x003b2;1 and integrin-&#x003b2;3, signal transduction necessary for osteogenic differentiation was decreased or at least delayed. It has to be noted that without a pre-treatment with anti-integrin-&#x003b2;1 or anti-integrin-&#x003b2;3 antibodies, mRNA expression of ALP was also decreased in cultures on both types of substrates, when day 1 is compared to day 3. These results are supported by other studies. For instance, a decreased ALP activity was observed when antibodies against fibronectin (&#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1) or collagen type I (&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1) were added [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we can maintain our hypothesis that blocking of integrin-&#x003b2;1 and integrin-&#x003b2;3 with antibodies has an inhibitory effect on the attachment and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells. However, osteoblast-like cells have the ability to compensate to great extent for the blocking strategy as applied here. Still, integrin-&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 seem to play different roles in attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells, and responses on CaP-coated substrates differ to non coated Ti. Furthermore, the influence on ALP expression suggests involvement of both integrin subunits in signal transduction for cellular differentiation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy was performed at the Microscopic Imaging Centre (MIC) of the Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences (NCMLS), the Netherlands.
