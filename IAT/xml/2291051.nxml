In the past years, decontamination by plants (phyto-remediation) has been the subject of intensive research. Some heavy metals such as copper, iron and zinc are oligo-elements essential for plant development, however they can become toxic at higher concentrations. Conversely, non-nutrient metals such as cadmium (Cd), lead and mercury are potentially toxic even at very low doses. Nonetheless, their toxicity varies between plant species. For example, metal-tolerant plants are able to grow in highly contaminated soils. Mechanisms responsible for the uptake and storage of heavy metals in plants began to be understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. First after mobilization of metal ions from soils, uptake of heavy metals occurs into root cells through more or less specific channels and/or transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In a second phase occuring in the cytoplasm metal ions are associated with amino acids, organic acids, glutathione or longer glutathione-derived peptide, phytochelatins (PCs). When plants are exposed to Cd, an increase in PCs synthesis occurs and these PCs participate in the root to shoot translocation of Cd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In a third phase, glutathione and PCs-Cd complexes are excluded from the cytosol into vacuolar or extra-cellular compartments by various transporters, among which are ABC transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is the largest family of transporters in living organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In humans, ABC transporters have received considerable attention as their deficiency or mutations are associated with severe diseases such as cystic fibrosis and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These transporters are able to carry various substrates, including ions, carbohydrates, lipids, xenobiotics, drugs and heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome, 120 genes encoding ABC proteins have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but for most of them, their function and substrates are still unknown. A number of ABC transporters were recently characterized for auxin and chlorophyll catabolites transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], pathogen and antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], detoxification of heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], as well as for controlling water stress <italic>via </italic>anions and calcium channel regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Fifteen members of the Arabidopsis ABC transporters belong to the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. MRP proteins display two hydrophobic domains (TMD) containing six membrane spans and two hydrophilic, cytosolic, nucleotide binding domains (NBD) which are organized in pairs. In most of MRP proteins, an additional hydrophobic domain (TMD<sub>0</sub>, including 3 to 5 transmembrane spans) is present at the N-terminal part of the transporter. In most ABC transporters, the binding and subsequent hydrolysis of ATP at their NBD provides the energy required for substrate translocation across the membrane. Structurally, each NBD exhibits one 'Walker A' and one 'Walker B' motif which is endowed by all ABC members, as well as by other ATP-binding proteins, and a highly conserved C motif or ABC transporter signature, being located between both Walker sequences, which is specific to ABC transporters. Until now, five members of this subclass (AtMRP1 to AtMRP5) have been characterized and AtMRP1, AtMRP2 and AtMRP3 have been found to exhibit glutathione S-conjugate transport activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the case of AtMRP2 and AtMRP3, an additive chlorophyll catabolites transport activity was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, AtMRP3 is also able to complement the loss of YCF1, which is an ABC transporter involved in Cd detoxification in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. <italic>In planta, AtMRP3 </italic>is up-regulated by a Cd treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], but the evidence that AtMRP3 is a Cd-transporter has not yet been obtained and to our knowledge there is no description of any <italic>Atmrp3 </italic>mutant in the literature till now. In addition, AtMRP4 and AtMRP5 are involved in the control of stomatal movements. More precisely AtMRP5 participates in the control of water loss <italic>via </italic>the regulation of anion and calcium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Here, we report the expression pattern of <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>which is part of a cluster of three <italic>MRP </italic>genes co-regulated by Cd. Two T-DNA insertion mutants were isolated, and an increased sensitivity to Cd during early stages of development was observed in these two lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>cDNA isolation and protein organization</title><p><italic>AtMRP6 </italic>(according to the nomenclature proposed by Martinoia and col. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]) was directly cloned by RT-PCR using MR06-NotStart and MR06R-StopNot oligonucleotide primers (table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and a full-length cDNA of 4398 bp was obtained (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY052368">AY052368</ext-link>). Alignment of this cDNA with the genomic sequence (5200 bp) from chromosome III allowed us to deduce the genomic organization of the gene. <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>extends on a 5.2 kb fragment and is spaced out into 9 exons. (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This cDNA was unstable in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, requiring a growth of the bacteria at 30&#x000b0;C in order to avoid mutations. Two other members of the MRP sub-family, <italic>AtMRP7 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP3</italic>, flank the <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>gene at its 5'- and 3'-end, respectively. All are oriented in the same transcription direction. <italic>AtMRP7 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>are the closest related genes to <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>and this cluster probably results from two successive gene duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Mean percentage amino acid identities of AtMRP6 compared to AtMRP7 and AtMRP3 were 79.5% and 64.0%, respectively. The <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>cDNA contains an open reading frame, which encodes a 1466-aminoacids polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 164.4 kDa. Based on a Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy plot using ProtScale and depending on the software used for transmembrane spans prediction, AtMRP6 exhibits 11 (PredTmr algorithm) to 16 (PHDhtm algorithm) transmembrane helixes. When using Aramemnon, 16 different algorithms are compared and a consensus sequence is proposed with 12 transmembrane spans. However, in this prediction, downstream from the first nucleotide-binding domain, the second half of the protein exhibits only 4 transmembrane helixes whereas 6 transmembrane spans are usually found. HMMTop_V2 (very well-known and suitable for the analysis of ABC transporters) as well as Phobius, proposed a model with 15 transmembrane helixes. Taking into account the fact i) ABC transporters should have an internal symmetry; ii) the two NBD should be accessible to the cytosol; iii) the two NBD should not overlap the transmembrane region, we consider that the most probable model is the one presented in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, with at least 15 transmembrane helixes, two-halves of 6 transmembrane helixes and a TMD<sub>0 </sub>of at least 3 transmembrane spans.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Gene structure and protein topology</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Genomic organization of the AtMRP6 gene (At3g13090) deduced from the cDNA.

In hydroponic conditions, wild type <italic>Columbia </italic>ecotype (C<italic>ol-0</italic>), <italic>Atmrp6.1 </italic>and <italic>Atmrp6.2 </italic>KO mutant plants were exposed to 5 or 50 &#x003bc;M CdSO<sub>4</sub>, conditions that triggered an up-regulation of <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>(figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). For all plant genotypes, similar Cd contents were found by ICP-AES analysis in roots and leaves as well as similar GSH, &#x003b3;-EC and phytochelatin contents determined by HPLC. Finally, all genotypes exhibited an equivalent resistance to Cd in terms of root growth and development (data not shown). Since the expression of <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>was essentially pronounced in seedlings (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;D</xref>), investigation of Cd effects was evaluated in <italic>Atmrp6.1 </italic>and <italic>Atmrp6.2 </italic>seedlings when seeds were directly sown on a Cd-contaminated medium. Three weeks after germination, root elongation and ramification in the absence or presence of 1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;M CdSO<sub>4</sub>were equivalent in all plant genotypes. However, <italic>Atmrp6.1 </italic>seedlings were more affected than control plants, notably at shoot level (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In the absence of Cd, the fresh weight of <italic>Atmrp6.1</italic>, <italic>Atmrp6.2 </italic>and wild type rosette-leaves from seedlings were similar (20.4 &#x000b1; 5.1 mg, 19.5 &#x000b1; 2.9 mg and 19.6 &#x000b1; 5.0 mg, respectively). Conversely, after Cd treatment, the fresh weight of <italic>Atmrp6.1 </italic>and <italic>Atmrp6.2 </italic>seedlings were significantly lower compared to wild-type (3.7 &#x000b1; 1.2, 4.3 &#x000b1; 0.8, and 6.9 &#x000b1; 1.6, respectively) (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>; mean of 4 independent experiments, 2 replicates per experiment). This reduction in fresh weight of the mutants was not accompanied by a change in Cd, GSH, &#x003b3;-EC or phytochelatin content.</p><p>Thus, it can be concluded that invalidation of <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>increases Cd-sensitivity of seedlings. The possibility of an eventual functional redundancy within the <italic>AtMRP3/AtMRP6/AtMRP7 </italic>cluster was investigated. Since it had already been demonstrated that <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>is induced by Cd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we examined comparatively in wild type plants the expression levels of the three MRP genes belonging to the cluster, together with <italic>AtMRP1 </italic>as a control. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, the expression of the three genes was up-regulated by Cd in plant roots, whereas the expression level of <italic>AtMRP1 </italic>remained unchanged. The likely gene duplication at the basis of the <italic>AtMRP3/AtMRP6/AtMRP7 </italic>cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] led us to investigate the expression level of <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP7 </italic>in the <italic>Atmrp6</italic>.1 mutant genetic background at the seedling stage of development. Whatever the presence or absence of Cd, no significant difference in <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP7 </italic>expression levels was observed. Therefore, invalidation of <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>was not correlated with an over-expression of <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>or <italic>AtMRP7</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>ABC transporters, especially from the MRP subfamily, are frequently involved in the detoxification of various xenobiotics, among which, heavy metals are found. Here, we tried to decipher the function of a previously uncharacterized <italic>A. thaliana </italic>gene, <italic>AtMRP6</italic>, which is flanked by two other <italic>MRPs </italic>gene on chromosome III, <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP7</italic>.</p><p>Analysis of <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>gene expression by RT-Q-PCR as well as by promoter GUS analysis, demonstrated that this gene is weakly expressed and has a restricted pattern of expression, mainly in germinating seeds and seedlings. Subcellular localization of AtMRP6 <italic>in planta </italic>was attempted through two different approaches. First, CaMV35s transgenic plants expressing <italic>AtMRP6-GFP </italic>were generated. Strikingly, whereas empty vector and <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>antisens plants were easily obtained, it was never the case for the sense construction, probably indicating a toxicity of this gene product under over-expressing conditions. As an alternative way to address the localization of the transporter, mesophyll cell protoplasts were transfected with <italic>AtMRP6-GFP </italic>by the classical polyethylene glycol method. No fluorescence could be observed in these conditions whereas, in control cells expressing the GFP alone, fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. The subcellular localization of AtMRP6 could not be determined however, our experiments highlighted the difficulties when working with this gene. In addition, heterologous expression of transporters in yeast constitutes an elegant approach to screening for complementation of various mutants and also to perform flux experiments with radiolabelled compounds. In the case of <italic>AtMRP6</italic>, no complementation of the &#x00394;<italic>ycf1 </italic>mutant could be obtained in this study: AtMRP6 being truncated (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We assume that this truncation of the protein was probably due to a toxicity of the transporter for the host. The development of such host toxicity is also consistent with an almost systematic mutation of the corresponding plasmid that occurred in bacteria at 37&#x000b0;C. When looking for an alternative expression system for AtMRP6, HEK-293 cells were transfected. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;C</xref>, AtMRP6 expression was successfully obtained. However, despite many efforts (assays with various plasmids such as pCi, pcDNA6 or pEGFP, optimization of the Kozak sequence, use of different cationic lipid transfection reagents), the yield of expression was too weak to initiate any flux experiment.</p><p>Results obtained in this study by RT-Q-PCR (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) and within a previous transcriptomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], demonstrate that <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>expression is up-regulated in roots within 30-hr by 5 &#x003bc;M Cd. Interestingly, not only <italic>AtMRP6</italic>, but the three members of the gene cluster were also up-regulated by after Cd exposition. These results are in accordance with an enhanced level of both <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>transcripts, reported previously in cDNA microarray experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It has already been reported that <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>can be important in Cd detoxification since its heterologous expression in the yeast strain deprived of <italic>ycf1 </italic>restores Cd tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, in Arabidopsis, despite the fact that Cd-related induction of <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>is correlated with Cd uptake after a short metal exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], whether AtMRP3 is involved in Cd transport or in the detoxification of toxic compounds produced after the metal stress awaits future studies. In the case of <italic>AtMRP7</italic>, very little data is available about its tissue expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and its function is still unknown. A fourth gene, located upstream of the MRP cluster, is also up-regulated in roots by Cd treatment: it encodes a mitochondrial-localized serine acetyl-transferase, SAT3 or serat2.2 (At3g13110; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]). This enzyme catalyzes the formation of O-acetyl-Ser from L-Ser and acetyl-CoA, which is used in cysteine synthesis, an important component of glutathione. Expression of the bacterial enzyme in tobacco led to an increase in cysteine and glutathione contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Moreover, the high activity of SAT is associated with nickel tolerance in <italic>Thlaspi </italic>nickel hyper-accumulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] suggesting a major role of SAT in heavy metal resistance. Recently, expression of SAT3 has been achieved in tobacco; however no experiments have been performed in relation to Cd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. All these results suggest that these four genes (<italic>AtMRP3, AtMRP6, AtMRP7 </italic>and <italic>SAT3</italic>), oriented in the same transcription direction on chromosome III, are members of a Cd-responding cluster. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that all these genes are up-regulated by a Cd treatment into the same organ (roots) and in the same time scale (24-hr for SAT3, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; 30-hr for the three MRP genes). Identification of such Cd-responsive elements would be useful in the context of phytoremediation strategies either to drive the expression of cadmium-transporter or reporter genes that might be used as biosensors of contaminated soils.</p><p>At the sight of the expression pattern of this gene (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), a phenotype was expected at root level in T-DNA KO lines. One cannot exclude that the neighboring MRP genes might complement the deletion of <italic>AtMRP6</italic>. For this reason, the expression levels of <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP7 </italic>were compared in wild type plants and in <italic>Atmrp6 </italic>genetic backgrounds. No significant difference in their expression levels was detected in the presence or in the absence of cadmium (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that if a mechanism of gene compensation is taking place in <italic>Atmrp6 </italic>KO plants, it involves (an)other gene(s) than <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP7 </italic>or that the basal levels of expression of <italic>AtMRP3/7 </italic>are sufficient to compensate for the absence of <italic>AtMRP6</italic>. Alternatively, these two genes could be up-regulated in the few cells expressing <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>in roots without significantly affecting their global root-expression level. The screening of several dozen conditions to observe a phenotype for <italic>Atmrp6 </italic>KO plants allowed us to show that, in the presence of Cd, the deletion of <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>has a small but significant impact on the development of primary leaves whereas roots elongation and ramification were unaffected. This phenotype was lost in 3- to 5-week-old plant, probably because at this developmental stage, Cd translocation from root to shoot is much lower, as already reported for AtMRP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that <italic>AtMRP6</italic>, <italic>AtMRP3 </italic>and <italic>AtMRP7</italic>, as well as <italic>SAT3</italic>, are part of a Cd-regulated gene cluster. The narrow expression profile of the <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>gene in the plant, essentially during the first step of seedling development might explain the discrete phenotype observed in T-DNA KO lines and is more consistent with a function of this transporter in plant growth/development rather than in Cd detoxification. If our results demonstrate that <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>is part of a cluster involved in metal tolerance, and that invalidation of this gene leads to a higher susceptibility of young seedlings, the precise function of this transporter in the plant will remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials, growth conditions and treatments</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>T-DNA insertion knockout mutants of <italic>AtMRP6 </italic>(At3g13090) from the Salk Institute Library (Salk #110544, Salk #091430 and Salk #084905) were obtained from the NASC European Arabidopsis Stock Center (Nottingham, GB).</p><p>Surface-sterilized seeds (using 70% ethanol containing 0.04% SDS) were plated on agar solidified nutrient solution containing 805 &#x003bc;M Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KNO<sub>3</sub>, 60 &#x003bc;M K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 695 &#x003bc;M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 20 &#x003bc;M FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 20 &#x003bc;M Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 74 nM (NH<sub>4</sub>)Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>, 3.6 &#x003bc;M MnSO<sub>4</sub>, 3 &#x003bc;M ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, 9.25 &#x003bc;M H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 785 nM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, supplemented with 1% sucrose and 0.8% agar (SNS solution).
