CBs are the first site of accumulation of newly assembled splicing snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) following their import into the nucleus, before they form their steady-state localization in nuclear splicing speckles. Gems are the nuclear site of accumulation of survival motor neurons (SMNs), an insufficiency of which leads to the inherited neurodegenerative condition, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMN is required in the cytoplasm for the addition of core, Sm, proteins to new snRNPs and is believed to accompany snRNPs to the CB. In most cell lines, gems are indistinguishable from CBs, although the structures are often separate <italic>in vivo</italic>. The relationship between CBs and gems is not fully understood, but there is evidence that symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues in the CB protein coilin brings them together in HeLa cells. During neuronal differentiation of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, CBs and gems increase their colocalization, mimicking changes seen during foetal development. This does not result from alterations in the methylation of coilin, but from increased levels of SMN. Expression of exogenous SMN results in an increased efficiency of snRNP transport to nuclear speckles. This suggests different mechanisms are present in different cell types and <italic>in vivo</italic> that may be significant for the tissue-specific pathology of SMA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cajal body</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>gem</kwd><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>snRNP maturation</kwd><kwd>spinal muscular atrophy</kwd><kwd>survival motor neuron</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The inherited neurodegenerative disorder, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) results from expression of too little of the protein survival motor neurons (SMNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). SMA is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, resulting in progressive atrophy of skeletal muscles. SMA occurs with a frequency of 1 in 10 000 live births, making it the leading genetic cause of infant death. There is currently no effective treatment. Although the genetic cause of the disease is known, the mechanism by which lowered SMN expression leads to selective loss of motor neurons is not understood. SMN is found in the cytoplasm of the cell and in small nuclear bodies called gems [gemini of Cajal bodies (CBs)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Gems are closely related to CBs and in many cultured cell lines the two are indistinguishable. <italic>In vivo</italic> CBs and gems are often seen as separate structures in foetal tissues, with the percentage of nuclear bodies containing both SMN and coilin increasing with foetal age. This suggests that their colocalization may be developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Interestingly, the greatest degree of colocalization of CBs and gems, 50%, is seen in motor neurons of the spinal cord. Cytoplasmic SMN is required for the correct assembly of essential pre-mRNA splicing factors called small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). The core snRNPs, Sm proteins, are assembled in a ring around the core snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) by a process involving SMN together with a number of associated proteins [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>)]. CBs are the first site of accumulation of newly imported snRNPs in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and they have been implicated in nuclear stages of snRNP biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). There is also increasing evidence that they have role in snRNP recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Thus, gems and CBs are linked both by their close physical association and by their involvement in the same molecular pathway.</p><p>Because pre-mRNA splicing factors are required in all cells, their biogenesis can be regarded as a housekeeping function. The total absence of SMN is lethal to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The highly selective pathology seen in SMA is, therefore, difficult to explain. There is evidence to suggest that SMN may have additional functions in neural cells, as it is found in granules actively transported in neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In addition, defects in axon outgrowth have been reported in zebra fish and mouse models of SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). However, the defects seen in zebra fish can be rescued by the injection of exogenous snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). While motor neurons are typically regarded as the affected cell type in SMA, there is also some evidence that differentiated muscle cells may be damaged by lowered levels of SMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), while defects in motoneuron junctions have been demonstrated to be the earliest pathology in mouse models of SMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Recently, it has been suggested that lowered levels of SMN selectively affect the biogenesis of certain snRNPs, particularly those involved in the minor spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and lead to widespread splicing defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). It is clear, therefore, that a fuller understanding of the mechanisms controlling snRNP biogenesis is required. In particular, any differences seen between differentiated and undifferentiated cells and, specifically, neural and non-neural cell types may shed light on the molecular pathology of SMA.</p><p>There is evidence that protein methylation is required for the correct localization and function of certain nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). In particular, the CB signature protein, coilin, has been demonstrated to contain symmetrically dimethylated arginine (sDMA) residues. In HeLa cells, the correct methylation of coilin is required for its binding to SMN and for the colocalization of gems and CBs. Strains of HeLa showing separation of CBs and gems were demonstrated to undermethylate green fluorescent protein (GFP)-coilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). In this study, we have investigated the relationship between CBs and gems and the methylation of endogenous coilin in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y as it undergoes differentiation and neurite outgrowth. The colocalization between CBs and gems increases during differentiation, mimicking changes seen during development <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, despite the presence of sDMAs in coilin in SH-SY5Y cells, we find no evidence for changes in the methylation of coilin during differentiation. In contrast to previous studies in HeLa cells and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), we find that the level of expression of SMN is a key regulator of the relationship between CBs and gems in differentiating neuroblastoma cells. As the prevailing view is that the role of the CB/gem complex is to increase the efficiency of snRNP maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), these findings have important implications for the understanding of the tissue-specific nature of SMA.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells is associated with increased colocalization of Cajal bodies and gems</title><p>In many commonly studied cell lines, CBs and gems are indistinguishable from each other. CBs are identified by the presence of coilin and are implicated in nuclear stages of splicing snRNP maturation, while gems contain the SMN protein known to be important for earlier, cytoplasmic, stages of snRNP biogenesis. <italic>In vivo</italic>, however, CBs and gems are separate in foetal tissues and colocalized in the equivalent adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, can be induced to undergo differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> by addition of retinoic acid (RA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C,D</xref>) or by the sequential use of RA followed by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Both treatments result in the extension of neurites from the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1D,F</xref>, arrows). However, some cells within the population remain undifferentiated in cultures treated with RA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C,D</xref>, arrowheads). These cells are not seen in cultures subsequently treated with BDNF, in which all cells develop a neural appearance providing a reproducible method to produce uniformly differentiated cells. To investigate the relationship between CBs and gems in undifferentiated and RA+BDNF-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and nuclear bodies detected using antibodies to the CB marker, coilin, and to SMN. In undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells, CBs and gems are present predominantly as separate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2Ai</xref>), with just 10% of nuclear bodies containing both SMN and coilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>). Following differentiation with RA and BDNF, the percentage of nuclear bodies containing both SMN and coilin increases to around 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2Aii,B</xref>). There is a corresponding statistically significant increase in the number of colocalized CBs (coilin) and gems (SMN) per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>). SH-SY5Y cells thus represent a suitable model of neural differentiation for examining molecular mechanisms regulating the relationship between CBs and gems. Because the RA+BDNF differentiation protocol involves several days' growth in serum-free medium, SH-SY5Y cells were grown for 10 days in serum-free medium to ensure that the changes seen were not because of growth arrest resulting from serum starvation. Serum-starved cells did not show any increase in the colocalization of nuclear bodies (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cajal bodies and gems increase their colocalization on differentiation.</bold> A) SH-SY5Y cells grown without (i) or with (ii) RA followed by BDNF.

It has thus been proposed that the presence of methylated coilin results in the formation of nuclear bodies containing both coilin and SMN, with hypomethylated coilin being present in cells with separate CBs and gems. The inhibitor of protein methylation, 5&#x02032;-deoxy-5&#x02032;-methylthioadenosine (MTA), has been shown to result in the appearance of gems, containing only SMN, in HeLa cells that normally contain colocalized CBs and gems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). A different methylation inhibitor, adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx), was shown to decrease methylation of coilin, but did not result in separation of CBs and gems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). To determine if protein methylation is important for the association between CBs and gems in SH-SY5Y cells, we treated undifferentiated and RA+BDNF-treated cells with AdOx and MTA. In contrast to results from HeLa cells, both inhibitors resulted in a decrease in colocalization of coilin and SMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A&#x02013;C</xref>). This was accompanied by a general decrease in the number of nuclear CBs present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the decreased association between CBs and gems results from a loss of CBs, rather than a separation of colocalized bodies.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of protein methylation causes separation of CB and gems.</bold> A) Top panel: antibodies to SMN (magenta) and coilin (green) show very little colocalization in undifferentiated or BDNF-differentiated cells treated for 24 h with AdOx or MTA.

To focus further on the role of methylation of coilin in maintaining CB integrity, we employed siRNA to reduce the levels of the methylase protein methyl arginine transferase 5 (PRMT5), which is responsible for addition of sDMA modifications to coilin and the Sm proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Four duplexes were used individually and as a mix. Hela cells electroporated with duplexes to reduce the levels of PRMT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A,B</xref>, and other data not shown) showed a striking reorganization of coilin into large irregular structures (arrows). These structures were seen in 46% of cells electroporated with a mix of four duplexes (<italic>n</italic> = 126), 17% with duplex A (<italic>n</italic> = 233) and 26% with duplex B (<italic>n</italic> = 156). This compares with less than 1% in control cells (<italic>n</italic> = 468). Interestingly, the subcellular distribution of SMN was also disrupted in these cells, with colocalization of SMN and coilin seen in the aberrant irregular structures. This suggests that direct molecular interaction between methylated coilin and SMN is not the major cause of colocalization of CBs and gems. Electroporation of SH-SY5Y cells with siRNA duplexes to reduce PRMT5 levels did not result in the presence of abnormal nuclear bodies or major changes in the distribution of coilin and SMN between nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B,C</xref>, and other data not shown). This adds further weight to the suggestion that nuclear bodies are regulated differently in different cell types.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Reduction of PRMT5 by RNAi results in abnormal nuclear foci containing SMN and coilin in HeLa cells, but not in SH-SY5Y cells.</bold> A) HeLa cells electroporated with PRMT5 siRNA duplexes for 48 h labelled with antibodies to SMN and coilin and counterstained with DAPI.

In both undifferentiated and RA+BDNF-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, coilin is immunoprecipitated with both antibodies, demonstrating that the protein is methylated in differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The Y12 antibody appears to precipitate coilin slightly more efficiently in differentiated cells. However, this is not seen using the SYM10 antibody, which was raised specifically to recognize sDMA. Both Y12 and SYM10 also efficiently immunoprecipitate the Sm protein components of snRNPs, which are known to contain sDMA motifs. SMN is seen in the fractions immunoprecipitated with SYM10 and Y12. This is likely to be as a result of interaction between SMN and Sm proteins as SMN does not have an arginine motif predicted to be dimethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The ability of anti-sDMA antibodies to coimmunoprecipitate SMN has previously been observed in some, but not all, HeLa cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of endogenous coilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref>) does not result in the coimmunoprecipitaiton of Sm proteins in undifferentiated or differentiated cells. This suggests that only minor amounts of these proteins, if any, interact under these conditions.

To investigate the effect of expressing excess SMN in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells, we established a number of cell lines stably expressing GFP-SMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8A</xref>). In all of the cell lines examined, GFP-SMN was found in the cytoplasm and in a small number of nuclear bodies. These bodies resembled canonical CBs by size and number and were demonstrated to contain coilin. No nuclear bodies containing coilin alone or containing SMN alone (gems) were detected in these cell lines, suggesting that the amount of SMN present is the key determinant of nuclear body architecture in these cells. Analysis of the level of expression of GFP-SMN in these cell lines by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8B</xref>) demonstrates an increase in total SMN levels in these lines of between 75 and 95%. To confirm that this effect was specific to the expression of exogenous SMN, we also established a number of cell lines expressing GFP-tagged coilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8C</xref>). In agreement with results obtained from transient expression of YFP-coilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref>), excess coilin is not well tolerated by SH-SY5Y cells, showing mostly diffuse localization within the nucleus. One cell line (GFP-coilin-SHY5) did show GFP-coilin-positive bodies in approximately 30% of nuclei. In this line, some of the coilin-positive bodies colocalize with endogenous SMN, but others do not, as is seen in the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8C</xref>, inset). SMN localization is disrupted in these cell lines, with SMN-positive gems almost completely absent. This further emphasizes the importance of the balance between coilin and SMN levels for the integrity of nuclear CBs and gems.</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of GFP-SMN leads to complete colocalization of CBs and gems.</bold> A) Three independent SH-SY5Y cell lines (clones SHY2, SHY8 and SHY10) expressing GFP-SMN show coilin, detected with anti-coilin antibodies (red on overlays) and GFP-SMN (green on overlays) fully colocalized within the nucleus into CB/gem complexes (arrows).

As CBs and gems represent the same structure in HeLa cells but are clearly separate in SH-SY5Y cells, we wanted to determine whether the reduced physical association between the two structures in SH-SY5Y cells reflects a reduced functional association. Cells were microinjected with siRNA duplexes to target SMN expression. The injected material was labelled with Texas Red dextran to allow precise identification of the experimental cells. In HeLa cells, we observed a general increase in diffuse nucleoplasmic coilin, together with a decrease in size and number of CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9A</xref>). The distribution of the SR splicing factor, SC-35, was not altered by SMN reduction, confirming that the rearrangements seen are specific to nuclear bodies and do not reflect a general disruption of nuclear architecture. In SH-SY5Y cells, either before or after differentiation, reduction of SMN led to a total loss of accumulation of coilin in CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9B</xref>), with only diffuse nucleoplasmic coilin observed. Thus, despite a less obvious relationship between CBs and gems in SH-SY5Y cells compared with HeLa cells, the loss of SMN has a greater effect on the integrity of CBs in these cells. This suggests that the functional relationship between CBs and gems is of at least equal importance in SH-SY5Y cells as in HeLa cells.</p><fig id="fig09" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Reduction of SMN expression with RNAi disrupts CBs as well as gems.</bold> A) HeLa cells microinjected with siRNA duplexes to reduce SMN expression (demonstrated by red signal in TR-dextran panel, far right, and arrows) lack SMN-containing gems (left hand panel, green on overlays).

In cell lines studied previously, newly made snRNPs are at first seen diffusely within the cell, and localize to CBs prior to their eventual accumulation in nuclear speckles. Important modifications of the snRNA core of snRNPs are carried out in the CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Interfering with snRNP biogenesis using metabolic inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) or reduction of SMN levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) has been demonstrated to prevent or reduce the accumulation of newly made snRNPs in speckles. To determine the effect of increased levels of SMN on the efficiency of snRNP maturation in SH-SY5Y cells, the parental cell line and a cell line constitutively expressing GFPSMN (GFPSMNSHY10) were transfected with a plasmid to express the core snRNP protein, SmB tagged with mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Cells were fixed after 24 and 48 h and the distribution of mCherry-SmB determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In SH-SY5Y cells expressing only endogenous SMN protein, mCherry-SmB is largely diffuse within the cell after 24 h of expression. In contrast, cells of line GFPSMNSHY10, which overexpress SMN by approximately 75%, already show clear accumulation of mCherry-SmB in nuclear speckles (arrows) and CBs (arrowheads) after 24 h of expression. After 48 h of expression, mCherry-SmB shows a clear pattern of speckles within the nucleus in both cell lines. To determine whether this increase in the rate of accumulation of snRNPs in speckles results from an increased efficiency of SMN-mediated snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm or from an increased efficiency of stages of snRNP maturation carried out in the CB, we isolated U snRNAs from the mCherry-SmB-transfected cells using antibodies against the characteristic trimethylguanosine (TMG) 5&#x02032; cap structure. Analysis of the bound and unbound fractions using antibodies to mCherry revealed a similar proportion of mCherry-SmB assembled onto snRNAs at the 24 h time-point in both cell lines. This suggests that the increased efficiency with which cells expressing GFP-SMN accumulate mCherry-SmB in speckles results from an increased efficiency of nuclear stages of snRNP maturation and/or transport, rather than an increase in the rate of assembly of Sm proteins onto snRNAs by SMN in the cytoplasm.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Increased levels of SMN in SH-SY5Y cells lead to an increase in the rate of accumulation of Sm proteins in speckles.</bold> A) Cells from lines SH-SY5Y and GFPSMNSHY1, expressing GFP-SMN, transiently transfected with a plasmid to express mCherry-SmB.

A comparison of nuclear bodies containing SMN (gems) and coilin (CBs) reveals these two structures to be largely separate in undifferentiated cells (10% of nuclear bodies contain both antigens). Following differentiation, the percentage of gems and CBs colocalized into a CB/gem complex increases reproducibly to approximately 25%. Detailed comparison of adult and foetal tissues has demonstrated an increase in colocalization of coilin and SMN during development in many tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). This suggests that increased colocalization of CBs and gems is a feature of cellular differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Studies using the rat PC12-derived cell line U61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) also reported an increased recruitment of SMN to nuclear CBs during neuritogenesis, although an increased number of gems devoid of coilin was also seen in differentiated cells. It seems likely, therefore, that increased presence of SMN in CBs is characteristic of increased cellular differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and maturation of tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Methylation of proteins, particularly the symmetrical dimethylation of arginine motifs in coilin, has been implicated in regulation of nuclear body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Using myc-tagged coilin expressed in HeLa cells, Matera et al. demonstrated that methylated coilin binds SMN with a higher efficiency than does unmethylated coilin. Certain strains of HeLa in which CBs and gems fail to colocalize do not methylate GFP-coilin efficiently. Inhibition of protein methylation in SH-SY5Y cells using AdOx or MTA results in a decreased association between CBs and gems in undifferentiated and in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). This is associated with a general decrease in coilin-positive bodies. These results are in partial agreement with the previous results in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), although in HeLa cells MTA, but not AdOx, caused dissociation of CBs and gems. This difference suggests that the regulation of nuclear body morphology may be subtly different in neural cells compared with other cell types. Reduction in expression of PRMT5, responsible for the addition of methyl groups to coilin, results in a severe disruption of CBs in HeLa cells [this study and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>)], but has a very little effect on nuclear bodies in SH-SY5Y cells. Despite the disruption seen in HeLa cells, coilin and SMN remain closely colocalized. This suggests that the direct molecular interactions between methylated coilin and SMN may not be the key determinant of whether CBs and gems colocalize. Symmetrical arginine dimethylation of core snRNP, Sm, proteins is required for their efficient assembly onto snRNAs during the cytoplasmic stages of snRNP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), as SMN binds preferentially to methylated Sm proteins. Downregulation of the methyltransferases PRMT5 and PRMT7 has been shown to decrease the efficiency of snRNP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). As disruption of CBs has previously been seen following inhibition of snRNP biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), reduction of snRNP maturation may contribute to the separation of gems and CBs in cells treated with global methylase inhibitors.</p><p>The prevailing view is that the purpose of accumulation of factors into the CB/gem complex is to provide increased local concentrations of rate-limiting factors for assembly and recycling pathways and so to increase their efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Cultured primary cells remain viable in the absence of visible CBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>), while the coilin knockout mouse shows somewhat decreased viability depending on the genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). These data suggest that processes normally occurring in CBs can be carried out elsewhere within the nucleus, but probably less efficiently. As increasing information becomes available about the effects of overexpression and reduction of expression of proteins involved in the CB/gem complex, it is clear that the balance between these molecular components is key to the correct formation and, by inference, function of the complex. Cells from the coilin knockout mouse contain residual CBs that accumulate nucleolar markers typical of canonical CBs but do not recruit SMN or snRNPs. In these cells, SMN is found in gems, separate from other CB markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Expression of exogenous coilin in these cells leads to the formation of normal CB/gem complexes containing coilin, SMN and Sm proteins. Moderate overexpression of coilin in HeLa cells or primary cells does not lead to increased number of CBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), with tagged versions of coilin showing wild-type localization. However, high levels of expression of GFP-coilin in HeLa cells can lead to disruption of the CB/gem complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Disruption of CBs is seen in SH-SY5Y cells transiently expressing exogenous coilin, with very few transfected cells showing correct localization of YFP-coilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>). Stable overexpression of GFP-coilin results in an almost complete loss of CBs and gems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8C</xref>). Expression of GFP-tagged Sm proteins, predicted to result in upregulation of the snRNP maturation pathway, is sufficient to cause the formation of CBs containing coilin, SMN and Sm proteins in primary cell lines that normally lack CBs. Furthermore, GFP-Sm expression causes the colocalization of CBs and gems in strains of HeLa cell where they are usually separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). This suggests that, in these cells, the CB/gem complex forms in response to upregulation of snRNP maturation. In SH-SY5Y cells, however, expression of YFP-SmB has no effect on nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B</xref>), raising the possibility that there is a difference in the regulation of nuclear body formation between neural SH-SY5Y cells and other cell types studied to date. If this proves to be the case for other neural cell types, it may be highly significant for elucidating the molecular defects responsible for SMA.</p><p>The most striking differentiation-associated change in endogenous nuclear body proteins in neural cells is an increase in SMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref>). During differentiation in two neural cell types, human SH-SY5Y (this study) and rat U61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), SMN increases its level and its accumulation in CBs. While this does not rule out upregulation of SMN as a general feature of cellular differentiation, it does suggest that increased SMN levels are associated with neural differentiation and the extension of neurites. Cells unable to sufficiently increase their SMN levels may differentiate less efficiently and be susceptible to damage or death. Expression of GFP-SMN in SH-SY5Y cells leads to complete colocalization of coilin and SMN into CB/gem complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, in these cells, it is not a lack of coilin, defects in coilin methylation or low levels of snRNP maturation that lead to the separation of CBs and gems, but a restrictive level of SMN. The complete absence of nuclear gems and CBs in SH-SY5Y cells with SMN expression lowered by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9</xref>) supports this view. Expression of additional SMN in SH-SY5Y cells not only causes the colocalization of coilin and SMN into a CB/gem complex but also increases the rate of accumulation of newly imported snRNPs in nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This observation ties the presence of a CB/gem complex containing both coilin and SMN to an increased efficiency of snRNP maturation.</p><p>It still remains to be discovered whether defects in snRNP biogenesis are responsible for the motor neuron-specific pathology seen in SMA. Disturbance of snRNP maturation has been demonstrated in a severe mouse model of SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and in cells with levels of SMN reduced to 5% of wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Associated tissue-specific defects in pre-mRNA splicing were seen. Defects in motor axon outgrowth and path finding have been documented in zebra fish models of SMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, these were rescued by purified snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), suggesting a direct link between the function of SMN in snRNP maturation and the cytoskeletal phenotype in axons and growth cones. This, again, suggests that SMN is involved in delicately balanced systems: the reduction of overall levels of SMN may cause a preferential loss of axon-specific functions of SMN in order to preserve the essential housekeeping role of SMN in supplying sufficient snRNPs to the splicing machinery. More drastic or more prolonged lack of SMN may lead to disruption of snRNP biogenesis and splicing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and differentiation</title><p>SH-SY5Y and HeLa cell lines were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).
