This single gene encoded enzyme is over-expressed in most human cancers, promoting tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>We report that targeted disruption of the murine heparanase gene eliminated heparanase enzymatic activity, resulting in accumulation of long heparan sulfate chains. Unexpectedly, the heparanase knockout (<italic>Hpse</italic>-KO) mice were fertile, exhibited a normal life span and did not show prominent pathological alterations. The lack of major abnormalities is attributed to a marked elevation in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, for example, MMP2 and MMP14 in the <italic>Hpse</italic>-KO liver and kidney. Co-regulation of heparanase and MMPs was also noted by a marked decrease in MMP (primarily MMP-2,-9 and 14) expression following transfection and over-expression of the heparanase gene in cultured human mammary carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cells. Immunostaining (kidney tissue) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (<italic>Hpse</italic>-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts) suggest that the newly discovered co-regulation of heparanase and MMPs is mediated by stabilization and transcriptional activity of &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The lack of heparanase expression and activity was accompanied by alterations in the expression level of MMP family members, primarily MMP-2 and MMP-14. It is conceivable that MMP-2 and MMP-14, which exert some of the effects elicited by heparanase (i.e., over branching of mammary glands, enhanced angiogenic response) can compensate for its absence, in spite of their different enzymatic substrate. Generation of viable <italic>Hpse</italic>-KO mice lacking significant abnormalities may provide a promising indication for the use of heparanase as a target for drug development.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies on the involvement of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in cell attachment, growth and differentiation revealed a central role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in embryogenesis, morphogenesis, angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Bernfield1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Iozzo1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Kjellen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

This observation was attributed to the fact that MMPs have many overlapping substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>, resulting in a possible redundancy <italic>in vivo</italic>. Unlike the large number of MMPs, a single functional heparanase appears to be used by cells to degrade the HS side chains of HSPGs, making it an ideal target for gene disruption. The present study suggests that heparanase, despite of having a different type of substrate, may, in some aspects, share redundancy with MMP family members by virtue of its action on a common global substrate, namely the extracellular matrix and basement membrane.</p><p>The observed accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in <italic>Hpse-</italic>KO tissues and the increased occupation of the MMP-14 promoter by &#x003b2;-catenin, suggest a possible molecular pathway linking heparanase and MMPs. &#x003b2;-Catenin, previously implicated in regulating the expression of MMP-7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Brabletz1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Crawford1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, MMP-14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, MMP-2 and MMP-9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Wu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, is a central mediator in the canonical Wnt signaling cascade involved in developmental processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Willert1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. It is conceivable that ECM remodelling and tissue morphogenesis in the <italic>Hpse</italic>-KO mice are mediated by activation of the &#x003b2;-catenin pathway and the associated upregulation of MMPs.</p><p>Over-expression of heparanase in breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) was associated with a marked decrease in the expression of MMP family members, yielding a mirror image of the results obtained with the <italic>Hpse-</italic>KO mice. Notably, this effect was dependent on heparanase enzymatic activity. Thus, when the cells were transfected with mutant heparanase lacking enzymatic activity, there was no change in MMP expression. It should be noted that not all MMPs are upregulated in response to heparanase gene silencing. Thus, unlike liver and kidney, we observed, for example, a decrease in MMP-14 and MMP-25 in the mammary glands of <italic>Hpse-</italic>KO mice (not shown), suggesting that a tissue specific co-regulation of heparanase and MMPs should be taken into account. Similarly, it appears that in a given tissue some MMPs are upregulated while other can be downregulated in response to heparanase gene knock out. Co-regulation of heparanase and MMP-9 expression was recently demonstrated in myeloma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Purushothaman1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. In this system, however, transfection of heparanase into myeloma cells, or addition of recombinant active heparanase enhanced their expression of pro MMP-9 <italic>in vitro</italic> and knockdown of heparanase expression in <italic>wt</italic> myeloma cells reduced the level of MMP-9 expression. This effect is likely mediated by ERK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Purushothaman1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Regardless of the mode of action, it appears that heparanase may function as a master regulator of protease expression and activity within tissues and the tumor microenvironment during the course of tissue morphogenesis and tumor progression. The newly identified interrelation between the two types of distinct ECM degrading enzymes, MMPs which degrade proteins and heparanase degrading HS saccharide chains, suggests a co-regulatory mechanism that affects the expression of both types of enzymes. It appears that a common cellular sensor monitors the need for ECM remodelling and regulates the balance between heparanase and MMP expression. It is conceivable that this putative sensor is activated upon release from the ECM depot, and, as proposed in our study, regulates MMP expression via the &#x003b2;-catenin pathway.</p><p>Unexpectedly, both overbranching of mammary glands and the enhanced angiogenic response observed in the <italic>Hpse</italic>-KO mice resembled the phenotype seen in heparanase over-expressing transgenic mice. This presumed incongruity could be explained by the fact that both mammary morphogenesis and the angiogenic process involve massive ECM remodelling. In both the <italic>Hpse-</italic>KO and <italic>hpa-</italic>tg mice, regulation of heparanase expression levels appears to be compromised by up- and down- regulation of MMPs, respectively. The overall end morphological appearance is the net result of the balance and co-regulation of ECM-degrading enzymes such as heparanase and MMPs.</p><p>Heparanase has been previously shown to affect gene expression. We have demonstrated, for example, that over-expression of the heparanase gene and even exogenous addition of recombinant heparanase, up-regulate the expression of VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Zetser1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and tissue factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Nadir1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Applying the <italic>hpa-</italic>tg and <italic>Hpse-</italic>KO mouse models, we have demonstrated up-regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Nadir1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> and down-regulation (our unpublished results) of tissue factor levels, <italic>in vivo.</italic> Preliminary gene array studies indicate that other genes are affected, as well. It has also been demonstrated that nuclear translocation of heparanase is associated with induction of gene expression and cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Ohkawa1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Nobuhisa1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. It is, therefore, not surprising that heparanase gene silencing and/or over expression affect the expression of other ECM-degrading enzymes such as MMPs.</p><p>Numerous studies emphasize the involvement of MMPs and heparanase in disease situations associated with cancer metastasis, angiogenesis and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Vlodavsky3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Parish1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Ilan1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Alaaho1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-PageMcCaw1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the observed regulatory association between heparanase and members of the MMP superfamily may have important clinical implications. A major effort is invested in developing specific inhibitory molecules and strategies targeting heparanase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Basche1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Naggi1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref> and MMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Dredge1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005181-Mannello1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of MMP inhibitors yielded disappointing results, in part due to redundancy among family members, compensating for the inhibited target enzyme. The observed up-regulation of MMPs in response to heparanase gene knockout favours a combined approach in which heparanase and MMP inhibiting compounds are co-administered. </p><p>Our generation of viable <italic>Hpse</italic>-KO mice lacking major visible abnormalities is regarded as a good argument for the development of heparanase-based drugs, presumably with little or no side effects. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that subtle, unidentified phenotypes may cause some side effects, depending on the drug and the target tissue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Rafael Fridman (Department of Pathology, Wayne State University, Detroit) for providing anti-MMP antibodies and molecular probes and for his support and assistance.
