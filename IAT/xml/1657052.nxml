Recent molecular genetic studies on zebrafish have revealed that interaction among pigment cells plays a key role in pattern formation, but the mechanism of pattern formation is unclear. The zebrafish <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant has broader stripes than wild-type fish. In this mutant, the development of pigment cells is normal but their distribution is altered, making these fish ideal for studying the process of pigment pattern formation. Here, we utilized a positional cloning method to determine that the <italic>inwardly rectifying potassium channel 7.1 (Kir7.1)</italic> gene is responsible for pigment cell distribution among <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant fish. Furthermore, in <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant alleles, we identified amino acid changes in the conserved region of Kir7.1, each of which affected K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel activity as demonstrated by patch-clamp experiments. Injection of a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the wild-type <italic>Kir7.1</italic> genomic sequence rescued the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> phenotype. From these results, we conclude that mutations in <italic>Kir7.1</italic> are responsible for <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic>. We also determined that the ion channel function defect of melanophores expressing mutant Kir7.1 altered the cellular response to external signals. We discovered that mutant melanophores cannot respond correctly to the melanosome dispersion signal derived from the sympathetic neuron and that melanosome aggregation is constitutively activated. In zebrafish and medaka, it is well known that melanosome aggregation and subsequent melanophore death increase when fish are kept under constant light conditions. These observations indicate that melanophores of <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant fish have a defect in the signaling pathway downstream of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor. Taken together, our results suggest that the cellular defect of the Kir7.1 mutation is directly responsible for the pattern change in the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Animals display a variety of skin pigment patterns. How these often intricate patterns are formed, however, is the longstanding question. Zebrafish is the only model organism having a pigment pattern, and thus it provides a unique system in which to investigate the mechanism of pattern formation. The striped pigment pattern of zebrafish comprises two types of pigment cells, melanophores (black chromatophores) and xanthophores (yellow chromatophores), and defects in pigment cell differentiation cause abnormal pigment patterns. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the arrangement of pigmented cells during development is unclear. In this paper, the authors cloned and studied the zebrafish mutant gene <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> and identified it as <italic>inwardly rectifying potassium channel 7.1</italic> (<italic>Kir7.1)</italic>. Although the development of pigment cells is normal in <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> fish, they have abnormally wide body stripes; thus, cell positioning is altered, suggesting that the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> functions in the system that determines pigment patterning. The connection between the Kir7.1 channel and the pigment pattern remains unclear, but the mutant melanophores are defective in intracellular aggregation and dispersion of the melanosome (pigment) controlled by the sympathetic neuron, suggesting that the signaling pathway activated by the neuron is also related to pigment pattern formation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Iwashita M, Watanabe M, Ishii M, Chen T, Johnson SL, et al.

How skin pigment patterns form, however, is a longstanding question among biologists. More than 50 y ago, a British mathematician, Alan Turing, proposed a theoretical hypothesis called the reaction-diffusion model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, which explains autonomous pattern formation such as spots and stripes by the interaction and diffusion of hypothetical molecules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The model has not been validated at the molecular level, however. Among model organisms used for genetic and/or developmental studies, zebrafish alone contains stripes on the skin, making it an ideal model for studying the molecular mechanism of pigment pattern formation. Zebrafish stripe patterns are determined mainly by the distribution of two types of pigment cells in the hypodermis during the larval-to-adult metamorphosis (approximately 2 wk)&#x02014;melanophores (dark stripes) and xanthophores (light stripes) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. To understand how the stripe pattern forms, several studies have utilized zebrafish with skin pigment pattern mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, and the molecular function of several genes responsible for the abnormal pigment pattern have been reported.

All <italic>jaguar</italic> and <italic>obelix</italic> alleles have very similar phenotypes, and each of these mutations maps to the same locus on the zebrafish genome as determined by cross tests between <italic>jaguar</italic> and <italic>obelix</italic> fish (unpublished data). We called these mutant fish <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic>. Heterozygous mutants of <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> have slightly fewer and broader stripes on the fins and some incomplete stripes on the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

From linkage analyses with microsatellite markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), we mapped the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> locus between 73.2 cM (microsatellite marker z26441) and 79.6 cM (microsattelite marker z53177) on LG15. Fine linkage analysis with the polymorphic microsatellite markers mapped the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> locus between 0.12 cM (recombinant frequency 4/3,306) on the proximal side (M190) and 0.10 cM (recombinant frequency 3/2,864) on the distal side (M234). We found that marker M48 was perfectly linked to the mutant phenotype and was located in the intron of a gene homologous to mouse <italic>inwardly rectifying potassium channel 7.1</italic> (<italic>Kir7.1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. In a critical region between M190 and M234, three genes, including <italic>Kir7.1,</italic> were predicted by ENSEMBLE transcript. We thus isolated cDNA sequences for <italic>Kir7.1</italic> and for two neighboring genes of the mutant alleles <italic>(obe<sup>tc271d</sup></italic> and <italic>obe<sup>td15</sup>)</italic> and compared them with wild-type alleles. Both mutant alleles had nucleotide changes in <italic>Kir7.1</italic> that conferred amino acid substitutions, but no amino acid change was detected in either neighboring gene. We therefore concluded that zebrafish <italic>Kir7.1</italic> is a candidate gene for the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant phenotype.</p><p>To confirm that we identified the correct gene for <italic>jaguar/obelix,</italic> we performed rescue experiments. Microinjections of mRNA to rescue the phenotype and/or injections of a morpholino-oligo to knockdown the wild-type phenotype were not effective for our mutant because stripe phenotypes of fish appear more than 1 mo after fertilization. In addition, initial attempts to rescue the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> phenotype by injecting DNA with constitutively activated <italic>Kir7.1</italic> promptly killed the embryos (unpublished data). We therefore performed microinjection of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing the genomic <italic>Kir7.1</italic> sequence (98K22&#x02032; and 126F9, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) into fertilized eggs. The injected BAC DNA should have become diluted as development proceeded; it is possible, however, that the BAC DNA was integrated into the chromosomes of some early embryonic cells, generating a chimeric fish with respect to the BAC DNA. For the injected fish that survived to adulthood, we obtained three mutant fish rescued by 98K22&#x02032; of 50 injected fish and three mutant fish rescued by 126F9 of 43 injected fish. None of the 100 injected fish that were produced with the BAC clone lacking <italic>Kir7.1</italic> showed a change of pattern. All mutant fish rescued by BAC injection had partial stripes with normal width or round spots of melanophores with a clear border between the xanthophore region on the fish body and fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).

The Kir channel is a homo/heterotetramer of four Kir subunits that have two membrane-spanning helices (M1 and M2), a short helix, and a loop region (P). The G-Y/F-G motif in the P-region of this channel forms a filter for both the selection of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions and their permeation across the channel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

Interestingly, we found that of the three <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutants, two <italic>(jag<sup>b230</sup></italic> and <italic>obe<sup>tc271d</sup>)</italic> contained amino acid substitutions in the P-region and one <italic>(obe<sup>td15</sup>)</italic> contained a substitution in the M2 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g004">4</xref>B). To determine if these substitutions affected protein function, we performed voltage-clamp experiments to analyze HEK293 membranes exogenously expressing zebrafish Kir7.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g004">Figure 4</xref>C to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g004">4</xref>F).

To determine the melanophore response of homozygous <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> fish, we placed them in tanks with dark or light backgrounds for an extended period (1 d) and verified that the color adaptation of melanophores occurred normally (i.e., normal hormonal response; unpublished data). However, when the mutant fish were subjected to rapid alternation of background color (3-min intervals), melanophores from <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> fish responded differently than those from wild-type fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g005">Figure 5</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The wild-type melanophores quickly responded to rapid background color changes in both directions (from dark to light, and from light to dark). Most of the melanophores in <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> fish also responded to the rapid background change from dark to light, although the extent of aggregation in the mutant melanophores appeared to be more pronounced than in the wild-type. Interestingly, mutant melanophores did not disperse melanosomes in response to the rapid change of background from light to dark, whereas melanophores of the wild-type fish dispersed melanosomes quickly. We concluded that this mutant lacks a quick response system for melanophores. These observations suggest that the regulation of melanosome aggregation and dispersion, which is under neuronal control, is impaired in <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant fish.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-Adrenoceptor Signaling Is Deficient in Melanophores of <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> Mutant Fish</title><p>Several studies have reported that melanosome aggregation-dispersion in teleost fish is mainly controlled through the &#x003b1;<sub> 2</sub>-adrenoceptor expressed in melanophores &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b036">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine whether the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> defect also is controlled by the melanophore &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor, we examined the response of melanophores to either epinephrine (an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist) or yohimbine (an antagonist) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). When the fish were placed in water containing epinephrine, melanosome aggregation was observed in both wild-type and mutant fish, but the extent of aggregation in the mutant melanophores appeared to be more pronounced than in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). On the other hand, when the fish were placed in water containing yohimbine, melanophores in the wild-type fish dispersed melanosomes regardless of the white background color because the antagonist blocks the endogenous aggregation signal, but the mutant melanophores failed to disperse melanosomes and aggregation persisted for a long period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020197-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). These observations suggest a defect in the signaling pathway downstream of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor in melanophores of <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant fish.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that Kir7.1 dysfunction causes wider stripes in <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant fish. It is difficult, however, to directly connect the known function of Kir7.1 with the phenotypes induced by the <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutations. Several studies have shown that the role of the Kir family channel is to maintain membrane potential and sustain ionic composition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, it is quite likely that many kinds of cell&#x02013;cell signaling pathways that may be related to the pattern formation are affected by the dysfunction of the protein. It also has been reported that Kir family proteins are involved in a receptor-stimulated signaling cascade &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, and we predicted that functional loss of Kir7.1 would cause defects in the cellular response to external signals. Accordingly, we determined that <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant melanophores elicit a normal response to hormonal signals but an abnormal response to the neuronal signals that control melanosome aggregation and dispersion. Further tests utilizing an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist (epinephrine) and an antagonist (yohimbine) suggested that mutant melanophores have a defect in the signaling pathway downstream of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor.</p><p>In the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor pathway, it is important to note that melanosome aggregation in melanophores is caused by the reduction of cAMP concentration through G proteins, depending on the amount of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor ligand that binds the G protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, it has been reported that one of the major functions of Kir family proteins is to sustain K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis by potassium ion buffering and uptake, and that the loss of function of Kir channels can induce an increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, an increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> has pleiotropic effects on the activity of intracellular factors such as calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which becomes activated and leads to the reduction of cAMP concentration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, if Kir7.1 is related to the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor signaling pathway, it might have a role in maintaining ionic composition for normal cAMP signaling. This hypothesis provides a link between the Kir7.1 K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel defect and the abnormal melanosome movement found in <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutants.</p><p>It is difficult to explain how stripe width changes upon a defect in Kir7.1 function because most of the complex interactions among pigment cells are largely uncharacterized. However, recent studies with zebrafish pigment pattern mutants suggest that pattern formation is controlled by mutual interactions among melanophore and xanthophore pigment cells and that these cells control each other's development, migration, and death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. This process stabilizes the balance between the number and position of melanophores and xanthophores and leads to normal stripe patterning. Therefore, the lack of control in cell development, migration, and cell death can result in abnormal pattern formation. In zebrafish and medaka, the constitutive induction of melanosome aggregation by norepinephrine causes cell death mediated by attenuation of cAMP-PKA signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Our experimental results using <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> fish indicate that the aggregation response was heavy and that aggregation was sustained for a long period even after the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor was blocked by yohimbine. Furthermore, we found that the melanophore density in mutant fish was significantly lower than in the wild-type fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020197-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, we predict that the melanophores in the mutant fish may become more sensitive to the cell death signal, resulting in an aberrant interaction between melanophores and xanthophores that leads to pattern change. Based on the above reasoning, the newly characterized cellular phenotype described in this study may be critical for determining the link between genetic mutation and pigment pattern alteration.</p><p>To determine that the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor signaling defect directly leads to the wide-stripe phenotype, the signaling pathway must be controlled artificially in vivo. However, the pigment pattern does not appear clearly until the adult stage, and therefore signaling pathway disruption would result in abnormal fish development. In our preliminary experiment in which fish were maintained in breeding water containing epinephrine at a low concentration that did not inhibit the normal growth of the fish, we found that the pigment pattern of the wild-type fish became similar to that of heterozygous <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> mutant fish (unpublished data). Thus, increased &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor pathway activity may lead to the wider stripe phenotype, although this theory will require further confirmation.</p><p>We recently reported that the gene <italic>connexin41.8</italic> is responsible for the mutant phenotype of <italic>leopard,</italic> which has a round spot pattern &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; (T. Chen and S. L. Johnson, personal communication). This gene encodes another channel that can form both hemichannels and intercellular channels. The function of Connexin41.8 in pigment pattern change is unknown, but it is intriguing to note that one of the common features of <italic>leopard</italic> and <italic>jaguar/obelix</italic> is that small molecules affect pattern change. Additionally, Kir7.1 and Connexin41.8 are both thought to contribute to cell&#x02013;cell interactions between melanophores, between xanthophores, and/or between melanophores and xanthophores &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020197-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.
