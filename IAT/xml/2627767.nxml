KRAP (Ki-<italic>ras</italic>-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule, however, its physiological roles remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that <italic>KRAP</italic>-deficient (<italic>KRAP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia. <italic>KRAP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia. Notably, glucose uptake in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in <italic>KRAP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice is enhanced in an insulin-independent manner, suggesting that BAT is involved in altered energy homeostasis in <italic>KRAP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, although UCP (Uncoupling protein) expressions are not altered.
