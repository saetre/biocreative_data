Deletion of 8p23.2 or reduced expression of <italic>CSMD1 </italic>has been associated with poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and in prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p><italic>CSMD1</italic>, consisting of 70 exons spread over two megabases of 8p23.2, encodes a rare 11.5 kb transcript most abundantly expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is the founding member of a novel, evolutionarily highly conserved gene family whose proteins contain multiple domains thought to be sites of protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions and whose structure suggests that they may be transmembrane receptors or adhesion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Tumor suppressor genes are expected to be inactivated in cancers either genetically by mutations or epigenetically by modification of their promoters. While <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts are detectable in upper aerodigestive tract epithelium, preliminary analysis of several head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines suggested that <italic>CSMD1 </italic>expression was lost in these lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although the region containing <italic>CSMD1 </italic>is frequently deleted in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and prostatic adenocarcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], point mutations in the gene are relatively rare in primary squamous cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (Schmidt, Richter and Scholnick, unpublished). Nonsense or splice junction mutations in <italic>CSMD1 </italic>have not been reported and not enough is known about the function of the protein to accurately assess the effect of the few missense mutations that have been detected. Thus, if <italic>CSMD1 </italic>is inactivated in tumors, alternative mechanisms for gene silencing must be operating.</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that while most squamous cell carcinoma cell lines do not express full length <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts, nearly all produce abnormal transcripts unlikely to encode functional CSMD1 proteins. Methylation of the DNA preceding <italic>CSMD1</italic>'s first exon is correlated with reduction in the level of expression and cell lines expressing at low levels do not appear to elongate the full 11.5 kb transcript. Other anomalies of expression include incorrect splicing and the use of cryptic promoters. Our data suggest that activation of these promoters may result from the global demethylation of the genome associated with tumorigenesis (reviewed by Ehrlich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]).</p><p>Taken together these data demonstrate that mechanisms other than point mutation are responsible for the aberrant <italic>CSMD1 </italic>expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, and these data suggest potential targets for further investigation in primary tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CSMD1 promoter methylation in HNSCC cell lines is correlated with expression levels</title><p>Preliminary evidence suggested that <italic>CSMD1 </italic>expression is lost in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] but that point mutations were rare [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and Schmidt, Richter and Scholnick, unpublished]. To date, only two of the 20 cell lines we have tested for <italic>CSMD1 </italic>expression, UPCI:SCC066 and PCI-13, express large transcripts initiated at the normal <italic>CSMD1 </italic>promoter. These data suggest that a mechanism(s) other than point mutation must be responsible for the loss of expression. <italic>CSMD1</italic>'s first exon is embedded in a 3.7 kb CpG island (data from the UCSC genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) suggesting that promoter methylation might epigenetically silence the gene. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed 32 head and neck cancer cell lines for <italic>CSMD1 </italic>promoter methylation using the Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) technique described by Xiong and Laird (Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. COBRA analysis of the three amplicons diagrammed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> suggested that 28 of the cell lines (87%) had more promoter methylation than did normal upper aerodigestive epithelium (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Positions of the amplicons used for COBRA and bisulfite sequencing relative to <italic>CSMD1</italic>'s first exon and the CpG island. Amplicon 1 extends from -395 to -112 bp, amplicon 2 from +175 to +396 bp, and amplicon 3 from +398 to +718 bp relative to the first base of the transcript. The region between amplicons 1 and 2 is so GC rich that no workable PCR primers could be designed to amplify it after bisulfite conversion. Transcription of <italic>CSMD1 </italic>is from left to right in the figure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2867-5-29-1"/></fig><p>We selected nine of these cell lines for high resolution analysis of promoter methylation by sequencing of clones from bisulfite converted genomic DNA. This approach has the distinct advantage of allowing determination of the state of all the CpG dinucleotides within an amplicon on an allele by allele basis. Amplicons 1 and 2 have 19 and 20 CpG dinucleotides, respectively. Amplicon 3 could not be examined by this technique because it is unclonable after bisulfite conversion. The methylation data were correlated to <italic>CSMD1 </italic>expression levels as measured by quantitative RT-PCR using an amplicon spanning exons 1 and 2 (Methods). A pool of cDNA from five normal oropharyngeal epithelium specimens served as a basis for comparison to the cell lines.</p><p>Our data from amplicon 1 demonstrate a clear relationship between methylation and the level of expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The bisulfite sequencing data confirm that there is relatively little promoter methylation in normal tissue (clones 1&#x02013;20, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This is also the case in cell line UPCI:SCC066 which expresses a large <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcript from the normal promoter at a level approximately 33% of that of normal tissue (clones 32&#x02013;39, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). PCI-13, our highest expressing line at 125% of normal epithelium, displays two distinct patterns of promoter methylation with some clones heavily methylated (clones 21&#x02013;24, and 30) and others with no methylation (clones 25&#x02013;39 and 31; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This pattern is consistent with either heterozygosity for methylation or the co-existence of 2 distinct populations within the cell line, one heavily methylated and one unmethylated. We cannot distinguish between these two possibilities using the currently available data.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Methylation status of each of the 19 CpG dinucleotides in amplicon 1.

Cell lines with more amplicon 1 methylation tend to express the gene at lower levels but the relationship is not strictly quantitative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, our data revealed no relationship between expression level and methylation of amplicon 2 (located towards the 3' end of exon 1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For example, all of the 10 clones of amplicon 2 sequenced from PCI-13 were methylated at 19 or 20 of their 20 CpG dinucleotides. UPCI:SCC066, on the other hand, has nearly no methylation in amplicon 2 with only a single methylated CpG dinucleotide detected in one clone out of the nine sequenced.

A survey of 20 cell lines using a battery of RT-PCR primer pairs located throughout the 11.5 kb transcript reveals that this is not the case. These lines included OKF6-TERT1, a TERT immortalized, p16 deficient but untransformed oral keratinocyte cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that the low expressing cell lines shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> express considerably more of the 5' end of the 11.5 kb transcript than they do exons further 3', a phenomenon well illustrated by cell line PCI-100. This line expresses the exon 1/exon 2 amplicon at approximately 15% of the level of normal epithelium. In contrast, we had previously reported that <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts were not detectable in this line by combined RT-PCR and Southern blotting using three sets of intron spanning primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The most 5' of those amplicons spans exons 9 through 26.</p><p>Analysis with additional primer pairs resolves this apparent paradox by demonstrating that the amount of transcript declines sharply and reproducibly as one examines progressively more 3' exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The same effect is seen using either oligo-dT or random hexamer primed cDNA. No transcript of this structure has been detected in normal epithelium nor have we detected any sequence alterations in PCI-100 that would explain why the full transcript is not expressed. It is not clear whether PCI-100 produces a small number of discrete size classes of transcript, if individual transcripts terminate at random points within the very large introns in this part of the gene (the first 10 introns average ~150 kb in length), or if the short transcripts result from the elevated activity of a previously undetected posttranscriptional control mechanism.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>RT-PCR data demonstrating the preferential loss of longer <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts in cell line PCI-100.

Subsequent finer scale analysis demonstrates that PCI-13's transcript lacks exons 4 and 5, resulting in a frameshift-induced nonsense codon in exon 6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Sequencing of the PCI-13 RT-PCR product demonstrates the direct juxtaposition of wildtype exons 3 and 6 and that the transcript contains no novel sequences or splices that would prevent the frameshift. UPCI:SCC066 produces two transcripts, a normal one that includes exons 4 and 5 and another that lacks them (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). RT-PCR of human fetal brain cDNA reveals very low levels of an RT-PCR product corresponding in size to that expected from the internally deleted transcript. This band is not readily visible at the exposure used for Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>. We have not detected a similar sized PCR product in RNA from oropharyngeal epithelium but this may reflect the fact that <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts are ~10x less abundant in oropharyngeal epithelium than they are in fetal brain (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>A) RT-PCR demonstrating deletion of exons 4 and 5 from the <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts of cell lines PCI-13 and UPCI:SCC066.

Like PCI-100, these lines express low levels of the very 5' end of the transcript and even lower levels of more 3' exons within the first half of the transcript. However, these lines are distinct in expressing higher levels of the 3' half of the transcript, suggesting that alternative promoters in the middle of the gene may be used. SCC9 was chosen for further study because it expresses the 3' half of the transcript at a level dramatically higher than normal for oropharyngeal epithelium. Northern blotting detects a comparatively abundant 6.4 kb truncated transcript as well as smaller amounts of an 8.7 kb transcript in SCC9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The other three cell lines express their truncated <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts at lower levels (data not shown). Sequence analysis of <italic>CSMD1 </italic>cDNA clones from SCC9 demonstrates that many transcripts are improperly spliced, resulting in retention of intronic sequences and/or deletion of exonic sequences (data not shown). In particular, retention of sequences from intron 40 is common. The high frequency of faulty splicing may explain the broadness of the 6.4 kb <italic>CSMD1 </italic>band in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and suggests that the 8.7 kb transcript may also be incompletely or improperly spliced.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>A) Northern blot showing the truncated <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcript expressed by the SCC9 cell line.

Only the 5'-most 120 base pairs of the Alu element are present in the genome. RT-PCR using a forward primer specific for the novel sequences of the SCC9 transcript (prm1904, cgtttagttcgacacacttcatgt) demonstrates that cell lines 041, PCI-1 and PCI-2 do not initiate their <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts at the same point, suggesting that other cryptic promoters are active in these lines.

We selected two low expressing cell lines with promoter methylation, UPCI:SCC104 and 094, for treatment with various concentrations of 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) as well as combinations of either of those drugs with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. These treatments did not reactivate the silenced <italic>CSMD1 </italic>promoter.

Of the HNSCC cell lines examined, only UPCI:SCC066 appears to express a normal transcript from the expected promoter. Even that cell line produces a second species of aberrantly spliced transcript lacking internal exons. Our data suggest that epigenetic modification of the DNA 5' of the transcription start site may contribute to the down-regulation of <italic>CSMD1</italic>. In addition, a low level of expression appears to be associated with production of prematurely terminated transcripts. This degree of complexity might be expected from a 2 megabase, 70 exon gene.</p><p>Methylation of a specific region of the CpG island, -395 to -112 bp relative to the transcriptional start site (amplicon 1), appears to be correlated with the activity of the normal <italic>CSMD1 </italic>promoter. In contrast, methylation of amplicon 2, located within the first exon, shows no such relationship. Our data suggest that the relationship between the amount of methylation in amplicon 1 and the level of expression may not be strictly quantitative. Differences between cell lines with amplicon 1 methylation could arise through a number of mechanisms, for example, variations in the levels of transcription factors between cell lines. In cases where there is considerable heterogeneity in the methylation pattern within a cell line like PCI-100, alleles with less methylation may be expressed at higher levels than those more heavily methylated (compare clones 51 and 52 to clone 58 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Alternatively, the presence of methylation in amplicon 1 could be a qualitative but not strictly quantitative indicator of methylation of a critical segment of the promoter not discovered in this study.</p><p>The normal <italic>CSMD1 </italic>promoter was not reactivated by drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, nor did the drugs abolish <italic>CSMD1 </italic>promoter methylation, even at toxic doses. Not all genes with promoter methylation respond to such treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These drug treatments did, however, provide a potential explanation for the use of a normally cryptic promoter by cell line SCC9. The <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcript in this line is initiated near a partial Alu element. 5-aza-dC treatment of cell line 094 activates the same cryptic promoter. This suggests that cryptic promoters may be naturally activated by general hypomethylation of the genome in cancer cells and the subsequent release of repetitive elements from epigenetic repression (reviewed by Ehrlich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). The SCC9 transcript does not appear to encode a functional protein but, with a very large gene like <italic>CSMD1</italic>, there is a potential for some abnormally initiated transcripts to encode truncated proteins with dominant negative properties.</p><p>The second ramification of this finding is for the interpretation of data obtained by treating cells with methyltransferase inhibitors. Detection of <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts solely with primers mapping to the 3' end of the gene could have been erroneously interpreted as representing reactivation of the normal promoter. It seems imperative that such experiments demonstrate that transcripts detected after drug treatment are actually initiated at the normal promoter.</p><p>Aberrant splicing also appears to play a role in the production of defective <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcripts. Loss of splicing fidelity has been proposed as a characteristic of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and this would be consistent with the variety of misspliced transcripts we detected from SCC9. However, the removal of exons 4 and 5 from the <italic>CSMD1 </italic>transcript in PCI-13 may reflect a more specific phenomenon than a general inability to splice large introns; this line is still capable of splicing large introns as evidenced by its successful splicing of exon 3 to exon 6, eliminating an intron of over 666 kb. The failure to include exons 4 and 5 may be due to inactivation of a splicing enhancer in intron 3, or to less efficient splicing due to the fact that exons 4 and 5 do not begin with the consensus G residue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our data suggest that <italic>CSMD1 </italic>function is lost in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines through a variety of mechanisms other than point mutagenesis. Epigenetic modifications of amplicon 1 and defective splicing appear to be fruitful areas to explore in primary head and neck squamous cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and tissue samples</title><p>DNA from HNSCC cell lines UMSCC9, UMSCC35, UMSCC37, UMSCC38, UMSCC45, UMSCC49, UMSCC65, UMSCC68, and UMSCC76 was provided by Dr. Thomas Carey, University of Michigan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].
