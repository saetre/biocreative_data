After photo-activation at 350 nm the cross-links to ribosomal proteins and RNA were identified by our standard procedures. In the 30S subunit protein S19 (and weakly S9 and S13) was the target of cross-linking from tRNA at the A site, S7, S9 and S13 from the P site and S7 from the E site. Similarly, in the 50S subunit L16 and L27 were cross-linked from the A site, L1, L5, L16, L27 and L33 from the P site and L1 and L33 from the E site. Corresponding cross-links to rRNA were localized by RNase H digestion to the following areas: in 16S rRNA between positions 687 and 727 from the P and E sites, positions 1318 and 1350 (P site) and 1350 and 1387 (E site); in the 23S rRNA between positions 865 and 910 from the A site, 1845 and 1892 (P site), 1892 and 1945 (A site), 2282 and 2358 (P site), 2242 and 2461 (P and E sites), 2461 and 2488 (A site), 2488 and 2539 (all three sites) and 2572 and 2603 (A and P sites). In most (but not all) cases, more precise localizations of the cross-link sites could be made by primer extension analysis.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0113-a" xlink:role="4637"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0113-b" xlink:role="4637"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0114-a" xlink:role="4638"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4635"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4636"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4637"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4638"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4639"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4640"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4641"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
