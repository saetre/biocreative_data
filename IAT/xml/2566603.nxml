Using a construct containing the VEGF promoter linked to a luciferase reporter, we found that a mutation reducing HIF binding to the VEGF promoter had no significant effect on luciferase production induced by M-CSF stimulation. Further analysis revealed that M-CSF induced VEGF through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway via the transcription factor, Sp1. Thus, inhibition of either ERK or Sp1 suppressed M-CSF-induced VEGF at the mRNA and protein level. M-CSF also induced the nuclear localization of Sp1, which was blocked by ERK inhibition. Finally, mutating the Sp1 binding sites within the VEGF promoter or inhibiting ERK decreased VEGF promoter activity in M-CSF-treated human monocytes. To evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF induced VEGF production, we used an <italic>in vivo</italic> angiogenesis model to illustrate the ability of M-CSF to recruit mononuclear phagocytes, increase VEGF levels, and enhance angiogenesis.

Upon binding M-CSF, the M-CSF receptor dimerizes and elicits intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity triggering signaling pathways that induce cell survival. Using human monocytes, we previously demonstrated that M-CSF activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway, which induces cell survival by suppressing caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003405-Kelley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

During hypoxic conditions, the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) proteins regulate VEGF production. At low oxygen levels, the HIFs are stabilized and bind promoter sites known as hypoxia regulatory elements (HREs), driving the transcription of over 20 hypoxia-inducible genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003405-Besse1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. During normoxia, VEGF can be expressed from cells by hypoxia-independent mechanisms still involving the HIF apparatus.

Finally, the importance of VEGF in tumor progression is well-established.

Here, we elucidate the biochemical mechanism of this phenomenon by first investigating the role of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). During hypoxic stress, HIFs are the master regulators of VEGF and function by binding to the hypoxia regulatory element (HRE) sequence within the VEGF promoter. We utilized both wild type and mutant VEGF promoter constructs driving luciferase production. We transfected human monocytes with either the pGL3-basic empty vector, the same pGL3 construct containing a 1.5 kb portion of the wild type VEGF promoter, or a VEGF promoter construct containing a mutated HRE to prohibit HIF protein binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003405-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). This assay measures luciferase production as a function of VEGF promoter activation. All cells were transfected using the Amaxa Nucleofector, stimulated with M-CSF, and subsequent luciferase production was measured at 16 hours and represented as fold-change over the luciferase production from the pGL3 empty vector. When transfecting the eGFP control construct into human monocytes, we observed an efficiency of 55.3&#x00025; as analyzed by flow cytometry (data not shown). Cells expressing the VEGF wild type construct displayed a 4.5-fold increase in luciferase production compared to the pGL3-basic empty vector control (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.020). Mutation in the HRE did not affect the luciferase production (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.743) suggesting M-CSF-induced VEGF promoter activation is HIF-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003405-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003405-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003405.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>M-CSF induced VEGF production occurs through a HIF-independent mechanism.</title><p>A) The 1.5 kb wild type VEGF promoter <italic>(WT1.5 kb)</italic> and the same promoter sequence containing a non-functional mutation of the hypoxia regulatory element (HRE) <italic>(&#x00394;HRE)</italic> were inserted into the pGL3-basic vector to create constructs that produce luciferase upon VEGF promoter activation.

Therefore, we investigated the roles of Akt and the MAP kinases in M-CSF-induced VEGF production from primary human monocytes. We treated peripheral blood monocytes with pharmacological inhibitors targeting PI3 kinase, the upstream activator of Akt (LY294002), mTOR, a signaling molecule downstream of Akt (Rapamycin), JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580), or ERK (U0126) and stimulated these cells with M-CSF. We analyzed VEGF levels in the supernatants by ELISA. Our data suggested that the PI3-K/Akt pathway did not regulate M-CSF-induced VEGF production as neither LY294002 nor Rapamycin affected VEGF production (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.898 for 1 &#x000b5;M and p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.334 for 10 &#x000b5;M LY294002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003405-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>) and (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.0 for 1 &#x000b5;M and p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.640 for 10 &#x000b5;M Rapamycin) (data not shown).

We found that protein levels of Sp1 were not depleted from these cells until 48 hours after transfection. This created a challenge in VEGF determination as cultured, primary human monocytes differentiate into macrophages which become less responsive to M-CSF and therefore make it difficult to measure VEGF production from these cells. Additionally, transfection of monocytes with Lipofectamine alone induced the production of VEGF that masked induction of VEGF by M-CSF (data not shown). As a result, we attempted to transfect the siRNA using the Amaxa Nucleofector. Using this method, transfection alone induced the production of the soluble form of VEGFR-1, which sequesters VEGF from antigenic detection by ELISA.

M-CSF may affect the stability of the HIFs and induce their binding to the HRE, but we did not observe a functional role for HIF binding in M-CSF-induced VEGF promoter activity.</p><p>The transcription factor Sp1 is activated by ERK and induces VEGF production in other cells. Milanini et al demonstrated a cooperative effect of AP-2 and Sp1 to activate the VEGF promoter. They transfected a fibroblast cell line with mutated VEGF promoter constructs and found that only the VEGF promoter construct with mutations in both the Sp1 and AP-2 binding sites displayed reduced promoter activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003405-Milanini1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. By performing similar promoter assay experiments, we found that a mutation in the Sp1 binding site alone was sufficient to reduce M-CSF-induced VEGF promoter activity to basal levels. Mutation of the AP-2 binding site within the VEGF promoter construct did reduce luciferase levels about 20&#x00025;, however, this reduction was not statistically significant or comparable to the luciferase production observed with the Sp1 mutant. Therefore, we do not rule out a possible cooperative effect of Sp1 and AP-2 for VEGF promoter activation, but in our model of M-CSF stimulation of human monocytes, we found Sp1 to be the main transcription factor responsible for VEGF production.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate the ability of M-CSF to induce angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay, we showed that M-CSF recruited mononuclear phagocytes, increased VEGF protein levels, and increased the number of blood vessels formed within the Matrigel plug. The recruitment of F480-positive cells was expected as M-CSF is a known chemoattractant for monocytes/macrophages, alone or through induction of monocyte chemoattractant protein (CCL2/MCP-1) by monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003405-Baran1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003405-Leonard1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Our observation of increased VEGF production and angiogenesis within the M-CSF-containing plugs confirms the ability of M-CSF to induce angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition to inducing VEGF production from monocytes, M-CSF is also known to stimulate the production of other pro-angiogenic factors, such as IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003405-Pages1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and MMP-9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003405-Tojo1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. To decipher the angiogenic molecule responsible for the blood vessel formation in the M-CSF-containing plugs, we added a neutralizing antibody to VEGF to the M-CSF-containing plugs. The neutralization of VEGF within these plugs significantly reduced the angiogenesis implicating VEGF as a necessary molecule in M-CSF-induced angiogenesis.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate the biochemical details of M-CSF-induced VEGF production. We propose a pathway involving M-CSF-induced ERK activation followed by ERK-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor Sp1, which then translocates to the nucleus and binds to its specific sequence within the VEGF promoter to drive transcription of VEGF mRNA. Previous data on VEGF regulation has been obtained using cell lines; we demonstrate our phenomenon in primary human monocytes, enhancing the relevance of this observation. This manuscript describes the pro-angiogenic potential of M-CSF as it pertains to mononuclear phagocyte recruitment, VEGF production, and angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. The abundance of clinical data from cancer patients correlating high levels of M-CSF, mononuclear phagocytes, and VEGF with poor prognosis highlights the importance of increasing our understanding of this paradigm. We believe studies linking these three components may cultivate understanding and aid in the genesis of novel therapies for numerous cancers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Susheela Tridandapani for her assistance in preparing this manuscript.
