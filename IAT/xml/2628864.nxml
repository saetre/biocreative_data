Under hypoxia, a condition often found in solid tumors, HIF-1&#x003b1; is activated to induce target genes involved in chemoresistance, inhibition of apoptosis and tumor progression. Here, we investigated whether the HIPK2 overexpression could downregulate HIF-1&#x003b1; expression and activity in tumor cells treated with hypoxia-mimicking condition, and evaluated whether HIPK2-dependent downregulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; could sensitize chemoresistant tumor cells to adriamycin (ADR)-induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Tumor cell lines carrying wild-type p53, siRNA p53, or mutant p53 were overexpressed with HIPK2 (full length or catalytic inactive mutant) and treated with cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>) to mimic hypoxia, in the presence or absence of ADR treatment. HIF-1&#x003b1; expression was measured by semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Western immunoblotting and HIF-1 activity was evaluated by luciferase assay using reporter plasmid containing hypoxia response elements (HREs) upstream of luciferase gene.

HIPK2 carries out its potential oncosuppressor function through both its catalytic and transcriptional co-repressor activities. We and others have found that HIPK2 phosphorylates p53 at serine 46 (Ser46) after severe DNA damage and induces apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; we also found that silencing of HIPK2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], inhibits drug-induced apoptosis inducing chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and increases genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], moreover, we showed that HIPK2 ovrexpression circumvents the blockade of apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant cells, restoring the p53-dependent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The role of HIPK2 in regulating tumor growth has been also evidenced in p53-independent manner. We have shown that HIPK2 downregulates the cPLA2-induced prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) production, and that HIPK2 silencing increases <italic>in vivo </italic>tumor growth and tumor vascularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, we have found that HIPK2 can suppress the &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, we have recently found that HIPK2 binds to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) promoter, in a co-repressor complex with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), to repress HIF-1&#x003b1; at transcriptional level with subsequent suppression of HIF-1 transcriptional activity, in normoxic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor that transactivates more than 60 target genes involved in multiple aspects of tumorigenesis including tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemotherapy response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. HIF-1 consists of two subunits, HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]: HIF-1&#x003b2; is constitutively expressed in cells, while HIF-1&#x003b1; stability is stimulated by hypoxia, growth factors, and several oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] thus, HIF-1&#x003b1; is overexpressed in many types of tumors and contributes to chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Activation of HIF-1 depends primarily upon redox-sensitive stabilization of its &#x003b1; subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] however, HIF-1 responsive genes can be induced by cobalt ions with kinetics similar to that of hypoxia induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms of chemoresistance appear to be multifactorial and include, among others, inhibition of apoptosis and dysfunction of p53 oncosuppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Growing evidence suggests that hypoxia in tumors selects for cells with decreased potential for apoptosis through for instance the overexpression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 and decreased killing effect through upregulation of drug transporter proteins that may contribute to resistance to standard radio- and chemo-therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, multidrug resistance (MDR) is a serious obstacle for cancer chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The MDR phenotype is associated with induction of the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] which encodes for P-glicoprotein a transporter protein able to extrude a range of anti-cancer drugs out of the cell, lowering their concentration below the level required for cytotoxic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. <italic>MDR1 </italic>has been shown to be HIF-1 target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and is involved in the acquisition of multidrug resistance in various types of cancers cells, for instance, tumors resistance to doxorubicin is associated with increased levels of <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>A recent survey of malignant and normal tissues found that the expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; is commonly increased in a variety of human tumors including colorectal carcinoma and glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate, in colon cancer and glioblastoma cell lines, whether HIPK2 might inhibit HIF-1&#x003b1; expression and activity in hypoxia-mimicking condition and sensitize chemoresistant tumor cells to adriamycin (ADR)-induced apoptosis. The results show that overexpression of HIPK2 inhibited HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA levels and cobalt-stabilized HIF-1&#x003b1; protein, with subsequent suppression of HIF-1 transcriptional activity. The HIPK2-mediated inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; correlated with suppression of MDR1 and Bcl-2 gene transcription and with sensitization of cobalt treated-tumor cells, regardless of their p53 status, to ADR-induced apoptosis. Thus, HIPK2 could be useful in cancer therapy to enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>HIPK2 downregulates HIF-1&#x003b1; expression and protein levels in hypoxia-mimicking condition</title><p>To address whether HIPK2 might regulate the HIF-1&#x003b1; expression induced by hypoxia, tumor cells were treated with cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>) that stabilizes HIF-1&#x003b1; and induces HIF-1 responsive genes with kinetics similar to that of hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. RKO colon cancer cells, carrying wild-type p53, stably transfected with siRNA control vector (RKO-C) or with siRNA p53 vector (RKO-p53i), and T98G glioblastoma cells, carrying mutant p53, were transfected with HIPK2 or its catalytic inactive mutant K221R. After transfection, cells were treated with CoCl<sub>2 </sub>(200 &#x003bc;M) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, HIPK2 overexpression downmodulated HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA levels while the K221R mutant failed to do so. HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA expression levels were not induced by cobalt treatment, as expected. Furthermore, the cobalt-stabilized HIF-1&#x003b1; protein levels were strongly suppressed by HIPK2 overexpression, compared to the K221R kinase inactive mutant in all three cell lines analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Then, the HIF-1&#x003b1; protein half-life was evaluated after HIPK2 overexpression. RKO-C cells were transfected with either HIPK2 expression vector or the empty vector and 24 h later exposed to cobalt treatment to induce HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation. Thereafter (t = 0), the synthesis of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide (CHX) and the degradation of the cobalt-stabilized HIF-1&#x003b1; protein was monitored for a further period of 180 min. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, HIPK2 was able to accelerate the degradation of cobalt-stabilized HIF-1&#x003b1;, compared to the empty vector-transfected cells. Densitometric analysis of protein expression show that the HIF-1&#x003b1; half-life after transfection with the empty vector was of about 120 min and drop down to about 80 min after HIPK2 overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These data suggest that HIPK2 downmodulated HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA and protein levels under hypoxia-mimicking condition and that the HIPK2 catalytic activity was involved in this regulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>HIPK2 downregulated HIF-1a expression and protein levels in hypoxia-mimicking condition</bold>.

To this end, H1299 cells were co-transfected with pEpoE-luc or pEpoEM1-luc reporters and HIPK2 or K221R expression vectors. After transfection cells were treated with CoCl<sub>2 </sub>for 24 h. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, overexpression of HIPK2 markedly suppressed the cobalt-induction of luciferase gene expression. Moreover, this effect correlated with the HIPK2 catalytic activity. HIPK2 did not affect the activity of the pEpoEM1-luc reporter that was neither induced by cobalt-treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Thus, the effect of HIPK2 on luciferase gene expression was HIF-1-dependent.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>HIPK2 inhibited HIF1 transcriptional activity of target genes</bold>.

On the other hand, the already elevated MDR1 and Bcl2 mRNA levels in RKO p53i and in T98G cells, compared to RKO-C cells, were not further increased by cobalt treatment, at least at the time point analyzed; however, they were strongly suppressed by HIPK2 overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

To this aim, RKO-C, RKO-p53i and T98G cells were transfected with HIPK2-GFP and K221R-GFP expression vectors and soon after transfection treated with cobalt. The GFP detection by fluorescence microscope allowed to monitor transfection efficiency that was comparable between HIPK2 and K221R expression vectors and among the three cell lines. Cell viability was then determined by Trypan blue exclusion 24 h later. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, HIPK2 induced cell death, compared to K221R, in cobalt-treated cells, ranging from 10% (in p53i and T98G cells) to 20% (in RKO-C cells). However, long-term analysis of cell survival show that HIPK2 overexpression did not reduce colony-forming ability of the cobalt-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The effect of hypoxia-mimicking condition on survival after HIPK2 overexpression was highly reproducible in three different experiments. We have previously shown that HIPK2 strongly decreases colony formation of RKO cells compared to K221R transfection, inducing p53-dependent apoptosis, furthermore, HIPK2 does not suppress colony formation in either p53 mutant or null cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, these data suggest that HIPK2 was able to induce transient cell death in cobalt-treated cells, thus, it did not induce long-lasting cell death, as seen by colony assay, neither apoptosis (see below).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of HIPK2 on cell death and survival after cobalt treatment</bold>.

Therefore, we asked whether HIPK2 could sensitize cobalt-treated cells to drug-induced apoptosis. To this aim, RKO-C, RKO-p53i, and T98G cells were transfected with HIPK2 expression vector; soon after transfection cells were trypsinized, counted and equal cell numbers were re-plated in triplicate prior to the exposure of cells to CoCl<sub>2 </sub>and ADR alone or in combination. Twenty-four hours later, cell viability was assayed by Trypan blue exclusion. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, exposure to CoCl<sub>2 </sub>strongly reduced the ADR-induced cell death of RKO-C cells, while did not further change the viability of ADR-treated RKO-p53i and T98G cells. Interestingly, HIPK2 overexpression significantly restored the ADR-induced cell apoptosis in cobalt-treated RKO-C cells, as shown by cell viability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and Western immunoblotting of cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). It is noteworthy that HIPK2 significantly sensitized to ADR-induced apoptosis also the RKO-p53i and T98G cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, 4B</xref>) that showed an inherent ADR resistance in anoxic condition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and also resistance to HIPK2-induced long-term cell death (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Moreover, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels showed that ADR treatment did not change the HIF-1&#x003b1;, MDR1, and Bcl2 gene expression in cobalt-treated RKO-C, p53i, and T98G cells, on the other hand, HIPK2 overexpression strongly reduced HIF-1&#x003b1;, MDR1, and Bcl2 gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The biological outcome of HIPK2 overexpression in cobalt-treated cells, in the presence or absence of ADR was further evaluated by colony forming assay. To this aim, RKO-p53i and T98G cells were transfected with HIPK2 expression vector; soon after transfection cells were treated with cobalt (200 &#x003bc;M) for 24 h before adding 2 h pulse of ADR (2 &#x003bc;g/ml). Cells were then trypsinezed, counted and equal number of cells were re-plated in duplicate in fresh medium and kept in culture for at least ten days. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, colony forming ability of RKO-C, p53i, and T98G cells treated with combination of cobalt and ADR was markedly suppressed by HIPK2 overexpression, while ADR only partially limited cell growth of cobalt-treated cells. ADR alone strongly suppresses colony formation only in RKO-C cell, as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that HIPK2 could reverse cobalt-induced cell chemoresistance of wild-type p53 RKO-C cells and sensitize chemoresistant RKO-p53i and mutant p53 T98G cells to ADR-induced apoptosis. This biological outcome correlated with suppression of MDR1 and Bcl2 gene expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>HIPK2 sensitized resistant cells to ADR-induced apoptosis, in hypoxia-mimicking condition</bold>.

Thus, HIPK2 overexpression did not induce per se apoptosis of cobalt-treated cells, on the contrary it sensitized cobalt-treated cells to ADR-induced apoptosis, regardless of their p53 status.</p><p>We have previously documented the role of HIPK2 in drug-induced apoptosis. HIPK2 activation by chemotherapeutic drugs, including ADR and cisplatin, results in p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 with specific induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; on the other hand, HIPK2 is unable to induce apoptosis in p53 mutant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], although p53-independent apoptotic pathways activated by HIPK2 have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have recently shown that HIPK2 deregulation is involved in chemoresistance however, HIPK2 overexpression circumvents the blockade of apoptosis in chemoresistant cells, restoring activation of p53Ser46 and the caspases' pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, lack of functional p53 contributes to resistance to HIPK2 apoptotic function although, deregulation of the upstream signaling pathways and of the regulatory proteins that finally lead to HIPK2 activation in response to different stimuli cannot be excluded.</p><p>In the present study, we have shown that the exogenous HIPK2 might enhance the ADR-apoptotic response impaired by hypoxia-mimicking condition. It is noteworthy that HIPK2 sensitized to ADR-induced apoptosis also the RKO-p53i and T98G cells (carrying mutant p53) that showed an inherent ADR resistance in anoxic condition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and also resistance to HIPK2-induced long-term cell death (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These data suggest that HIPK2 might induce fundamental alterations in cell signaling pathways, involving or not p53-dependent apoptotic function. In this regard, we have recently found that HIPK2 downmodulates HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in normoxic condition, repressing HIF-1 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. HIF-1&#x003b1; is a negative factor for tumor therapy that has a powerful role in modulating chemotherapeutic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) via HIF-1-dependent regulation has been shown to increase chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our results showed that overexpression of HIPK2 downmodulated HIF-1&#x003b1; expression and HIF-1 transcriptional activity, in hypoxia-mimicking condition. Blocking of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression abolished MDR1 and Bcl2 expression and restored ADR-induced apoptosis. Reversal of MDR1 and Bcl2 upregulation could therefore provide the mechanistic basis for chemosensitization observed during HIPK2 transduction.</p><p>In summary, this study shows the efficacy of HIPK2 transduction to restore the apoptosis-inducing potential of chemotherapeutic drug in hypoxia-mimicking condition and therefore to sensitize chemoresistant tumor cells, regardless of their p53 status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present here a potential approach of combining HIPK2 transduction with chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of chemoresistant tumor cells. Specifically, HIPK2 restored the apoptosis-inducing potential of chemotherapeutic drug in hypoxia-mimicking condition and sensitized chemoresistant tumor cells. These data suggest that HIPK2 might induce fundamental alterations in cell signaling pathways, involving or not p53 function and provide a foundation for the development of combined regimens that would enhance the apoptotic response of chemoresistant cells. Thus potential use of HIPK2, by either gene therapy deliver or identification of small peptides able to activate HIPK2, is promising for cancer treatment by potentiating cytotoxic therapies, regardless of p53 cell status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures and treatments</title><p>Human colon carcinoma RKO (carrying wtp53), RKO-p53-interfered (p53i) (a kind gift of Silvia Soddu, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Rome Italy), the human glioblastoma T98G (mutant p53, codon 237 methionine-to-isoleucine change) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (GIBCO-BRL, Life Technology, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO-BRL) plus glutamine and antibiotics in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Adriamycin (ADR) was diluted into the medium to a final concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g/ml that we have shown can induce apoptosis in wild-type bearing cells but not in p53 inactive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], for 16-24 h; hypoxia-mimicking condition was obtained by adding cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>) into the culture medium to a final concentration of 200 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] for 24 h; cycloheximide (CHX), the inhibitor of protein synthesis, was diluted into the medium to a final concentration of 40 &#x003bc;g/ml for 3 h.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis</title><p>Cells were transfected with HIPK2-GFP, K221-GFP coding HIPK2 kinase defective mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and the empty GFP vector using LipofectaminePlus method.
