In the process of characterizing its mechanism of action we found that the viral PB1-F2 protein sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, as demonstrated by increased cleavage of caspase 3 substrates in PB1-F2-expressing cells. Moreover, treatment of purified mouse liver mitochondria with recombinant PB1-F2 protein resulted in cytochrome c release, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhancement of tBid-induced mitochondrial permeabilization, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed cellular sensitization to apoptosis. Using glutathione-S-transferase pulldowns with subsequent mass spectrometric analysis, we identified the mitochondrial interactors of the PB1-F2 protein and showed that the viral protein uniquely interacts with the inner mitochondrial membrane adenine nucleotide translocator 3 and the outer mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion channel 1, both of which are implicated in the mitochondrial permeability transition during apoptosis. Consistent with this interaction, blockers of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) inhibited PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial permeabilization. Based on our findings, we propose a model whereby the proapoptotic PB1-F2 protein acts through the mitochondrial PTPC and may play a role in the down-regulation of the host immune response to infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>PB1-F2 is a short polypeptide encoded by influenza viruses.

The exact mechanism leading to the mitochondrial permeabilization is still under investigation, but is known to involve cellular apoptotic mediators of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bak and Bax, and proteins constituting the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), such as the adenine nucleotide translocator 3 (ANT3) in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in the outer mitochondrial membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In view of the possible contribution of the PB1-F2 protein to influenza viral pathogenesis, we sought to determine the role of the protein in modulation of host immune response and to further elucidate its mechanism of action. We show that the mitochondrial permeabilization by the PB1-F2 protein renders cells sensitive to the proapoptotic effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) through tBid signaling. Furthermore, our results indicate that PB1-F2-induced apoptosis proceeds through a unique mechanism involving its interaction with the ANT3 and VDAC1 proteins of the PTPC at the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively. With the use of ANT3-specific inhibitor, we conclude that PB1-F2 directly permeabilizes mitochondria in an ANT3-dependent manner. The results of our studies provide a deeper insight into the function of the PB1-F2 protein and underscore the role of the PTPC in mitochondrial permeabilization and cell death in influenza virus-infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PB1-F2 Protein Sensitizes Transfected Cells to Apoptotic Stimuli</title><p>We investigated whether transient expression of the influenza virus PB1-F2 protein would enhance cell death by intrinsic and extrinsic proapoptotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To achieve maximal transient transfection efficiency of the PB1-F2 protein, the proapoptotic effect of the agents was initially assayed in PB1-F2-transfected 293T cells, where apoptosis was detected by cleavage of poly A ribose polymerase (PARP), a direct substrate of caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The unrelated influenza virus protein, nucleoprotein (NP), which does not induce apoptosis, was used as a control. Reduction of full-length PARP with a concomitant increase in cleaved PARP product was seen in PB1-F2-transfected cells in response to DNA damage caused by UV irradiation and cisplatin, when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Treatment of PB1-F2-transfected cells with 50 ng/ml of TNF&#x003b1; or with 5 ng/ml of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand resulted in significant increase in PARP cleavage, as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In view of the findings that PB1-F2 sensitized cells to both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic stimuli, we tested whether the PB1-F2-expressing cells are also sensitized to death due to detachment from the growth matrix (anoikis). The activation of anoikis has also been shown to involve proapoptotic members of the BH3 family &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, PB1-F2 also sensitized cells to death by anoikis, as demonstrated by rapid membrane blebbing and fragmentation of trypsinized human lung epithelial A549 cells transfected with a construct expressing PB1-F2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine whether the PB1-F2-expressing cells were indeed undergoing apoptosis, we labeled PB1-F2-transfected A549 cells with M30 antibody to caspase-cleaved cytokeratin. Interestingly, in the absence of other apoptotic stimuli, only a small proportion of PB1-F2-expressing cells underwent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), which could explain the relatively low proapoptotic effect of the PB1-F2 protein observed in the assays above. Overall, these results suggest that the PB1-F2 protein enhances the effect of cellular proapoptotic stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sensitization to Apoptosis by the PB1-F2 Protein Is Inhibited by Bcl-xL</title><p>Since PB1-F2 has been shown to localize to mitochondria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;, we investigated whether mitochondrial apoptotic mechanisms are involved in PB1-F2-induced apoptotic enhancement. Mitochondrial permeabilization by cellular apoptotic mediators is controlled by the antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Given the dependence of PB1-F2-induced apoptosis on cellular apoptotic factors, we decided to determine whether PB1-F2-induced apoptotic sensitization can overcome the cytoprotective effect of Bcl-xL. For the purposes of our experiments, we used A549 cells to generate a cell line stably overexpressing Bcl-xL protein (A549-Bcl-xL) and a respective control cell line expressing the gene encoding neomycin resistance. The resulting cell lines both exhibited transient transfection efficiencies of around 60&#x00025; as witnessed by transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP; unpublished data).</p><p>In a control cell line stably transfected with neomycin vector (A549-neo), expression of PB1-F2 enhanced the proapoptotic effect of TNF&#x003b1;, as demonstrated by immunolabeling with M30 antibody specific for cleaved cytokeratin 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Coimmunostaining for PB1-F2 revealed that the PB1-F2-expressing cells were indeed undergoing apoptosis. However, PB1-F2-induced apoptosis in response to TNF&#x003b1; was inhibited in the A549 cell line stably overexpressing Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Overall these results suggest that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways are required for PB1-F2-mediated apoptotic enhancement.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The Influenza Virus PB1-F2 Protein Disrupts Mitochondrial Organization and Induces the Release of Cytochrome C</title><p>To further characterize PB1-F2-mediated apoptotic enhancement, we generated a monoclonal antibody (26D3) specific for the N-terminal domain of the protein, and confirmed by microscopy that the PB1-F2 protein expressed from transfected plasmid localized to mitochondria in A549-neo and A549-Bcl-xL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). While in normal cells mitochondria are usually distributed along the microtubular networks, mitochondria of PB1-F2-transfected cells lost the normal tubuloreticular organization and displayed a punctiform appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Interestingly, this effect was not inhibited by Bcl-xL overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), suggesting that disruption of the mitochondrial network is not the primary mechanism for PB1-F2-induced apoptosis.</p><p>To further evaluate the effect of PB1-F2 protein on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, we analyzed the PB1-F2-expressing cells for release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. HeLa cells were transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PB1-F2, treated with 50 ng/ml TNF&#x003b1; for 8 h, and stained for HA tag and cytochrome c. Expression of the PB1-F2 protein resulted in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) in a subset of cells, as witnessed by diffusion of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm. For a better quantitative measure of the amount of cytochrome c released, 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing PB1-F2 or an empty vector and 24 h later were treated for 8 h with 50 ng/ml TNF&#x003b1;. The cells were subsequently fractionated into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, and the amount of cytochrome c remaining in the mitochondrial fraction was determined by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Treatment of the PB1-F2 transfected cells with TNF&#x003b1; resulted in enhanced release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria when compared to the vector control.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>PB1-F2 Directly Induces Mitochondrial Permeabilization and Sensitizes Mitochondria to the Proapoptotic Effect of tBid</title><p>To further investigate whether the effect of PB1-F2 protein on the mitochondria is direct, we incubated purified mouse liver mitochondria with recombinant PB1-F2 protein. Recombinant tBid protein was used as a control. Treatment of mitochondria with the PB1-F2 protein resulted in the release of cytochrome c, which increased at higher concentrations, suggesting a direct role for PB1-F2 in promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). This effect was not observed when a recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST) protein was used in this assay at similar concentrations (unpublished data). In view of the previous report that the C-terminal region of PB1-F2 protein targets it to the inner mitochondrial membrane, we proceeded to investigate whether PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial permeabilization also involves the inner mitochondrial membrane. For this purpose we used the mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye JC-1 to determine whether incubation of purified mitochondria with recombinant PB1-F2 protein would result in dissipation of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential. The uptake of the JC-1 dye by intact mitochondria results in increased red-orange fluorescence at 590 nm upon excitation at 490 nm. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, incubation of the purified mitochondria for 10 min with increasing doses of PB1-F2 resulted in reduction of JC-1 fluorescence at 590 nm, suggesting that the PB1-F2 protein-induced mitochondrial permeabilization involves the inner mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, while recombinant PB1-F2 protein was, at equimolar concentrations, less effective than tBid in releasing cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), it was comparable to tBid in permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This suggests that while loss in the mitochondrial membrane potential might not be required for tBid-induced cytochrome c release &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;, it may be necessary for PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial permeabilization. These results confirmed previous findings that showed that expression of PB1-F2 protein in cells can lead to dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, as we and others showed, expression of the PB1-F2 protein itself does not cause significant levels of apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that the inner membrane permeabilization by the PB1-F2 protein might not be the primary mechanism of apoptosis induction. Rather, we hypothesize that PB1-F2-induced inner membrane permeabilization acting in conjunction with another apoptotic mechanism may be responsible for PB1-F2-mediated apoptotic enhancement illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g002">2</xref>.</p><p>In view of the fact that both intrinsic and extrinsic cellular apoptotic stimuli converge on the mitochondria through signaling of the Bcl-2 family BH3 proteins, we investigated whether the presence of PB1-F2 in suboptimal concentrations would enhance the release of cytochrome c from purified mitochondria by recombinant tBid. Incubation of the purified mitochondria with recombinant tBid results in release of cytochrome c at tBid concentrations as low as 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Preincubation of the purified mitochondria with 10 nM PB1-F2 augments the tBid-induced cytochrome c release by a factor of almost ten (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). As the PB1-F2 protein was used at a concentration at which it fails to release cytochrome c by itself, the result suggests that the effect of PB1-F2 and tBid is not simply additive. We speculate that PB1-F2-induced permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane may augment cytochrome c release in response to tBid. Overall, these results suggest that sensitization of cells to apoptosis by the PB1-F2 may proceed through its potentiation of the effects of the cellular BH3 family proteins.</p><p>Previous studies revealed that the PB1-F2 protein localizes to both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b03">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;. As the cellular apoptotic proteins were previously shown to act through the mitochondrial proteins controlling permeabilization of the inner as well as outer mitochondrial membranes, we speculate that the observed PB1-F2-induced apoptotic sensitization could proceed via components in both membranes. To investigate possible involvement of mitochondrial proteins in PB1-F2-induced apoptosis, we sought to identify potential mitochondrial interactors of the PB1-F2 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The PB1-F2 Protein Interacts with ANT3 and VDAC1 Proteins of the Mitochondrial PTPC</title><p>PB1-F2 protein was expressed in 293T cells as an N-terminal GST fusion protein, and the complexes between GST-PB1-F2 and its interacting proteins were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Proteins were subsequently eluted from the beads, separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, and visualized by silver stain. An unrelated polypeptide of similar length fused to GST (GST-Nipah-Wc, containing the last 43 amino acids of the W protein of the Nipah virus fused to GST) was used as a control. Unique protein bands at approximately 36, 55, and 80 kDa specific for the PB1-F2 fusion protein but not GST or the control protein were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 4 and 5). Mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins identified the 36-kDa band as the mitochondrial ANT3, the 55-kDa band as beta tubulin, and the 80-kDa band as cytokeratin. The latter was likely a contaminant of the protein preparation. While interaction of PB1-F2 with tubulin may be important for PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial disorganization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), we chose to focus on the ANT3 protein, which is known to be involved in mitochondrial apoptosis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with transfected HA-tagged ANT3 confirmed the interaction between PB1-F2 and ANT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). As expected, transfected HA-tagged ANT3 localized to the mitochodria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).</p><p>To verify that the interaction between PB1-F2 and ANT3 was direct, we expressed <sup>35</sup>S-labeled ANT3 in vitro and performed GST pulldowns on the labeled protein with either GST or GST-PB1-F2 proteins. Only GST-PB1-F2 was able to coprecipitate the in vitro-translated ANT3 protein, suggesting that direct interaction between PB1-F2 and ANT3 is likely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).</p><p>Previous studies revealed that the predicted basic amphipathic helix formed by amino acids 69&#x02013;82 is sufficient for targeting PB1-F2 to the inner mitochondrial membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. However, immunoelectron microscopy studies had also previously shown that the full-length PB1-F2 protein localized to both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that the N terminus of the protein may play a role in targeting the protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Thus, while ANT3 was the only component of the PTPC identified by mass spectrometry to interact with PB1-F2, we could not exclude the possibility that PB1-F2 exerts its effect in conjunction with other proteins of the pore complex. Since ANT3 is exclusively an inner membrane protein, we speculated that the outer membrane PB1-F2 may be acting through an additional mechanism. Indeed, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PB1-F2 protein also interacted with VDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), and GST pulldown experiments with in vitro-translated VDAC1 confirmed that the interaction is likely direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). These findings were surprising, since VDAC1 protein was not identified in the original experiment by mass spectrometry. While it is likely that the VDAC1 protein was missed in our analysis, it is also possible that the N-terminal GST tag may have prevented the interaction of the PB1-F2 protein with VDAC1 within the cell.</p><p>ANT3 and VDAC1 appear to be critical components of the pore complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. ANT3 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that functions as an antiporter catalyzing the exchange of ATP for ADP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;. In the presence of apoptotic stimuli, ANT3 is believed to undergo major conformational changes resulting in the formation of nonspecific pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Apoptotic stimuli also trigger conformational changes in the outer membrane protein VDAC1, which forms pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. ANT3 and VDAC1 are believed to interact, forming the PTPC, which leads to dissipation of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of apoptotic mediators from the mitochondrial intermembrane space &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To eliminate the possibility of nonspecific interaction of PB1-F2 with mitochondrial proteins, we performed PB1-F2 coimmunoprecipitation experiments with the outer mitochondrial membrane transport protein Tom20, the inner mitochondrial membrane protein COXIV, and the protein Tim44, which localizes to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).

Furthermore, to determine whether PB1-F2 interacts with ANT3 and VDAC1 within the context of viral infection, we infected Flag-ANT3- and Flag-VDAC1-transfected 293T cells with either a wild-type PR8 virus or with its correspondent virus knocked out for PB1-F2 protein expression.

The sensitivity to apoptosis of PB1-F2-expressing cells was greatly enhanced in response to different cellular apoptotic stimuli, such as DNA damage, anoikis, and signaling through death receptors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Similar findings were previously reported for the hepatitis B virus X protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, treatment of purified mitochondria with recombinant tBid in the presence of PB1-F2 resulted in enhanced cytochrome c release (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, the proapoptotic effect of PB1-F2 on cells in response to TNF&#x003b1; was blocked by Bcl-xL (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g002">Figure 2</xref>), which could occur through inhibition by Bcl-xL of either outer or inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Interestingly, Bcl-xL overexpression did not inhibit PB1-F2-induced disorganization of mitochondria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). This suggests that alteration of mitochondrial organization by PB1-F2 may proceed through a different mechanism, possibly through its interaction with tubulin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>Due to the unstable nature of the PB1-F2 protein and its low expression levels within the cells, the studies described above were performed in cell lines with good transfection efficiencies, such as A549 and 293T cells. The major drawback of this strategy is the transformed nature of these cells, which may alter their apoptotic responses. In particular, as seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g002">2</xref>, these cells are normally resistant to proapoptotic effects of TNF&#x003b1;, suggesting that the survival/proinflammatory pathways activated by TNF&#x003b1; exert a dominant effect. Nevertheless, expression of the PB1-F2 protein shifted this balance toward the proapoptotic pathways in both cell lines.</p><p>We further evaluated the mechanism of PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial permeabilization and determined that the PB1-F2 protein directly induced cytochrome c release and loss of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential in purified mouse liver mitochondria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">4</xref>B), suggesting that PB1-F2 may be acting in permeability transition-dependent manner. This speculation was further supported when proteins of the PTPC ANT3 and VDAC1 were identified in our PB1-F2 interaction screen.</p><p>To confirm that PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial permeabilization proceeds through the pore complex in an ANT3-dependent manner, we used two known ANT3 blockers, BA and CsA.

Direct interaction of ANT3 with several cellular and viral proteins (including the HIV Vpr protein) has been shown to result in mitochondrial permeabilization, leading to apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

We further determined that, while interaction of PB1-F2 protein with ANT3 occurs through its C-terminal domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g006">Figure 6</xref>), interaction of PB1-F2 protein with VDAC1 is mediated through both N- and C-terminal regions. Overall, these data suggest a possible complex formation between VDAC1, ANT3, and PB1-F2, whereby PB1-F2 may bridge VDAC1 and ANT3, thus promoting formation of the PTPC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Further experiments will be needed to determine whether such a complex is indeed formed within the cell. In this study, we did not further identify the PB1-F2 protein residues responsible for the interaction with ANT3 and VDAC1. In a previous study, the inner mitochondrial membrane targeting signal was mapped to the amphipathic helix within the C-terminal region of the protein, consistent with our finding that the PB1-F2 C-terminal region interacts with the inner membrane ANT3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The amphipathic helix by itself was sufficient to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential, and mutations within the amphipathic helix abolished the mitochondrial localization of the protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. At this point, however, we are unable to separate the mitochondrial-targeting and the ANT3-binding domains of the PB1-F2 protein, since lack of mitochondrial targeting also abolished PB1-F2-ANT3 interaction. In support of our findings, the N-terminal region of the PB1-F2 protein targeted to mitochondria with a heterologous inner mitochondrial membrane targeting sequence failed to interact with ANT3, confirming the specificity of the ANT3 interaction with the PB1-F2 C-terminus.</p><p>The induction of permeability transition by PB1-F2 could proceed through three possible mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Through its interaction with both ANT3 and VDAC1, PB1-F2 could potentially act as a bridge between the two proteins, enhancing the formation of the pore complex (mechanism 1). Alternatively, the protein could act separately at the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, in conjunction with ANT3 and VDAC1, respectively (mechanism 2). The latter model is supported by the evidence that PB1-F2 has been shown to localize to both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and to directly induce membrane permeabilization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent studies also indicate that, similar to the members of the Bcl-2 family, the PB1-F2 protein is capable of forming multimeric complexes, which are probably responsible for its membrane-permeabilizing activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, direct permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane by PB1-F2 protein complexes could account for the third possible mechanism.</p><p>We chose to focus our studies on the VDAC1 and ANT3 proteins primarily because these proteins were identified in our interaction screens, while other proteins localized to the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes and the mitochondrial matrix (Tom20, COXIV, and Tim44) were excluded. In addition, these protein isoforms are specifically known to be involved in the mitochondrial permeability transition. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the PB1-F2 protein may also interact with other isoforms of ANT and VDAC. In particular, a recent study showed that the VDAC2 isoform is implicated in suppression of mitochondrial apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b41">41</xref>&#x0005d;. The fact that the ANT3-specific inhibitor BA did not completely inhibit PB1-F2-induced inner membrane permeabilization suggests that additional players may be involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In addition, while the results of our work propose the role of ANT3 in PB1-F2-induced permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, further experiments are needed to determine the role of the VDAC1 protein and the function of the PB1-F2 protein in the outer membrane. Our studies are currently limited by the lack of availability of specific inhibitors against the VDAC1 protein. Experiments are currently in progress to individually characterize the role of VDAC1 in PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial permeabilization.</p><p>Since the PB1-F2 protein is relatively short-lived and is expressed mainly during the later stages of the infection cycle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;, its proapoptotic effect most likely is not inhibitory to viral replication. Based on our findings, we propose the following model for the mode of PB1-F2 protein action within the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Early in the infection cycle, PB1-F2 localizes to the mitochondria, but does not induce a permeability transition due to its low levels present within the cell. This allows for maintenance of cell viability, which supports normal viral replication. During later stages of infection, when enough PB1-F2 protein is synthesized or when cellular mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways are activated, the mitochondria undergo a permeability transition.</p><p>While induction of apoptosis by influenza virus may at first seem counterintuitive to efficient viral production, it has been shown to be important in influenza viral replication.

Moreover, we speculate that sensitization of cells to death by TNF&#x003b1; rather than direct induction of apoptosis by PB1-F2 could have several additional advantageous effects for the virus. TNF&#x003b1; has been shown to exert a strong antiviral effect against influenza virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;, which is likely to proceed through nuclear factor kappa-B- and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent activation of antiviral gene expression and secretion of antiviral cytokines, such as type I interferon &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b45">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Sensitization of cells to the proapoptotic effects of TNF&#x003b1; would minimize the antiviral signaling to other cells. In support of this theory, induction of apoptosis by influenza virus has been shown to limit the release of proinflammatory cytokines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies are currently underway to analyze a possible differential effect on cytokine induction by the wild-type and PB1-F2 mutant viruses. Finally, as suggested by previous work, immune cells seem to be more sensitive to induction of apoptosis by PB1-F2, as indicated by the finding that <italic>PB1-F2-</italic>knockout influenza virus induced less cell death than the wild-type virus in infected human monocytes. This observation suggests that the protein may play a role in down-regulation of the host immune response to the infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is thus possible that these proteins may play a role in the regulation of differential apoptotic responses in different cell types following infection with influenza virus. Further animal studies will be needed to evaluate the function of the PB1-F2 protein in modulation of the immune response and its overall role in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines, antibodies, and reagents.</title><p>293T, A549, and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and were maintained in DMEM culture medium (Gibco, San Diego, California, United States) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (Hyclone, South Logan, Utah, United States), 100 U/ml of penicillin G sodium and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of streptomycin sulfate (Gibco).

BA, cisplatin, and recombinant tBid were obtained from Sigma; G418 and CsA were from Calbiochem (San Diego, California, United States); Mitotracker Red and JC-1 dyes, DAPI, monoclonal anti-COXIV antibody, and secondary fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Constructs and cloning.</title><p>The pCAGGS vector for the expression of proteins under control of chicken &#x003b2;-actin promoter has been described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010004-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d;. cDNAs for the full-length ANT3, VDAC1, Bcl-xL, Bak, and Bax were obtained by reverse transcription with oligo-dT primer from RNA obtained from A549 cells. PCR for each gene was performed with gene-specific primers. An N-terminal HA or Flag tag was introduced into each construct by PCR with 5&#x02032; gene-specific primers possessing the tag sequences. Each tagged gene was introduced into the pCAGGS vector for mammalian expression and into the pcDNA 3.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) for in vitro transcription. The Bcl-xL gene was in addition cloned into the pLNCX2 retroviral vector (Clontech) for stable integration into A549 cells. The <italic>PB1-F2</italic> gene was reverse-transcribed and amplified with gene-specific primers by RT-PCR from viral RNA of the influenza virus A/PuertoRico/8/34 strain. N-terminal HA and Flag tags were introduced by PCR as outlined above. Tagged and untagged constructs were cloned into the pCAGGS vector for mammalian expression and the pGEX6P-1 vector (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) for bacterial expression of the GST fusion protein. The pCAGGS-GFP vector was generated by subcloning the GFP gene from the pEGFP vector (Clontech). The HA-tagged PB1-F2-GFP fusion construct was generated by insertion of the full-length HA-tagged <italic>PB1-F2</italic> gene into the pCAGGS-GFP vector. HA-tagged constructs expressing either C- or N-terminally truncated PB1-F2-GFP fusion proteins (HA-nF2-GFP and HA-cF2-GFP, respectively) were generated by insertion of PCR-amplified C- or N-terminal domains into the pCAGGS-GFP vector (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010004-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The HA-MTS-nF2-GFP construct was generated by trimolecular ligation of the HA-tagged cytochrome oxidase MTS sequence cloned from A549 cells (sequence available from Clontech) and the N-terminal domain of PB1-F2 using the pCAGGS-GFP vector. Sequences of each generated construct were confirmed by automated sequencing performed at the Mount Sinai sequencing core facility. All primer sequences are available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Recombinant protein purification from <italic>E. coli.</italic></title><p>Competent BL-21 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States) transformed with pGEX6p-1 vector were cultured to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 in 2XYT medium.

During early stages of the infection, PB1-F2 localizes to mitochondria, where it interacts with ANT3 and VDAC and predisposes the mitochondria to permeability transition. Later in the infection, when more PB1-F2 is synthesized, and upon induction of antiviral apoptotic signaling pathways, the mitochondria undergo the permeability transition, which results in the induction of apoptosis. PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial permeabilization can proceed through three possible mechanisms, as indicated on the right graphic: (1) enhancement of the pore complex formation through direct interaction with ANT3 and VDAC1; (2) independent permeabilization of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes with the help of ANT3 and VDAC1, respectively; and (3) direct permeabilization of the mitochondrial membranes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.0010004.g008"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="ack1" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack2" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> DZ, AGS, and PP conceived and designed the experiments.
