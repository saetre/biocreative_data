We determined the amino acid specificity of tRNA by sequencing a suppressed protein and the aminoacylation efficiency of tRNA by examining the steady-state level of aminoacyl-tRNA. On substituting nucleotides derived from the acceptor end and variable pocket of tRNAPro for the corresponding nucleotides in a tRNAPhe gene, the identity of the resulting tRNA changed substantially but incompletely to that of tRNAPro. The redesigned tRNAPhe was weakly active and aminoacyl-tRNA was not detected. Ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis of the redesigned tRNAPhe gene produced a mutant with a wobble pair in place of a base pair in the end of the acceptor-stem helix of the transcribed tRNA. This mutant exhibited both a tRNAPro identity and substantial aminoacyl-tRNA. The results speak for the importance of a distinctive conformation in the acceptor-stem helix of tRNAPro for aminoacylation by the prolyl-tRNA synthetase. The anticodon also contributes to tRNAPro identity but is not necessary in vivo.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0281-a" xlink:role="525"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0282-a" xlink:role="526"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0282-b" xlink:role="526"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="522"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="523"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="524"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0281.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="525"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="526"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="527"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="528"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="529"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
