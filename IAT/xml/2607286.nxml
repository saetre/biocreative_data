Transmission of <italic>Brucella </italic>spp. from infected animals to humans may be either direct or indirect. Direct transmission involves the respiratory, conjunctival and cutaneous routes, and is more important in people in close contact with infected animals. Indirect transmission is through the consumption of contaminated dairy products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>Brucella </italic>spp. occasionally causes spontaneous abortion in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>There have been several histological studies on the placentas of <italic>Brucella </italic>infected animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Further, it has been found that <italic>Brucella </italic>internalizes into the caprine erythrophagocytic trophoblastic epithelial cells from the maternal circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and that the internalized bacteria replicate within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in secondary infection of adjacent trophoblastic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Researches have also shown that after necrosis of infected trophoblasts, large numbers of brucellae are released, and proximity of the fetal capillaries in the ulcerated placenta to the lumenal bacteria has been proposed as the source of the fetal bacteremia and further placental infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism of abortion induced by <italic>Brucella </italic>spp. remains unknown.</p><p>The mouse model, particularly that using the unpregnant mouse, has been used extensively to study some aspects of the pathogenesis of brucellosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While brucellosis is known to primarily affect the reproductive tract in the natural host, little is known regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of <italic>Brucella </italic>infection in the pregnant mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the structure of bovine placenta is completely different from mouse placenta, the infectious abortion model using the pregnant mouse is a powerful tool for investigating the mechanisms of <italic>Brucella </italic>pathogenesis. In our previous study, we demonstrated that <italic>B. abortus </italic>causes abortion in pregnant mice by inoculating bacteria on day 4.5 of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We found that there was a higher degree of bacterial colonization in the placenta than in other organs, that there were many bacteria in trophoblast giant (TG) cells in the placenta and that an intracellular replication-defective mutant did not induce abortion. These findings suggest that bacterial infection of TG cells plays a key role in abortion induced by <italic>B. abortus </italic>infection.</p><p>Pregnancy leads to a generalized suppression of the adaptive immune system, typified by significantly decreased cell-mediated immunity and reduced T helper cell (Th) 1 responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This immunosuppressed state prevents maternal rejection of the fetus but has the unfortunate consequence of increasing maternal susceptibility to certain infectious agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our previous study showed that a transient increase in interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; due to <italic>Brucella </italic>infection contributes to abortion in pregnant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition to examining the balance of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines in bacteria infected pregnant mice, analysis of bacterial internalization into the TG cells, a specific host cells in placenta, will help to advance our knowledge regarding the control of <italic>Brucella</italic>-induced abortion.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the internalization of <italic>B. abortus </italic>into TG cells and identified heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) as a candidate receptor against <italic>Brucella </italic>or bacterial uptake-associated molecule.

On day 18.5 of gestation, placenta and spleen were removed and homogenized in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Tissue homogenates were serially diluted with PBS and plated on Brucella agar to count the number of CFU in each organ.

To measure bacterial internalization efficiency after 30 min of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, the cells were washed once with TS medium and then incubated with TS medium containing gentamicin (30 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 30 min. Next, cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with cold distilled water. CFU values were determined by serial dilution on Brucella plates.

The cell washing, lysis and plating procedures were the same as for the bacterial internalization efficiency assay. Percentage protection was determined by dividing the number of bacteria surviving by the number in the infectious inoculum.

As expected, the R2&#x02013;25 and anti-Hsc70 antibodies reacted with both types of recombinant Hsc70 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The mouse recombinant Hsc70 had a slightly greater molecular weight than the bovine recombinant Hsc70 because 25 amino acid residues had been added to the former after HRV 3C protease cleavage. These results indicate that the protein reacting with R2&#x02013;25 was Hsc70.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Bacterial internalization inhibiting antibodies react with Hsc70</bold>.

TG cells are polyploid cells that play a crucial role in implantation, in remodeling of the embryonic cavity, and preventing maternal blood flow to the implantation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since <italic>B. abortus </italic>internalizes into TG cells and replicates in them, cell functions are not exhibited completely, which leads to abortion since implantation and placental development are inhibited. Therefore, it is thought that bacterial infection of TG cells is a key event in inducing abortion. To analyze the molecular mechanisms of <italic>B. abortus </italic>infection of TG cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used trophoblast stem (TS) cells and TG cells differentiated from TS cells for the infection assay in this study. Although TG cell differentiation is fairly well understood at the morphological and molecular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the role of immune responses in fighting against pathogens of TG cells is poorly understood and in this regard a model of host-pathogen interaction using TG cells would be useful for obtaining new information of the effect of TG cell functions on pregnancy.</p><p>Hsc70 has been reported to be present on the surface of several types of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this regard, though Hsc70 congregates on the surface of TG cells, it is present to a much lesser extent on the surface of TS cells (data not shown). This may be a reason that the internalization of <italic>B. abortus </italic>into TG cells was greater than that into TS cells. As Hsc70 and many other factors will be present on TG cells differentiated from TS cells, there is a possibility that other receptors or bacterial uptake-associated molecules may contribute to <italic>B. abortus </italic>infection of TG cells. Little is known about how Hsc70, a protein with no signal sequence for secretion, exits cells by mechanisms other than escape from cells undergoing necrotic lysis. In previous studies, Hsc70 has seen to be released from a late endsomal lysosomal location where it participates in protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Further, the secretion of the Hsp70 family and its association with lipid rafts have also been observed in epithelial cells under normal conditions, and a lipid raft-based mechanism has been suggested for the membrane delivery and release of Hsp70 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although receptors for the extracellular Hsp70 family have still not been fully defined, several cell surface receptors have been suggested, such as CD14, CD40, CD91 and scavenger receptor Lox-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Since it has also been noted that class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) contributes to <italic>B. abortus </italic>infection in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], SR-A may be receptors for Hsc70, and the mechanism for <italic>B. abortus </italic>internalization into TG cells may be the same pathway as that for Hsc70 uptake by TG cells. Hsc70 may have a function that is catching antigens and anti-Hsc70 would inhibit binding between Hsc70 and antigens. IFN-&#x003b3; treatment enhanced bacterial internalization into TG cells and these observations agreed with results obtained in pregnant mice model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and thus expression of unidentified receptors against Hsc70 may be upregulated by IFN-&#x003b3; treatment. IFN-&#x003b3; should therefore promote internalization of <italic>B. abortus </italic>into TG cells <italic>in vivo </italic>and this would be one of ways in which infectious abortion is induced.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The finding of this study that the anti-Hsc70 antibody prevents abortion caused by <italic>B. abortus </italic>infection is expected to be applied in the development of methods of preventing abortion. Since intracellular bacteria such as <italic>Brucella </italic>replicate in host cells, it is difficult to completely eliminate them from the host through treatment with antibiotics and develop effective vaccines against them. An alternative strategy in treating infection due to <italic>Brucella </italic>would be inhibition of bacterial internalization into TG cells and this could be an effective means of protecting against abortion due to brucellosis. Recently, Carvalho Neta <italic>et al</italic>. reported that <italic>B. abortus </italic>modulates innate immune response by bovine trophoblastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although the structure of bovine placenta is completely different from mouse placenta, bovine and mouse trophoblastic cells may have similar function in the immune system. However, it is not known whether the mechanism of host-pathogen interaction observed in this study could be used to develop protective methods against other abortion-inducing pathogen infections, and thus further analysis of TG cell function in the immune system will be needed to clarify host defense mechanisms in the placenta and those contributing to the success of pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MW conceived the study.
