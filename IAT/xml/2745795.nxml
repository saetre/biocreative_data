RA whole synovial tissue explant (RA ST), primary synovial fibroblasts (RASFC), human cartilage and chondrocyte cultures were stimulated with IL-17A +/- TNF-&#x003b1; and Oncostatin M (OSM). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1) were assessed by ELISA and zymography. Cartilage proteoglycan release was assessed histologically by Safranin-O staining.

Angiogenesis is an early, critical event enabling lymphocytes and macrophages to enter the joint cavity by active recruitment via the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. New vessels and leukocyte migration lead to expansion of the ST into an aggressive tumour-like pannus. The hyperplastic ST fibroblasts (RASF) of the lining layer invade the cartilage causing degradation via proteolytic cleavage of aggrecan and collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Cytokines and growth factors are required to stimulate cell survival, proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation as part of this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cartilage and bone degradation is characterised by a loss of ECM through activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and decreased production of specific tissue inhibitors such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Joint destruction can be visualised radiographically and is associated with long-term functional disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Cartilage turnover can also be monitored by measuring synthesis and degradation products of cartilage-specific collagens and proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recent studies by our group and others have demonstrated that these collagen biomarkers can be used to monitor disease activity and predict radiographic outcome in patients with inflammatory arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Targeted biologic therapies including anti-TNF-&#x003b1; have advanced the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. Some patients, however, do not respond, highlighting the need for new therapeutic targets. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A is one such potential target. IL-17A is the first identified member of the IL-17 family (A to F), and it is most closely related to IL17F with 50% sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. IL-17F demonstrates similar but less potent effects to IL-17A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The recently identified subset of T helper cells termed Th17 cells are the main source of IL-17A. However, CD8+ T cells, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells and natural killer T cells can also secrete IL-17A. In both the humans and mice, differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells into Th17 cells involves the cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-21, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown previously, in RA ST from joint replacement surgery, that IL-17A is spontaneously produced; also high levels have been demonstrated in the synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients. IL-17A has also been detected in SF from osteoarthritis (OA) patients; however, levels were lower than in RA SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, IL-17A stimulates the production of cytokines and chemokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. IL-17A also up-regulates MMP expression by chondrocytes and synoviocytes resulting in cartilage damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] Furthermore, IL-17A causes an upregulation in RANKL production leading to bone erosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In animal studies <italic>in vivo </italic>a role for IL-17A has been established in mediating cartilage and joint damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Injection of IL-17A, alone, into na&#x000ef;ve murine knee joints resulted in extensive cartilage depletion and bone erosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Continuous administration of IL-17A by gene expression in mice significantly increased inflammatory infiltrate, cartilage and joint erosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Inhibition of IL-17A using blocking antibodies and a soluble receptor in a mouse model or with IL-4 does protect against inflammation and bone damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A role for IL-17A in the progression of acute joint inflammation into chronic destructive arthritis has also been demonstrated in an IL-17 receptor deficient (IL-17R-/-) mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These IL-17R-/- mice showed suppressed joint inflammation and impaired synovial expression of IL-1 and MMPs. A number of studies have linked IL-17A producing Th17 cells to bone destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>IL-17A appears to be associated with chronicity as demonstrated by murine models of collagen-induced arthritis. IL-17A was strongly dependent on TNF-&#x003b1; in the early stages of experimental arthritis; however, at a later stage the disease became IL-17A driven and both TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1 independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Th17 cells were implicated in the erosive stage of chronic arthritis independent of TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In human RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells the IL-17A/TNF-&#x003b1; ratio at baseline was found to be lower in responders to anti-TNF therapy as opposed to nonresponders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This observation provides further evidence for IL-17A having a role in disease chronicity in human RA.</p><p>The aim of this study was to further examine the expression of IL-17A in actively inflamed joints and to elucidate the mechanism of IL-17A, alone and in combination with TNF-&#x003b1; and oncostatin M (OSM) in matrix turnover and cartilage degradation using whole RA synovial tissue explants, primary synovial fibroblasts (RASFC) and normal human cartilage cultures. Furthermore, we examined the relation of IL-17A to matrix turnover in patients following anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Synovial tissue, serum and synovial fluids</title><p>All patients fulfilled the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for a diagnosis of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and had actively inflamed knee joints. RA ST was obtained at arthroscopy, using local anaesthesia as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. SF was obtained from 49 patients with inflammatory arthritis (RA, n = 29; Spondyloarthropathy (SpA), n = 20) and five OA patients by arthrocentesis and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.

Serial 7 &#x003bc;M microtome sections were mounted on Superfrost slides and fixed in acetone for 10 minutes. The sections were then washed and blocked with 1 &#x000d7; casein for 30 minutes. The sections were then washed and incubated with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml goat polyclonal anti-IL-17A (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) or normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a control. After incubation for one hour at room temperature and washing, the sections were incubated with biotinylated mouse anti-goat IgG antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by strepavidin-peroxidase complex (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 minutes and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for five minutes. Nuclear counterstaining was performed using Mayer's haematoxylin, the sections were then dehydrated, and mounted in Dibutyl Phthlate Xylene (DPX). Sections from 11 RA and 3 OA patients and healthy control tissue (n = 1) were analysed for IL-17A synovium expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary fibroblast cell culture</title><p>RASFC were obtained by enzymatic digestion of synovial biopsy specimens with 1 mg/ml of type 1 collagenase (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, New Jersey, USA) in RPMI (Gibco BRL, Warrington, UK) for four hours at 37&#x000b0;C in humidified air with 5% carbon dioxide. Dissociated cells were plated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco BRL, Warrington, UK), 10 ml of 1 mmol/L HEPES (Gibco BRL, Warrington, UK), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and fungizone (0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml) (all from Biosciences, Co. Dublin, Ireland). The cells were incubated and grown to confluence in T75 flasks (about 10 days) at 37&#x000b0;C in humidified air with 5% carbon dioxide before being harvested with trypsin and passaged. RASFs between the fourth and eighth passages were used for experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary chondrocyte cell culture</title><p>Normal human articular cartilage was obtained from patients undergoing surgery for traumatic fracture of the femoral neck, each of whom had no history or radiological evidence of arthritis.

Cells were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 ml of 1 mmol/L, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml) and fungizone (0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml). Chondrocytes were used for experiments up until the eighth passage.</p></sec><sec><title>RASFC, cartilage and chondrocyte cultures</title><p>Cartilage explant cultures were prepared using 3 mm punch biopsy specimens, thus ensuring that only full-depth cartilage biopsy samples were used. RASFC and cartilage explants were cultured in 96-well plates in serum-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) in the presence of TNF-&#x003b1; (10 ng/ml), OSM (10 ng/ml) and IL-17A (50 ng/ml) alone and in combination.

As RASFCs are the primary cells that invade cartilage, RASFC experiments were also performed over a 15-day time course to examine if induction of MMPs in response to IL-17A could be sustained over the same time period. Culture supernatants were harvested every four days, and wells were replenished with fresh medium containing cytokine conditions that were identical to the medium used on day 1. Following the culture period, supernatants were pooled from each time point and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for analysis of proMMP-1, proMMP-13, TIMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Cartilage and RASFC experiments were performed in duplicate.

All patients had clinically active disease, with 28-joint count Disease Activity Scores (DAS28) of more than 3.2 points despite conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy, and were offered treatment with biologic agents. Patients who had previously received biologic therapy were excluded from the study. Changes in conventional therapy were permitted during biologic therapy at the discretion of the patient's treating rheumatologist; however, no changes in the disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug dosage were made during the study. Following approval by the institutional ethics committee at St. Vincent's University Hospital, all patients gave their fully informed written consent prior to inclusion in the study. All 38 patients began biologic therapy after their baseline assessment of disease activity. Patients were evaluated before and at 1, 3 and 12 months after initiation of biologic therapy.</p><p>Blood samples were obtained and sera was separated and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until used for biomarker analysis, and samples were available for this study at baseline and three months. Clinical evaluation at each assessment was performed using the DAS28, and the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The DAS28 response was analysed both by changes in scores from baseline and by response categories according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A DAS28 response at three months was defined as a reduction in the DAS28 score of 0.6 points or more and a final DAS28 score of 5.1 points or less. A DAS28 nonresponse was defined as an improvement of less than 0.6 points or a final DAS28 score of more than 5.1 points.

Following three months of therapy, two patients whom at baseline showed undetectable levels had detectable levels of IL-17A. These 11 patients were categorised as the IL-17A-positive group. The remaining 27 patients were negative for IL-17A expression at both baseline and three months and were categorised as the IL-17A-negative group, 70% of which had a clinical response to anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapy at three months.</p><p>In the IL-17A-positive group, 82% showed a decrease in IL-17A levels after three months of therapy, while 18% showed an increase. Patients that showed a decrease post therapy were also those patients that had been defined as clinical responders, while those showing an increase post therapy (dotted lines) were non-responders (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). All but one of these patients maintained this response to 12 months post therapy. The change in IL-17A levels pre/post biologic therapy strongly correlated with the change in CRP (r<sup>2 </sup>= 0.817, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) and the change in A-SAA (r<sup>2 </sup>= 0.627, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), markers of the acute phase response. When patients were categorised into those with detectable IL-17A levels and those with no detectable IL-17A levels, a significant difference in serum matrix turnover markers was demonstrated. MMP-1 and MMP-3 levels were significantly reduced in the IL-17A-negative patients (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) compared with the IL-17A-positive patients, which showed no significant change (data not shown). The MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratios were higher in the IL-17A-negative patients compared with IL-17A-positive patients but this was not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). A significant reduction was demonstrated for the MMP-1/TIMP4, MMP3/TIMP1 and MMP3/TIMP4 ratios in IL-17A-negative patients (all <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), compared with IL-17A-positive patients where we demonstrated no significant reduction in any of the MMP/TIMP ratio. This demonstrates decreased matrix degradation three months post therapy in those patients with no detectable IL-17A levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Although there is no change from baseline MMP/TIMP ratios pre/post anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapy in the IL-17A-positive patients, the levels of IL-17A were decreased post therapy. This suggests that patients with detectable IL-17A levels may sustain a higher MMP/TIMP ratio than those that are negative; however, other complex regulatory processes may also be involved in regulating matrix turnover, possibly through interactions with IL-17A or independently. Cartilage biomarkers were also measured in the IL-17A-negative and positive patients. There were no significant differences in the serum levels of C1, 2C, C2C and CPII pre/post therapy in either group. However, CS846 a marker of proteoglycan synthesis was significantly higher in the IL-17A-positive patients compared with the IL-17A-negative group at both baseline (262.5 &#x000b1; 68.1 ng/ml vs. 158 &#x000b1; 18.4 ng/ml) and three months post therapy (246.2 &#x000b1; 60 ng/ml vs. 159 &#x000b1; 14.9 ng/ml; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Finally, IL-17A production was measured in synovial explants following incubation with Humira and IgG control antibody.

The effect of biologics therapy on IL-17A expression and matrix turnover was also examined <italic>in vivo </italic>in a previously described cohort.</p><p>In this study we have shown high expression of IL-17A in ST lysates with no significant difference between RA and PsA tissue. Furthermore, IL-17A expression was markedly higher in RA and PsA ST compared with OA. Our results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating increased IL-17A production from RA patients compared with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; however, our data differ as samples are from patients with early active inflammation before commencing biologic therapy. We also report significantly higher IL-17A levels in SF and serum from inflammatory arthritis patients compared with OA and healthy controls. SF levels of IL-17A were significantly higher than matched serum suggesting that the cytokine is predominantly produced locally in the inflamed joint. Although previous reports showed elevated serum and SF IL-17A levels in RA patients compared with healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] these studies did not examine matched serum/SF samples as performed in this study. Interestingly, there was a strong correlation of SF IL-17A levels with CRP and disease duration. This finding is not surprising because previous animal model studies have suggested IL-17A drives disease activity and is associated with disease chronicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, IL-17A is a potent inducer of CRP from human smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We also demonstrated IL-17A expression in RA but not OA or healthy control synovium. IL-17A was expressed in 70% of RA patients examined, which is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>A fine balance exists between active MMP and TIMP levels in normal tissue and cartilage. In inflammatory conditions such as RA, this balance shifts leading to an increase in the ratio of active MMP: TIMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The effect of IL-17A on MMP expression was first examined in RASF and normal human chondrocyte cultures. IL-17A alone upregulated the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13 in both chondrocytes and RASFCs. IL-17A combined with OSM synergistically upregulated MMP-1 production in both chondrocytes and RASFs. A similar effect was observed for chondrocyte MMP-13 production with a less potent effect on RASF MMP-13 production. IL-17A alone also caused an increase in matrix turnover in chondrocytes as seen by the increased MMP-9 activity. IL-17A combined with OSM had an additive effect on matrix turnover as seen by the increased MMP-9 activity compared with either cytokine alone. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing IL-17A induced MMP expression in human OA chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and in RA synoviocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In animal cells IL-17A has been previously shown to act synergistically with TNF-&#x003b1; and OSM in upregulating proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and cartilage breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In this study for the first time we have shown in human cells isolated from patients with inflammatory arthritis that IL-17A combined with OSM synergistically upregulates the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 in both chondrocytes and RASFs.</p><p>We also showed for the first time in human cartilage explants and a human <italic>ex vivo </italic>synovial explant culture model, that IL-17A regulates MMP production and cartilage degradation, which is supported by previous animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. IL-17A alone significantly shifted the MMP-1: TIMP-1 ratio in favour of a destructive pattern. Significant matrix turnover was also demonstrated by increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in response to IL-17A stimulation. Mild proteoglycan depletion was observed in response to IL-17A stimulation visualised by loss of safranin-O staining. However, when IL-17A was combined with other key pro-inflammatory cytokines it significantly potentiated the effect of TNF-&#x003b1; and OSM on MMP-1 and MMP-13 production. This had a profound effect on the MMP/TIMP ratios, which shifted dramatically in favour of matrix degradation. Furthermore, when human cartilage explants were incubated with IL-17A, TNF or OSM alone, mild proteoglycan depletion was observed; however, when IL-17A was combined with OSM or TNF, near complete proteoglycan depletion compared with either cytokine alone was demonstrated.</p><p>These results suggest that in the inflamed joint environment, which has a complex milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that in addition to exerting its effects alone, IL-17A appears to have an important role in dramatically potentiating the destructive effects of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1; and OSM. Increased MMP expression has been observed in human chondrocytes in response to IL-17A stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] but no previous studies has examined its effect on RA whole tissue synovial explants or human cartilage explants. Whole tissue explant cultures more closely mimic the joint environment, as the architecture, cell-cell interactions and ECM remains intact, which can result in expression of genes and proteins to stimuli that differ from monolayer cultures. Thus the combination of mono-culture and whole tissue explant culture in this study dissects the cellular responses such as MMP expression to specific stimuli more effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we examined IL-17A and MMP/TIMP production in patients pre/post biologic therapy on IL-17A. We demonstrate for the first time that IL-17A serum levels are reduced in inflammatory arthritis patients following TNF blockade <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that serum IL-17A levels are modulated by biologic therapy with 80% of patients showing a decrease in IL-17A three months post therapy. Significantly, this reduction was demonstrated in patients who showed a clinical response, while non-responders showed an increase. Change in IL-17A also correlated with change in CRP and A-SAA, markers of systemic inflammation. Previous studies have shown synovial membrane mRNA levels of IL-17A may predict joint damage progression in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and IL-17A serum levels correlate with disease severity in psoriasis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. IL-23 (a key factor in Th17 differentiation) has been genetically linked to increased susceptibility to psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Furthermore, disease resolution in psoriasis patients following TNF blockade correlates with reduced Th17 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant difference in MMP/TIMP ratios from baseline to three months post therapy in IL-17A-negative patients, with no significant difference in IL-17A-positive patients. However, interpretation of this data is complex. IL-17A-positive patients may exhibit a sustained stimulation of MMPs; however, as the IL-17A levels do reduce after three months in most patients, it may suggest other pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and OSM are driving MMP expression. Indeed, this is supported by our <italic>in vitro </italic>data and the results of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] demonstrating IL-17A acts in synergy with TNF-&#x003b1;, OSM and other cytokines leading to increased MMP activity.</p><p>Numerous studies have associated MMP serum levels in particular MMP-3 levels to disease activity and radiographic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. SNPs in the IL-17A gene have been associated with radiographic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, one of the main drivers of IL-17A production, IL-23, is present in higher levels in patients with bone erosions than those without erosions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The observation of higher CS846 levels in IL-17A-positive sera may be relevant radiographically. Increased serum levels of CS846 are an indicator of increased turnover of newly formed matrix, as part of an attempt to repair cartilage degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Furthermore, patients with rapid radiographic progression have been shown to have higher CS846 epitope levels than slow progressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p>Overexpression of IL-17A by injection or gene expression significantly increased inflammatory infiltrate and resulted in extensive joint destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Furthermore, in studies that blocked IL-17A or in IL-17R-/- mice reduced inflammation and bone damage was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].

Furthermore, the IL-17A/TNF-&#x003b1; ratio pre-treatment was shown to be lower in responders to anti-TNF treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].
