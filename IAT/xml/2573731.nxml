The molecular defect has been identified as deficiency of destrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], an actin binding protein also known as actin depolymerizing factor (ADF). It is a member of the actin severing proteins that share sequence and functional similarity with cofilins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. In addition to the naturally occurring <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> mice, destrin-knockout mice generated by gene targeting also exhibited mild corneal hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. The requirement of destrin seems to be unique to the cornea because <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> mice are fertile and appear normal, apart from the corneal defect. However, it is not known how a destrin mutation leads to phenotypic changes in a <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea.</p><p>Histology of <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> corneas showed that the hyperplastic epithelium expressed an increased level of keratin 14 and involucrin while the level of keratin 12 was not altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. It has been shown that hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea depend on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], but its relationship with a destrin mutation is not known. Recently it was suggested that vascularization of <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> corneas arises from lack of soluble VEGF receptor, sflt-1, which was proposed as an essential factor for maintenance of avascularity in a normal cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. In this scenario, the loss of destrin would be the initial event that leads to the loss of sflt-1 in a <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea, but this causal relationship has not been established at a molecular level.</p><p>Two of the major defects in a <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea, vascularization and abnormal epithelium, may arise independently of each other as a consequence of destrin deficiency. Alternatively, there may be a causal relationship between the two, i.e., either one may be a prerequisite for the other. Gross and histological observations suggested that a corneal surface irregularity occurred about a week before signs of neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>], favoring an idea that epithelial defects may trigger neovascularization. However, initial molecular events leading to vascularization may have been undetectable using histological techniques, and therefore, other possibilities remain viable at this time.</p><p>In this study, we focused on dynamic aspects of epithelial defects in a <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea by studying its epithelial homeostasis in the hope that this knowledge will eventually help the molecular elucidation of corneal defects due to destrin mutations. Our results suggest that epithelial homeostasis of a <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea is abnormal and similar to that of a normal conjunctival epithelium or a pathological epithelium of a conjunctivalized cornea, both of which feature an underlying stromal vasculature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The animal studies adhered to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> (Stock&#x000a0;Number 001649) and CAG-EGFP (Stock Number 003115) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), crossed, and bred to generate a strain with homozygosity to both traits, which we refer to as GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> in this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology</title><p>For histology, the eyes were isolated after sacrificing the animal with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (100&#x000a0;mg/kg). Whole-mounts containing an entire area of ocular surface were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] and stained with DAPI to reveal nuclei. Fluorescence patterns of DAPI and GFP were visualized with a fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets (Axioskop2, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Overlapping microscopic images were acquired digitally (Orca 100; Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan and Metamorph; Molecular Dynamics., Downingtown, PA), and assembled with Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) to prepare a large image file of the entire ocular surface for analysis.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed with cornea whole mounts that were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. For BrdU staining, corneal whole-mounts were pre-treated for epitope retrieval with 2 N HCl for 15 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> corneas were further processed by incubation with 0.2&#x000a0;mg/ml pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 0.1 N HCl for 5 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C so that antibody penetration to basal layers was satisfactory. For double immunofluorescence staining, corneal GFP fluorescence was quenched completely by treatment with methanol before antibody incubation. Rat anti-BrdU antibody was from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Rabbit anti-destrin antibody (GV-13) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rat anti-K8 antibody (Troma-I) was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Goat anti-K12 (L15) and goat anti-MUC5AC (K20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-K15 was from Lab Vision (Fremont, CA) and rabbit anti-K15 was from ProteinTech (Chicago, IL). Secondary antibodies conjugated with either Texas-red, Cy2, or Cy3 were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All immunostaining reactions without primary antibodies were negative under the same image acquisition conditions for staining with primary antibodies. This ensured that fluorescent signals were due to specific reactions of primary antibodies to target tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo microscopy</title><p>In vivo microscopy and digital imaging were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] using an M2Bio fluorescence microscope system (Kramer Scientific, Valley Cottage, NY), which is based on an SV11 stereo microscope (Carl Zeiss). Mice were anesthetized with a stream of 3% isoflurane in oxygen. The eye was lightly proptosed with a thin vinyl-coated, U-shaped flexible metal wire for microscopy. GFP fluorescence images were obtained with a 1.6X objective with a zoom at 1.0X using a digital camera (Coolsnap ES; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) controlled by MetaVue (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Image resolution was approximately 4.0&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m/pixel under these conditions. At each time point, at least seven images were taken, three at the central cornea at different focal planes, and one each at the superior, the inferior, the temporal, and the nasal portion of the peripheral cornea. This was facilitated by a set of custom-made gimbals, which accommodated a mouse platform and could be rotated freely to bring an ocular surface area of interest to the apex to face the objective. GFP patterns were recorded at intervals of one to four weeks, and movement of GFP positive cells was analyzed from time lapse sequences as before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labeling of DNA with BrdU</title><p>To determine cell division rates, DNA was metabolically labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h in live mice of 13-20 weeks. BrdU (0.6&#x000a0;mg/day) was given systemically with an Alzet osmotic pump (model 1003D; DURECT Corp., Cupertino, CA) that was implanted subcutaneously in the back. The animal was sacrificed 24 h later to determine DNA synthesis during the 24 h period. Whole mounts were prepared to determine BrdU-incorporating cells by immunohistochemistry (see above). BrdU-labeling rates over 24 h were determined as a ratio of the number of BrdU positive cells and the number of DAPI-stained cells in an area of 170&#x000d7;210&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m in digitized microscopic images. At least six such areas were selected randomly in each of the five eyes for GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> corneas and three eyes for CAG-EGFP corneas.</p><p>For determination of label-retaining cells (LRCs), four adult mice (18-24 weeks old) were labeled with BrdU with a subcutaneous Alzet pump (model 2002) for two consecutive weeks. The Alzet pump was removed at the end of the two-week labeling, and the mouse was sacrificed eight weeks later to harvest both eyes when only slow cycling cells would retain BrdU in their nuclei. After whole mount BrdU immunofluorescence, individual BrdU retaining cells (i.e., LRCs) were located under a fluorescence microscope and plotted manually on a print-out of a whole mount outline. Manual determination of BrdU positive cells under the microscope was aided by focusing up and down and switching between BrdU and DAPI channels to ensure only epithelial BrdU signals were counted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> hybrid mice</title><p>To observe homeostatic movement of epithelial cells, we crossed CAG-EGFP mice with <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> mice to generate a line, GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic>, which was homozygous to both traits.

For <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> phenotype, spontaneous corneal vascularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) and epithelial hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>) were observed as with <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> homozygous mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>].

In normal CAG-EGFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, right panel), corneal GFP patterns were mosaic in two-week-old animals (a three-week cornea is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) while radial stripes emerged at the limbus at three to four weeks and continued to move centripetally and reached the center by 10 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> corneas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, left panel) also exhibited mosaic patterns after birth, but radial stripes appeared as early as two weeks at the peripheral cornea. The centripetal progression of budding radial stripes stopped at four to six weeks and never reached the center of the cornea. Instead, GFP patterns became diffuse and globular without a sign of extended stripes, radial or otherwise, indicating that there was neither centripetal movement nor sustained directional movement of epithelial cells in an adult GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea.</p><fig id="f2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Developmental changes of GFP patterns in GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> corneas and normal CAG-EGFP corneas.

Two of the representative sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>. In the sequence of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>, epithelial GFP exhibited a mixture of diffuse and stripe patterns, suggesting that the direction of cell movements had not been established yet. At six weeks, radial stripes became the dominant pattern, indicating that there were general cell movements in a radial direction. By 10 weeks, however, GFP stripes turned into irregularly shaped patches, suggesting that the radial cell movements had stopped before 10 weeks. Thereafter, GFP patterns were diffuse and remained generally immobile while their size appeared to grow slowly in all directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A,C,D</xref>), which is perhaps reflecting gradual and random local cell movements, accompanied by clonal growth of GFP positive cells. A time lapse sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref> shows images up to 79 weeks and demonstrates that epithelial GFP remained generally stationary for the life of the animal as the natural life span of <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> and GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> mice is about 70-80 weeks (unpublished observations).

These observations make it clear that epithelial homeostasis is abnormal in a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea.</p><sec><title>Epithelial homeostasis in a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea</title><p>One of the implications of our findings is that the epithelium of a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea may contain epithelial stem cells within it. This is suggested by the observation that epithelial cells were generally stationary during the life of the animal and yet mitotically active, indicating that the GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> epithelium is a self-sustained tissue, which would contain its own stem cells. This notion was supported by the finding that LRCs were present in the epithelium of a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea. Although all LRCs are clearly not stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], some LRCs are likely to be stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The situation is similar to the skin where cells are generally immobile in a lateral direction and maintained by keratinocyte stem cells within the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. This is, however, unlike a normal corneal epithelium, which is maintained by a constant influx of epithelial cells that are generated by limbal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>].</p><p>A comparison of epithelial homeostasis suggests that the epithelium of a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea resembles that of a conjunctiva or a conjunctivalized cornea. This point is based on our characterization of the normal conjunctival epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] and the epithelium of a conjunctivalized cornea (unpublished data), both of which are self-sufficient in cell renewal and appear to contain uniformly distributed stem cells. However, one marked difference is that a <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea exhibits several patches of epithelial hyperplasia throughout the cornea while such hyperplastic zones do not usually exist in a conjunctival epithelium or a conjunctivalized cornea. One parameter that we have not measured is a rate of cell desquamation, which may also be a contributing factor in the hyperplastic phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Epithelial differentiation in a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea</title><p>An adult GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea contained a mixed population of cells expressing markers for corneal and conjunctival epithelium. MUC5AC-positive goblet cells were also present in older mice. Non-corneal cells may have migrated from the conjunctiva, but we failed to detect directed epithelial cell movements in a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea including those from the conjunctiva into the cornea for the entire life in some animals. Therefore, it is likely that those cells of a conjunctival phenotype in the cornea arose by differentiation of epithelial stem cells in situ rather than immigration of conjunctival cells into the cornea. This in turn suggests that a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea contains 1) three types of stem cells, each specific for corneal epithelial cells, conjunctival epithelial cells, or goblet cells; 2) multi-potent stem cells that are capable of differentiating into all three types of cells (and perhaps others); or 3) a combination of both. Further investigation may shed light on the nature of tissue-specific stem cells and their differentiation.</p><p>As to differentiation cues, variable patterns of K12 and K15 in GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> corneas of the same age groups suggest that there is a stochastic element to the epithelial differentiation, i.e., some epithelial cells go through abnormal differentiation (manifested by expression of odd keratins), but it is not possible a priori to predict which cells do and where in the cornea they appear. The stochasticity may be a feature of epithelial differentiation in a normal cornea that continues well into adulthood because it has been reported that K12 expression in the mouse cornea did not stabilize until the mouse was six months old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A destrin mutation</title><p>Our results with GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> mice demonstrate that destrin-defective epithelial cells lost the ability to move centripetally at a constant rate in the cornea. Given the involvement of cofilin/destrin in cell movement in a variety of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], it is likely that loss of destrin is directly related to the loss of epithelial cell movement in a GFP-<italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea. On the other hand, it is not clear whether the loss of destrin is the primary cause of other epithelial abnormalities such as increased division rates and hyperplasia. At this time, it is equally possible that such abnormalities are cumulative results of secondary events such as lack of cell movement triggered by destrin loss. Further investigations are required to determine how destrin deficiency leads to a variety of epithelial abnormalities at a molecular level.</p></sec><sec><title>Epithelial movement and vascularization</title><p>Having established the abnormal cell movement in a <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea in this study, we note an apparent correlation between epithelial cell movement and underlying stromal vascularization. On one hand, epithelial cells exhibit constant centripetal movement in a normal avascular cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, epithelial cells are generally stationary in a vascularized cornea including a <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> cornea (this study), a pathological conjunctivalized cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], and a normal conjunctiva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Similarly, epithelial cell movements were reportedly disturbed in a vascularized <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mouse cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. These observations raise an intriguing possibility that constant homeostatic epithelial cell movement may be a required component of avascularity in a normal cornea and that lack of such movement may trigger vascularization. Many variations of this scheme are possible including those that incorporate a vital role of sflt-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] or VEGFR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], but further discussion should await more experimental results. <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1</sup></italic> mice should serve as a valuable tool for this purpose, especially in combination with <italic>Dstn<sup>corn1&#x02013;2J</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], an independent destrin mutant mouse line with no corneal vascularization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by grants from National Institute of Health (EY015835) and Research to Prevent Blindness.
