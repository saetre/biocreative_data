Phenotyping revealed that the "uncorrected" frequencies of A*24, B*14, B*15, B*35, B*40, B*49, and B*50 were significantly greater in index cases, and frequencies of B*35, B*58, B*62 were significantly lower in index cases. After Bonferroni corrections, the frequencies of phenotypes A*24, B*14, and B*40 were significantly greater in index cases, and the frequency of B*62 was significantly lower in index cases. The most common haplotypes in index cases were A*02-B*44 (frequency 0.1385), A*01-B*08 (frequency 0.1308), and A*03-B*07 (frequency 0.1000), and the frequency of each was significantly greater in index cases than in control subjects ("uncorrected" values of <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001, 0.0252, and 0.0011, respectively). After performing Bonferroni corrections, however, the frequency of A*02-B*44 alone was significantly increased in probands (p &#x0003c; 0.0085). Three other haplotypes were also significantly more frequent in index cases (A*03-B*14, A*31-B*40, and A*32-B*14). The combined frequencies of three latter haplotypes in index patients and control subjects were 0.0411 and 0.0126, respectively ("uncorrected" value of <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0002; "corrected" value of <italic>p </italic>= 0.0166). Most phenotype and haplotype frequencies in CVID and IgGSD were similar. 26.7% of index patients were HLA-haploidentical with one or more other index patients. We diagnosed CVID or IgGSD in first-degree or other relatives of 26 of 195 index patients for whom HLA-A and -B haplotypes had been ascertained; A*01-B*08, A*02-B*44, and A*29-B*44 were most frequently associated with CVID or IgGSD in these families. We conservatively estimated the combined population frequency of CVID and IgGSD to be 0.0092 in adults, based on the occurrence of CVID and IgGSD in spouses of the index cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>CVID and IgGSD in adults are significantly associated with several HLA haplotypes, many of which are also common in the Alabama Caucasian population. Immunoglobulin phenotype variability demonstrated in index cases and family studies herein suggests that there are multiple gene(s) on Ch6p or other chromosomes that modify immunoglobulin phenotypes of CVID and IgGSD. The estimated prevalence of CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama could be reasonably attributed to the fact that many HLA haplotypes significantly associated with these disorders are also common in the general population.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>common variable immunodeficiency</kwd><kwd>haplotype</kwd><kwd><italic>HFE</italic></kwd><kwd>hemochromatosis</kwd><kwd>HLA</kwd><kwd>IgG subclass deficiency</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency (IgGSD) are characterized by subnormal serum concentrations of total IgG, or by normal serum total IgG concentrations with deficiency of one or more IgG subclasses, respectively; in some cases, IgA or IgM levels are also subnormal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most persons are diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD because they have increased frequency and severity of infections due to bacteria and other microbial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although a susceptibility locus for these disorders has not been identified, they often appear to be familial and to segregate with markers on Ch6p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of the present work was to quantify and analyze the frequencies of HLA-A and -B phenotypes and haplotypes in index cases with CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama who presented because they had increased frequency or severity of infections, and to compare the present results to those of control subjects in this geographic area. We also evaluated the relationships of HLA-A and -B phenotype frequencies and haplotypes with phenotypes defined by serum immunoglobulin concentrations, and we estimated the combined frequency of CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama based upon the occurrence of these disorders in the spouses of the present index cases. The implications of the present results in determining the hereditary basis and immunoglobulin phenotype expression of CVID and IgGSD are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Selection of Subjects</title><sec><title>General Criteria for Selection of Study Subjects</title><p>The performance of this work was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Brookwood Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the Ethical Principles for Medical Research involving Human Subjects promulgated by the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki were followed. All subjects were adults (&#x02265; 18 years of age) who identified themselves as Caucasians; each resided in central Alabama. The first persons in respective families diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD were designated as index cases. All index persons were diagnosed in routine medical care in a single community medical center; none was diagnosed as a consequence of family or population screening. We included all evaluable index patients diagnosed between November 1991 and June 2002.</p></sec><sec><title>CVID and IgGSD Index Cases</title><p>Each patient was diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD deficiency as an adult because he/she had frequent or unusually severe infections. Each patient had a single, severe or life-threatening infection that required hospitalization or four or more infections per year that required antibiotic therapy for at least two consecutive years. None was known to have pre-existing isolated IgA deficiency or other abnormality of immunity. Diagnoses were based on demonstration of persistent, otherwise unexplained serum concentrations of immunoglobulins &#x0003e; 2 S.D. below the corresponding mean levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Criteria for the diagnosis of CVID were: 1) decreased total serum IgG concentration; and 2) either decreased IgG subclass(es), decreased serum IgA concentration, or decreased serum IgM concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Criteria for the diagnosis of IgGSD were: 1) normal total serum IgG concentration; and 2) abnormally low serum concentrations of one or more IgG subclasses; some patients with IgGSD also had decreased levels of IgA or IgM levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>We excluded persons of African American descent because: 1) certain HLA types and haplotypes differ significantly among Caucasians and African Americans in central Alabama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; 2) in adults, serum concentrations of immunoglobulins are often greater in persons of sub-Saharan African descent than in whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; and 3) persons of sub-Saharan descent occur infrequently in series of CVID or IgGSD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and such patients are uncommon in our experience. We also excluded persons who had isolated deficiencies of IgA or IgM, those with hypogammaglobulinemia attributable to B-cell neoplasms (<italic>e.g</italic>., B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, plasma cell myeloma, macroglobulinemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) or those with markedly increased immunoglobulin loss (<italic>e.g</italic>., nephrotic syndrome or protein-losing enteropathy).</p></sec><sec><title>Control Subjects</title><p>Data from 1,321 apparently normal, unrelated Caucasian adult subjects from Alabama who had undergone HLA-A and -B phenotype analysis as part of paternity testing were used to estimate allele and gene frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. HLA-A and -B haplotypes were determined in 751 unrelated Caucasian subjects from Alabama who had undergone testing to establish paternity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Haplotypes were assessed from a child and his/her mother or father, and included in the data set. Preliminary data analysis revealed that frequencies of the major HLA-A and -B haplotypes observed in the present control subjects were similar to those estimated to occur in Caucasians from a large national bone marrow donor program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Family Members</title><p>We diagnosed CVID or IgGSD deficiency in some family members using the same criteria defined herein for index patients. These persons presented themselves for evaluation after an index case was diagnosed in their respective kinships because they also had increased frequency and severity of bacterial infections. Although other relatives of index cases were also reported to have increased frequency and severity of infections or to have some form of antibody deficiency, they were not included in the present study because we did not evaluate them. Screening or other systematic testing of family members of the present index cases was beyond the scope of the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Laboratory Methods</title><p>Serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgG subclasses were measured using standard automated methods before IgG replacement therapy was initiated. Reference ranges for serum immunoglobulin concentrations are: total IgG 700 &#x02013; 1600 mg/dL; IgG<sub>1 </sub>422 &#x02013; 1292 mg/dL; IgG<sub>2 </sub>117 &#x02013; 747 mg/dL; IgG<sub>3 </sub>41 &#x02013; 129 mg/dL; IgG<sub>4 </sub>1 &#x02013; 291 mg/dL; total IgA 70 &#x02013; 400 mg/dL; and IgM 40 &#x02013; 230 mg/dL. The basis of these reference ranges has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Deficiency of an immunoglobulin class or subclass was defined by a serum concentration at diagnosis that was less than the corresponding lower reference limit. Measurement of IgA subclasses, IgD, or IgE in serum was not routinely performed.</p><p>HLA -A and -B alleles were detected using low-resolution DNA-based typing (PCR/sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe) in index cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Control subjects were tested using the microdroplet lymphocytotoxicity test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; subjects were evaluated using antisera that detected allele assignments described in the 9<sup>th </sup>International Histocompatibility Workshop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Because the levels of resolution of the DNA-based and serological typing methods we used are similar, alleles detected by these respective methods provide concordant allele assignments, with the exception of B*70 and B*71 that were not detected by serological methods. HLA typing of family members was performed to permit assignment of Ch6p haplotypes. In each index patient in whom a single A or B allele was detected by DNA-based typing, we verified the allele(s) and set phase to ascertain haplotypes of the index patient using HLA analyses of appropriate family members. For the present analysis, all haplotypes were defined only by A and B alleles.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Considerations</title><p>A data set that included HLA-A and -B phenotypes in 240 index patients with either CVID or IgGSD and HLA-A and -B haplotypes in 195 of these 240 index patients was available. Absolute or "uncorrected" values of A and B phenotype frequencies in index cases, A and B haplotype frequencies, and occurrence of two-haplotype combinations were calculated after enumeration of the raw data. To correct for the possible occurrence of spurious HLA antigen and haplotype associations due to multiple comparisons, we also computed values of <italic>p </italic>using the Bonferroni inequality method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. "Corrected" values of <italic>p </italic>are displayed in tabular form along with "uncorrected" values. A computer spreadsheet (Excel 2000, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and a statistical program (GB-Stat, v. 8.0 2000, Dynamic Microsystems, Inc., Silver Spring, MD) were used to perform the present analyses. Means were compared using a student t-test (two-tail). Frequency values were compared using chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact test (one-tail), as appropriate. A value of <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was defined as significant. Only significant values of <italic>p </italic>are displayed, and these are expressed to four significant figures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>General Characteristics of CVID and IgGSD Index Patients</title><p>There were approximately equal fractions of index patients with CVID and IgGSD, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Thus, a conservative estimate of the combined frequencies of these disorders in adults in central Alabama is 0.0092 (2/217).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present observations demonstrate that CVID and IgGSD in Caucasian adults diagnosed in routine medical care delivery are significantly associated with HLA haplotypes on Ch6p. More than two-thirds of the present 195 index patients who were evaluable for haplotyping inherited one or two of the significantly associated haplotypes A*01-B*08, A*02-B*44, A*03-B*07, A*03-B*14, A*31-B*40, and A*32-B*14. This indicates that a susceptibility locus (loci) for CVID and IgGSD occurs on multiple haplotypes defined by HLA-A and -B typing. Further, this implies that putative Ch6p alleles associated with CVID or IgGSD susceptibility occur on many HLA haplotypes that are common in Caucasians in central Alabama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and in Caucasians from a large national bone marrow donor program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The present observations also confirm and extend the reports of association of HLA haplotype A*01-B*08 (or an extended haplotype containing A*01 and B*08) with heritable forms of immunoglobulin deficiency demonstrated in family-based analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is likely that a candidate gene(s) for CVID or IgGSD exists in the HLA class II region, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Because the class II region is closer to the HLA-B locus than to the HLA-A locus, it is plausible that candidate gene(s) for CVID or IgGSD in the class II region are in greater linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B than HLA-A. This is consistent with the aggregate observations on HLA-A and -B typing in the present study.</p><p>The present observations demonstrate that the frequencies of HLA-A and -B phenotypes and haplotypes were not significantly different in CVID and IgGSD index patients, with few exceptions. These observations could be explained by the occurrence of an HLA-linked allele that is necessary to cause either CVID or IgGSD, but is insufficient to induce a specific immunoglobulin deficiency phenotype. Alternatively, the variable immunoglobulin deficiency phenotypes presently classified as CVID and IgGSD are best explained by the co-inheritance of multiple alleles, each of which has an independent effect on the immunoglobulin deficiency phenotype. Regardless, the variability we observed in IgG, IgA, and IgM phenotypes in index patients and family members is best explained by the co-inheritance of multiple allele(s) that influence the immunoglobulin phenotype. This is consistent with evidence for the occurrence on Ch6p of multiple distinct susceptibility genes for patterns of immunoglobulin deficiency, some recessive and others dominant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, at least two putative alleles associated with heritable IgA deficiency occur on Ch6p, and each is associated with a different major histocompatibility (MHC) region haplotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], whereas a putative susceptibility locus on chromosome 18 is not a major contributor to selective IgA deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Allele(s) on chromosomes other than Ch6p may also influence the phenotypic expression of CVID and IgGSD in adults. The inheritance of certain polymorphisms of the mannose-binding lectin gene on Ch10 in persons with CVID are associated with earlier age of onset of manifestations of antibody deficiency and with increased risk of autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Altogether, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that many common heritable antibody deficiency phenotypes collectively diagnosed as CVID or IgGSD are the result of the inheritance of multiple disease-predisposing alleles on Ch6p and possibly other chromosomes.</p><p>We have estimated that the prevalence of CVID and IgGSD in adults in central Alabama is 0.0092. This estimated prevalence could be reasonably attributed to the fact that many of the HLA haplotypes significantly associated with CVID and IgGSD are also common in the general population. This could also explain a) the inheritance of two significantly associated HLA haplotypes in many of the present index cases, including most of the index patients who were HLA-haploidentical with at least one other index patient; b) the disparate immunoglobulin deficiency phenotypes of multiple family members who inherited the same HLA haplotype; and c) the occurrence of disparate haplotypes in two sisters who had similar immunoglobulin phenotypes.</p><p>Some of the haplotypes significantly associated with CVID and IgGSD in the present study also occur with significantly increased frequencies in central Alabama Caucasian hemochromatosis probands with homozygosity for <italic>HFE </italic>C282Y on Ch6p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These haplotypes are A*03-B*07 and A*03-B*14 [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; present study]. These observations imply that susceptibility alleles for CVID and IgGSD occur on haplotypes that sometimes include the <italic>HFE </italic>C282Y allele. In addition, the haplotypes A*01-B*08 and A*02-B*44 significantly associated with CVID and IgGSD in the present study are common in both hemochromatosis probands homozygous for <italic>HFE </italic>C282Y and control subjects in Alabama [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; present study]. Taken together, these observations could explain the occurrence of CVID or IgGSD and hemochromatosis due to <italic>HFE </italic>C282Y homozygosity in some of the present index patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and account for the occurrence of IgA deficiency and hemochromatosis in different members of the same family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>CVID and IgGSD are significantly associated with the HLA haplotypes A*01-B*08, A*02-B*44, A*03-B*07, A*03-B*14, A*31-B*40, and A*32-B*14. Many of these haplotypes are also common in the Alabama Caucasian population. Immunoglobulin phenotype variability demonstrated in index cases and in family studies suggest that there are multiple gene(s) on Ch6p or other chromosomes that modify the immunoglobulin phenotypes of CVID and IgGSD. The estimated prevalence of these disorders in central Alabama is 0.0092. The estimated prevalence of CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama could be reasonably attributed to the fact that many HLA haplotypes significantly associated with these disorders are also common in the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Author 1 (JCB) conceived the study, and contributed CVID and IgGSD index cases, case characterization, and HLA typing, tabulated index case HLA frequency values, performed statistical comparisons, and formulated the manuscript.
