Although it is well accepted that SVZ neuroblasts are migratory, recent evidence suggests their progenitor cells may also exhibit motility. Since stem and progenitor cells are proliferative and multipotential, if they were also able to move would have important implications for SVZ neurogenesis and its potential for repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We studied whether SVZ stem and/or progenitor cells are motile in transgenic GFP&#x0002b; slices with two photon time lapse microscopy and <italic>post hoc</italic> immunohistochemistry. We found that stem and progenitor cells; mGFAP-GFP&#x0002b; cells, bright nestin-GFP&#x0002b; cells and Mash1&#x0002b; cells were stationary in the SVZ and rostral migratory stream (RMS). In our search for motile progenitor cells, we uncovered a population of motile &#x003b2;III-tubulin&#x0002b; neuroblasts that expressed low levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr). This was intriguing since EGFr drives proliferation in the SVZ and affects migration in other systems. Thus we examined the potential role of EGFr in modulating SVZ migration. Interestingly, EGFr<sup>low</sup> neuroblasts moved slower and in more tortuous patterns than EGFr-negative neuroblasts. We next questioned whether EGFr stimulation affects SVZ cell migration by imaging Gad65-GFP&#x0002b; neuroblasts in the presence of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-&#x003b1;), an EGFr-selective agonist. Indeed, acute exposure to TGF-&#x003b1; decreased the percentage of motile cells by approximately 40&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In summary, the present study directly shows that SVZ stem and progenitor cells are static, that EGFr is retained on some neuroblasts, and that EGFr stimulation negatively regulates migration. This result suggests an additional role for EGFr signaling in the SVZ.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The adult subventricular zone (SVZ) is one of two largest neurogenic areas of the adult brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-AlvarezBuylla1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The current model of the adult SVZ delineates three neurogenic cell types: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP&#x0002b;) stem cells, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr&#x0002b;) transit-amplifying progenitor cells, and doublecortin (Dcx&#x0002b;) neuroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Doetsch1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Pastrana1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Stem cells divide slowly and generate transit-amplifying progenitor cells which divide rapidly to produce neuroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Doetsch2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Garcia1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Using <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine and histological analyses, Altman showed that neuroblasts migrate in the rostral migratory stream (RMS), a densely packed corridor of cells moving from the SVZ to the olfactory bulbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Altman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These and many other studies of migration were static experiments that determined the final position of labeled cells or used cell morphology to assess migration. There are several shortcomings with these approaches. First, one can never be certain of the trajectory taken by a migrating cell between its point of origin and final position. In addition, local motility would not be detected with dye, thymidine analogue or retroviral labeling and static histological approaches. Indeed, two-photon time lapse studies revealed that in addition to long-distance migration, one third of motile SVZ cells move in local exploratory patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Nam1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, migratory morphology is not always correlated with motility, motile cells can change shape dramatically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Nam1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus local motility of stem and progenitor cells, or even rare long-distance motility may have been missed with previous approaches. If pluripotential stem cells or rapidly dividing progenitor cells migrate in the SVZ, they may also migrate to injuries and be more reparative than SVZ neuroblasts, which are fate-restricted.</p><p>Studies have emerged recently which suggest that transit-amplifying progenitor cells in the SVZ may be motile. A population of 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic nucleotide 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase-enhanced green fluorescent protein/NG2&#x0002b; cells were identified as migratory transit-amplifying progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Aguirre1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Aguirre2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (0.25 ml/L for 1 min), immersed in ice for 5 min, decapitated and the brain quickly removed, placed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM, CaCl<sup>2</sup>, 1 mM MgCl<sup>2</sup>, 26 mM NaHCO<sup>3</sup>, 1.25 mM H<sub>2</sub>PO<sup>4</sup>, and 25 mM glucose at pH 7.4). The brain was bisected and trimmed for mounting. Hemispheres were mounted on a platform, submerged in ice-cold aCSF and 300 &#x000b5;m sagittal slices cut on a Vibratome (Campden Instruments Ltd.). Slices were collected sequentially in a chamber filled with oxygenated aCSF, incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 40 min, and returned to RT (about 1 hr) before imaging. For cell imaging, each section was examined shortly under low power epifluorescence to find the optimal slice and field. A two photon laser (Mira 900, Coherent) was used to acquire 51 optical sections separated by 1 &#x000b5;m, every 3 min. Oxygenated aCSF was constantly perfused during the imaging at 0.5&#x02013;1.0 ml/min. For TGF-&#x003b1; experiments, 10 ng/ml TGF-&#x003b1; was dissolved in oxygenated aCSF and either TGF-&#x003b1;, or aCSF as a control, constantly perfused during imaging at 0.2&#x02013;0.5 ml/min.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Image Processing and Quantification</title><p>Two photon images were acquired as a stack of TIFF images using Fluoview software (Olympus) and data processed with Volocity software (Improvision). Briefly, Fluoview files were imported into Volocity, decompressed and processed with autocontrast, fine median filter, and auto level functions to obtain optimal image quality. Each stack of processed data was compressed and exported into Quicktime (Apple). For quantifying cell speed and motility, 3D coordinates of cells in each frame were recorded and calculated using Volocity. If the net distance of displacement divided by the total migration distance was less than 0.4, between 0.4 and 0.6, or more than 0.6, cells were classified as exploratory, intermediate, or migratory, respectively. Cell speed was plotted by dividing total migration distance/time. For percentage migratory cell analysis in the TGF-&#x003b1; experiments, the first hour of pre-treatment and the last hour of drug treatment were quantified. Cells in the first frame of each movie were numbered and their motility subsequently followed in 2P movies. Only cells moving more than two cell diameters were considered motile.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Immunohistochemistry and Confocal Microscopy</title><p>For <italic>post hoc</italic> immunohistochemistry, immediately after the last 2P frame was taken slices were fixed with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde for 1 hr and transferred to cryoprotectant at 4&#x000b0;C.

To examine the direct effect of TGF-&#x003b1; on EGFr<sup>low</sup> neuroblasts, we performed posthoc EGFr immunohistochemistry on Gad65-GFP slices after TGF-&#x003b1; treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008122-g006">Fig. 6G</xref>). It was very difficult to identify EGFr<sup>low</sup> neuroblasts and trace them during the entire 5 hr time-lapse imaging because most expressed GFP at low levels. None of the EGFr<sup>low</sup>/Gad65-GFP cells exhibited fast and unidirectional movement, most were non-motile (81.8&#x00025;), and even motile EGFr<sup>low</sup>/Gad65-GFP cells moved very slowly in the last hour of imaging (after 2 hr TGF-&#x003b1; treatment) (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11 cells, N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 mice). The cells we followed through the entire imaging (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 cells) moved slowly in pre-treatment but then stopped during most of the TGF-&#x003b1; treatment.

Using two photon time lapse microscopy of slices from multiple GFP&#x0002b; mouse lines we did not find any evidence of motile stem or progenitor cells. Unexpectedly, we found that a marker of transit-amplifying progenitor cells, EGFr, was also expressed by a subset of neuroblasts. Interestingly these EGFr<sup>low</sup> neuroblasts exhibited slower and more complex motility than EGFr-negative neuroblasts. Moreover, exposure to TGF-&#x003b1;, induced significant decreases in the percentage of migratory neuroblasts. These results do not support the recent evidence of progenitor migration and suggest that EGFr signaling may serve to decrease SVZ neuroblast migration in addition to modulating progenitor proliferation.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Stem Cells and Transit-Amplifying Progenitor Cells Are Stationary in the SVZ</title><p>When <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine, a mitotic label, was injected and the SVZ examined at short survival times; most forebrain labeled cells were in the SVZ, indicating a large proliferative population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Altman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

These classic labeling studies, as well as histological observations, prompted the classification of SVZ cells into distinct proliferative and migratory subpopulations. This model was commensurate with most migratory cells in the developing telencephalon being postmitotic; stem and progenitor cells reside in germinal zones and upon exiting the cell cycle their progeny migrate to final locations. However there are notable exceptions and other clues pointing to the possibility of stem or progenitor cell migration.

Taken together, this suggested that GFAP&#x0002b; astrocyte-like stem cells or transit-amplifying progenitor cells of the adult SVZ may be capable of motility. This is important, because if stem or progenitor cells are motile in the SVZ, they may be able to emigrate and better effectuate repair of injured tissues than the less plastic neuroblasts.</p><p>Intriguingly, three separate lines of evidence suggested SVZ stem and/or progenitor cells may be motile.

We confirmed that many CSH-Nestin-GFP<sup>bright</sup> cells were GFAP&#x0002b; or Mash1&#x0002b;, which was consistent with the antigenic phenotype of SVZ stem and progenitor cells. The CSH-Nestin-GFP mouse dim neuroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008122-Mignone1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> migrated, serving as an internal control for the stationary bright GFP&#x0002b; SVZ stem and progenitor cells.

One potential explanation is that TGF-&#x003b1; acted directly on EGFr<sup>low</sup> neuroblasts. To support this argument, we observed EGFr<sup>low</sup> cells which were motile before TGF-&#x003b1; treatment but stopped after the treatment. The decreased percent of migrating cells in this study could also be explained by increased proliferation; cells theoretically have to stop moving before they divide.

The short time course also suggests that TGF-&#x003b1; acted directly on EGFr<sup>low</sup> neuroblasts, although we can not rule out an indirect effect via stimulation of EGFr<sup>high</sup> cells and release of soluble factors from them. Regardless of whether either scenario is correct, TGF-&#x003b1; treatment decreased the percentage of motile cells.
