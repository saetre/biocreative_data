The sequence is 3289 nucleotides in length and contains four open reading frames (ORFs) which code for proteins of Mr 22,147 (ORF1), Mr 58,098 (ORF2), Mr 17,378 (ORF3), and Mr 14,119 (ORF4). The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by the ORF nearest the 5'-end of the RNA (ORF1) is identical (after the initiator methionine) to the published N-terminal amino acid sequence of BSMV coat protein for 29 of the first 30 amino acids. ORF2 occupies the central portion of the coding region of RNA beta and ORF3 is located at the 3'-end. The ORF4 sequence overlaps the 3'-region of ORF2 and the 5'-region of ORF3 and differs in codon usage from the other three RNA beta ORFs. The coding region of RNA beta is followed by a poly(A) tract and a 238 nucleotide tRNA-like structure which are common to all three BSMV genomic RNAs.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0296-a" xlink:role="3898"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0293.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3895"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0294.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3896"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3897"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3898"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3899"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3900"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0299.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3901"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0300.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3902"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0301.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3903"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0302.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3904"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0303.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3905"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0304.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3906"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0305.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3907"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0306.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3908"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0307.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3909"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
