Apoplastic phloem-loading species require sucrose transporters (SUTs) to transport sucrose into the phloem. In many dicot plants, genetic and biochemical evidence has established that SUT1-type proteins function in phloem loading. However, the role of SUT1 in phloem loading in monocot plants is not clear since the rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and sugarcane (<italic>Saccharum</italic> hybrid) <italic>SUT1</italic> orthologues do not appear to function in phloem loading of sucrose. A <italic>SUT1</italic> gene was previously cloned from maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) and shown to have expression and biochemical activity consistent with a hypothesized role in phloem loading. To determine the biological function of <italic>SUT1</italic> in maize, a <italic>sut1</italic> mutant was isolated and characterized. <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants hyperaccumulate carbohydrates in mature leaves and display leaf chlorosis with premature senescence. In addition, <italic>sut1</italic> mutants have greatly reduced stature, altered biomass partitioning, delayed flowering, and stunted tassel development. Cold-girdling wild-type leaves to block phloem transport phenocopied the <italic>sut1</italic> mutants, supporting a role for maize SUT1 in sucrose export. Furthermore, application of <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose to abraded <italic>sut1</italic> mutant and wild-type leaves showed that sucrose export was greatly diminished in <italic>sut1</italic> mutants compared with wild type. Collectively, these data demonstrate that SUT1 is crucial for efficient phloem loading of sucrose in maize leaves.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Carbohydrate accumulation</kwd><kwd>cold-girdling</kwd><kwd>maize</kwd><kwd>phloem</kwd><kwd><italic>sucrose transporter1</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>sut1</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most plant species, sucrose is the principal form of carbohydrate translocated through the veins from carbon-exporting source leaves to carbon-importing sink tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turgeon, 2006</xref>). Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) leaves contain two photosynthetic cell types, mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, that are concentrically arranged around the veins and co-operatively perform C<sub>4</sub> carbon assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esau, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Sucrose initially follows a symplastic path from its site of synthesis in the mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lunn and Furbank, 1999</xref>), diffusing through plasmodesmata into the bundle sheath cells and into the vascular parenchyma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Russin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Maize is an apoplastic phloem loading species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heyser, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gamalei, 1989</xref>). Sucrose is exported into the apoplast from the vascular parenchyma cells by an unknown mechanism, prior to being imported into the phloem companion cells and/or sieve elements of leaf minor veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fritz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>). The minor veins feed into the lateral veins which are responsible for the long-distance transport of assimilates out of the leaf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russell and Evert, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fritz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) import sucrose from the apoplast into the phloem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lalonde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun and Slewinski, 2009</xref>).

Experiments in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes and in yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) have demonstrated biochemical activity for many SUTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Riesmeier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gahrtz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sauer and Stolz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boorer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Based on their sequence and affinity for sucrose, SUTs were previously classified into three different types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lalonde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Type I contained high-affinity transporters proposed to function as the major transporters that load sucrose into the phloem in dicots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">K&#x000fc;hn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lalonde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In recent years, with the greater number of SUT sequences, phylogenetic analysis divided the type II SUT proteins into two clades, establishing four SUT groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sauer, 2007</xref>). With the recent completion of the draft genome sequences of maize, sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>), and <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, and the identification of their corresponding <italic>SUT</italic> genes, five different SUT groups have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun and Slewinski, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Members of group 2 (formerly type I) SUT proteins are unique to dicots and have been shown to function in phloem loading.

In addition, these <italic>sut</italic> mutant plants exhibit leaf chlorosis, reduced rates of photosynthesis, diminished shoot and root growth, delayed flowering, and decreased yields due to the reduced export of carbohydrates to developing sink tissues. These studies demonstrate that these group 2 SUT proteins function as sucrose carriers involved in apoplastic phloem loading.</p><p>Group 1 (formerly type II) SUT proteins are present only in monocot plants, and their <italic>in vivo</italic> functions are mostly unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun and Slewinski, 2009</xref>). <italic>SUT1</italic> genes have been cloned from a number of grasses and shown to encode proteins with sucrose transport activity when expressed in heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirose <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weschke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carpaneto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rae <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sivitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reinders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The SUT1 protein from sugarcane (<italic>Saccharum</italic> hybrid) was immunolocalized to cells outside the phloem in leaf and stem tissues, indicating that sugarcane SUT1 does not function in phloem loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rae <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). To date, mutational studies have not established whether group 1 SUT1 proteins have a role in phloem loading in grass leaves. Two research groups characterized nearly complete antisense RNA knockdowns of <italic>SUT1</italic> in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), but neither found any alterations in photosynthetic rates, plant morphology or carbohydrate content in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scofield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The principal phenotypes associated with these lines were reduced grain-filling and decreased seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scofield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The authors suggested that another SUT may be responsible for phloem loading, which is consistent with <italic>SUT1</italic> being expressed at low levels in rice source leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirose <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Follow-up work has shown that multiple <italic>SUT</italic>s are present in the rice genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, rice may utilize a symplastic phloem loading pathway based on the high frequency of plasmodesmata connecting the vascular parenchyma and companion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaneko <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>). Based on its expression pattern, <italic>SUT1</italic> in rice has been proposed to function in sucrose retrieval from the apoplasm in seedling tissues as well as in the long-distance assimilate transport pathway from the flag leaf blade to the base of the filling grain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scofield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61"><italic>b</italic></xref>). Therefore, no grass <italic>SUT</italic> gene has been demonstrated to have a function in phloem loading in leaves.</p><p>Maize and rice SUT1 proteins are highly similar, sharing 82% identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), and the maize and sugarcane SUT1 proteins are 95% identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rae <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Maize SUT1 has been shown to have a biochemical activity and sucrose affinity consistent with a role in phloem loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carpaneto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In contrast with rice or sugarcane, the maize <italic>SUT1</italic> gene is expressed in a pattern suggestive of a function in phloem loading. Maize <italic>SUT1</italic> is expressed strongly in source leaves in a diurnal pattern with maximal expression at the end of the day and minimal expression during the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In addition, in developing leaves, it is expressed in a tip-to-base gradient reflective of the sink-to-source transition, which is in agreement with a role in exporting photoassimilates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). However, given that the orthologous rice and sugarcane <italic>SUT1</italic> genes do not appear to function in phloem loading, the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of maize SUT1 in phloem loading is suspect. To test the hypothesis that the maize SUT1 protein functions in phloem loading, a <italic>sut1</italic> mutant was isolated. Here, the effects of the mutation on plant growth, leaf carbohydrate accumulation, and <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose export from leaves are reported, and the role of SUT1 in phloem loading of sucrose in maize leaves is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant growth conditions</title><p>Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) plants were grown in a greenhouse supplemented with sodium vapour and metal halide lamps at 1400 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> under a 16 h day (30 &#x000b0;C) and 8 h night (20 &#x000b0;C).

Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of <italic>SUT1</italic> RNA was examined using primers located in the 3&#x02032; end of the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Expression of <italic>SUT1</italic> was strongly reduced in the <italic>sut1</italic> mutants compared to wild type.

This suggests that the transcript detected in <italic>sut1</italic> mutants using the 3&#x02032; primers may be due to initiation from a different site, such as within the transposon. To test this idea, RT-PCR was carried out using the same upstream-facing gene-specific primer with a second primer designed to the <italic>Mu</italic> element TIR. A product was obtained from <italic>SUT1</italic> mutants, but not from wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A, D</xref>).

Sequencing the <italic>sut1</italic> mutant 5&#x02032; RT-PCR product revealed an out-of-frame ATG in the <italic>Mu</italic> TIR located 268 bases upstream of the normal SUT1 translational start site (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern335/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

To investigate the basis for these phenotypes, the leaves of <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants were compared to wild-type siblings. <italic>sut1</italic> mutant leaves display a chlorotic/necrotic phenotype that progressively becomes more severe as the leaf emerges from the whorl. At maturity, leaves of <italic>sut1</italic> plants are strongly chlorotic throughout the leaf blade compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A, C</xref>). To determine if leaf chlorosis was associated with carbohydrate hyperaccumulation, the leaves were cleared of photosynthetic pigments and the tissue was stained for starch with IKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruzin, 1999</xref>). Wild-type leaves collected at 08.00 h had little starch whereas <italic>sut1</italic> mutant leaves stained strongly for starch throughout the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B, D</xref>).

Sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch were increased in mature leaves four, five, and six of <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants relative to wild type at both 08.00 h and 20.00 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A&#x02013;D</xref>). For the four different carbohydrates, at both time points, for leaves four, five, and six, the differences between <italic>sut1</italic> and wild type were highly significant in all cases (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.0001). Within either the wild-type or the <italic>sut1</italic> leaves, the levels of glucose, fructose, and starch were roughly similar in mature leaves four through six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B&#x02013;D</xref>). Sucrose levels in <italic>sut1</italic> gradually increased from leaf six to leaf four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The fold differences between the <italic>sut1</italic> and wild-type values were invariably greater at 08.00 h than at 20.00 h, for example, sucrose in leaf six was 12-fold higher at 08.00 h, but only 4.5-fold higher at 20.00 h, in leaf five, 15-fold at 08.00 h, but only 7-fold at 20.00 h, and in leaf four, 14-fold at 08.00 h, but only 7.8-fold at 20.00 h. However, as opposed to the mature leaves, the exposed tip of leaf seven contained similar carbohydrate levels in <italic>sut1</italic> and wild-type plants at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A&#x02013;D</xref>).

To investigate the effects of the loss of <italic>SUT1</italic> function on plant growth and development further, detailed phenotypic characterization of <italic>sut1</italic> mutant and wild-type plants was performed. Vegetative phenotypes in <italic>sut1</italic> mutants included reduced plant height and leaf number compared with wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Further, mutant leaves were smaller and showed premature senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). In addition, the retention of carbohydrates in the leaves was associated with decreased total biomass, a 36% reduction in shoot mass, a 59% reduction in root mass and an increased shoot-to-root ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A&#x02013;C, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Concomitant with the reduction in root mass, the elongation of prop roots was severely attenuated in <italic>sut1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Hence, loss of <italic>Sut1</italic> function is correlated with decreased plant vigour.</p><p>In addition to the vegetative phenotypes, the <italic>sut1</italic> mutation also conferred reproductive defects. Carbohydrate retention in <italic>sut1</italic> mutant leaves was associated with arrested tassel development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D&#x02013;F</xref>) and a failure to produce ears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Approximately 10% of the <italic>sut1</italic> mutants produced tassels with partially barren branches and limited spikelet development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). These stunted tassels yielded very reduced amounts of pollen and were delayed in anthesis by 14 d compared with wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). All of these phenotypes are presumably caused by the reduced export of sucrose from the leaves, resulting in increased carbohydrate retention within the leaves and decreased delivery to the developing sink tissues. Thus, <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants display strongly inhibited reproductive development as well as vegetative growth defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Cold-girdling wild-type plants results in leaf chlorosis and carbohydrate hyperaccumulation similar to <italic>sut1</italic> mutants</title><p>To investigate if a disruption in phloem loading is consistent with the observed chlorosis and carbohydrate hyperaccumulation seen in <italic>sut1</italic> mutant leaves, cold-girdling of wild-type B73 plants was performed. Cold-girdling dicot plants has been shown to block phloem transport and result in carbohydrate accumulation, down-regulation of photosynthesis, and leaf chlorosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krapp <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krapp and Stitt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schulz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).

However, the chlorotic leaves of girdled plants contained greatly elevated levels of starch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>).

Biochemical characterization showed that SUT1 possessed sucrose transport activity as well as H<sup>+</sup> and sucrose affinities consistent with its proposed role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carpaneto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). To determine the biological function of the maize <italic>SUT1</italic> gene <italic>in planta</italic>, a <italic>sut1</italic> homozygous mutant was isolated and characterized. It was found that <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants had carbohydrate hyperaccumulation in leaves and leaves that were chlorotic and prematurely senescent. In addition, <italic>sut1</italic> mutants had reduced growth, displayed altered biomass partitioning and impaired reproductive development. All of these phenotypes are consistent with a defect caused by a failure to transport sucrose from the photosynthetic cells into the phloem. Exogenous <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose application confirmed that sucrose export was greatly retarded in <italic>sut1</italic> mutant leaves compared with the wild type, supporting this hypothesis. Furthermore, these phenotypes are similar to those reported in dicot plants mutant for the <italic>SUT1</italic>-type gene that functions in phloem loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Riesmeier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">K&#x000fc;hn <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">B&#x000fc;rkle <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gottwald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hackel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In particular, the defect in <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose export observed in maize <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants is virtually identical to that reported for <italic>Atsuc2</italic> mutant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gottwald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Hence, together with the previous work, the <italic>in vivo</italic> characterization of the <italic>sut1</italic> mutant indicates a critical function for the maize SUT1 protein in loading sucrose into the phloem in leaves for export to sink tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Different roles of closely related grass SUT1 proteins</title><p>The SUT1 protein from sugarcane did not localize to the phloem, indicating it does not function in phloem loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rae <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Further, antisense RNA suppression of the <italic>SUT1</italic> gene in rice did not produce a phloem loading-related phenotype in leaves, suggesting that, at least in rice, SUT1 does not function in leaves to load sucrose into the phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scofield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, mutation of the maize <italic>SUT1</italic> gene produced a phloem loading-related phenotype in mature leaves. There are several possible explanations for why a defect in phloem loading may have been observed in maize but not in rice. First, rice <italic>SUT1</italic> is expressed at low levels in source leaves in comparison to the maize <italic>SUT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirose <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), so, as previously suggested, it may not have a predominant role in phloem loading in rice. Second, genetic redundancy may mask any phenotype in the rice antisense <italic>SUT1</italic> lines, since two other closely related rice <italic>SUT</italic>s, <italic>SUT3</italic> and <italic>SUT5</italic>, are more highly expressed in source leaves than <italic>SUT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). A third possibility is that the reduction in gene expression achieved using antisense RNA expression in rice was insufficient to eliminate <italic>SUT1</italic> function. However, this explanation is unlikely as some transgenic lines displayed less than 10% of wild-type transcript levels and others had only 1.4% of the wild-type level of SUT1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scofield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In contrast to the rice antisense lines, the maize <italic>sut1</italic> mutation is a presumed null allele that eliminates gene function based on the 5&#x02032; end of the transcript containing a portion of the <italic>Mu</italic> transposon and encoding an out-of-frame, non-functional protein if translated. Thus, differences in expression and functional requirements in leaves suggest that the orthologous <italic>SUT1</italic> genes in grasses probably play different roles in maize, sugarcane and rice.</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotypes observed in <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants are very likely caused by mutation of <italic>SUT1</italic></title><p>As previously noted, the phenotypes of <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants closely resemble the phenotypes reported in dicot plants that lack a SUT responsible for phloem loading. In addition, the novel phenotype of secreted sugar droplets observed on <italic>sut1</italic> mutant leaves was phenocopied by cold-girdling wild-type leaves (see below). Moreover, this phenotype is unique to the <italic>sut1</italic> mutant as many other independent maize mutants that accumulate excess carbohydrates in their leaves have been characterized, yet they do not exude concentrated sucrose solution in their guttation fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Russin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinges <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Braun, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slewinski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Therefore, although it can not formally be excluded, it is highly improbable that the phenotypes observed in <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants are caused by an unrelated, closely linked mutation, rather than the <italic>Mu</italic> insertion identified within the <italic>SUT1</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Cold-girdling maize leaves phenocopies <italic>sut1</italic> mutants</title><p>Additional evidence for the maize SUT1 protein functioning in phloem loading of sucrose comes from cold-girdling experiments. Cold-girdling blocks the transport of assimilates in the phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krapp <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krapp and Stitt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schulz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Cold-girdling wild-type maize leaves produced a phenotype strongly resembling that seen in <italic>sut1</italic> mutant plants. Cold-girdled leaves became chlorotic and hyperaccumulated starch and soluble sugars, similar to the phenotypes reported in heat-girdled leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldschmidt and Huber, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeannette <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Moreover, it was found that inhibition of phloem loading using either genetic or physiological approaches resulted in an identical and novel phenotype of the secretion of a concentrated sugar solution in the guttation fluid. In the case of the <italic>sut1</italic> mutants, sucrose that normally would be loaded into the phloem for transport probably remained in the apoplastic space and was carried along the transpiration path to the hydathodes where the water evapourated, thereby concentrating the sugars. A similar outcome is proposed to have occurred in girdled leaves due to the inhibition of phloem transport in the sheath and stem. The similarity between the <italic>sut1</italic> mutant and phloem transport-inhibited leaf phenotypes supports the hypothesis that <italic>SUT1</italic> functions to load sucrose into the phloem in maize leaves.</p></sec><sec><title>Symplastic phloem loading in maize?</title><p>Although <italic>sut1</italic> mutants have a severe reduction in plant growth and fitness, they manage to produce a tassel and shed a small amount of pollen. This indicates that some sucrose is transported from the source leaves to the developing sink tissues to sustain their development. This was a somewhat surprising finding and may be explained by several alternatives. One explanation is that other maize <italic>SUT</italic>s may be expressed in source leaves and partially compensate for the loss of the <italic>SUT1</italic> function. A second possibility is that a symplastic pathway for sucrose entry into the phloem still operates in <italic>sut1</italic> mutants, even though the apoplastic path is no longer functional. Plasmodesmata are present at all cellular interfaces from the mesophyll cells to the phloem sieve elements in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botha, 2005</xref>). While the frequency of plasmodesmata is high between the bundle sheath cells and vascular parenchyma cells, it is low between the vascular parenchyma cells and companion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botha, 2005</xref>). However, these data suggest that a limited capability exists for symplastic sucrose movement into the phloem. In support of this possibility, dye labelling studies in maize and rice leaf blades have demonstrated symplastic transport between the vascular parenchyma cells and the phloem sieve elements, indicating that this route is functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botha, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Further support for this hypothesis was recently provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>. The authors found that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants lacking SUC2, the SUT1-type protein principally responsible for phloem loading, while debilitated, grew and had similar levels of photoassimilated carbon in phloem exudates compared to wild type. In addition, the mutants were unable to load exogenously applied sucrose, suggesting that sucrose entered into the phloem through symplastic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that a symplastic pathway may sustain sucrose entry into the phloem and distribution to developing sink tissues in the <italic>sut1</italic> mutant, albeit at a reduced capacity.</p><p>In summary, a role for the maize <italic>SUT1</italic> gene in phloem loading was demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Plants lacking <italic>SUT1</italic> function display a significant reduction in <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose export from leaves, hyperaccumulate carbohydrates in leaves, display the novel phenotype of exuding high concentrations of sugars in their guttation fluid, and are severely impaired in growth and development. These data suggest that maize requires the activity of SUT1 for efficient phloem loading of sucrose. This report presents the first demonstration of an essential function of a monocot <italic>SUT</italic> in phloem loading in leaves.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern335/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern335/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>.</bold> Molecular analyses of <italic>Mu1</italic> insertion in <italic>sut1</italic> allele.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern335/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>.</bold> Photograph of cold-girdling experimental set-up on a wild-type plant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="ern335_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ern335_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>IKI</term><def><p>iodine potassium iodide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>Mu</italic></term><def><p><italic>Mutator</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>SUT</italic></term><def><p><italic>sucrose transporter</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIR</term><def><p>terminal inverted repeat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TUSC</term><def><p>trait utility system for corn</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We thank Tony Omeis and Scott Harkcom for excellent plant care and Sally Assmann for the use of the Li-Cor 6400.
