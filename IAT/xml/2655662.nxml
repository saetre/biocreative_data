Both processes require communication at a distance along a DNA molecule and PepA is the major structural component of the nucleoprotein complexes that underlie this communication. Atomic Force Microscopy was used to analyze the architecture of PepA&#x000b7;<italic>carAB</italic> and PepA&#x000b7;<italic>cer</italic> site complexes. Contour length measurements, bending angle analyses and volume determinations demonstrate that the <italic>car</italic>P1 operator is foreshortened by &#x0223c;235 bp through wrapping around one PepA hexamer. The highly deformed part of the operator extends from slightly upstream of the &#x02013;35 hexamer of the <italic>car</italic>P1 promoter to just downstream of the IHF-binding site, and comprises the binding sites for the PurR and RutR transcriptional regulators. This extreme remodeling of the <italic>car</italic>P1 control region provides a straightforward explanation for the strict requirement of PepA in the establishment of pyrimidine and purine-specific repression of <italic>carAB</italic> transcription. We further provide a direct physical proof that PepA is able to synapse two <italic>cer</italic> sites in direct repeat in a large interwrapped nucleoprotein complex, likely comprising two PepA hexamers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aminopeptidase A (PepA) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (E.C.3.4.11.10) is a multifunctional protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It is a major aminopeptidase capable of digesting a broad range of peptides, with a preference for leucine or methionine as the N-terminal amino acid. Interestingly, PepA (alias XerB and CarP) turned out to be also a DNA-binding protein involved in two distinct cellular processes, site-specific DNA recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In both processes, the catalytic activity of PepA is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>PepA plays a crucial role in both pyrimidine and purine-specific repression of the upstream promoter P1 of the <italic>carAB</italic> operon encoding carbamoyl phosphate synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Binding of PepA upstream to the <italic>car</italic>P1 promoter of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> protects two &#x0223c;27-bp long stretches against DNase I digestion, but also induces a large number of regularly spaced hyperreactive sites, indicative of minor groove widening by DNA distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). PepA is an essential element in the regulation of <italic>car</italic>P1 activity but integration host factor (IHF), PyrH (UMP-kinase), PurR (purine repressor) and RutR, recently identified as the regulator of pyrimidine utilization, are required as well for the full range modulation of promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). Furthermore, PepA binds to the control region of its own gene, suggestive of negative autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic view of the <italic>carAB</italic> control region showing the <italic>car</italic>P1 and <italic>car</italic>P2 promoters, the binding sites for the various regulatory and architectural proteins, and the size and the borders of the fragments used in the AFM study.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1078f1"/></fig></p><p>PepA is also required in the process of the monomerization of ColE1 and pSC101 plasmid multimers formed by homologous recombination. This reaction helps to ensure stable plasmid inheritance. PepA binds to the ColE1 <italic>cer</italic> and pSC101 <italic>psi</italic> sites, and in conjunction with ArgR (arginine repressor) and ArcA (anaerobic response regulator), respectively, ensures that the recombination is exclusively intramolecular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). PepA and ArgR/ArcA bind to &#x0223c;180-bp long accessory sequences adjacent to the 28&#x02013;30-bp core site where the sequential strand exchange reactions are performed by the related XerC and XerD recombinases, members of the tyrosine family of recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). PepA and ArgR/ArcA are required to bring together two <italic>cer</italic>/<italic>psi</italic> sites in direct repeat in the multimer to form an interwrapped synaptic complex. PepA is clearly the major architectural element in this process; ArgR/ArcA stimulate the recombination reaction, but are dispensable <italic>in vitro</italic>, when the PepA concentration is sufficiently high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). XerC and XerD also act at the <italic>E. coli dif</italic> site to resolve dimers of the chromosome; but in this case, recombination is controlled by the cell division protein FtsK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of PepA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and mutant studies have provided some clues to the mode of action of this multifunctional protein that bears none of the well-characterized DNA-binding motives. The hexamer (6 &#x000d7; 55 kDa) is organized as a dimer of trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). Each subunit comprises a smaller N-terminal domain (residues 1&#x02013;166) that is connected to a larger C-terminal domain (residues 193&#x02013;503) through a long &#x003b1;-helix. The C-terminal domains cluster around the 3-fold axis and form the core of the enzyme. The catalytic site and the two metal-ion-binding sites are entirely comprised within this core. The N-terminal domains extend outwards to the corners of the triangle. They mediate interactions between the two trimers in the vicinity of the 2-fold axes and play an important role in DNA binding, as indicated by mutant studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). From the crystal structure and the charge distribution on the surface of hexameric PepA, it has also been proposed that a groove, running over the surface of the C-terminal core of the hexamer, would act as a DNA-binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Mutant studies have corroborated this proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Combined, these data strongly suggest that PepA acts in <italic>carAB</italic> regulation and site-specific DNA recombination as the major architectural protein that induces severe DNA deformations required for the elaboration of higher order nucleoprotein structures. However, the DNA-binding mode of PepA is unusual and not well characterized, and the molecular architecture of the regulatory and recombining complexes, including their stoichiometry is not yet solved. Here we use a single molecule approach to analyze PepA&#x000b7;DNA complexes formed with the <italic>carAB</italic> control region and the ColE1 <italic>cer</italic> site. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to unravel the architecture of these complexes. AFM allows the detection of DNA deformations such as bending, wrapping and spooling, quantification of the bending angle and DNA compaction, and in some instances the determination of the stoichiomety of protein&#x000b7;DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Interestingly, the single-molecule approach also provides insights to the flexibility of protein&#x000b7;DNA complexes through the distribution of the bending angles and the degree of the DNA foreshortening. In recent years the technique has been applied in the study of several nucleoprotein complexes involved in transcription and transcription regulation and in other DNA transactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Overexpression and purification of PepA</title><p>PepA was purified from an IPTG-induced culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> strain JM101 transformed with the plasmid pKHW1, as described by Devroede <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of DNA samples</title><p>The DNA molecules used in the AFM experiments were produced by PCR amplification using the ReadyMix TaqPCR reaction mix (Sigma-Aldrich).

The 642-bp fragment spanning the <italic>carAB</italic> control region was generated with the same template and the oligonucleotides AB1Bam and DC381r (5&#x02032;-GCTTGGCTGCAGGTCGAAATTCG-3&#x02032;). The 2050-bp 2<italic>cer</italic> fragment and the 1640-bp 1<italic>cer</italic> fragment were generated with plasmid pGIC009 (provided by B.

All oligonucleotides used in this work were purchased from Sigma Genosys.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample preparation for AFM</title><p>DNA molecules were diluted in binding buffer (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.9), 125 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM DTT, 25% glycerol) in a total volume of 15 &#x000b5;l. The diluted DNA was then mixed with an equal volume of adsorption buffer [40 mM Hepes (pH 6.87), 10 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O] and 15 &#x000b5;l were deposited on freshly cleaved mica. After 5 min of adsorption, the samples were rinsed with deionized ultrapure water. Subsequently, excess water was blotted off with absorbing paper and finally the mica was blown dry in a stream of filtered air. PepA&#x000b7;DNA complexes were formed by incubating 25&#x02013;35 ng of PepA with about 200 ng of DNA in the binding buffer in a total volume of 15 &#x000b5;l at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min. Sample deposition was as described above for DNA molecules, allowing 3&#x02013;5 min of adsorption.</p></sec><sec><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>Images of 512 &#x000d7; 512 pixels were acquired with a NanoScope IIIa atomic force microscope (Digital Instruments/Veeco) operating in tapping mode at room temperature. We used Nanoprobe SPM tips, type TESP (Veeco), with a 125 &#x000b5;m cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 50 N m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and resonance frequencies in the range from 279 to 362 kHz. The scan rate was 2 Hz and the scan size was 1.5 &#x000b5;m &#x000d7; 1.5 &#x000b5;m. All images used in one analysis were obtained with the same tip and deposition, and all the contour length and bending angle measurements were carried out with the same procedure. The NanoScope 6.11r1 software (Digital Instruments/Veeco) was used to flatten the images prior to analysis. Molecules were manually traced using ImageJ (25; available at rbs.info.nih.gov/ij/) to measure contour lengths and end-to-end distances. Contour length histograms were fitted to a normal distribution (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). The persistence lengths (<italic>P</italic>) were calculated from the experimentally measured contour lengths (<italic>L</italic>) and the end-to-end distances (<italic>R</italic>) according to the formula: &#x0003c;<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; <sub>2D</sub> = 4<italic>PL</italic> [1 &#x02013; 2<italic>P</italic>/<italic>L</italic>(1 &#x02212; <italic>e</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic><sup>L</sup></italic><sup>/2</sup><italic><sup>P</sup></italic>)]. Bending angle analysis was performed by applying the Bending Analysis Software (26; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.nat.vu.nl/compl/bendinganalysis">www.nat.vu.nl/compl/bendinganalysis</ext-link>). The bin sizes were chosen using the following formula as a guideline: optimal bin size is equal to the ratio of the range of measurements over the square root of the number of measurements. The apparent volume of the globular PepA&#x000b7;<italic>carAB</italic> operator complexed regions was calculated as follows: <italic>V</italic><sub>app</sub> = <italic>&#x003c0;</italic> &#x000d7; height &#x000d7; (width)<sup>2</sup>/6, assuming that the complexed regions have the shape of an oblate spheroid. The width was measured at a height of 0.5 nm as a correction for the height of the DNA molecule and the background. The apparent volume of the two-lobe PepA&#x000b7;2<italic>cer</italic> complexes were calculated as follows: <italic>V</italic><sub>app</sub> = 3<italic>&#x003c0;abc</italic>/4, with <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic> the lengths of the semiaxes, assuming that they have an ellipsoidal shape. Volumes were also determined by the integration of the intensity of all the pixels composing the image, using a software developed for scanning probe microscopy (WSxM 4.0 Develop12.5 available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nanotec.es/wsxm_download.html">http://www.nanotec.es/wsxm_download.html</ext-link>). Both methods generated very similar data. Apparent volumes measured by AFM deviate significantly from the real volume and AFM images of soft biomolecules appear usually wider (because of tip convolution) and less high (because of interactions between the tip and the surface) than the sample itself. Therefore, only measurements from a single deposition and using the same tip can be used, and exclusively in a comparative manner. All calculated mean values are given with the standard deviation. The experimentally determined basepair rise for each fragment was systematically used to convert distances measured in nanometers into basepairs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Visualization of bare DNA molecules</title><p>Four DNA fragments, two comprising the <italic>carAB</italic> operator, one carrying a single ColE1 <italic>cer</italic> site, and one carrying two <italic>cer</italic> sites in direct repeat were used for the analysis of PepA&#x000b7;DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The 578-bp long B1&#x02013;B2 fragment extends 428-bp upstream and 149-bp downstream of the <italic>car</italic>P1 transcription initiation site. It contains both promoters of the <italic>carAB</italic> operon and the binding sites for IHF, PepA, RutR, PurR and ArgR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). The B1-DC381 fragment of 642 bp has the same upstream border, but extends further downstream, into the vector sequence.

The contour length (<italic>L</italic>) of the DNA molecules was measured by tracing along the length of the molecule from one end to the other using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Only non-overlapping molecules were measured and visible anomalies were excluded from the analysis. The data were plotted in a histogram and a Gaussian fit was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The results for all four fragments are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

These complexes have a large, globular shaped structure and a sharp angle between the in- and outgoing DNA arms of the complexed region. Furthermore, the naked DNA part is visibly shortened as compared to the bare DNA molecules. These observations strongly suggest DNA wrapping. To analyze the DNA deformations induced by PepA more quantitatively, we measured the contour length of these molecules. The contour length of globular protein&#x000b7;DNA complexes can be measured in two manners: the &#x02018;visible length&#x02019; and the &#x02018;read-through&#x02019; length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). The visible contour length corresponds to the sum of the length of the two naked DNA arms; this might result in an underestimation of the length because of the &#x02018;shadow&#x02019; of the protein causing a partial occlusion of the naked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The read-through length corresponds to the contour length measured along the naked DNA arms and the shortest path through the complexed region; this could result in an overestimation of the length of the naked DNA when the entry and exit points of the DNA arms are distant. The histograms with the distribution of the read-through and visible contour lengths for complexes formed with the 578-bp and the 642-bp <italic>carAB</italic> fragments are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c&#x02013;f). We measured the read-through contour length of 150 and 156 complexes formed with the 578-bp and 642-bp fragments, respectively. A Gaussian fit was applied and it yielded an average contour length of 107 nm (SD 18.2) for the 578-bp fragment and 137 nm (SD 17.5) for the 642-bp fragment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This indicates that the binding of PepA to the <italic>carAB</italic> control region results in a massive apparent reduction of the contour length, &#x0223c;74 and 70 nm, respectively, which corresponds to &#x0223c;239 and 219 bp. The average total visible length of the complexes formed with the 578-bp and the 642-bp fragment was 94 nm (SD 15) and 125 nm (SD 13.2), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), which indicates a foreshortening of the PepA-bound DNA by &#x0223c;87 nm (&#x0223c;280 bp) and 83 nm (&#x0223c;259 bp). Taking into account that the read-through and visible length methods may lead to an under- and overestimation of the calculated foreshortening, respectively, we may reasonably estimate that PepA binding induces an apparent reduction in length of the <italic>carAB</italic> operator DNA of &#x0223c;235 bp, likely by wrapping around a single PepA hexamer (see below). The length of the in- and outgoing arms of the complexes was plotted in a single histogram with a bimodal distribution that was fitted with two Gaussians. This resulted in two peaks corresponding to an average length of the individual arms of 37 nm (SD 8.5) (&#x0223c;121 bp) and 56 nm (SD 9.8) (181 bp) for the 578-bp fragment; 46 nm (SD 8.7) (&#x0223c;143 bp) and 78 nm (SD 9.7) (&#x0223c;244 bp) for the 642-bp fragment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that the wrapped part of the operator extends approximately from positions &#x02013;280 to &#x02013;60, upstream of the start of <italic>car</italic>P1 transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). The difference in length between the long arms of the complexes formed with the two DNA fragments corresponds almost precisely to the difference in length of the two fragments. Given that they share the same upstream border, we may conclude that the short arm of the complexes corresponds to the upstream part of the operator and the long arm to the downstream, promoter proximal part of the operator. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview AFM image of PepA binding to the 642-bp <italic>carAB</italic> fragment B1-DC381.

Furthermore, the results can only be used in a comparative manner and have to be interpreted with caution. Taking these precautions into account, several authors were able to establish a relationship between the protein volume measured by AFM and the molecular mass of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34 B35">31&#x02013;35</xref>). To determine the stoichiometry of the PepA&#x000b7;<italic>carAB</italic> operator complexes, we performed volume analyses on these complexes and on free hexameric PepA molecules (same deposition and tip). Both the free and the DNA-bound protein molecules have a similar and very regular appearance. Therefore, we calculated their volume assuming that they resemble an oblate spheroid (see Materials and methods section). From the distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), we obtained an average apparent volume of 2434 nm<sup>3</sup> (SD 620) for DNA-bound PepA molecules (144 molecules analyzed), and 2577 nm<sup>3</sup> (SD 500) for the free PepA hexamers (36 molecules). Hence, both volumes are very similar and, therefore, we may conclude that a single PepA hexamer binds to the <italic>carAB</italic> control region and wraps &#x0223c;235 bp of the operator. At first sight, it may seem surprising that wrapped DNA does not lead to a significant increase in the volume of bound PepA molecules, but this was previously observed with the archaeal transcriptional regulator Ss-LrpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) that wraps about 100 bp. Apart from the limitations of the technique already mentioned above, additional factors such as docking of DNA stretches into grooves on the surface of the protein, might contribute to the observed absence of increase in volume upon significant increase in mass. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>)Histograms of the volume analyses of unbound and DNA-bound (B1-DC381 fragment) PepA molecules, with an overlay of a normal distribution curve.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1078f5"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>PepA induces wrapping and looping-out with two <italic>cer</italic> sites in direct repeat</title><p>Binding of PepA to the 2050-bp 2<italic>cer</italic> fragment resulted in the formation of different classes of complexes with a distinct shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The simple &#x02018;linear&#x02019; types, showing one or two globular regions, likely represent molecules with respectively one and two <italic>cer</italic> sites bound by individual PepA hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a). Most interestingly, however, are the complexes exhibiting a large DNA loop, that could be observed consistently with the 2<italic>cer</italic> fragment, and only with the 2<italic>cer</italic> fragment (see below). They constitute about two-third of the non-entangled PepA-bound molecules. These complexes likely represent single DNA molecules in which the two <italic>cer</italic> sites in direct repeat are brought together in an interwrapped synaptic complex. A gallery of such complexes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b (flattened presentation) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c (tilted surface plots to emphasize the topography). They consist of a prominent globular region, with an irregular and apparently two-lobe shape (see also below: stoichiometry of PepA&#x000b7;2<italic>cer</italic> complexes), from which protrude a DNA loop of constant size, and two short asymmetric in- and outgoing DNA arms that exit the globular complex on opposite sides. The two arms were not always discernible; in many instances one arm was not visible, likely due to the particular orientation of these molecules on the mica surface, and the bulkiness of the globular region. The contour length of the loop from 60 PepA&#x000b7;2<italic>cer</italic> complexes was measured. The data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>d resulted in an average loop length of 310 nm (SD 44.1), which corresponds to &#x0223c;942 bp. The average contour length of the longest arm was 59 nm (SD 15.0) or &#x0223c;179 bp, whereas the shortest arm was 33 nm (SD 7.1) or &#x0223c;100 bp long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>e). However, since the position of the two <italic>cer</italic> sites with respect to the limits of the fragment is very similar, we cannot assign a particular arm length to the upstream or downstream border of the fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). Therefore, the two alternatives are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b. Altogether this results in a total visible length of 403 nm or &#x0223c;1221 bp, which in turn indicates an impressive apparent reduction of the DNA contour length (&#x0223c;275 nm or 833 bp). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) AFM images of two linear 2<italic>cer</italic> DNA fragments with one and two complexed regions, respectively.

We measured the height and the short and long axis of these ellipsoidal structures and calculated their volume (see Materials and methods section). For the free PepA hexamer (28 molecules, determined from the same deposition), we obtained an average apparent volume of 2580 nm<sup>3</sup> (SD 605) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>f). The histogram of looped DNA-bound PepA molecules suggests a bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>g). Non-linear least-square fitting of the cumulative density function with two Gaussians (data not shown) indeed results in two normal distributions, one with an amplitude of 0.17 and a mean of 2820 nm<sup>3</sup>, and the second one with an amplitude of 0.83 and a mean of 4230 nm<sup>3</sup>. This indicates that 17% of the complexes have a volume close to that of a single PepA hexamer. They likely represent DNA molecules bound at one <italic>cer</italic> site only, forming an apparent loop by random DNA crossing, as also observed with the 1<italic>cer</italic> fragment (see below). In contrast, 83% of the complexes show a significantly higher volume, almost double that of a free PepA molecule, suggesting the binding of two PepA hexamers. Furthermore, the volume analysis of a limited set of linear 2<italic>cer</italic>&#x000b7;PepA complexes (25 molecules) indicated an average volume of 2291 nm<sup>3</sup> (SD 944). Volume analysis based on the integration of the intensity of pixels pointed to the same conclusions (data not shown).

The PepA-induced foreshortening is huge in comparison to the amount of DNA that is condensed in several other prokaryotic transcriptional or regulatory complexes, but more similar to the nucleosomal DNA (&#x0223c;150 bp) that is wound &#x0223c;1.65 times around the octameric histone core (&#x0223c;110 kDa) (&#x0223c;200 bp including the linker histone H1). For instance, <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase (&#x0223c;460 kDa) and some smaller bacterial and archaeal Lrp-like transcriptional regulators wrap about 100 bp only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Molecular modeling by Reijns <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) indicates that about &#x0223c;70 bp could occupy a single C-terminal groove and its two flanking N-terminal DNA-binding sites. Based on the triangular shape of the hexameric PepA crystal structure with an edge length of about &#x0223c;135 &#x000c5; and a thickness of &#x0223c;80 &#x000c5;, a minimum of 49 nm (144 bp) of DNA would be required to make a single tight wrap. This is considerably shorter than the &#x0223c;235-bp foreshortening of the <italic>carAB</italic> operator by wrapping around a single PepA hexamer. Yet, it appears unlikely that the operator would make two full turns around PepA. Rather, we propose the existence of regions of tight interactions (N-terminal binding sites and C-terminal grooves) connected by loops that are in loose contacts, containing the binding sites for various transcriptional regulators involved in <italic>carAB</italic> regulation. Such architecture is quite different from the nucleosome structure where about 140 hydrogen bonds provide the driving force for the tight and regular wrapping of the DNA around the octameric histone core.</p><p>Why does <italic>carAB</italic> regulation rely on such a pronounced remodeling of the operator region? Possibly, the rationale for this mechanism is to be found in the multitude of transcriptional regulators involved in the modulation of <italic>car</italic>P1 promoter activity. There is evidently not enough space to bind all these proteins in the immediate vicinity of the RNA polymerase binding site, unless the various binding sites would largely overlap, which might create a problem of binding specificity. Furthermore, the promoter region must also integrate a TTT stretch involved in uracil-sensitive reiterative transcription initiation control (stuttering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), and a discriminator box involved in stringent control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>Previously we have shown that the binding of PepA to the <italic>carAB</italic> control region of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> induces a large number of regularly spaced sites hyperreactive for DNase I spreading over nearly 200 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This zone is almost completely comprised within the wrapped part of the operator as determined in this work by AFM imaging of PepA&#x000b7;<italic>carAB</italic> operator complexes. The downstream borders determined by the two techniques coincide very well, whereas the upstream border of the wrapped region extends farther upstream in the AFM technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). The entire <italic>carAB</italic> control region is extremely A + T rich and contains numerous stretches of four or more consecutive A or T residues. When aligned in phase with the periodicity of the DNA helix, such stretches impose an intrinsic bending of the DNA which in turn would reduce the energetic cost for the pronounced PepA-induced deformations of this region.</p><p>Based on our AFM imaging, DNase I footprinting and PepA mutant studies, we propose a model for PepA-induced wrapping of the <italic>carAB</italic> control region that is based on one of the models previously proposed for the formation of the synaptic complex involved in <italic>cer</italic>/Xer recombination (20; see also below). In this model two DNA stretches directly interact with two of the three composite binding zones present on the PepA hexamer. Each DNA binding path is composed of a C-terminal groove segment and the corresponding N-terminal edges of the triangular PepA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a). The third path would not be contacted since the groove and the DNA run in opposite directions. In this model, the intervening DNA, comprising the PUR box is looped out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a). This looping is at least compatible with the occurrence of PepA induced hyperreactive for DNase I in the PUR box and the immediate flanking sequences. The simultaneous binding of PepA and PurR has to be guaranteed since <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments indicated that the PurR-dependent repression of P1 activity is completely abolished in a <italic>pepA</italic> mutant, and that activated PurR is unable to repress P1 activity in a single round <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription system containing purified PurR and RNA polymerase but no PepA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Therefore, PurR relies on PepA to exert its regulatory effect and the PepA-dependent remodeling of the operator appears to be required to bring PurR in the vicinity of the RNA polymerase. Notice that a similar situation prevails for the binding of ArgR and ArcA to the <italic>cer</italic> and <italic>psi</italic> sites of the ColE1 and pSC101 plasmids, respectively. The position of the binding site for these regulators implies that ArgR and ArcA should also be able to bind the plectonemic interwrapped PepA&#x000b7;DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). ArgR and ArcA are required <italic>in vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vitro</italic> they stimulate the recombination reaction. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Cartoon presentation of PepA&#x000b7;DNA complexes.

In this model, two <italic>cer</italic> sites and the flanking region (colored in green and magenta) are brought together by two PepA hexamers.

Two crossings of the DNA are trapped on two of the three faces of the hexameric PepA triangle. A single hexameric ArgR molecule might contribute to the stabilization of the bend.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1078f8"/></fig></p><p>In contrast, it was recently suggested but not proven, that the binding of the novel RutR regulator, far upstream of the P1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a), would inhibit the binding of PepA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). RutR (b1013) belongs to the TetR family of transcriptional regulators and was shown to stimulate <italic>car</italic>P1 activity in a uracil-sensitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, the pyrimidine-specific regulation of <italic>car</italic>P1 can not only be governed by an antagonistic binding of RutR and PepA. <italic>In vivo</italic> assays indicate that pyrimidine-dependent modulation of <italic>car</italic>P1 activity is reduced but not abolished in a &#x025b5;<italic>rutR</italic> mutant (11; unpublished observations from this laboratory) and, furthermore, UMP kinase, the essential <italic>pyrH</italic> product, is involved in the control of <italic>car</italic>P1 activity as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Binding of PyrH to the <italic>carAB</italic> operator DNA has not been demonstrated, but mutant studies and the local charge distribution on the surface of the PepA and PyrH hexamers suggest the possibility of recruitment of PyrH by protein&#x02013;protein contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). These protein&#x02013;protein contacts would distinguish the mode of action of PepA in transcriptional control from its role in site-specific DNA recombination. In this context it is worth noticing that different selection strategies have provided single amino-acid substitution mutants of <italic>pepA</italic> that are still proficient for ColE1 dimer resolution, but deficient in transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The corresponding proteins still bind the <italic>carAB</italic> control region and the <italic>cer</italic> site, but are unable to repress <italic>car</italic>P1 activity. Furthermore, hybrid PepA proteins bearing parts of the homologous protein from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> or <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> were able to complement an <italic>E. coli pepA</italic> knock-out mutant for the resolution reaction, but not for <italic>carAB</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Therefore, there is definitely more to the role of PepA in transcriptional control than simply DNA binding and remodeling of the operator DNA, even though this is clearly a crucial element for the elaboration of the higher order structures required for both the purine and pyrimidine-specific regulation. Further work is required to unravel all the protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;DNA cross-talks and the detailed architecture of the corresponding complexes involved in <italic>carAB</italic> regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Stoichiometry and models of synaptic PepA&#x000b7;<italic>cer</italic> complexes</title><p>Like many other DNA recombination reactions, XerCD recombination at <italic>cer in vivo</italic> shows an absolute requirement for <italic>trans</italic>- and <italic>cis</italic>-acting accessory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These accessory but essential elements promote the formation of a specific topological complex that imposes constraints on the recombination reaction catalyzed by XerCD, ensuring that only directly repeated sites on a plasmid dimer will be recombined efficiently. Other recombination reactions catalyzed by serine and tyrosine recombinases use small DNA-binding proteins (such as IHF or FIS), additional but catalytically inactive copies of the recombinase molecules, and/or the geometry of the complex to sense the topology of the DNA and to enhance the reaction rate (41 and references therein).</p><p>Several models, with a different stoichiometry have been proposed for the synaptic <italic>cer</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The most recent models, based on the identification of the DNA-binding path as identified by <italic>pepA</italic> mutant studies propose: (i) an adaptation of the Str&#x000e4;ter model that contains two PepA hexamers and (ii) a novel model in which two <italic>cer</italic> sites are wrapped around a single PepA hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>b and c). In the adapted Str&#x000e4;ter model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>b), each <italic>cer</italic> site interacts with the N-terminal DNA-binding paths and passes through two C-terminal grooves, one on each PepA hexamer. Thus, the two sites wrap around each other just enough to form an antiparallel synaptic complex and to account for the product topology of XerCD recombination, a 4-node catenane. In the novel model with a different stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>c), two plectonemic DNA crossings are trapped on two faces of a single triangular PepA hexamer, whereas the third face would be occupied by the heterotetrameric XerCD recombinase. Even though the latter model has the preference of the authors in the Reijns paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), both models are largely consistent with the published footprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and could not yet be discerned in the absence of data on the stoichiometry of the synaptic complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Although the volume measurement by AFM have to be interpreted with caution, both the shape and the volume of the PepA&#x000b7;<italic>cer</italic> complexes suggest the presence of two PepA hexamers in the interwrapped synaptic complexes. Indeed, linear complexes formed with the 2<italic>cer</italic> and 1<italic>cer</italic> fragment do not show the bi-lobe shape and have a significantly lower volume than that of the looped structure, close to that of a free hexameric PepA molecule. Therefore, our data corroborate the adapted Str&#x000e4;ter model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>b) rather than the single PepA hexamer model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>c). Furthermore, and even though the measurements of free DNA parts may lead to an underestimation of the non-bound regions, the impressive foreshortening of the DNA in the PepA&#x000b7;2<italic>cer</italic> complexes (&#x0223c;800 bp) also indicates a complex path for the DNA in the synaptic complex that is more compatible with the wrapping around two PepA hexamers, rather than one. The adapted Str&#x000e4;ter model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>b shows one ArgR hexamer sandwiched in between two PepA hexamers. Our results and previous mutant studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) indicate that two complexed regions may assemble in the absence of ArgR, by protein&#x02013;protein contact between two PepA molecules, as observed in the &#x003c7;-like structures, or much more stably, by the interwrapping of two DNA segments around two PepA hexamers, possibly accompanied by protein&#x02013;protein contacts, as in the looped PepA&#x000b7;2<italic>cer</italic> structures. Therefore, ArgR does not appear to be absolutely required for the formation of the synaptic complex.</p><p>The formation of a synaptic complex with PepA binding to two <italic>cer</italic> sites in direct repeat on a linear DNA fragment as demonstrated here does not automatically imply that this complex would be a good substrate for XerCD-mediated recombination. Indeed supercoiling appears to be a supplementary requirement for efficient dimer resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Research-Foundation-Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen G.044.02, G.0429.06), Reseach Council of the Brussels University (OZR835), Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie.
