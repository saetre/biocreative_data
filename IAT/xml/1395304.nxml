During endochondral ossification, the transcription factors Sox9, Sox5 and/or Sox6 are expressed and are involved in the induction of chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Chondrocytes in the growth plate are subsequently induced to exit the cell cycle and commit to terminal differentiation. The prehypertrophic chondrocytes mature into hypertrophic chondrocytes, which lay down a matrix rich in Collagen X, and secrete VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. VEGF promotes the invasion of blood vessels from the perichondrium, bringing in both the bone forming osteoblasts and the bone resorbing osteoclasts. The hypertrophic chondrocytes then undergo apoptosis, and are replaced by trabecular bone and bone marrow. In contrast, the flat bones of the skull, the frontal and parietal bones, form by intramembranous ossification. Cranial mesenchymal cells directly differentiate into osteoblasts that initiate mineralization and secrete an extracellular matrix rich in Collagen I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Growth of these calvarial bones occurs through proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts at the margins or sutures. The molecular pathways that dictate these alternative ossification programs are not yet well defined. In particular, it is not known whether intramembranous ossification is prespecified by the ontogeny of the cranial mesenchyme or is a response to local environmental signals.</p><p>Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) appear to be important for both types of ossification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. FGFs comprise a large family of proteins that includes at least 22 known members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. FGFs bind and signal through low and high affinity FGF receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The four known high affinity receptors (FGFR1&#x02013;4) are structurally similar transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. During intramembranous ossification of the flat bones, FGFR1&#x02013;3 are expressed by the differentiating osteoblasts at the osteogenic fronts and also by the adjacent cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. FGFR1 is expressed in cells close to and within the osteoid; FGFR2 is expressed in the proliferating osteogenic stem cells; FGFR3 expression is seen in the thin layer of cartilage underlying the lower part of the coronal suture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As FGFR3 null mice do not show defects in calvarial development, it has been hypothesized that intramembranous bone formation is controlled primarily by FGFR1 and FGFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 in humans that affect skeletal growth are consistent with this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Craniosynostosis is mainly associated with mutations in FGFR1 and FGFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Mutations that affect the growth of long bones resulting in syndromes such as Achondroplasia (Ach) and Thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) are mainly localized to FGFR3. These autosomal dominant disorders are believed to reflect either an enhancement of receptor activity or a neomorphic gain-of-function effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. During long bone development, FGF receptors are expressed in the epiphyseal growth plates: FGFR3 is expressed in the proliferating chondrocytes; FGFR1 is expressed in the hypertrophic chondrocytes; FGFR1 and FGFR2 are expressed in the perichondrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. FGFR2 is expressed in early mesenchymal condensates and in the periosteal collar around the cartilage models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Targeted deletion of FGFR2IIIc suggests that FGFR2IIIc is a positive regulator of ossification in both the osteoblasts and chondrocytic lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Targeted deletion of FGFR3 results in mice that show overgrowth of the long bones and abnormal proliferation of chondrocytes suggesting that FGFR3 stimulation inhibits chondrocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These studies describe roles for FGF receptor-mediated signaling during differentiation/maturation of chondrocytes.</p><p>The roles of FGF ligands in skeletal development are unclear. During calvarial development, <italic>Fgf8 </italic>is expressed in the osteoblasts; <italic>Fgf2 </italic>and <italic>Fgf4 </italic>are expressed in the sutural mesenchyme; <italic>Fgf18 </italic>is initially expressed in the cranial mesenchymal cells and later, in the differentiating osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>Fgf9 </italic>is expressed in the sutural mesenchyme and is upregulated in the endocranial portions of the mesenchyme and is downregulated during postnatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The specific in vivo functions of these different FGFs remain undefined. In vitro, cephalic neural crest cells from quail embryos have been shown to respond to exogenous FGF-2 in a dose dependant manner; lower doses induce proliferation and higher doses induce cartilage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. During long bone development, at the time of initiation of endochondral differentiation, <italic>Fgf9 </italic>is expressed in the condensing mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>Fgf2</italic>, <italic>Fgf5</italic>, <italic>Fgf6 </italic>and <italic>Fgf7 </italic>are expressed in loose mesenchyme outside the condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, mice lacking these Fgfs show no apparent defects in skeletal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Functional redundancy between these FGFs may, in part, account for the lack of phenotype. Therefore, roles for these Fgfs in the early stages of chondrogenesis have not yet been defined.</p><p>In this study, we have analyzed transgenic mice that express FGF9 in their cranial mesenchymal cells. These mice show abnormal head development and are born with a pronounced bulge in their skulls. Skeletal preparations of these mice revealed dramatic changes in parietal bone formation. In the region where the parietal bones normally form, cranial mesenchymal cells are induced to differentiate into chondrocytes that proliferate, hypertrophy and subsequently differentiate as bone. Correlative changes in expression of marker genes <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Col2a1</italic>, <italic>Col10a1</italic>, <italic>Ihh</italic>, <italic>CbfaI </italic>and <italic>Osteocalcin </italic>occur in conjunction with the altered differentiation program. Thus the parietal bones in these mice form by endochondral ossification rather than by the usual intramembranous ossification route. Fate mapping studies indicate that the ectopic cartilagenous precursors in these mice are derived from the mesoderm. Based on these results we suggest that cranial mesenchymal cells are competent to initiate endochondral ossification, and can be switched to this alternative developmental program by ectopic expression, or overexpression, of FGF9.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Changes in cranial morphology in the FGF9 transgenic mice</title><p>Transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of a construct with the &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter linked to a mouse <italic>Fgf9 </italic>cDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

In the transgenic line OVE1070, in addition to lens defects, there were defects in the development of the skull (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref>). Mice in this family that are heterozygous for the transgene are born with 'dome-shaped' heads (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This phenotype is even more pronounced in homozygous transgenic mice (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Abnormal head development in the OVE1070 FGF9 transgenic mice.

The OVE1070 transgenic mice often show unfused eyelids at birth (C). (D-K) Skeletal preparations of the FGF9 transgenic mice reveal an expansion in the cartilage territory in the head region.

The skeletal preparations show a dramatic expansion of cartilage in the head region by E15 (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Parietal bone development was particularly affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and inset). At P3, the phenotypic differences between the nontransgenic and FGF9 transgenic mice were still pronounced. At this age, the calvarial skull in nontransgenic mice is mostly ossified except at the sutures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). In contrast, there is an expanded cartilage territory (blue) in the FGF9 transgenic mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). The transgenic mice also show a central hole in the skull where there is neither cartilage nor bone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, inset, arrow). Development of the occipital bones appeared normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and inset). At P10, the Alcian blue stained tissues in the transgenic cranium were interspersed with Alizarin red stained regions suggesting that the cartilage territory was being replaced by bony structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). By 1 month of age, the cartilage territory was completely replaced by bone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref> and inset).</p><p>The alterations in skeletal development in the FGF9 transgenic mice were examined at the histological level by analyses of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of the cranium. No distinctive differences in morphology were seen at E11 (data not shown). By E13, more cranial mesenchymal cells were seen in the skull region of the FGF9 transgenic mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, B'</xref>) and these cells were organized differently from nontransgenic mice (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>). By E15, the cranial mesenchymal cells in the nontransgenic mice had initiated intramembranous ossification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, C'</xref>, arrow). In contrast, the mesenchymal cells in the FGF9 transgenic skulls differentiated into cells resembling chondrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, D'</xref>). Within the next few days these cells increased in size and became hypertrophic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F, F', H, H'</xref>). By P7, perichondrial cells (including the blood vessels) had begun to invade the cartilage territory (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J, J'</xref>). By P18, the cartilage territory was transformed into trabecular bone and bone marrow (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L, L'</xref>). These results considered together suggest that the cranial mesenchymal cells in the parietal region in these mice recapitulate the sequence of events that occurs during endochondral ossification.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cranial mesenchyme in the FGF9 transgenic mice differentiates into chondrocytes.

Panels A'-L' are higher magnifications of the boxed regions in panels A-L respectively. In nontransgenic mice, the mesenchymal cells of the skull form a skeletogenic membrane (arrows in A', C', E' and G') within which the bones form.

The transgenic mice ectopically express FGF9 in their cranial mesenchymal cells. Expression of FGF9 correlates with localized proliferation of the mesenchymal cells and with upregulation of <italic>Sox9 </italic>expression and downregulation of <italic>CbfaI </italic>and <italic>Osteocalcin</italic>. The mesenchymal cells consequently differentiate into chondrocytes that express <italic>Col2a1</italic>. These chondrocytes proliferate, then hypertrophy, express <italic>Col10a1</italic>and are later replaced by trabecular bone and bone marrow. Therefore, parietal bone formation in these mice recapitulates the sequence of events that occurs during endochondral ossification. These results demonstrate that FGF9 expression is sufficient to convert the differentiation program of (at least a subset of) the cranial mesenchymal cells from intramembranous to endochondral ossification.</p><sec><title>Ectopic expression of the transgene</title><p>The skeletal defects in this transgenic line (OVE1070) occur in mice that are either heterozygous or homozygous for the FGF9 transgene. It is, therefore, unlikely that the skull defects in this line of mice are due to disruption of a gene essential for membranous ossification of the parietal bones. The transgene expression pattern provides compelling evidence that the skull defects in these mice are due to ectopic expression of the transgene. In situ hybridization analyses show that the transgene is expressed in an appropriate spatial and temporal pattern to induce the developmental changes. In addition, the transgene is not expressed in regions where membranous ossification still occurs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). Furthermore, transgene expression precedes <italic>Sox9 </italic>expression and condensation of the mesenchymal cells. Also, our results are consistent with the results of other studies. For example, recent studies of a mouse model for Apert syndrome, with a single amino acid change in FGFR2, support the notion that enhanced activation of FGFR2 can cause some cranial mesenchyme to convert to a chondrocyte differentiation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, FGF9 expression in a chondrocytic cell line is sufficient to induce expression of <italic>Sox9 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Addition of FGF-2 in vitro to cranial mesenchymal cells from quail embryos can induce cartilage differentiation at high doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that initiation of chondrogenesis in the cranial mesenchymal cells in this line of mice is due to ectopic expression of the FGF9 transgene.</p><p>In the OVE1070 family, expression of the FGF9 transgene is not only ectopic but also transient. Expression in the cranial mesenchyme was not detectable after E15. This implies that stimulation by FGF9 is sufficient to induce (competent) cranial mesoderm to switch to a chondrocytic differentiation program, but sustained expression of FGF9 is not required for the later stages of differentiation. Therefore, the endochondral ossification program, once initiated by FGF9, appears to become autonomous.</p><p>The reason for the ectopic <italic>Fgf9 </italic>expression is not clear at present. It is possible the transgene array has integrated in the neighborhood of an endogenous enhancer that directs expression to the cranial mesenchymal cells. Some of the integrated copies of the transgene still retain the &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter since the transgene is still expressed in the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The transgene is also expressed in the dorsal margins of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and this expression transforms the RPE into neuroretina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Nature of FGF9 induction</title><p>Expression of FGF9 in growth plate chondrocytes using the <italic>Col2a1 </italic>promoter results in reduced proliferation and terminal differentiation of chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In addition, targeted deletion of FGFR3, one of the receptors through which FGF9 signals, results in mice with overgrowth of the long bones. These results suggest that a primary role of FGF signaling in the long bones is to act as a negative regulator of chondrocyte proliferation. These results are in contrast to our results that show that ectopic FGF9 expression in embryonic cranial mesenchymal cells induces overproliferation followed by endochondral ossification. How can these disparate observations be reconciled? One possible explanation is the differential timing of FGF9 expression. The <italic>Col2a1 </italic>promoter is active in the differentiated chondrocytes, while our transgenic FGF9 is expressed in undifferentiated cranial mesenchymal cells. Second, there are differences in the responding tissues. Chondrocytes in the long bones originate from the lateral plate mesoderm while the parietal mesenchyme is derived from cranial mesoderm. Since the stimulated cells have different developmental origins, there is no reason to expect that the responses will be identical. For example, although lens and corneal epithelial cells are related to each other, both morphologically and developmentally, they respond differently to FGF stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The reduction in proliferation in the long bones in response to FGF stimulation may be a unique property of the growth plate chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In contrast, the FGF9-induced proliferation of cranial mesenchymal cells is consistent with the notion that FGFs, in general, act as mitogens during normal development.</p></sec><sec><title>Endogenous role for FGF9?</title><p>Though FGF9 appears to be sufficient to induce chondrogenesis in the skull, the role of FGF9 during normal development of cartilage in the cranium is unclear. Our in situ hybridizations did not show any detectable expression of <italic>Fgf9 </italic>in the calvarial mesenchyme at E11 or E13. Expression is seen later during embryonic development in the endocranial portions of the mesenchyme and is downregulated during postnatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This expression pattern suggests that FGF9 is not important for initial specification of the cells in the chondrocytic lineage in the cranium. Consistent with this model, targeted deletion of FGF9 does not result in any visible skeletal abnormalities in the skull [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In contrast, in the transgenic mice, the ectopic FGF9 plays an instructive role and initiates chondrogenesis. FGF9 is known to signal through FGFR2 and FGFR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Signaling by FGF9 in the transgenic heads is likely to be mediated initially through FGFR2 rather than FGFR3 as the parietal fate switch in the FGF9 transgenic mice is not rescued by the loss of FGFR3. After Sox9 expression has been induced and the chondrocytic program has been initiated (by E13), expression of the FGF9 transgene is no longer required. In contrast to the normal chondrocytic differentiation program in long bones, ectopic chondrogenesis in the cranium proceeds at a much slower rate. Though the reasons for this are presently unclear, we speculate that this may be due to the multi-step nature of the endochondral differentiation program. Respecification and reprogramming of the parietal environment is required, and this is accomplished in a less timely fashion than at the normal sites of differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>FGFRs and intramembranous ossification</title><p>Our findings are in apparent conflict with some of the current models for the roles of FGF receptors in intramembranous ossification. Autosomal dominant mutations in FGFR2 or FGFR3 lead to premature differentiation and fusion of the skull sutures in humans and these effects are thought to be the consequence of enhanced receptor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based upon such a model, our transgenic mice would be predicted to exhibit an analogous phenotype, i.e. craniosynostosis. Inappropriate activation of the receptors in the cranial mesenchyme would be predicted to lead to premature differentiation. However, our studies indicate that ligand-mediated activation of FGFR2 induces proliferation of embryonic cranial mesenchymal cells and subsequent differentiation into cartilage. By extrapolation then, our results imply that mutations in the FGFR2 gene in human patients do not result in ligand-independent constitutive activation of the receptor. This prediction is supported by the finding that targeted inactivation of FGFR2 in mice causes developmental alterations in cell types that are not affected by the putative gain-of-function mutations. An alternative explanation is that transient stimulation of FGFR2 (as seen in our FGF9 transgenic mice) may lead to a qualitatively different cellular response compared to sustained ligand-independent stimulation of FGFR2 (as seen in the gain-of-function mutations in human patients). In either case, our results show that a single FGF can function as an instructive signal, inducing a specific cell type to switch from one differentiation program to an autonomous, alternative differentiation pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the mechanistic details of FGF9 stimulation of the cranial mesenchymal cells remain to be elucidated, the OVE1070 transgenic mice provide the first demonstration in vivo that an FGF can switch the differentiation program of immature cranial mesoderm. These results also demonstrate that mesoderm-derived cranial mesenchymal cells are developmentally flexible and can undergo either intramembranous or endochondral ossification in response to extracellular signals. These transgenic mice provide a model system in which to elucidate the molecular connection between stimulation of an FGFR (FGFR2) and induction of expression of a cell-fate-determining transcription factor (Sox9).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of FGF9 transgenic mice</title><p>The construction of the FGF9 transgene and the generation of transgenic mice have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].
