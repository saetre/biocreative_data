In this study, we have functionally characterized interaction partners of the yeast transmembrane nucleoporin Ndc1. Ndc1 forms a distinct complex with the transmembrane proteins Pom152 and Pom34 and two alternative complexes with the soluble nucleoporins Nup53 and Nup59, which in turn bind to Nup170 and Nup157. The transmembrane and soluble Ndc1-binding partners have redundant functions at the NPC, and disruption of both groups of interactions causes defects in Ndc1 targeting and in NPC structure accompanied by significant pore dilation. Using photoconvertible fluorescent protein fusions, we further show that the depletion of Pom34 in cells that lack <italic>NUP53</italic> and <italic>NUP59</italic> blocks new NPC assembly and leads to the reversible accumulation of newly made nucleoporins in cytoplasmic foci. Therefore, Ndc1 together with its interaction partners are collectively essential for the biosynthesis and structural integrity of yeast NPCs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exchange of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is mediated by dedicated transport channels in the nuclear envelope (NE) called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs are embedded within NE at fusion sites between the inner and outer nuclear membrane. They are among the largest macromolecular assemblies in eukaryotic cells with an estimated mass of &#x0003e;50 MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hetzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tran, and Wente, 2006</xref>). The structural organization of NPC appears to be conserved in evolution and has been delineated in various systems using EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unwin, and Milligan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinshaw et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2007</xref>). However, no detailed molecular structure of NPC is currently available. A recent study combined a comprehensive proteomic analysis with a diverse set of biophysical data and computational modeling to propose a three-dimensional map of all <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins or Nups; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>). In addition, the first nucleoporin crystal structures have now been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weirich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeudy, and Schwartz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melcak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schrader et al., 2008</xref>), leading to new insight into NPC structure and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brohawn et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these studies have demonstrated that NPCs are constructed from &#x0223c;500 polypeptides, but because of their highly symmetrical organization, NPCs consist of only &#x0223c;30 distinct nucleoporins, all present in 8, 16, or 32 copies per NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rout et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cronshaw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">b</xref>). Despite our detailed knowledge of the protein composition of NPCs, little is known about the pathways that lead to NPC assembly, and it remains poorly understood how NPC biosynthesis is spatially or temporally coordinated. In higher eukaryotes that undergo an open mitosis, two NPC assembly pathways can be distinguished. The first pathway occurs upon completion of mitosis, when nucleoporin subcomplexes and membrane vesicles are recruited to chromatin during NE reformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rabut et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dultz et al., 2008</xref>). In vitro studies using an NE assembly assay in <italic>Xenopus</italic><italic>laevis</italic> egg extracts revealed discrete NPC assembly steps that are initiated by an early recruitment of the Nup107-160 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belgareh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2003</xref>) to chromatin by the DNA-interacting nucleoporin ELYS (embryonic large molecule derived from yolk sac)/Mel28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rasala et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillespie et al., 2007</xref>). This is followed by the recruitment of membrane vesicles containing the transmembrane nucleoporins POM121 and NDC1, which in turn leads to the incorporation of Nup155 (Nup157/Nup170 in yeast) and Nup53 (Nup53/Nup59 in yeast) and ultimately to the formation of complete and functional NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The second pathway occurs during interphase when new NPCs are synthesized and inserted into intact NEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maul et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Winey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Angelo, and Hetzer, 2006</xref>). Little is known about the mechanism of NPC biogenesis in interphase, and it is unclear how NPCs are inserted into the two lipid bilayers of an intact NE. De novo NPC synthesis during interphase occurs in all eukaryotes, but many unicellular eukaryotes such as the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> must rely exclusively on NPC insertion into intact double membranes as they undergo a closed mitosis with no NE breakdown. Transmembrane nucleoporins are thought to be crucial for interphase NPC biogenesis by anchoring and recruiting soluble NPC components to the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suntharalingam, and Wente, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonin et al., 2008</xref>). In both mammalian and yeast cells, only three transmembrane nucleoporins have been characterized: POM121, gp210, and NDC1 in mammals and Pom34, Pom152, and Ndc1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wozniak, and Blobel, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hallberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wozniak et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chial et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rout et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stavru et al., 2006a</xref>). In mammalian cells, RNAi-mediated silencing of POM121 alone or in combination with gp210 had no effect on cell viability but caused somewhat variable phenotypes with respect to the distribution of other nucleoporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stavru et al., 2006b</xref>). RNAi depletion of NDC1, the only evolutionarily conserved transmembrane nucleoporin, caused more severe phenotypes and affected NE localization of multiple nucleoporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stavru et al., 2006a</xref>). Interestingly, the knockout of NDC1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also affected nucleoporin distribution, but NDC1 is not absolutely essential for the viability of the animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stavru et al., 2006a</xref>), suggesting that the role of the three transmembrane nucleoporins in NPC biogenesis and maintenance might be redundant. In agreement with this, neither <italic>POM152</italic> nor <italic>POM34</italic> is essential for cell viability or NPC function in budding yeast. However, additional depletion of Ndc1 caused severe structural abnormalities of NPC and led to the appearance of enlarged pore structures within the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madrid et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the role of transmembrane nucleoporins in NPC biogenesis, we identified the direct interaction partners of Ndc1 in budding yeast. We show that Ndc1 can be isolated in a subcomplex with Pom152 and Pom34 and that Ndc1 alternatively interacts with either Nup53 or Nup59. In turn, Nup53 and Nup59 directly bind to the core nucleoporins Nup170 and Nup157, thus establishing a connection between the core of NPC and the pore membrane. The removal of Ndc1-interacting partners leads to severe ultrastructural NPC defects resembling the enlarged pore phenotype observed upon depletion of Ndc1 in <italic>pom152</italic> deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madrid et al., 2006</xref>). Using the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Dendra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gurskaya et al., 2006</xref>), we found that depletion of Pom34 in the absence of Nup53 and Nup59 leads to the reversible mislocalization of newly synthesized Nup82, indicating a block in the assembly of new NPCs. Our results demonstrate critical but redundant roles of the Ndc1-interacting nucleoporins in the assembly and structural integrity of yeast NPCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of Ndc1-interacting proteins</title><p>To identify Ndc1-interacting proteins, we performed affinity purifications from yeast cells that express a tagged version of Ndc1.

Liquid chromatography (LC)&#x02013;mass spectrometry (MS)/MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight MS analysis of copurified proteins revealed that Ndc1 specifically interacts with five nucleoporins, Nup170, Nup157, Pom152, Nup59, and Pom34, as well as one transmembrane protein associated with the spindle pole body, Mps3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wozniak et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rout et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaspersen et al., 2002</xref>).

Our findings are consistent with these results, and all the nucleoporins that we found to copurify with Ndc1 were also identified as close neighbors in these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>). However, whether the interactions between Ndc1 and these nucleoporins are direct or indirect had not been analyzed previously. We therefore decided to investigate the detailed interaction patterns of the identified proteins. Pom152 was the most abundant protein present in the Ndc1 purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), prompting us to test whether Ndc1 and Pom152 interact with each other directly. Interestingly, we found that in low ionic strength conditions, Ndc1 could be copurified together with Pom152 in the absence of any other detectable proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We therefore conclude that Ndc1 and Pom152 are direct interaction partners. To further explore the nature of the interactions between the transmembrane nucleoporins, we generated yeast strains that endogenously expressed affinity-tagged versions of Pom152 and Pom34 and performed similar affinity purifications as described for Ndc1. We found that Pom152 coprecipitated Ndc1 and Pom34. Similarly, Pom34 pulled down Ndc1 and Pom152 in all cases in the absence of any major contaminating proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Therefore, the three transmembrane nucleoporins form a complex with each other. Of note in Pom34 purifications, Pom152 was consistently more abundant than Ndc1. This is in agreement with the recent finding that Pom152 and Pom34 can be copurified in a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>), suggesting a direct interaction between Pom152 and Pom34. To further examine the interaction relationships between Ndc1 and the other two transmembrane nucleoporins, we analyzed Ndc1 purifications in deletion mutants lacking either <italic>POM34</italic> or <italic>POM152</italic>. Interestingly, the deletion of <italic>POM34</italic> resulted in strongly reduced amounts of copurified Pom152, and similarly, the deletion of <italic>POM152</italic> severely diminished the amounts of Pom34 in Ndc1 purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Because the deletion of one POM had no detectable effect on the expression of the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), this indicates that the interactions between Ndc1, Pom152, and Pom34 are interdependent.</p><p>It was recently shown that Pom152 and Pom34 form a stable, ring-like structure, and it was proposed that this complex is stabilized by interactions involving the large luminal domain of Pom152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>). We therefore decided to test whether the interactions between Ndc1 and the two Poms are dependent on the luminal domain of Pom152. We performed Ndc1 purifications from yeast strains expressing truncated versions of myc-tagged Pom152. A C-terminal Pom152 truncation (Pom152<sub>1&#x02013;301</sub>), which lacks most of the luminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tcheperegine et al., 1999</xref>), was efficiently coprecipitated with Ndc1 and still supported the recruitment of Pom34. In contrast, an N-terminal truncation of Pom152 (Pom152<sub>170&#x02013;1,337</sub>), essentially lacking the entire cytosolic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tcheperegine et al., 1999</xref>), did not copurify with Ndc1 and prevented efficient recruitment of Pom34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). Consistent with this, Pom152<sub>1&#x02013;301</sub> localized correctly to NE, whereas Pom152<sub>170&#x02013;1,337</sub> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). This mislocalization of Pom152<sub>170&#x02013;1,337</sub> was specific, and no effect on Ndc1 or Pom34 localization could be observed in these cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810030/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Of note, Pom152<sub>170&#x02013;1,337</sub> was correctly inserted into the membrane as judged by its presence in the membrane fraction and by its detergent extractability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tcheperegine et al., 1999</xref>; unpublished data).</p><p>Together, these findings indicate that all three yeast transmembrane nucleoporins form a distinct NPC subcomplex, which we refer to as the Ndc1 subcomplex. This complex is held together by at least two direct interactions: (1) between Ndc1 and Pom152 and (2) between Pom152 and Pom34. However, the overall integrity of the complex depends on the presence of both Poms and predominantly relies on interactions that occur on the cytosolic portions of these three transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Nup59 and Nup53 directly interact with Ndc1 and also bind directly to Nup157 and Nup170</title><p>To discriminate between direct and indirect interactions connecting Ndc1 to its other binding partners, we used in vitro binding approaches with purified proteins. First, we tested whether Ndc1 directly binds to Nup59. In this analysis, we also included the highly related Nup53, which was not detected in the original MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Tandem affinity purification (TAP)&#x02013;tagged Ndc1 was purified from yeast cells using S protein&#x02013;conjugated agarose beads (S beads), whereas recombinant GST fusions of Nup53 and Nup59 were obtained from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Addition of <italic>E. coli</italic> extract was used to internally control for nonspecific binding interactions with Ndc1. We found that both GST-Nup53 and GST-Nup59 were specifically purified from the protein mixtures by Ndc1-coated beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). These interactions did not depend on the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins and were not detected with GST alone (Fig. S1 B), demonstrating that both Nup59 and Nup53 directly and specifically bind to Ndc1.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The interactions of Ndc1 with Nup53 and Nup59.</bold> (A) Purified proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.

We created truncations of both Nup53 and Nup59 and tested them for binding to Ndc1. The removal of the last 15 amino acids completely abolished Nup59 binding to Ndc1 and severely impaired the binding of Nup53. Further deletion of the terminal 50 amino acids completely prevented the interactions of both proteins with Ndc1, demonstrating that the very C termini of Nup53 and Nup59 are necessary for the direct interaction with Ndc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>).

To differentiate between these possibilities, Ndc1 beads were premixed either with a 10-fold molar excess of GST or with a 10-fold molar excess of GST-Nup53 and then incubated with GST-Nup59. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>, preincubation with an excess of GST-Nup53 caused a significant reduction in GST-Nup59 binding when compared with the GST control. Furthermore, the C terminus of Nup53 (Nup53<sub>376&#x02013;475</sub>) was sufficient to inhibit the interaction between Nup59 and Ndc1, whereas an N-terminal fragment of Nup53 lacking the AAHD (Nup53<sub>1&#x02013;425</sub>) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Conversely, the interaction between Nup53 and Ndc1 was blocked when Ndc1-TAP beads were preincubated with an excess of the C-terminal 100 amino acids of Nup59 (GST-Nup59<sub>429&#x02013;528</sub>), but no inhibition was seen in the presence of a Nup59 variant that lacks the extreme C terminus (GST-Nup59<sub>1&#x02013;478</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). These competition experiments show that Nup53 and Nup59 cannot bind to Ndc1 at the same time, suggesting that they use similar or overlapping binding sites. Furthermore, they support a model wherein Ndc1 forms two alternative complexes at the NPC, one with Nup53 and one with Nup59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whether Ndc1 could also directly bind to Nup157 or Nup170, but our attempts to detect specific direct interactions between these proteins were not successful (unpublished data). This suggested that the interactions between Ndc1, Nup157, and Nup170 that we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> might be indirect and mediated by bridging factors. Because Nup53 and Nup59 were previously shown to copurify with Nup170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marelli et al., 1998</xref>) and Nup170 shares high similarity with Nup157, we explored the pairwise binding interactions of Nup53 and Nup59 with Nup170 and Nup157. TAP-tagged fusions of full-length Nup157 and Nup170 or TAP-tagged alone were purified from yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and tested for their ability to bind to maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions of Nup53 or Nup59. We again included a mixture of <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins to internally control for binding specificity. Although Nup170 specifically purified both MPB-Nup53 and MBP-Nup59 from the protein mixtures, Nup157 only bound to MBP-Nup53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref> and Fig. S1 C), suggesting that the interactions between these two pairs of proteins are not identical.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The interactions between Nup53, Nup59, Nup157, and Nup170.</bold> (A) Coomassie brilliant blue&#x02013;stained gel showing samples of purified proteins.

In both cases, Ndc1 predominantly localized to NE in permissive conditions, although some faint peripheral ER localization was already apparent.

Furthermore, these cells partially mislocalized the strongly imported Npl3 protein (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref> [left] with Fig. S4 B), indicating that they have both structural and functional NPC defects. Upon depletion of Nup59, these defects were further exacerbated, as indicated by mislocalization of all four nucleoporins and the strong cytoplasmic mislocalization of Npl3-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, right). Therefore, in the absence Pom152 and Pom34, both Nup53 and Nup59 become critical for the proper structural organization and function of NPC. However, their roles are not entirely equivalent because only <italic>NUP59</italic> is synthetically lethal with <italic>POM152</italic> and <italic>POM34</italic>. In addition, Nup53 and Nup59 have partially redundant roles because we observed exacerbated functional and structural defects in the absence of both these nucleoporins as compared with the conditions when only one of them was absent.

In permissive conditions, we did not observe major localization defects of the reporter nucleoporins in either of these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>, left). The only exception was Nup82, which we found to mislocalize in the <italic>GAL-3&#x000d7;HA-POM15</italic>2 cells. Because we did not observe this in the <italic>GAL-3&#x000d7;HA-POM34</italic> cells, this phenotype is likely a consequence of the high level of Pom152 that is expressed in the presence of galactose. This had no detectable consequence on NPC function, as the Npl3-GFP reporter efficiently accumulated within the nuclei of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>, left). However, upon depletion of either Pom34 or Pom152, <italic>nup53</italic>&#x00394; <italic>nup59</italic>&#x00394; cells displayed almost complete mislocalization of Nup82 and a partial mislocalization of the central nucleoporins Nup133 and Nup188 into cytoplasmic foci. At the same time, Nup2 appeared to localize normally. This redistribution of nucleoporins also coincided with a strong mislocalization of Npl3-GFP to the cytoplasm, indicating impaired NPC function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>, right). The similarity in the NPC phenotypes that we observed upon depletion of Pom152 or Pom34 indicates that these proteins cooperate to perform a similar function in the structural organization of NPC.

We were therefore interested to investigate whether the mislocalized nucleoporins represent newly synthesized proteins that fail to be incorporated into NPCs or whether they are derived from previously existing NPCs that have disintegrated. To address this question, we developed an assay to monitor the fate of old, already assembled NPCs as well as the assembly of new NPCs. We took advantage of the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Dendra, which irreversibly switches from green to red fluorescence upon the application of a short pulse of UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gurskaya et al., 2006</xref>). To test this approach, we fused one of the core nucleoporins, Nup133, with a double Dendra tag (2&#x000d7;Dendra) in wild-type cells and followed its distribution before and after photoconversion. Initially, Nup133-2&#x000d7;Dendra displayed the characteristic punctate nuclear rim distribution, which was detected exclusively in the green channel without any red signal. However, after the application of a short UV pulse, Nup133-2&#x000d7;Dendra was completely photoconverted into the red fluorophore. Over time, newly synthesized Nup133-2&#x000d7;Dendra reemerged in the green channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). The appearance of the green signal was dependent on protein synthesis (unpublished data), demonstrating that Nup133 synthesized before photoconversion was exclusively detected in the red channel and thus could be distinguished from newly made protein.

As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, we found that Ndc1 is embedded into NPC through a web of interactions with at least six nucleoporins, consisting of Pom152, Pom34, Nup59, Nup53, Nup157, and Nup170. Four of these nucleoporins, Pom152, Pom34, Nup53, and Nup59, bind to Ndc1 directly, but we did not find evidence for a direct association between Ndc1 and Nup157 or Nup170. Our purifications demonstrated that Ndc1 forms a stable subcomplex with the other two transmembrane nucleoporins, Pom152 and Pom34. Using cells that lack either Pom152 or Pom34 or express various Pom152 truncations, we show that the integrity of this Ndc1 subcomplex is dependent on both Pom152 and Pom34 and that the interactions between members of this complex predominantly take place on the cytosolic side of the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). We further show that Pom152 directly binds to Ndc1, but this interaction is clearly weakened in the absence of Pom34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). This interdependency on both Pom34 and Pom152 for Ndc1 subcomplex formation provides a biochemical explanation for the functional similarity and for the shared set of genetic interactions that was described for both <italic>POM152</italic> and <italic>POM34</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tcheperegine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miao et al., 2006</xref>; this study). Intriguingly, Pom34 and Pom152 were recently isolated in a ring-shaped oligomeric assembly that does not contain Ndc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>). Based on the biochemical interactions that we describe in this study, it is likely that Ndc1 is also a part of this circular structural unit within NPC. Our experiments further revealed that both Nup59 and Nup53 directly interact with Ndc1, although they compete for binding. The interaction is dependent on the almost identical C-terminal AAHDs within Nup53 and Nup59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>), suggesting that these two proteins use the same or highly overlapping binding sites on Ndc1. Although direct interactions of Ndc1 with Nup53 and Nup59 had not been reported previously, it had already been shown that Ndc1 and Pom152 are recruited to proliferated intranuclear membranes that can be observed upon overexpression of Nup53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marelli et al., 2001</xref>). Using in vitro binding assays, we were unable to detect direct interactions between Ndc1 and Nup157 or Nup170 (unpublished data). However, we observed that Nup53 directly binds to both Nup157 and Nup170, whereas Nup59 directly interacts with Nup170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that Nup53 and Nup59 may act as bridging factors that link Ndc1 to core nucleoporins, in particular to Nup170 and Nup157. In vertebrates, Nup53, the homologue of yeast Nup53/Nup59, was recently shown to interact with the homologue of Ndc1 and with Nup155, the homologue of yeast Nup170/Nup157 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawryluk-Gara et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these findings point to an evolutionarily conserved set of interactions between Ndc1, Nup157/Nup170, and Nup53/Nup59. It is interesting to note that all four nucleoporins that we identified as direct Ndc1 interaction partners are either transmembrane proteins (Pom152 and Pom34) or have been shown to peripherally associate with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marelli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel and Rexach, 2007</xref>). We therefore propose that Ndc1 and its immediate neighbors (Pom152, Pom34, Nup53, and Nup59) constitute the innermost layer of NPC that anchors NPC scaffold elements, including Nup157 and Nup170 to the nuclear pore membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Summary model of the Ndc1 interaction network.</bold> Solid arrows depict direct protein interactions.

The first element consists of the two transmembrane nucleoporins, <italic>POM152</italic> and <italic>POM34</italic>, which display a synthetic lethal interaction with the second element, which consists of <italic>NUP59</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tcheperegine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miao et al., 2006</xref>). What is the combined essential function of these two elements? First, Nup59 together with Pom152 and Pom34 plays a redundant role in anchoring and/or targeting of Ndc1 to the NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Second, our biochemical findings suggest that these two functional elements play an important role in bridging the interactions between Ndc1 and other NPC components, in particular Nup170 and Nup157 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). In combination, Nup157 and Nup170 are essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>) and have a critical function in NPC biogenesis (see Makio et al. on p. 459 of this issue). Interestingly, Nup170 also directly interacts with Pom152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Makio et al., 2009</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the two groups of Ndc1 interactors may play redundant roles in bridging the interactions between Ndc1 and the essential Nup170/Nup157 pair, thus providing a possible explanation for the genetic interactions that can be observed between the two <italic>POM</italic> genes and <italic>NUP59</italic>. Intriguingly, the filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> does not contain genes encoding for Nup53, Nup59, or Pom34, and although the homologues of Ndc1 and Pom152 are not required for viability, Nup170 is encoded by an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osmani et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it will be interesting to understand how Nup170 and other core nucleoporins are anchored to the nuclear membrane in this organism.</p><p>Nup53 and Nup59 have similar patterns of physical interactions in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>) and display some functional redundancy because the loss of both proteins leads to an exacerbated perturbation of NPC structure and function in the <italic>pom152</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pom34</italic>&#x00394; background when compared with the individual loss of each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). However, no synthetic lethal interactions between <italic>NUP53</italic> and the two <italic>POM</italic>s can be detected, and <italic>NUP53</italic> cannot functionally compensate for the loss of <italic>NUP59</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). This suggests that these two highly related proteins have functionally diverged to play distinct roles at the NPC. Consistent with this, we could detect only Nup59 in the Ndc1 purifications from cell extracts, and only Nup59 conferred efficient recruitment of Ndc1 to the NE in <italic>pom152</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pom34</italic>&#x00394; mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). At present, the molecular basis for the functional differences between Nup59 and Nup53 remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Ndc1-interacting nucleoporins in NPC biosynthesis and maintenance</title><p>The cell growth phenotypes that we observed upon the loss of the various Ndc1-interacting proteins were accompanied by mislocalization of Ndc1 and other structural nucleoporins, ultrastructural NPC abnormalities, and functional NPC defects. In general, the severity of the NPC defects gradually increased upon the loss of multiple proteins, but collectively, the four Ndc1-interacting proteins appear to be important (a) to connect Ndc1 to other structural elements of NPC, (b) to anchor Ndc1 to the pore, and (c) to maintain the structural integrity of NPC. However, the defects within the different mutants varied, and we found that the conditional depletion of Nup59 (in either <italic>pom152</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pom34</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>pom152</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pom34</italic>&#x00394; <italic>nup53</italic>&#x00394; backgrounds) and the conditional depletion of the Poms (in the <italic>nup59</italic>&#x00394; <italic>nup53</italic>&#x00394; background) induced distinct phenotypes. For example, in <italic>nup59</italic>&#x00394; <italic>nup53</italic>&#x00394; cells in which Pom34 was depleted, we observed selective mislocalization of a subset of nucleoporins into cytoplasmic foci. This phenotype was accompanied by a reduction in pore number in the absence of obvious ultrastructural NPC defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). To investigate the origin of the mislocalized nucleoporins in these cells, we took advantage of the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Dendra, which enabled us to monitor the intracellular distribution of newly synthesized and preexisting nucleoporins in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Using Nup82-Dendra, we showed that upon Pom34 repression in <italic>nup59</italic>&#x00394; <italic>nup53</italic>&#x00394; cells, newly synthesized Nup82 was almost exclusively localized to cytoplasmic foci. This suggests that newly synthesized Nup82 cannot be incorporated into NPCs and that the process of de novo NPC assembly is blocked in these cells. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that these cells have a reduced number of pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), as these cells can undergo several rounds of division after the shift to the nonpermissive conditions (e.g., Fig. S2 D) and presumably dilute previously synthesized pores between mother and daughter cells. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Makio et al. (2009)</xref> also describes defects in new NPC biosynthesis in cells simultaneously lacking Nup170 and Nup157. It is therefore likely that the connection to Nup170 and Nup157 established by Ndc1-interacting proteins is critical for new NPC biosynthesis. Notably, the mislocalization of Nup82 was reversible, and the previously synthesized pool of Nup82 that was present in cytoplasmic foci could be chased back to the NE upon reinduction of Pom34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). An apparent reversible NPC assembly defect was recently also described in <italic>apq12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>). However, in this case, the defects in NPC assembly were accompanied by invaginations of the inner nuclear membrane, which we did not observe in our strains.</p><p>Surprisingly, when we depleted Nup59 in a <italic>pom152&#x00394; pom34&#x00394;</italic> background, we induced a distinct set of phenotypes. Under these conditions, we did not only observe nucleoporin mislocalization but also found severe ultrastructural defects at NPC. Most strikingly, we detected a significant increase in NPC diameter and, in the absence of Nup53, the appearance of large openings within NE, which is reminiscent to the phenotype that we had previously described upon depletion of Ndc1 in the absence of Pom152. Unfortunately, the Dendra assay did not allow us to unambiguously answer the question of whether these enlarged pores represent blocked NPC assembly intermediates or whether they are derived from destabilized pores that have fallen apart. However, <italic>pom152&#x00394; pom34&#x00394; GAL-NUP59</italic> cells display an NPC maintenance defect that can be illustrated with the Dendra assay by the mislocalization of already existing nucleoporins in nonpermissive conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810030/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>). Furthermore, all NPC defects that we observe upon Nup59 depletion are irreversible (unpublished data). Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that in these cells, the stability of NPCs is compromised, which ultimately leads to the disintegration of existing pore structures and the formation of large openings within the NE. Future studies will now be required to analyze the molecular details of how Ndc1 and its interacting partners contribute to NPC assembly and maintenance and to dissect the mechanism of how NPCs are inserted into the lipid bilayers of NE.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Construction of yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Construction of plasmids for this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810030/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>) was performed using standard molecular cloning techniques.

Proteins were visualized with GelCode staining reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and the desired areas differing in protein content were excised from the gel and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight MS and LC-MS/MS.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the interactions between Ndc1, Pom152, and Pom34</title><p>The analytical TAP-tagged affinity pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D and G</xref>) were performed using a procedure similar to the aforementioned one using S beads. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with SYPRO-Ruby (Invitrogen) using a UV transilluminator coupled to a digital camera (Alpha Innotech). Conditions for TAP-tagged pull-downs at a lower salt concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) were identical except that experiments were performed in LB diluted 1:1 with distilled water. For Western blotting experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>), digitonin was added to 1 ml bead beater cell lysate up to a final concentration of 1%, and after 10 min incubation on ice, the solubilized material was clarified by 2 min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a tabletop mini centrifuge. The extract was incubated for 1 h with 20 &#x000b5;l S beads. The beads were washed and eluted with SDS sample buffer. After resolving by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the respective primary and secondary antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of recombinant proteins and preparation of bacterial cell extract</title><p>Cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> BL-21 cells transformed with the respective protein-coding plasmids were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 2 h at RT.

Supernatants were incubated with either Sepharose-GSH beads (GE Healthcare) or His-Select affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich).

Cells were grown overnight and harvested, washed, and lysed in LB containing protease inhibitors in a preparative scale bead beater (BioSpec Products, Inc.). Cell debris was removed from the lysate by centrifugation (5 min at 2,000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge), and membranes were collected by high-speed centrifugation at 17,000 rpm (SS-34 rotor) for 1 h. The membrane pellet was diluted with ice-cold LB/inhibitors, frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> in 1-ml aliquots, and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. For preparation of Ndc1-TAP S beads, aliquots of the membrane suspension were diluted 1:1 with LB plus protease inhibitors and 1.2% octyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (final concentration), incubated for 20 min, and clarified by a 10,000 rpm centrifugation in a tabletop mini centrifuge. To immobilize Ndc1-TAP, the supernatant was then incubated with S beads. Alternatively, Ndc1-TAP membranes were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and washed with LB plus 0.1% Tween 20. The Triton extraction protocol provided better efficiency of Ndc1 immobilization, although the protein appeared to be less active in the in vitro binding experiments when compared with the octyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside extraction procedure. The overexpression of TAP-Nup157 (KWY2377) and TAP-Nup170 (KWY2378) was similar as described for Ndc1-TAP. Lysis was performed using glass beads with ice-cold LB/inhibitors supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 (final concentration). Insoluble cell debris was removed by 5-min 4,500 rpm centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge, and the supernatant was incubated with S beads and extensively washed with LB supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro binding assays with Nup53, Nup59, Ndc1, Nup157, and Nup170</title><p>For each in vitro binding reaction, aliquots of the bait protein were premixed with an equal volume of LB or LB containing bacterial proteins in the presence of 10% glycerol and 0.4% digitonin, and protein mixtures were added to preequilibrated beads. For competition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>), beads were first preincubated with an excess of competitor protein solution followed by the addition of the respective full-length protein. Beads were briefly washed and eluted with high salt elution buffer (1.25 M NaCl, 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, and 0.2% digitonin). Eluted proteins were precipitated with methanol-chloroform, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with SYPRO-Ruby. The remaining beads were also subjected to a second stringent elution with ammonium hydroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oeffinger et al., 2007</xref>) to exclude the possibility that the binding of some proteins was not detected because they resisted salt elution. The ammonium hydroxide eluates were dried in a Speedvac (GMI, Inc.) and resolubilized in SDS sample buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells were grown at 30&#x000b0;C in permissive synthetic selection media (containing galactose or containing dextrose and lacking methionine) or in the nonpermissive synthetic selection media (containing dextrose or containing dextrose and 0.2 mg/ml methionine). The media were supplemented with twofold excess of adenine, and cell density was kept under OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5 to reduce autofluorescence. For all live imaging experiments except for color Dendra assays, cells were concentrated by centrifugation, mounted under a cover slide in culture media, and imaged directly. All Images were acquired with a digital camera (CA742-98; Hamamatsu Photonics) controlled by the Metamorph software program (MDS Analytical Technologies). Images were processed using Photoshop (CS2; Adobe), and figures were assembled using Photoshop and Illustrator (CS2; Adobe).</p><p>For depletion Dendra experiments, cells were grown overnight in the permissive media essentially as described in the previous paragraph and diluted into the nonpermissive media. Cells were collected for Dendra microscopy at the times specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8</xref> and S5. Cells were washed with fresh medium and concentrated during the final wash step. 2 &#x000b5;l cells was placed on a 2% low melt agarose pad prepared using respective medium. Dendra was converted by 4 &#x000d7; 20&#x02013;ms pulses of UV light in DAPI channel followed by 8 s YFP exposure to bleach remaining signal. Slides were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C between time points. For recovery experiments, cells were grown in nonpermissive conditions for the time stated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>. Cells were washed three times with 500 &#x000b5;l of the permissive media, and 2 &#x000b5;l was placed on an agarose pad prepared using the permissive media. Cells were imaged immediately, incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for the time stated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>, and imaged again. Dendra was converted with one 20-ms UV exposure followed by a 10-s YFP exposure to bleach remaining signal.
