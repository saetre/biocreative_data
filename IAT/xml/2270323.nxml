Tight regulation of cellular c-di-GMP concentration is governed by diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases, which are responsible for its production and degradation, respectively. Here, we present the crystal structure of the diguanylate cyclase WspR, a conserved GGDEF domain-containing response regulator in Gram-negative bacteria, bound to c-di-GMP at an inhibitory site. Biochemical analyses revealed that feedback regulation involves the formation of at least three distinct oligomeric states. By switching from an active to a product-inhibited dimer via a tetrameric assembly, WspR utilizes a novel mechanism for modulation of its activity through oligomerization. Moreover, our data suggest that these enzymes can be activated by phosphodiesterases. Thus, in addition to the canonical pathways via phosphorylation of the regulatory domains, both product and enzyme concentration contribute to the coordination of c-di-GMP signaling. A structural comparison reveals resemblance of the oligomeric states to assemblies of GAF domains, widely used regulatory domains in signaling molecules conserved from archaea to mammals, suggesting a similar mechanism of regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Bacteria can switch from a single-cell, free-floating behavioral mode to a community life-form via colonization of surfaces and the secretion of an extracellular matrix. This process, called biofilm formation, has been attributed to a majority of chronic infections, including the lungs, as occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis. Recently, a small intracellular signaling molecule, the nucleotide cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), and enzymes for its production and degradation have been discovered that relay environmental cues to changes in secretion, cell adhesion and ultimately, biofilm formation and virulence. We have studied the molecular mechanism and mode of regulation of WspR, an enzyme from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and related pathogenic bacteria responsible for the generation of c-di-GMP and biofilm formation. On the basis of its crystal structure and functional assays, we elucidated a sophisticated regulatory mechanism in WspR that is controlled by feedback inhibition mediated by c-di-GMP. We hypothesize that WspR is primed for the (re)activation by enzymatic degradation of the inhibitory nucleotide. In addition, we identified mutations at the inhibitory site of WspR in a subset of bacteria that are frequently found in cystic fibrosis patients, suggesting that altered c-di-GMP signaling, mediated by modified WspR, may contribute to the pathogenicity of these strains. Furthermore, we present a structural comparison with GAF domains, which are widely used conserved regulatory signaling domains, suggesting a similar mechanism of regulation.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>We present a model for the regulation of a conserved diguanyate cyclase from<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> that is responsible for cyclic di-GMP production and biofilm formation, providing insight into the molecular mechani7sm controlling cell signaling and virulence.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>De N, Pirruccello M, Krasteva PV, Bae N, Raghavan RV, et al.

Such segregation would be accompanied by the breakup of the CheY dimer.

For both the models of the active and inactive dimers, the exact position of the GGDEF domains relative to the CheY-stalk module might be different from that observed in the tetrameric assembly, and might depend on interactions with nucleotides, inter- and/or intramolecular interactions.

The autoregulatory switch in WspR involves a coiled-coil motif extending from the CheY-homology phospho-receiver domains. This helical stalk can homodimerize in a parallel or antiparallel fashion, stabilizing the active or inactive state, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Since the tetramer assembles from the compact dimeric species and dissociates into elongated dimers in the presence of c-di-GMP, it is not surprising that the structure captures features from all three states. As a required intermediate, a tetrameric assembly serves as an exit platform for the product-inhibited species. Tetramerization is also driven by interactions of the stalks, jamming the active sites and establishing transient inhibition.</p><p>We recently obtained a crystal structure of the WspR homolog from <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. syringae</named-content> (R. Raghavan and H. Sondermann, unpublished data). In this crystal, WspR was also found in a tetrameric assembly similar to the one described here with a subtle, but important, difference. The inhibitory contacts between all four GGDEF domains and the CheY-stalk modules of the neighboring protomers have been formed (similar to zone 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). It was rewarding to see that this leads to a weakening of the CheY domain interfaces (unpublished data), supporting our hypothesis that the tetramer facilitates the formation of elongated, inactive dimers with unpaired CheY domains.</p><p>Previously, it has been demonstrated that WspR is regulated by phosphorylation in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. In the purified system, mutant proteins targeting the active site of the CheY domain have characteristics indistinguishable from WspR<sup>wt</sup> (unpublished data). Furthermore, purified WspR appears to be constitutively oligomeric even in the absence of posttranslational modifications under the conditions described here (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060067-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).

In fact, preliminary studies suggest that addition of beryllium fluoride, a commonly used compound mimicking phosphorylation, modulates WspR's oligomeric state, facilitating tetramer formation and autoinhibition (N. De and H. Sondermann, unpublished data). In a putative model, the activated, phosphorylated state may be subject to stronger feedback regulation via tetramerization. Such a mechanism would create a short c-di-GMP pulse before WspR shuts down contributing to localized signaling, a hallmark described for this second messenger signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. On another level, WspR has been shown to relocalize in a phosphorylation-dependent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. It is feasible that phosphorylation is used for fine-tuning of the signaling system. The proper output might rely on the exact spatial and temporal activation of WspR and regulation might impact both localization and/or activity. The exact mechanism and role of phosphorylation on WspR activity awaits further experimental elucidation.</p><p>The switching mechanism in WspR involving distinct oligomers might be more widely used, and may apply to other regulatory domains such as GAF domains, a common regulatory module in cyclic nucleotide PDEs. Tandem GAF units contain two globular nucleotide-binding domains connected by a helical stalk. They have been crystallized in two conformations, a parallel and an antiparallel dimer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. In the structure of mouse PDE2A, the N-terminal GAF domain and the protruding stalk function as a dimerization module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g008">Figure 8</xref>B, left panel) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, we find a tetrameric assembly in the crystal lattice in which the stalk dimers and the second GAF domains bind in a head-to-head orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g008">Figure 8</xref>B, right panel). In essence, these conformations show remarkable resemblance to the compact dimer and the tetramer species of WspR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, the tandem GAF domain from <italic>Anabaena</italic> forms an antiparallel assembly in the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g008">Figure 8</xref>C) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, globally resembling the elongated dimer of WspR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g008">Figure 8</xref>). We speculate whether a similar oligomerization mechanism as the one we describe here for WspR might also regulate GAF domain&#x02013;containing phosphodiesterases in all kingdoms of life.</p><p>In our model for feedback regulation of WspR, c-di-GMP serves two purposes: Initially, it works as a clamp in the tetramer that stabilizes a conformation from which the inactive dimers detach. Cyclic di-GMP remains bound to the canonical I-site motif located solely at the GGDEF domain, where it functions as an allosteric inhibitor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060067-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The inhibited dimeric state is primed for (re)activation. Removal of c-di-GMP from the I-site by PDEs releases the inhibition and induces dimerization of the unpaired CheY-homology domains and diguanylate cyclase activity via switching between distinct dimer species. Using purified enzymes, we did not observe a high degree of specificity; multiple active PDEs showed similar activities towards WspR-bound c-di-GMP. In cells, targeting and signaling specificity might be determined by regulatory domains in the PDEs. In summary, activation by PDEs might represent a more general way to switch on diguanylate cyclases, in addition to the well-established phosphorylation-dependent mode.</p><p>The feedback mechanism described here allows WspR to integrate multiple inputs such as phosphorylation, as well as protein and c-di-GMP concentrations, to adjust its activity. The mode of regulation is likely to be relevant with regards to the particular properties of c-di-GMP signaling in bacteria. Despite its small size and hydrophilic nature, c-di-GMP appears not to function as a general, diffusive second messenger in the cell.

The GGDEF domains are linked via c-di-GMP molecules that bridge the I-sites of neighboring molecules. Arrows indicate how breaking up the CheY domain dimers accompanied by a rigid body rotation of the CheY-stalk module would facilitate the formation of two identical dimers shown in (C) (elongated dimer 1). Such a motion is similar to the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g001">Figure 1</xref>C.</p><p>(C) Possible elongated dimer states derived from the tetrameric assembly. Cyclic di-GMP-bound, inactive WspR is dimeric in solution but crystallizes as a tetrameric assembly. From the three possible elongated WspR dimers that can be derived from the tetrameric structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060067-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B), the elongated dimer 1 (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g008">Figure 8</xref>A, right panel) might represent a structure close to the conformation of inactive WspR in solution, based on structural and functional arguments presented in the main text. Briefly, two symmetry-related molecules shown in color (chain A) of WspR in the elongated dimer 1 are held together by three interfaces: stalk-stalk, stalk-GGDEF domain, and GGDEF domain-CheY domain of adjacent molecules. In the stalks, the same residues that would satisfy the coiled-coil and drive tetramerization form the hydrophobic center of the dimer (D&#x02013;F). The ionic interaction between the GGEEF motif and the stalk is shown in detail (close-up view in inset). Elongated dimer 2 is mediated exclusively by antiparallel packing of the stalks, burying the smallest surface area in the dimer interface compared to dimers 1 and 3. Other interactions observed in elongated dimer 1 have not formed yet in elongated dimer 2. Considering the bridging of the GGDEF domains by c-di-GMP, elongated dimer 3 might be an intuitive candidate for the inhibited state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060067-sg004">Figure S4</xref>C, right panel). However, the dissociation of such a dimer from the tetramer would be sterically hindered. In addition, the buried surface area at the interface (1,518 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> surface are buried between the two chains, 830 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of which are buried between the GGDEF domains) is less extensive compared to elongated dimer 1 (2,430 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>), and the interaction between the GGDEF domains appears to be functionally less important since a mutation at the interface (WspR<sup>R195E</sup>) has no effect on the protein, being mechanistically indistinguishable from wild-type WspR (unpublished data). These arguments and considerations support the hypothesis that elongated dimer 1 might represent a conformation close to the inhibited state in solution that assembled to the tetrameric assembly in the crystal lattice.

Upon overexpression, protein levels are likely to be high enough to facilitate the formation of transient dimers exhibiting diguanylate cyclase activity, similar to the activity observed for the isolated GGDEF domain at high expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060067-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and data not shown).</p><p>(1.3 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0060067.sg006.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0060067-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Data Collection and Refinement Statistics</title><p>(44 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0060067.st001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><sec id="s4a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>Atomic coordinates and structure factors for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> PA3702 have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb</ext-link>) under ID code 3BRE.</p><p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) accession numbers for the protein sequences used for alignment of WspR are as follows: <named-content content-type="genus-species">Burkholderia</named-content> sp. 383 (YP&#x0005f;372775), <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. ambifaria</named-content> MC40&#x02013;6 (ZP&#x0005f;01553618), <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. dolosa</named-content> AUO158 (ZP&#x0005f;00984936), <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. phytofirmans</named-content> PsJN (ZP&#x0005f;01511812), <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. vietnamiensis</named-content> G4 (YP&#x0005f;001117051)., <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. phymatum</named-content> STM815 (ZP&#x0005f;01501464), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mesorhizobium loti</named-content> MAFF303099 (NP&#x0005f;109384), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> PAO1 (NP&#x0005f;252391), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. entomophila</named-content> L48 (YP&#x0005f;606955), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. fluorescens</named-content> Pf-5 (YP&#x0005f;258266), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. fluorescens</named-content> PfO-1 (YP&#x0005f;346790), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. fluorescens</named-content> Sbw25 (AAL71852), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. putida</named-content> W619 (ZP&#x0005f;01639796), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. syringae</named-content> pv. phaseolicola 1448A (YP&#x0005f;276013), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. syringae</named-content> pv. syringae B728a (YP&#x0005f;234398), <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. syringae</named-content> pv. tomato str.
