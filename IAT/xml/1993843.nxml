When transfected into A3G-deficient epithelial cell lines, A3G induces catastrophic hypermutation by deaminating the HIV-1 genome. Interestingly, studies suggest that endogenous A3G in T cells induces less hypermutation than would be expected. However, to date, the specific deaminase activity of endogenous A3G in human CD4&#x0002b; T cells has not been examined directly. Here, we compared deaminase activity of endogenous and exogenous A3G in various human cell lines using a standard assay and a novel, quantitative, high-throughput assay. Exogenous A3G in epithelial cell lysates displayed deaminase activity only following RNase treatment, as expected given that A3G is known to form an enzymatically inactive RNA-containing complex. Surprisingly, comparable amounts of endogenous A3G from T cell lines or from resting or activated primary CD4&#x0002b; T cells exhibited minimal deaminase activity, despite RNase treatment. Specific deaminase activity of endogenous A3G in H9, CEM, and other T cell lines was up to 36-fold lower than specific activity of exogenous A3G in epithelial-derived cell lines. Furthermore, RNase-treated T cell lysates conferred a dose-dependent inhibition to epithelial cell lysates expressing enzymatically active A3G. These studies suggest that T cells, unlike epithelial-derived cell lines, express an unidentified RNase-resistant factor that inhibits A3G deaminase activity. This factor could be responsible for reduced levels of hypermutation in T cells, and its identification and blockade could offer a means for increasing antiretroviral intrinsic immunity of T cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>APOBEC3G (A3G) is an antiviral enzyme that is expressed in human T cells and macrophages, which are the cell types infected by HIV. Early in the HIV life cycle, the HIV RNA genome is reverse transcribed into DNA. A3G can modify this DNA enzymatically, leading to high rates of mutation such that the virus can no longer replicate. To date, most studies of A3G's enzymatic activity have utilized cell lines (293T and HeLa) that can be transfected to express A3G but do not express it endogenously. A report of unexpectedly low levels of mutation in viral DNA from HIV-infected human T cells led us to investigate regulation of A3G enzymatic activity in T cells. We developed a high-throughput assay to compare the enzymatic activity of endogenous A3G in T cells versus transfected (exogenous) A3G. Surprisingly, enzymatic activity of A3G from human T cell lines and primary T cells was very low relative to A3G from transfected cells, even when corrected for A3G protein amount. Moreover, T cell lysates inhibited enzymatic activity of exogenously expressed A3G. These data suggest that enzymatic activity of endogenous A3G in human T cells is inhibited by an uncharacterized mechanism that may protect the host from this DNA mutator and could have important implications for A3G antiviral activity in vivo.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Thielen BK, Klein KC, Walker LW, Rieck M, Buckner JH, et al.

One such strategy involves the deoxycytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G), an intrinsic defense mechanism specific to primates. A3G is a cellular protein expressed in a limited number of cell types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, including, but not limited to, T cells and macrophages, and has antiviral activity against HIV-1, hepatitis B virus, and endogenous retroelements (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;). During HIV-1 infection, A3G can exert antiviral effects either when it is packaged into virions (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;) or when it is present in T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, which are a natural target of infection. The antiviral effect of packaged A3G is not observed in infections with wild-type virus because HIV encodes the viral infectivity factor (Vif), which prevents A3G from being packaged into newly formed virus particles by targeting it for proteosomal degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; and by other mechanisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in the absence of functional Vif, A3G is packaged and subsequently mediates deamination of deoxycytidine (dC) residues in the nascent minus-strand DNA during reverse transcription of the HIV genome. As a result of this deamination, G-to-A hypermutation of the coding strand can occur, resulting in an increased proportion of non-infectious virus (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;). Alternatively, the presence of multiple deoxyuridines (dUs) in the minus strand may prevent accumulation of reverse transcripts, either by triggering degradation by cellular DNA repair machinery &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b011">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; or by impairing synthesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. In both cases, dC-to-dU deamination was initially thought to be critical to the antiviral effects of packaged A3G. However, subsequent studies have demonstrated that packaged A3G mutants can have antiviral effects even when they lack deaminase activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Recent studies also indicate that A3G does not always need to be packaged to inhibit HIV infection. Endogenous A3G present in resting CD4&#x0002b; T cells from peripheral blood, but not from lymphoid tissue, restricts infection of these cells in a Vif-independent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, when reverse transcripts from these cells were examined, unexpectedly low levels of hypermutation were observed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, raising the possibility that A3G-mediated restriction of infection of resting T cells may also occur by mechanisms other than deamination. Thus, both packaged A3G and A3G present in resting T cells may restrict HIV-1 infection by a deaminase-independent mechanism, although in both cases some degree of mutation of HIV reverse transcripts is typically seen.</p><p>To determine how much deamination contributes to the antiviral effect of A3G in vivo, a better understanding of the deaminase activity of endogenous A3G in T cells and macrophages is needed. Regulation of A3G's deaminase activity has been studied primarily using tagged A3G expressed exogenously in epithelial cell lines. In these cells, exogenously expressed A3G is found in high molecular mass (HMM) ribonucleoprotein complexes, which are enzymatically inactive. RNase A treatment of epithelial cell lysates disrupts the integrity of these complexes, producing an enzymatically active, low molecular mass (LMM) form of A3G &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. RNase-sensitive HMM complexes are also found in T cell lines, activated CD4&#x0002b; T cells, resting CD4&#x0002b; T cells from lymphoid tissue, and CD16&#x0002b; monocytes, all of which are susceptible to infection by wild-type HIV-1. Interestingly, resting peripheral blood CD4&#x0002b; T cells and CD16- monocytes, which restrict HIV-1 infection, contain primarily LMM A3G &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. However, to date, no studies have examined enzymatic activity of endogenous A3G in resting or activated CD4&#x0002b; T cells. Although the finding that LMM A3G in resting T cells confers resistance to HIV infection demonstrates its antiviral activity, the surprisingly low percentage of mutated HIV reverse transcripts recovered from these cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; raises the possibility that A3G may not be as enzymatically active in resting T cells as it is in epithelial cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that the deaminase activity of LMM A3G in T cells is much lower than the deaminase activity of comparable amounts of exogenous A3G expressed in epithelial cells. These data suggest that endogenous A3G in T cells is regulated by a novel inhibitory protein or proteins. This inhibition of A3G deaminase activity could explain the unexpectedly low level of HIV hypermutation observed in resting T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Such a mechanism for regulation in cells expressing endogenous A3G in the LMM form could allow for more fine-tuned modulation of this enzyme that may be harmful to the cell if uncontrolled but is also needed for defense against viruses and endogenous retroelements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To determine if A3G activity is regulated differently in T cells and epithelial cells, we compared the activity of endogenous A3G in human T cell lines (H9 cells and H9 cells expressing the HIV genome without Vif) to the activity of comparable amounts of exogenous A3G expressed in human epithelial-derived cell lines (293FT and HeLa cells) using a standard gel-based deaminase assay, in which an infrared 700 (IRDye 700)&#x02013;labeled oligonucleotide containing the A3G deamination motif (dCdC) was incubated with samples of total cell extracts containing 10 &#x003bc;g of total cellular protein. Uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs) present endogenously in cell extracts and recombinant UDG added to the assay convert deaminated dCs to abasic sites, which are cleaved during the assay upon incubation at a basic pH (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). The resulting oligonucleotide cleavage is then detected by gel electrophoresis followed by imaging with a LI-COR infrared scanner. While incubation of the oligonucleotide with RNase A&#x02013;treated epithelial cell extracts expressing A3G resulted in high levels of cleavage in the absence or presence of exogenous UDG, incubation with RNase A&#x02013;treated H9 cell extracts resulted in much less oligonucleotide cleavage, even in the presence of exogenous UDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). An aliquot of each cell lysate subjected to immunoblotting for A3G confirmed the presence of similar amounts of A3G in lysates of H9 cells and transfected 293FT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The surprising finding that endogenous A3G in the T cell extracts exhibited less deaminase activity than comparable amounts of transfected A3G in epithelial cells raised the possibility that an inhibitory activity exists in H9 T cells. Since two enzymatic reactions occur in this assay (deamination by A3G and base excision by UDG), a parallel control was performed to determine which of the two reactions was inhibited in H9 cells. When an IR-labeled oligonucleotide containing dU was incubated with the same cell extracts in the presence of RNase A but without exogenous UDG, it was cleaved to a similar extent across cells types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), indicating equivalent endogenous UDG-mediated base excision in H9 T cell lines and epithelial cell lines. These data are consistent with previous reports &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; and indicate that H9 extracts do not contain an inhibitor of UDG activity. Together, these findings suggested that after RNase A treatment, endogenous A3G in H9 T cells exhibits less A3G deaminase activity than comparable amounts of transfected A3G expressed in 293FT cells. Since improved and nearly complete cleavage was observed in all cell types upon supplementation with exogenous UDG, all future studies were performed in the presence of exogenous UDG.</p><fig id="ppat-0030135-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A Gel-Based Assay Reveals That Endogenous A3G in T Cell Lines Exhibits Unexpectedly Low Deaminase Activity Compared to Exogenous A3G in Transfected Epithelial-Derived Cell Lines</title><p>(A) Deaminase activity was measured using an infrared 700 (IR700)&#x02013;labeled oligo containing the A3G recognition site (CCC) either with or without exogenous recombinant uracil DNA glycosylase (&#x0002b;/- UDG). Oligos were incubated with crude cell lysates containing 10 &#x003bc;g of total cellular protein obtained from H9 cells, H9 cells expressing the HIV genome containing a deletion in Vif (H9-HIV), or from HeLa or 293FT cells transfected with the indicated amounts of A3G plasmid DNA (pA3G).

The time- and labor-intensive gel-based assay is not readily amenable to the multiple measurements that are required to validate linearity of the assay for a large number of cell types. Thus, to obtain a more quantitative view of A3G deaminase activity in different cell types, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#x02013;based, high-throughput assay that would allow us to more easily perform dose-response curves and multiple replicates using either crude cell extracts or immunoprecipitated A3G. The lack of simple, non-radioactive, quantitative assays has been at least partially responsible for the absence of comprehensive studies of A3G activity in a wide variety of cell types and physiological situations.

One method for directly assaying A3G deaminase activity measures the ability of immunoprecipitated or virion-incorporated A3G to induce deamination-dependent cleavage of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotides, as detected by altered migration on a gel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled dATP, which only occurs when dCs in an oligonucleotide template strand are converted to dUs by deamination, can be measured &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. We devised a non-radioactive assay in which the A3G substrate is a 13-base oligonucleotide that contains the A3G recognition motif and is dual-labeled with FRET-optimized fluorophores. We added exogenous UDG to ensure complete uracil excision. Treatment with base leads to cleavage of the labeled oligonucleotide at sites of deamination, as in the gel-based assay. Upon cleavage, the reporter fluorophore is no longer efficiently quenched, producing an increase in detectable fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). Using different ratios of double- and single-labeled oligos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-st001">Table S1</xref>), we demonstrated that fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of single-labeled oligo representing cleaved substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B).</p><p>We then validated the FRET-based assay by demonstrating that increasing A3G expression in 293FT cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase in deaminase activity when the assay was performed with extracts from cells expressing increasing amounts of A3G plasmid, but only in the presence of RNase A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). These data are consistent with previous reports that A3G in 293T cells is only active as a deaminase after conversion from the HMM to LMM form using RNase A &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Dose dependence was also observed when the deaminase assay was performed with increasing amounts of cell lysate from 293FT cells transfected with a fixed amount of A3G plasmid and when the length of oligonucleotides containing the A3G cleavage site was varied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). The consistent low level of cleavage that was detected in cell lysates lacking significant A3G expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figures S2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">S2</xref>B) is likely due, at least in part, to other cytidine deaminase enzymes, given that the degree of cleavage induced by incubation with crude cell lysates lacking A3G was greater for CCC-containing oligos than for GGG-containing oligos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). While specific antibodies are not available for most APOBEC3 family members, we were able to assess A3F levels using an antibody that specifically recognizes A3F and not A3G (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C). In some experiments, we detected expression of APOBEC3F (A3F) in non-transfected 293FT cells, albeit at low levels (unpublished data). This may account for the A3G-independent baseline activity we observed in these cells since some of our oligos (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-st001">Table S1</xref>) also contain the TC dinucleotide motif recognized by A3F &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, we consistently observed activity above background levels that was mediated by A3G in a dose-dependent manner and encompassed a dynamic range of 900&#x02013;1,100 relative fluorescence units (RFU). Additionally, although others have reported a minimum length requirement of 16 bases for oligo binding by purified recombinant A3G &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, we were able to detect deamination by A3G from cell extracts using the FRET-based assay with oligos of 13 to 21 bases in length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B; unpublished data).</p><p>To measure the activity of A3G in the absence of cellular nucleases and other deaminases, we subjected lysates from 293FT cells transfected with A3G to immunoprecipitation with beads coupled to either affinity-purified A3G-specific antiserum (&#x003b1;A3G) or rabbit IgG under native conditions before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>D) or after (unpublished data) RNase A treatment. Using either approach, enzymatically active A3G was efficiently recovered following immunoprecipitation with &#x003b1;A3G, and increasing amounts of immunoprecipitation eluate resulted in a dose-dependent increase in A3G activity spanning a range of 833 RFU. Note that the A3G antiserum most likely immunoprecipitates A3G specifically since it is directed against the C-terminus of A3G, which differs considerably from the C-termini of other APOBEC family members. Consistent with this, A3G immunoprecipitation completely eliminates the baseline A3G-independent deamination activity that is observed when activity is measured in crude cell lysates (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>D with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">S2</xref>B). Finally, to further validate the FRET-based assay, we demonstrated that two A3G mutants that contain substitutions in both deaminase domains and are known to display substantially reduced enzymatic activity in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>&#x02013;based mutation assays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; also displayed 30- to 50-fold less activity than wild-type A3G in the FRET-based assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg002">Figure S2</xref>E). Thus, taken together, these results demonstrate that the FRET-based assay specifically detects catalytically active, exogenously expressed A3G from both crude cell lysates and immunoprecipitations over a dynamic range of 800 to 1,100 RFU.</p><p>Using our quantitative FRET-based assay for A3G activity, we asked whether A3G expressed endogenously in human cell lines exhibits similar levels of deaminase activity as A3G transfected into epithelial cells. For this purpose we used two human T cell lines: the H9 cells, described above, as well as CEM cells, which also express native A3G, albeit at lower levels than H9 cells. Moreover, for each T cell line, we chose input cell lysate amounts that were matched for A3G content with samples from transfected 293FT cells displaying high deaminase activity (i.e., transfected with 30&#x02013;100 ng of A3G plasmid). As expected, transfected A3G in 293FT cell lysate exhibited a dose-dependent increase in deaminase activity that was proportional to the relative amounts of A3G protein expressed by transfecting increasing amounts of plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). However, the signal produced by RNase-treated H9 cell lysate was 15-fold less than the signal produced by the lysate of 293FT cells containing a comparable amount of transfected A3G that was treated with RNase A and assayed in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; 43 RFU versus 678 RFU), consistent with what was found with the gel-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Similarly, RNase-treated CEM cell lysate produced a signal that was 30-fold less than a comparable amount of A3G expressed by transfection of 293FT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; 17 RFU versus 508 RFU). As expected, the amount of input cell lysate needed to achieve these levels of A3G was higher for CEM cells (as indicated by higher levels of the calreticulin loading control) due to their relatively low level of A3G expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="ppat-0030135-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A Quantitative FRET-Based Assay Reveals That Endogenous A3G in T Cell Lines Exhibits Very Low Specific Deaminase Activity Compared to Transfected A3G Expressed in Epithelial-Derived Cell Lines</title><p>(A) Deaminase activity of crude cell lysates from H9 and CEM T cell lines or from 293FT cells transfected with the indicated amounts of A3G plasmid DNA (pA3G) was determined as RFU using the FRET-based assay and was graphed.

We first determined the amount of A3G expressed at steady state in T cell lines and transfected HeLa cells by interpolation on a standard curve generated by parallel immunoblotting of aliquots of samples and known amounts of recombinant standards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A). H9 and CEM cells contained approximately 2.9 and 2.0 ng A3G/&#x003bc;g cellular protein, respectively, which was similar to the amount of A3G expressed in the transfected HeLa control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). We then calculated specific deaminase activity (deaminase activity per unit A3G protein) by normalizing the deaminase activity of each sample to the amount of A3G protein in each sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030135-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B), and found that the specific deaminase activity of endogenously expressed A3G in T cell lines was 36-fold lower than that of A3G transfected into HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Thus, even when normalized for A3G protein levels, deaminase activity appears to be inhibited in T cells.</p><p>Previous work showed that RNase treatment was needed to dissociate HMM complexes, which in turn was required for A3G enzymatic activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Velocity sedimentation gradients demonstrated that RNase A converted A3G in T cell lines from an HMM form to an LMM form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), indicating the effectiveness of the RNase A treatment. Thus, the low A3G activity in T cells is not due to A3G being retained in the HMM complex.</p><p>Since different T cell lines express significantly different amounts of A3G, we examined expression of A3G in several other T cell and monocyte lines by immunoblotting. Although many expressed little or no A3G (SupT1, U937, MOLT4, CEMSS, C8166) and others expressed low levels of A3G (CEM, Jurkat, A3.01), two cell lines (HSB2 and Hut 78) displayed levels of A3G similar to that of H9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Notably, the relative amounts of A3G protein seen by immunoblotting correlated well with the relative amounts of A3G mRNA observed by others in these cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. We examined the amount of deaminase activity in cell lines whose A3G amounts were within 2-fold of the amount of A3G observed in transfected 293FT cells. Despite excellent endogenous A3G expression, HSB2 and Hut78 cells, like H9 T cells, exhibited very little deaminase activity, even when assayed over a 20-fold range of total protein input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Note that transfected A3G expressed in 293FT cells displays a linear increase in activity over approximately a 10-fold range of input amounts, with activity then reaching a plateau consistent with saturation of the assay. When activity was normalized for A3G protein levels, we found that A3G from 293FTs had a specific deaminase activity of 6.1 RFU/ng A3G, while specific deaminase activity for A3G from all T cell lines tested was significantly lower, ranging from 0.32 to 0.91 RFU/ng A3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Similar results were observed in lysates prepared in the presence (unpublished data) or absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) of EDTA, and with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) or without (unpublished data) DNase treatment. Moreover, because the assay involves incubation of lysates for over an hour at 37 &#x000b0;C, we considered the possibility that degradation of A3G could occur over the course of the assay despite the use of a protease inhibitor cocktail during cell harvest, and that this could be more prominent in T cells than in other cell types. However, when aliquots of the assay were removed at the start (0 min) and during the assay (30, 60, and 90 min), no change was seen in the amount of A3G or calreticulin during the 37 &#x000b0;C incubation in H9, HSB2, Hut78, or transfected 293FT cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), ruling out selective A3G degradation as a cause of the very low deaminase activity levels in T cell lines. Thus, several different T cell lines that express significant amounts of A3G exhibited very low specific activity compared to exogenous A3G expressed in 293FT cell lines, and these differences could not be explained by assay conditions or other experimental parameters.</p><fig id="ppat-0030135-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Other T Cell Lines with High Levels of Endogenous A3G Protein Exhibit Very Low Specific Deaminase Activity</title><p>(A) Endogenous A3G protein levels from the indicated T cell lines, compared to 293FT cells mock-transfected (0 ng 293FT) or transfected with 10 ng A3G plasmid DNA, were determined by western blotting (WB) in two independent experiments (top versus bottom panels).

Again, despite RNase A treatment and the presence of similar amounts of A3G protein in the immunoprecipitation eluates, A3G immunoprecipitated from H9 and CEM cells displayed significantly less deaminase activity than A3G from 293FT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), suggesting that LMM A3G from T cells is less active than LMM A3G from transfected epithelial cell lines. Similar results were seen when lysates were pre-treated with RNase A prior to immunoprecipitation and when activity assays were performed directly on immunoprecipitation beads (unpublished data).

Thus, the deaminase activity of endogenous A3G present in unstimulated and stimulated primary human CD4&#x0002b; T cells was also inhibited relative to the deaminase activity of A3G transfected into epithelial cell lines, as was observed above for endogenous A3G in four human T cell lines.

Thus, in T cell lines and in primary T cells, activity of LMM A3G is much lower than expected, and this low activity is most likely not attributable to inhibitory RNA since the low activity is observed even after RNase A treatment.</p><fig id="ppat-0030135-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Endogenous A3G from Primary Human CD4&#x0002b; T Cells Exhibits Very Low Specific Deaminase Activity</title><p>(A) Deaminase activity of RNase A&#x02013;treated crude cell lysates from primary CD4&#x0002b; T cells, either resting or activated for 72 h, or from 293FT cells expressing the indicated amounts of A3G plasmid DNA (pA3G) was determined using the FRET-based assay and is graphed.

When we transfected 293FT cells with plasmids representing human A3G sequence variants that differ at two amino acid positions, one derived from A3G cDNA amplified from a CEM T cell line (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;) and the other from A3G cDNA amplified from human kidney cells (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;), we obtained similar deaminase-specific activity values (unpublished data), which argues against an inactive isoform present in T cells. To further distinguish among these possibilities, we first mixed lysate from non-transfected 293FT cells with lysate from H9 cells expressing endogenous A3G. Endogenous A3G activity from H9 cells was unchanged (unpublished data), suggesting that the activity observed in 293FT cells is not due to the presence of an activating factor. We next examined whether inhibition could be conferred to A3G-expressing 293FT lysates by simply adding lysates of human T cell lines. To keep A3G levels constant in these mixing experiments, we only added lysate from T cell lines (or control epithelial cell lines) that lacked detectable amounts of A3G. All lysates were RNase-treated in this experiment. First, we pre-incubated lysate from the A3G-deficient MOLT4 human T cell line or mock-transfected 293FT cells with labeled oligo, and then added cell lysate from 293FT cells expressing A3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Addition of a 4:1 ratio of crude MOLT4 lysate to A3G-expressing lysate led to a 26&#x00025; reduction in activity relative to 293FT, while a 9:1 ratio reduced activity by 98&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, graph).

These data suggested the presence of an inhibitor in the MOLT4 cell line that can alter the activity of A3G expressed by transfection of epithelial cell lines.

We altered our protocol so that A3G-expressing and A3G-deficient lysates were incubated together prior to the addition of oligo, and we examined lower amounts of A3G plasmid transfected into 293FT cells to more closely approximate physiological conditions. Addition of SupT1 cell lysate, but not lysate from non-transfected epithelial cell lines, produced a dose-dependent decrease in activity of transfected A3G at all levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Notably, when A3G was expressed at approximately physiological levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, 10 ng of A3G plasmid) in 293FT cells, a 1:1 ratio of crude T cell lysate to crude A3G-expressing 293FT lysate was sufficient to inhibit the deaminase activity of transfected A3G by 50&#x00025;, and a 4:1 ratio reduced transfected A3G activity to background levels. As expected, proportionately less inhibition was seen when lysate was added to 293FT cell lysate expressing A3G at higher than physiologic levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, 30 ng and 60 ng of A3G plasmid; also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Note that in this experiment, transfection efficiency was high, resulting in near saturating levels of A3G activity at 10 ng of transfected plasmid. Despite saturating levels of A3G activity, as A3G protein expression was increased with larger amounts of transfection plasmid, equivalent amounts of inhibitor became less effective. These data suggest that the inhibitor is present in limited quantities in SupT1 cells, allowing it to be titrated out by high levels of A3G. Moreover, although the inhibitory activity in T cell lysates was unaffected by DNase (unpublished data) or RNase, it was abolished when SupT1 lysate was heat treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Together, these data suggest that a protein(s) that is expressed in multiple T cell lines but not in epithelial-derived cell lines is responsible for the observed inhibition.</p><p>To further confirm the existence of an inhibited form of A3G in T cell lines, we partially purified LMM A3G from T cell lines and transfected 293FT cells by velocity sedimentation. A3G protein was primarily recovered in the LMM fractions for all cell lines after RNase A treatment followed by velocity sedimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, blots). LMM A3G from transfected 293FT cells displayed high levels of deaminase activity, as expected. In contrast, even larger amounts of LMM A3G isolated from endogenously expressing HSB2 and Hut78 T cell lines displayed negligible deaminase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, graph). To rule out the possibility that A3F, another APOBEC expressed in non-transfected 293FT cells and T cell lines, was responsible for the deaminase activity, we used A3F-specific and A3G-specific antisera to demonstrate that although A3F is present in crude 293FT and H9 cell extracts, it does not co-migrate with A3G in LMM fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). This finding is consistent with previous observations that A3F-containing HMM complexes are more RNase resistant than A3G-containing HMM complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, these results, which were obtained using an independent method, further demonstrate the existence of an enzymatically inhibited form of A3G in T cells.</p><fig id="ppat-0030135-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Active and Inhibited A3G Can Be Purified by Velocity Sedimentation</title><p>(A) HMM A3G fractions from Hut78, HSB2, 293FT cells, or 293FT cells transfected with A3G plasmid DNA (293FT-A3G) were isolated, treated with RNase A, subjected to velocity sedimentation, and fractionated (1&#x02013;12).

Microscopic examination of crude cell lysates revealed that they are largely free of nuclei following clarification (unpublished data). Nevertheless, it is possible that small amounts of nuclear contents leak into the supernatant prior to this clarification step. To examine the subcellular localization of the inhibitor, we mixed aliquots of LMM gradient fractions prepared from 293FT cells expressing A3G with either cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts (containing 5 &#x003bc;g of total protein) from non-transfected 293FT cells or MOLT4 cells, a T cell line that does not express significant quantities of A3G (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Addition of the MOLT4 cytoplasmic extract inhibited deaminase activity of A3G expressed exogenously in 293FT cells to a much greater extent than did cytoplasmic extract from non-transfected 293FT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), consistent with the results displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figure 6</xref>. In contrast, when the same amount of total protein was added in the form of nuclear extract from either MOLT4 or 293FT cells, little inhibition of A3G activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). These data suggest that T cell cytoplasm, rather than T cell nuclei, is the primary source of the inhibitory activity. Thus, it is unlikely that leakage of nuclear contents during harvest accounts for inhibition of A3G deaminase activity in T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we used two different cytidine deaminase assays&#x02014;a previously described gel-based assay and a novel FRET-based assay&#x02014;to compare A3G enzymatic activity in both exogenously and endogenously expressing cells. Although previous studies have documented deaminase activity in several cell types, including T cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, the present study constitutes the first report to our knowledge in which deaminase activity of A3G, expressed endogenously or by transfection and normalized to the amount of A3G protein, is directly compared in a variety of different cell types. Surprisingly, we found that for comparable amounts of A3G protein, enzymatic activity is much lower in T cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g002">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g004">4</xref>) and in resting or activated primary T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g005">Figure 5</xref>) than it is in epithelial-derived cell lines. These findings are consistent with a model in which (1) T cells contain an inhibitor of A3G activity, (2) epithelial-derived cell lines contain an activator of A3G activity, or (3) T cells contain a less active isoform of A3G. In support of the model in which an A3G inhibitor is expressed in T cells, we demonstrated that in the presence of RNase A or DNase, addition of lysate from A3G-deficient T cell lines (SupT1 or MOLT4) inhibits activity of A3G expressed in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g007">7</xref>C), whereas addition of lysate from epithelial-derived cell lines did not activate A3G from T cells. The ability of T cell lysates to confer inhibition to A3G expressed exogenously in 293FT cells also argues against an alternate isoform of A3G being present in T cells. Thus, these data suggest that when A3G is in the LMM form, i.e., in resting T cells or following conversion by RNase treatment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, it is capable of being inhibited by an RNase-insensitive factor(s) that is present or enriched in human T cells but not in epithelial-derived cell lines.</p><p>Experiments examining deaminase activity, taken together with experiments examining inhibition of deaminase activity by T cell lysates, suggest that the inhibitor is active in at least six T cell lines (H9, CEM, HSB2, Hut78, MOLT4, and SupT1), as well as in resting and activated peripheral blood CD4&#x0002b; T cells. Moreover, our studies suggest that the inhibitor most likely resides in the cytoplasm of T cells, which is where the vast majority of A3G is localized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, rather than in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g007">Figure 7</xref>D), although additional studies will be needed to verify this. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the inhibitor is either absent, present in lower abundance, or much less active in the transformed epithelial cell lines that we examined (293FT and HeLa). Whether the inhibitory factor is present in macrophages or other non-hematopoietic cell lines remains to be determined. Moreover, its exact mechanism of action is not known, although our studies indicate that it is insensitive to RNase A and DNase, but is sensitive to heat. These data suggest that the inhibitor is either a protein that interacts with A3G or an enzyme that modifies A3G post-translationally. Recent studies have found numerous proteins associated with A3G, although the majority interact with it in an RNA-dependent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; and are therefore unlikely to constitute the inhibitor described here. Similarly, other studies found that A3G associates with proteins that reside in P bodies in T cell lines and primary T cells, but these associations were also RNA dependent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although it is known that the deaminase activity of exogenously expressed A3G is inhibited when A3G associates with RNA in HMM complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; and that large ribonucleoprotein complexes are present in T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, other mechanisms for regulating A3G activity could also exist, especially given that A3G is in the LMM form in resting T cells. In fact, multiple mechanisms of post-translational regulation have been described for proteins related to A3G, including APOBEC1 and activation-induced deaminase (AID) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b042">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;<italic>.</italic> Thus, the host cell likely has multiple mechanisms for regulating A3G, especially given that APOBEC family members with unchecked deaminase activity can be mutagenic, causing tumors in vivo (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;). While some immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated an exclusively cytoplasmic location for A3G in epithelial cell lines (offering one potential mechanism to protect the host genome) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, another study reported that small amounts of A3G are present in nuclear fractions isolated from the H9 T cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that A3G may undergo nuclear shuttling in response to specific stimuli or by a novel mechanism. Since A3A, A3B, A3C, and A3H are known to localize to the nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, it is clear that other mechanisms besides cytoplasmic localization are used to protect the host genome from A3 proteins. Moreover, expression of A3G in yeast resulted in mutation of the yeast genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. This indicates that A3G can enter the nucleus in eukaryotic cells, and suggests that mechanisms for tightly regulating A3G deaminase activity are likely to exist &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the RNase-insensitive inhibition of A3G deaminase activity reported here is not completely surprising. Moreover, analogous forms of regulation, acting on other APOBEC3 family members, could exist. Little is known about the regulation of the related proteins A3F, which also has anti-retroviral activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, and A3A, A3B, and A3C, which act against endogenous retroelements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b053">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Use of the FRET-based, high-throughput assay described here with modifications in the substrate sequence should permit assessment of whether other APOBEC3 proteins also exhibit reduced enzymatic activity when expressed endogenously.</p><p>Notably, the presence of a factor that inhibits activity of A3G in T cells is consistent with data from other groups suggesting that deamination by A3G may not be required in order for A3G to be active &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although a detailed understanding of the effects of such an inhibitor must await its identification, such a mechanism for modulating A3G-mediated deamination could have multiple implications for our understanding of HIV pathogenesis. Since A3G can exert anti-HIV effects both when it is packaged into virions by producer cells and when it is present in resting T cells that are targets of infection, the role for an inhibitor may be different in these two contexts. The implications of an A3G inhibitor that is active in resting T cells is more obvious. The unexpected observation that HIV reverse transcripts isolated from resting T cells contain fewer mutations than expected from studies of A3G activity in epithelial cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; could be explained by the presence of a cellular inhibitor that blocks the A3G deaminase activity of LMM A3G, but does not inhibit antiviral activity that results from other mechanisms of A3G action.</p><p>On the other hand, a role for an inhibitor is less clear when A3G is packaged into virions. In the absence of Vif, HIV cannot initiate a productive infection in T cells. Reverse transcripts from &#x00394;Vif virons produced by H9 T cells show evidence of hypermutation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that the inhibitory factor must be removed or inactivated upon packaging of A3G into the virion or following initiation of reverse transcription. However, given that A3G that is packaged into virions can exert a deaminase-independent inhibitory effect on HIV replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, it is possible that some packaged A3G remains associated with the inhibitory factor and partially reduces A3G enzymatic activity. Further studies will be necessary to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>It is not yet known if and when this inhibitor acts in vivo. Numerous studies have detected G-to-A hypermutation with varying frequency in sequences from infected patient PBMCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b060">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. A single study examined the percentage of potential A3F and A3G target sequences (<bold>G</bold>A and <bold>G</bold>G on the coding strand, respectively) that were altered within 70 hypermutated sequences and identified sequences containing from 20&#x00025; to 94&#x00025; G-to-A substitution at these motifs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Hypermutation in patient samples could result from the generation of viral variants that lack Vif and consequently package A3G into virions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, or, alternatively, from Vif-independent A3G activity in resting T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, striking variability in the amount of hypermutation has been observed both in samples from infected patients and in T cells infected with Vif-encoding wild-type virus in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. In one study, the level of G-to-A hypermutation observed upon infection of CD4&#x0002b; T cells with wild-type virus in vitro depended on the timing of infection relative to T cell activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;, and therefore cannot be easily explained by sporadic generation of viral variants encoding mutations in Vif. In contrast, the RNase-independent inhibitor of A3G deaminase activity in T cells described here could account for at least some of the variability in G-to-A hypermutation observed upon infection of resting T cells, both in vitro and in patient samples. One implication of our findings is that such physiologic regulation of deaminase activity may need to be taken into account in studies correlating A3G mRNA and protein expression to pathogenesis. For example, variation in regulation of A3G deaminase activity in T cells could have contributed to conflicting results of studies addressing the consequences of A3G expression levels and polymorphisms for HIV disease susceptibility and progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b065">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that even modest amounts of inhibition of A3G deaminase activity in primary cells could have implications for the outcome of HIV infection in vivo. Others have suggested that sporadic inactivating mutations in Vif may generate a reservoir of diverse sequences that may function as a &#x0201c;genetic resource&#x0201d; to facilitate viral evolution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030135-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. While high levels of A3G activity would be expected to result in complete failure of virus propagation with antiviral consequences, reduced levels of A3G activity could result in virus that is viable and in fact exhibits increased rates of viral evolution due to the modest increase in mutation. Further study will be required to determine if the inhibitor described here can reduce the activity of endogenous A3G so that it fails to produce lethal hypermutation, and instead produces sub-lethal levels of mutation that benefit the virus by promoting viral adaptation. If so, then strategies that disrupt the inhibitor could help to increase T cell intrinsic immunity to HIV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids.</title><p>All A3G plasmids transfected in this study were untagged.

(1) In transfected 293T cells, A3G exists in an enzymatically inactive, HMM complex and is unable to deaminate the CCC-containing oligonucleotide substrate. The substrate remains uncleaved throughout subsequent steps, and consequently, the reporter fluorophore (R) is quenched by the quencher fluorophore (Q) and background fluorescence is detected. (2) In transfected 293T cells, RNase A treatment disrupts the HMM complex, converting A3G to an LMM, enzymatically active form. Upon incubation with substrate, deamination by A3G results in conversion of dC residues to dUs (a). Treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) leads to removal of dUs to create abasic sites (b). At high pH, the substrate is cleaved at the site of deamination (c), dissociating the reporter and quencher fluorophores and creating a fluorescent signal that can be detected by a luminometer (d). Note that depending on the oligo used, other detection methods can be used in step (d) to measure deaminase activity, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030135-g001">Figure 1</xref>.
