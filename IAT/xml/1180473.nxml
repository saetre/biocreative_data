Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been implicated in host defense. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether Chlamydophila pneumoniae (I) alters the expression of TLR2 and/orTLR4 in type II cells in a (II) Rho-GTPase- and (III) NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent pathway, subsequently (IV) leading to the production of (IV) pro-inflammatory TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Isolated rat type II pneumocytes were incubated with C. pneumoniae after pre-treatment with calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, inhibitors of NF-&#x003ba;B (parthenolide, SN50) or with a specific inhibitor of the Rho-GTPase (mevastatin). TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expressions were analyzed by PCR. Activation of TLR4, Rac1, RhoA protein and NF-&#x003ba;B was determined by Western blotting and confocal laser scan microscopy (CLSM) and TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 release by ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Type II cells constitutively expressed TLR4 and TLR2 mRNA. A prominent induction of TLR4 but not TLR2 mRNA was detected after 2 hours of incubation with C. pneumoniae. The TLR4 protein expression reached a peak at 30 min, began to decrease within 1&#x02013;2 hours and peaked again at 3 hours. Incubation of cells with heat-inactivated bacteria (56&#x000b0;C for 30 min) significantly reduced the TLR4 expression. Treated bacteria with polymyxin B (2 &#x003bc;g/ml) did not alter TLR4 expression. C. pneumoniae-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity was blocked by TLR4 blocking antibodies. TLR4 mRNA and protein expression were inhibited in the presence of BAPTA-AM, SN50 or parthenolide. TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 release was increased in type II cells in response to C. pneumoniae, whereas BAPTA-AM, SN50 or parthenolide decreased the C. pneumoniae-induced TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 release. Mevastatin inhibited C. pneumoniae-mediated Rac1, RhoA and TLR4 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TLR4 protein expression in rat type II cells is likely to be mediated by a heat-sensitive C. pneumoniae protein that induces a fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activity, necessary for maintenance of TLR4 expression and TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 release through possibly Rac and Rho protein-dependent mechanism. These results indicate that type II pneumocytes play an important role in the innate pulmonary immune system and in inflammatory response mechanism of the alveolus.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae</kwd><kwd>rat type II pneumocytes</kwd><kwd>TLR4</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The lung represents a site for the invasion of various bacteria or bacterial products. Along with alveolar macrophages, pulmonary epithelial cells are the first cells to be challenged by pathogenic microorganisms. The gram-negative bacterium Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) is an obligate intracellular pathogen causing acute and chronic pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The Toll-like receptor (TLR)-family is an integral part of the innate immune system and recognizes conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on microorganism. The interaction of TLRs with pathogen components initiates a signaling cascade that activates the adaptive immune response mechanisms which subsequently lead to inflammatory response and to the elimination of the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>TLRs are mainly expressed in professional immune cells in the alveolus. However, TLRs have also been found on type II pneumocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and could thus play an important role in the innate immune response at the alveolar surface area.</p><p>It is assumed that different TLRs recognize different classes of PAMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. TLR2 recognizes lipoproteins, peptidglycans and lipoteichoic acid. TLR4 is the receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates the LPS signal transduction together with other molecules such as CD14, MD-2, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Heat-shock protein (HSP) is one of the most phylogenetically conserved proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recent studies suggest, that chlamydial HSP stimulates innate immune and inflammatory responses by a TLR-mediated pathway, that is independent from LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Recognition of PAMPs by TLR results in early host defense as well as in the activation of an inflammatory response pathway that involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B). Furthermore, recognition of PAMPs induces the production of cytokines and stimulates the maturation of antigen-presenting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Type II pneumocytes are responsible for the metabolism of alveolar surfactant and have recently been suggested to play an important role in the inflammatory response of the lung. Little is known about events that are induced by an interaction of bacteria with type II cells. We have recently shown that the contact of C. pneumoniae with microvilli of type II cells induces changes in cytoskeleton and leads to activation of NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Here, we tested whether C. pneumoniae stimulates expression of TLR2 and/orTLR4 in type II cells to induce the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x003b1; and chemokine MIP-2 via Rho-GTPase-and NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent pathways. The identification of the involved pathways is essential for the understanding of the innate immune defense mechanisms and pulmonary inflammatory response of the alveolus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culturing</title><p>C. pneumoniae strain TW183 was cultured and purified as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 &#x000d7; g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Titer determination in cycloheximide-treated HEp-2 cells was performed with a thawed aliquot (in triplicate). Aliquots diluted with an equal volume of sucrose-phosphate-glutamate buffer supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. C. pneumoniae concentrations used were expressed as inclusion forming units (IFU)/ml. Type II pneumocytes were isolated from the lungs of adult male Wistar rats (body weight 120&#x02013;140 g) according to Dobbs et al.

The extra cellular portion of the TLR is directly involved in the recognition of various pathogens. C. pneumoniae are known to enter and persist in humane type II pneumocytes in chronic but not acute pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The role of TLR in the pulmonary host defense system is unknown.</p><p>The present study on the interaction of type II pneumocytes with C. pneumoniae helps to understand the role of TLR4 within the innate immunity and inflammatory response mechanism of the lung. The study demonstrates that TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA is expressed constitutively in isolated rat type II cells. Incubation of alveolar type II cells with C. pneumoniae for 2 hours increased TLR4 but not TLR2 mRNA expression. Thus, TLR4 expression of rat type II cells is highly responsive to C. pneumoniae.</p><p>TLR4 is localized in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of type II cells. Incubation of type II cells with C. pneumoniae increased the expression of TLR4 at the external cell membrane surface within 10&#x02013;30 min. Whereas the expression of TLR4 reached a peak value 30 min after C. pneumoniae contact, the TLR4 expression was less prominent after 60&#x02013;120 min of incubation. An incubation time of 180 min was again associated with a high TLR4 expression. The data suggests, that constitutively expressed TLR4 in type II pneumocytes is rapidly responding to C. pneumoniae contact and mediates cellular responses to C. pneumoniae components at a post-transcriptional level. Thus, it seems as if C. pneumoniae is captured by constitutively expressed receptors very rapidly. To enable further binding of C. pneumoniae components, newly synthesized TLR4 is required. The decreased TLR4 expression due to C. pneumoniae binding at the cellular surface and the subsequent up-regulation of TLR4 expression could represent a barrier to prevent uncontrolled stimulation.</p><p>Various studies show that TLR4 is constitutively expressed in distinct human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates the activation of TLR4 signaling in human alveolar type II-like (A549) and tracheo-bronchial (BEAS-2B, 16-HBE, and NT-1) epithelial cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, LPS increased the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein in human primary type II pneumocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In normal human lung TLR2 mRNA and protein is mainly expressed in type II cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Whereas TLR4 is generally believed to be the receptor that mediates LPS responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], TLR2 mediates the inflammatory response to components of gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria. However, TLR2 also mediates LPS-induced cellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Different cells are activated by C. pneumoniae or cellular chlamydial components in a TLR2 and/or TLR4-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the TLR4 protein expression in rat type II cells is independent of chlamydial LPS. In addition, our results with heat-inactivated bacteria implicate that TLR4 expression is most likely mediated by a heat-sensitive chlamydial protein. C. pneumoniae and LPS free components of chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60) were described to trigger inflammatory and cytokine responses in a TLR2-or TLR4-dependent way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It can be speculated that the TLR ligand is a protein component of the outer membrane of C. pneumoniae, with cHSP60 being a possible candidate.</p><p>One regulator of TLR signaling is the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor, which controls the expression of many genes involved in the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In vivo studies showed, that LPS induces NF-&#x003ba;B activation of type II cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with HSP60 triggers a signal cascade of protein kinase p38 and JNK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], that subsequently leads to NF-&#x003ba;B activation. We have recently shown that C. pneumoniae contact with the type II cell membrane activates the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the present study blockade of the TLR4 receptor at the cell membrane level reduced the C. pneumoniae-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation in type II cells. Thus, results are in accordance with studies on mouse macrophages and human endothelial cells showing, that activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60) requires TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>We demonstrate that C. pneumoniae-mediated TLR4 mRNA and protein expression is attenuated by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and by inhibition of nuclear factor NF-&#x003ba;B with parthenolide or SN50. LPS-mediated TLR2 mRNA up-regulation in murine alveolar macrophages was attenuated by inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B with sulfasalazine or SN50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>BAPTA-AM, SN50 and parthenolide inhibited C. pneumoniae-mediated TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 release in rat type II pneumocytes. It can be concluded that the calcium-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation is required for the transcriptional induction of TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2. Our findings support the idea that contact of C. pneumoniae with TLR4 triggers signal transduction and cytokine release. Contact of C. pneumoniae with TLR2 and TLR4 bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells (BMDDC) leads to the translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B as well as secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. HSP60 from C. pneumoniae causes a TLR2-and TLR4-dependent increase in serum levels of MIP-2 in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Intrapulmonary administration of Haemophilus influenzae in the mouse leads to TLR4-mediated TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 expression by an activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in epithelial cells of the conducting airways. This suggests that the airway epithelia contribute to recognition of H. influenzae infection and induction of the innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The role of alveolar type II cells in the regulation of lung inflammation is less clear. In vitro studies suggest that LPS-treatment of primary cultured type II cells from adult rat lungs leads to a TNF-&#x003b1; release, which initiates the synthesis and release of chemokines like MIP-2. Subsequently, the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lung is promoted. These data indicate that a direct bacterial stimulation of alveolar epithelial cells can initiate the local host defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we demonstrated that NF-&#x003ba;B activation is involved in the calcium-mediated reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton after C. pneumoniae contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. LPS induces the depolymerization of the cytoskeleton by mediating the TNF-&#x003b1; production in alveolar type II cells and may thus facilitate the migration of inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Small GTPases of the Rho family (Rac and Rho) play an important role in several signal networks including actin cytoskeleton dynamics, transcriptional regulation, and membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. RhoA controls the assembly of actin and myosin stress fibers. Rac1 regulates the formation of membrane ruffles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Data of the present study demonstrate that C. pneumoniae-induced TLR4 activation is Rac1 and RhoA protein mediated. Mevastatin, a specific inhibitor of the Rho-GTPase family, reduced the C. pneumoniae-mediated activation of TLR4, Rac1 and RhoA protein. In dendritic cells, TLR activation stimulates the antigen capture via F-actin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Mevastatin (compactin) blocked the invasion of C. pneumoniae in Hep2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. C. pneumoniae infection of vascular smooth muscle cells increased Rac1 and RhoA proteins and NF-&#x003ba;B expression that was suppressed by statin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These results suggest a signaling cascade by which C. pneumoniae contact with the cell membrane leads to the activation of Rho family GTPases. The subsequent changes in actin cytoskeletal structure are essential for TLR4 expression and the activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. The latter controls the expression of many genes involved in the innate immune system and adaptive inflammatory immune response.</p><p>We have recently shown, that C. pneumoniae changes the cytoskeleton of type II pneumocytes by NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The current work demonstrates that NF-&#x003ba;B activation induces an inflammatory cascade that could support the local host defense. In healthy lungs, the pulmonary surfactant represents a barrier that can prevent the invasion of bacteria. However, C. pneumoniae inhibits the surfactant metabolism of isolated type II cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, C. pneumoniae induce an immune response that prevents the invasion of C. pneumoniae into type II cells. Simultaneously, the impaired surfactant metabolism will enable bacteria to enter type II cells. The resulting net effect remains to be studied in vivo. Clinical data show, that no intracellular C. pneumoniae are found in patients with acute pneumonia, but in patients with chronic pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It could be assumed that C. pneumoniae-induced alterations of type II cell cytoskeleton and surfactant metabolism will impair the host defense. Subsequently, more type II cells are invaded by C. pneumoniae, causing the clinical picture of chronic pneumonia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TLR4 protein expression in rat type II cells is most likely stimulated by a heat-sensitive C. pneumoniae protein. The induction of a rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activity is required for TLR4 expression and TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2release. A Rac1 and RhoA protein-dependent mechanism seems to be involved. These results implicate that TLR4 plays an important role in the innate pulmonary immune defense mechanism and in the inflammatory response of the alveolus.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HW performed immunocytochemistry and CLSM, conceived and co-ordinated the study, acquired the data and wrote the manuscript.
