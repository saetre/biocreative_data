GSL are classified into different series defined by their respective core structures. In vertebrates, the main GSL series are called ganglio-, lacto-, globo-, isoglobo-, and muco-series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The functional significance of GSL is diverse since these glycoconjugates have been implicated in processes such as cell adhesion, cell migration, regulation of signaling proteins and binding of pathogens and toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The repertoire of GSL expressed by an organism is subject to changes according to cell type and developmental stage. Consequently, several stem cell and differentiation markers of early embryonic development, such as the stage-specific embryonic antigens SSEA-1, -3 and -4, represent carbohydrate epitopes carried by GSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The diversity of GSL is shaped by the action of multiple glycosyltransferase enzymes localized in the Golgi apparatus. The inactivation of key glycosyltransferase genes allows investigation of the functional specificity of individual GSL structures or of a whole GSL series. The &#x003b2;1,3 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (B3gnt5) enzyme initiates the formation of the lactoseries GSL by transferring GlcNAc in a &#x003b2;1,3-linkage to lactosylceramide. This transfer event leads to the synthesis of the Lc3 structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene is expressed during mouse development and then again later mainly in the spleen and placenta in adult mice. Additionally <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>transcripts are found in the adult mouse brain where <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>expression is limited to cerebellar Purkinje cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Biosynthesis of GSL core structures</bold>. GSL biosynthesis is initiated by the transfer of Glc to ceramide (Cer) catalyzed by the Ugcg enzyme. After addition of &#x003b2;1,4-linked Gal by Lac-Cer synthase, distinct core structures are defined by the action of different glycosyltransferases. The B3gnt5 enzyme catalyzes the Lc3 structure, which is the core of lactoseries GSL. The elongation of Lc3 by a &#x003b1;1,3-fucosyltransferase and a &#x003b2;1,4-galactosyltransferase yields the SSEA-1 antigen. &#x025cf;, Glc; &#x025cb;, Gal; &#x025a0;, GlcNAc; &#x025c6; Sia; &#x025b2;, Fuc.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-8-109-1"/></fig><p>The B3gnt5 enzyme has been shown to be key in the expression of sulfoglucuronylglycolipids (SGGL) in the developing nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. SGGL are expressed in a regulated manner during embryonic brain development and again postnatally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For example, SGGL carry the HNK-1 epitope, which has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, the developmentally regulated expression of SGGL coincides with certain cell migration and differentiation phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The B3gnt5 enzyme also initiates the formation of the SSEA-1 epitope, which is identical to the Lewis X antigen. SSEA-1 corresponds to the trisaccharide Gal&#x003b2;1,4(Fuc&#x003b1;1,3)GlcNAc which is first found on 8-cell stage embryos and in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The SSEA-1 epitope, which is mainly found on lactoseries derived GSL, is believed to participate in the regulation of cell adhesion during embryogenesis, cell differentiation, and development of the neuronal system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In order to study the developmental and physiological processes mediated by lactoseries derived GSL, we have inactivated the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene in mice by homologous recombination in ES cells. This mouse model suggests an essential contribution of the lactoseries derived GSL series in the very early stages of mouse development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To address the functional role of the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene in mouse development and physiology, we inactivated this gene by homologous recombination in mouse ES cells.

After selection with G418 and screening of 300 cell clones, we identified four ES cell clones bearing the homologous recombined allele. The homologous recombination at the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>locus was confirmed using both PCR and genomic Southern blot analysis. The genomic Southern probe distinguished between the wildtype and the null allele by producing diagnostic EcoRI fragments of 3 kbp and 2.3 kbp, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The absence of chromosomal aberrations was verified by karyotyping the four homologously recombined ES cells (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene targeting in ES cells</bold>.

Two male chimeric founders were obtained from the blastocysts microinjected with the two R1 ES cell clones, whereas the microinjection of TC1 ES cells did not yield any viable offspring. The chimeric males were mated with wildtype C57BL/6 females and the F1 progeny screened with PCR for germ line transmission of the disrupted allele. Both chimeric males transmitted the null allele to their progeny. Offspring positive for the disrupted gene were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for five generations. All the heterozygous offspring obtained from the chimeric males were grossly normal. Both male and females carriers of the null allele were obtained. Heterozygote mice were then bred to produce homozygous-null offspring. After crossing 17 independent heterozygote breeding pairs, no homozygous-null offspring were detected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The ratio of wildtype to heterozygous-null mice was 34% to 66%, thus corresponding to a Mendelian allele distribution assuming a complete lethality of homozygous-null offspring. Since the expression of the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene was shown to be elevated in embryos by mid-gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we genotyped 69 embryos isolated at E10 to assess whether homozygous-null embryos could be detected. The size and morphology of the embryos isolated at that stage were normal (data not shown) and the genotypic analysis demonstrated that 29.1% and 70.9% of embryos were wildtype and heterozygous-null, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Notably, no sites of resorption were observed in the uteri examined at mid-gestation. To identify whether the lack of embryonic development in <italic>B3gnt5</italic>-null mice was related to an implantation defect, we setup time-matings of heterozygous-null mice and examined the genotype of resulting embryos at the blastocyst stage.

Accordingly, we examined the level of <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene expression in the R1 and TC1 ES cells by quantitative PCR. The <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>mRNA levels were identical in the two cell lines and comparable to the expression of the housekeeping <italic>Polr2a </italic>polymerase gene (data not shown). Because the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the lactoseries derived GSL, we also analyzed GSL profiles quantitatively in wildtype and in <italic>B3gnt5</italic>-targeted R1 and TC1 ES cells. GSL were isolated from ES cells by organic solvent extraction and digested by ceramide glycanase to release the carbohydrate moiety. The resulting oligosaccharides were labeled with 2-aminobenzamide at their reducing end and separated by HPLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The comparison between wildtype and <italic>B3gnt5</italic>-targeted ES cells showed decreased amounts of several GSL structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The lactoseries GSL Lc3, the product of the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>enzyme, was not detected in ES cells. However, its elongation products, the lactoseries derived Lc5 and Lc6 were identified and found to be present at lower levels in <italic>B3gnt5</italic>-targeted ES cells. The decreased amounts of GSL found in <italic>B3gnt5</italic>-targeted ES cells were not limited to lacto-series GSL, since the gangliosides GM3, GM1, GD1 and the globosides Gb3, Gb5 were also reduced. The identity of the oligosaccharide structures detected by HPLC was confirmed by mass-spectrometry. The oligosaccharide sequences were further examined by fragmentation analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

Our study suggests an essential role of this GSL series in pre-implantation embryonic development by showing that <italic>B3gnt5</italic>-null blastocysts could not be retrieved from heterozygous matings. The expression of the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene from the two-cell stage up to the blastocyst stage would suggest a role for lactoseries derived GSL in cell-cell adhesion, possibly contributing to embryo compaction and implantation. Similarly, the SSEA-1 antigen has been shown to mediate the tight adhesion of blastomeres, since the addition of multivalent SSEA-1 structures promotes embryo decompaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The formation of the SSEA-1 antigen requires the action of the &#x003b1;1,3 fucosyltransferase FUT9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The disruption of the <italic>Fut9 </italic>gene in mice abolished the formation of the SSEA-1 antigen in pre-implantation embryos, but this loss did not affect the compaction and implantation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This finding showed that the fucose residue is critical for marking the antigen but that fucose is dispensable for the potential adhesion properties of the lactoseries derived structure.</p><p>The early lethality observed in the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene disruption model contrasts with the phenotype described for mice lacking the ceramide glucosyltransferase <italic>Ugcg </italic>gene, which initiates GSL biosynthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). <italic>Ugcg </italic>homozygous-null embryos have been reported to die between embryonic days E7.5 and E9.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since Ugcg activity is required for the formation of lactoseries derived GSL, the reverse order would be expected for the onset of lethality in the <italic>Ugcg </italic>and <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene disruptions. A similar paradoxical situation was observed in the globoside GSL pathway when comparing the phenotypes resulting from the disruptions of the &#x003b1;1,4 galactosyltransferase Gb3-synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and &#x003b2;1,3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase Gb4-synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] genes. Mice lacking the Gb3-synthase gene developed normally and did not show any physiological abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. By contrast, the disruption of the Gb4-synthase gene arrested development at the blastocyst stage and prevented the implantation of mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This apparent discrepancy may have different causes. It is possible that the loss of Ugcg activity is compensated for by other glycosyltransferase activities expressed during pre-implantation stages. However, no glycosyltransferase has been described with such activity yet and no proteins similar to the Ugcg enzyme could be retrieved from the mouse genome so far. Alternatively, it is possible that the expression of the <italic>Ugcg </italic>gene in unfertilized oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] yields enough of the Ugcg enzyme to sustain the formation of Glc-Cer until gastrulation.</p><p>The enzymatic characterization of the B3gnt5 protein has shown a significant N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity towards the monosaccharide Gal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore it is conceivable that B3gnt5 may act on Gal-termini found on N- or O-linked glycans. However, it is likely that pre-implantation lethality is in fact mediated by a defect of GSL biosynthesis, since defects in N- or O-linked glycan elongations lead to post-implantation lethal phenotypes at the earliest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Indeed, the inactivation of the B3gnt2 gene, a paralog of B3gnt5 that mediates the formation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains on glycoproteins, does not impair embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Even if the pre-implantation lethality observed in the <italic>B3gnt5</italic>-null embryos is caused by a defect of GSL biosynthesis, the question remains whether the loss of <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>solely affects the lactoseries derived GSL pathway. Our analysis of GSL profiles in ES cells bearing a <italic>B3gnt5</italic>-null allele showed decreased levels of additional GSL structures, such as the gangliosides GM3, GM1, GD1 and the globosides Gb3, Gb5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Earlier work has documented the physical interaction of glycosyltransferases involved in GSL biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], suggesting that the loss of a single enzyme might destabilize the localization and thereby the activity of other enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The disruption of the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene leads to the earliest lethality reported for a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, thereby underlining the essential role of lactoseries derived GSL and possibly of protein-bound &#x003b2;3GlcNAc-linked glycans in pre-implantation embryogenesis. Because of this early lethality, the role of these glycoconjugates in subsequent developmental pathways could not be determined in the present model. The expression pattern of the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>gene at gastrulation and at later stages would support the involvement of <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>products in processes such as neurogenesis and brain development.

The left arm, a 1.7-kbp BstXI-NdeI fragment that includes 400 bp of the <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>exon 4, was inserted blunt-end into the NotI site of pPGK-Neo and the right arm of the targeting vector was subcloned blunt-end as a 3.6-kbp BstXI-XbaI fragment into the EcoRV site of pPGK-Neo. Using this construct, a stretch of 745 bp encoding the catalytic domain of <italic>B3gnt5 </italic>was replaced by the PGK-Neo cassette (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The targeting vector was linearized at the unique Sac II site and 10 &#x003bc;g were electroporated into 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells of line R1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and TC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].
