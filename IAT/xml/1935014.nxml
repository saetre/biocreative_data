Impairment of regulation of mRNA stability was implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, inflammatory diseases and Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Enzymes involved in RNA degradation fall into two major classes: endoribonucleases, which cleave RNAs internally and exoribonucleases, which degrade RNAs from the ends. The phylogenetic distribution of endo- and exoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>) in genomes clearly shows that different species vary considerably with respect to the number and variety of the RNases they harbor. Interestingly, two ribonucleases that are essential in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> do not have homologous counterparts in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>: RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and oligoribonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Belonging to the degradosome, RNase E is widely believed to be the enzyme initiating mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Oligoribonuclease, Orn, is the only known exoribonuclease that is essential in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The essentiality in <italic>E. coli</italic> is due to its unique ability to degrade RNA oligonucleotides with a length of 5&#x02009;nt and shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>), and oligonucleotides of these lengths were shown to accumulate in a conditional <italic>orn</italic>-mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We would like to introduce the term &#x02018;nanoRNA&#x02019; here to distinguish these extremely short oligonucleotides from the longer microRNAs. We chose the term nano in reference to its roots: Nano originates from the Greek word nanos, which means dwarf. Micro on the other hand descends from the Greek word mikros, which means small. Nano is therefore used in this context simply to articulate &#x02018;smaller than&#x02019; micro.</p><p>A recent study reveals the structural basis for the constraints preventing RNase II as a member of the RNR exoribonuclease family from degrading oligonucleotides shorter than 5&#x02009;nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). Another member of this exoribonuclease family, RNase R was shown to processively degrade RNA in a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; directed manner until a di- or trimer remains which cannot be degraded further by this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This size limit is therefore likely to be common at least among the members of this important family of exoribonucleases. This highlights the importance of enzymes that have the ability to degrade nanoRNA and thus bring the degradation of RNA to completion. Absence of an oligoribonuclease in Firmicutes is in contrast to its general presence in Gram-negative prokaryotic genomes as well as in eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This prompted us to question which enzyme could functionally replace oligoribonuclease in these organisms.</p><p>We had recently discovered an unexpected link between sulfur- and RNA metabolism: oligoribonuclease binds to 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphate (pAp) and is sensitive to micromolar amounts of the nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). pAp is generated in sulfur assimilation and was implicated in the molecular mechanism of lithium's action in the treatment of bipolar disorder due to strong inhibition of pAp-phosphatase by lithium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The interaction between pAp and oligoribonuclease was documented for <italic>E. coli</italic> oligoribonuclease, Orn and its human homolog, Sfn (15). The purpose of this work was to explore whether the conserved interaction between pAp and oligoribonucleases could be exploited to identify a functional analog of Orn in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Surprisingly, the protein identified by this route, YtqI, points to the existence of an even closer link between sulfur- and RNA-metabolism in this organism: YtqI can degrade both nanoRNA and pAp <italic>in vitro</italic>. The pAp-degrading activity of YtqI is similar in magnitude to that of CysQ, the pAp-phosphatase from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Consistent with its <italic>in vitro</italic> activities, YtqI can replace both Orn and pAp-phosphatase (CysQ) in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains were grown in LB or MOPS minimal medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) containing 40&#x02002;&#x003bc;g/ml of amino acids as indicated, K-phosphate at 2&#x02009;mM, vitamin B1&#x02009;at 0.0005%, biotin at 0.001% when needed, glycerol at 0.4%, glucose or arabinose as indicated. <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was grown in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).

For analysis of the reaction products, 1.5 or 2.5&#x02002;&#x003bc;l of samples were applied to PAA gel electrophoresis on a 22% SDS-PAA gel containing 2&#x000d7; TBE and run in 2&#x000d7; TBE. Fluorescent RNA oligos were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics STORM 860 in 650-nm long-pass filter mode. Quantification of the data was done by calculating the percent of fluorescence of each band at a given time point relative to the total fluorescence of the same time point. Separating reaction products on 22% SDS-PAA gels, we observed a reverse migration phenomenon. This effect can be accounted for by the fact that cyanine dyes have a lower net negative charge than nucleic acids: thus, removing nucleotides will reduce the charge relative to the mass of the oligonucleotide and cause it to shift up instead of down.</p><p>Inhibition of YtqI-catalyzed degradation of RNA 5-mers (5&#x02032;Cy5-CCCCC3&#x02032;) by pAp was performed in 30&#x02002;&#x003bc;l reactions containing 3&#x02002;&#x003bc;M substrate RNA 5-mers, 9&#x02002;&#x003bc;g YtqI and pAp as indicated.

One-fourth of the total volume of labeled decade-marker was used per gel; this amount corresponded to &#x0223c;800&#x02009;000&#x02009;c.p.m. A previously characterized nuclease (with DNase and RNase activity) from <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, YhaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) served as positive control in experiments on RNA 24-mers.

On plates, a similar effect could be observed in the absence of Atc; transformants of strain UM341 with pBAD18 produced pinpoint-sized colonies that stopped growing, while transformants with the <italic>orn</italic> carrying plasmid were significantly larger after overnight exposure and continued to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Design of the conditional P<sub>LtetO-1</sub><italic>orn</italic> mutant.

In the presence of manganese, YtqI was able to degrade nanoRNA 5-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The activity in the presence of other ions tested (magnesium, zinc and calcium) was negligible (data not shown). Comparing YtqI- and Orn-catalyzed degradation of nanoRNA 5-mers, we noticed significant differences: The amount of YtqI required for appreciable activity was two orders of magnitude higher than that necessary for Orn-catalyzed activity. In addition, the pattern of degradation products as well as the kinetics of this reaction looked very different. Here, 3-mers were virtually missing and other intermediates (2-mers and 4-mers) accumulated less than in Orn-catalyzed hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that 3-mers might be a preferred substrate for YtqI and as such they might be hydrolyzed so fast that accumulation could not be observed. We tested this hypothesis by comparing degradation of 3-mers and 5-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We used three times more enzyme in the reaction with 5-mers as substrate in order to obtain appreciable conversion into monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) as compared to the reaction on 3-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Turnover numbers for 3-mers were one order of magnitude higher than for 5-mers (1.5 versus 0.14&#x02009;pmol/&#x003bc;g/min). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, we compare the kinetics of the disappearance of different substrates (3-mers or 5-mers) and the appearance of the final reaction product monomers in reactions with equal amounts of YtqI (1.5&#x02002;&#x003bc;g). These results clearly document that 3-mers were a much better substrate for YtqI than 5-mers. Moreover, it seems that degradation of 3-mers to 2-mer was the fastest step in catalysis as the 2-mers formed here disappeared considerably slower. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Comparison of YtqI and Orn-catalyzed degradation of nanoRNA 5-mers.

We had reported before that Orn-catalyzed degradation of nanoRNA is highly sensitive to pAp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Therefore, we decided to test the possibility (i) first. Unlike what we observed with Orn, the addition of small amounts of pAp to the YtqI-catalyzed reaction (10, 20 and 50&#x02002;&#x003bc;M) did not produce an easily observable effect on degradation of nanoRNA. At 100, 200 or 500&#x02002;&#x003bc;M pAp the activity of YtqI based on the conversion of 5-mer into monomers in 30&#x02009;min dropped to 28, 4 and 1%, respectively (data not shown).

YtqI converted 6&#x02009;nmol of pAp/&#x003bc;g/minute.

YtqI was present in Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi and in the delta subdivision of Proteobacteria. Orn, however, was present in beta and gamma-Proteobacteria and in Actinobacteria. This distribution points to some anti-correlation: the presence of one of the genes seemed to exclude the presence of the second one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The two proteins of different origin might therefore exert the same function. Some Actinobacteria were exceptional in that they had both <italic>orn</italic> and <italic>ytqI</italic>.

This figure shows that most organisms that had YtqI, did not have CysQ or Orn. Whereas the overlap between organisms carrying both Orn and CysQ was considerable (58% of the species having Orn have also CysQ), only 21% of the species having YtqI had also CysQ, and only 11% of species having YtqI carried also Orn. This distribution supports our hypothesis that YtqI might fulfill the function of two proteins, Orn and CysQ. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Distribution of CysQ, Orn and YtqI in bacterial genomes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm462f8"/></fig></p><p>Interestingly, while Orn was absent in all sequenced archeal genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), YtqI was represented in 42% of them.</p><p>A complete list of genomes investigated and details concerning presence of YtqI, Orn or CysQ orthologs is shown in Table S1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study was conducted in order to search in the model organism <italic>B. subtilis</italic> for a functional analog of <italic>E. coli</italic> oligoribonuclease, Orn. Encouraged by the observation that the pAp-oligoribonuclease interaction is conserved between <italic>E. coli</italic> and humans, we identified YtqI as potential functional Orn analog through its binding to pAp. The other <italic>B. subtilis</italic> proteins interacting with pAp, HisIE and GuaC, are of known function and were not the focus of this study. It is however noteworthy that the interaction between HisIE and pAp was observed previously using <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), which points to biological relevance of this interaction.</p><p>YtqI belongs to the DHH family of phosphoesterases, more specifically to the DHHA1 subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), some members of which are involved in nucleic acid metabolism. It was therefore a good candidate for a functional Orn analog. YtqI can complement a conditional <italic>orn</italic> mutant in <italic>E. coli</italic> when expressed at similar levels as Orn. This complementation does not require high amounts of YtqI, as expression levels that are below the detection limit of Anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibodies are sufficient. Recombinant YtqI is able to degrade nanoRNA 5-mers <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of manganese. Whereas Orn is essential in <italic>E. coli</italic>, YtqI is not essential in <italic>Bacillus</italic>. This points to the existence of at least one more enzyme with the ability to degrade nanoRNA.</p><p>The pattern of degradation products on the PAA gel as well as the kinetics of their appearance make it clear that Orn and YtqI employ different mechanisms for the degradation of nanoRNA. 5-mers are not a good substrate for YtqI, they might be degraded in a distributive rather than a processive way. Another obvious difference was the absence of 3-mers from the degradation pattern. One possible explanation for this could be a preferred degradation of 3-mers into 2-mers. When used as substrate, 3-mers are degraded much faster than 5-mers, requiring approximately 10 times less enzyme than 5-mers for complete degradation. We therefore concluded that 3-mers are much better substrates than 5-mers. This <italic>in vitro</italic> result could reflect the intriguing possibility that YtqI acts preferentially on 3-mers <italic>in vivo</italic> and cannot efficiently degrade 5-mers. In this case, the fact that YtqI can complement Orn in <italic>E. coli</italic> could suggest that the accumulation of 3-mers and not 5-mers is the main cause of growth deficiency in <italic>E. coli</italic> lacking Orn. According to the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), 90% of RNA degradation in <italic>E. coli</italic> is done hydrolytically, implying a more significant contribution of RNase II and RNase R as compared to PNPase. The relative contribution of RNase II and RNase R is under dispute; RNase II was considered to be the main contributor to mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), but this result was questioned by a genome-wide analysis of mRNA levels in a strain deleted for RNase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The end products of degradation catalyzed by RNase II and RNase R differ slightly in size; for RNase II experimental data indicate 3&#x02013;5-mers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or 4&#x02013;6-mers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) as final product and 4-mers according to the structural model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and RNase R leaves 2&#x02013;3-mers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) or 1&#x02013;2-mers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The size range of fragments produced by RNase R seems to be more suitable for degradation by YtqI than that of oligonucleotides produced by RNase II. The importance of RNase R is increasingly recognized. RNase R has the ability to degrade stable RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and contributes to quality control of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). More recently this enzyme was shown to be involved in the degradation of mRNA substrates with extensive secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In addition, RNase R was shown to increase dramatically under different stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>). <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> harbors only one member of the RNR family of exoribonucleases, RNase R, which seems to be equally important for the degradation of highly structured RNA as its counterpart in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Another requirement for oligonucleotide degradation might also come from systems expressed under the control of cyclic dGMP. Indeed this regulatory molecule is degraded by a phosphodiesterase, which should result in formation of pGpG, a dinucleotide that needs to be further degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>We previously demonstrated that Orn and Sfn bind pAp, but cannot degrade it, instead pAp is a strong inhibitor of these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). YtqI however can degrade pAp <italic>in vitro</italic>; it also complements a <italic>cysQ</italic> mutant in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Both results clearly indicate that YtqI is a pAp-phosphatase. The phenotype of an <italic>ytqI</italic> mutant in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> resembles that of an <italic>E. coli cysQ</italic> deletion: growth is impaired in the absence of cysteine. Withdrawal of cysteine causes doubling times to increase 1.6-or 2.3-fold in an <italic>ytqI</italic> mutant in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> or an <italic>E. coli cysQ</italic> mutant, respectively. The effect of withdrawal of cysteine seems therefore slightly more moderate in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> lacking YtqI than in <italic>E. coli</italic> lacking CysQ. In fact, the difference between <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> in this respect could be somewhat larger, considering the fact that <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MG1655 used in our experiments has a rather leaky <italic>cysQ</italic> mutant phenotype as compared to other strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). One possible explanation for this interspecies difference could be bispecificity of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> protein CysH1. This enzyme has the ability to reduce both PAPS and APS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, expression of <italic>B. subtilis cysH1</italic> can complement an <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant defective for APS kinase encoded by <italic>cysC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). This raises the possibility that APS could be reduced directly in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, which would bypass the requirement for PAPS synthesis and thus pAp accumulation could be unnecessary. The direct reduction of APS is commonly used in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and was documented for some bacteria including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and <italic>Rhizobium meliloti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>The existence of a second enzyme able to hydrolyze pAp could be an alternative explanation for the only partial growth defect of the <italic>ytqI</italic> mutant in the

and in particular the anti-correlation is in agreement with the hypothesis that YtqI fulfills the functions of two proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, Orn and CysQ.</p><p>Until now, RNase R was the only exoribonuclease known in the small genomes of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Noteworthy is therefore the presence of YtqI homologs among the small set of proteins of unknown function in the genomes of <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, where proteins MG371 and MPN140 respectively, are likely to perform the essential function of nanoRNA degradation.</p><p>Different species seem to have found different solutions to the same cellular problem, the problem being the degradation of nanoRNA or pAp. Yet another solution to the problem of nanoRNA degradation awaits to be discovered, as cyanobacteria and the alpha division of proteobacteria have neither YtqI nor Orn orthologs.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm462_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm462_nar-00789-w-2007-File010.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="nar_gkm462_nar-00789-w-2007-File011.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We wish to thank Dr Hermann Bujard for the gift of the anydrotetracycline tightly regulated system, Dr Michael Cashel for the gift of strain CF10230 Drs Isabelle Martin-Verstraete and Anne-Marie Gilles for helpful discussions.
