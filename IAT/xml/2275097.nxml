However, the function of DNA binding by Lon remains elusive. Studies suggest that human Lon (hLon) binds preferentially to a G-rich single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequence overlapping the light strand promoter of mitochondrial DNA. This sequence is contained within a 24-base oligonucleotide referred to as LSPas. Here, we use biochemical and biophysical approaches to elucidate the structural properties of ssDNAs bound by hLon, as well as the thermodynamics of DNA binding by hLon. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and circular dichroism show that ssDNAs with a propensity for forming parallel G-quartets are specifically bound by hLon. Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrates that hLon binding to LSPas is primarily driven by enthalpy change associated with a significant reduction in heat capacity. Differential scanning calorimetry pinpoints an excess heat capacity upon hLon binding to LSPas. By contrast, hLon binding to an 8-base G-rich core sequence is entropically driven with a relatively negligible change in heat capacity. A considerable enhancement of thermal stability accompanies hLon binding to LSPas as compared to the G-rich core. Taken together, these data support the notion that hLon binds G-quartets through rigid-body binding and that binding to LSPas is coupled with structural adaptation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ATP-dependent Lon protease is a member of the AAA+ family of proteins (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), which is present in archaea, prokaryotes and eukaryotic mitochondria, peroxisomes and plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9">2&#x02013;9</xref>). Lon has multiple cellular functions such as degrading abnormal polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), as well as certain regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">12&#x02013;15</xref>) and metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19">16&#x02013;19</xref>), acting as a chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and binding to nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27 B28">22&#x02013;28</xref>). In addition, Lon may be important in maintaining genome integrity and expression, either by selectively degrading proteins involved in mtDNA metabolism, or by directly binding to DNA and/or RNA.</p><p>Recent work demonstrates that hLon binds to mtDNA in living cells and interacts preferentially with the control region for transcription initiation and mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). It is possible that the sequence-specific binding of Lon to the mitochondrial genome may function to localize the protease at sites where it degrades protein substrates involved in mtDNA integrity. In bacteria, some of Lon's protein substrates are involved in genome metabolism, which manifests the role of Lon in maintaining genome stability. For example, in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, Lon mediates the ATP-dependent turnover of the CcrM DNA methyltransferase, thereby regulating DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Lon selectively degrades the transcription regulator SoxS only when this factor is not bound to DNA or to RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In yeast, results demonstrate that the TCA enzyme mitochondrial aconitase is present in mitochondrial nucleoids and functions in maintaining mtDNA, independent of its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32">30&#x02013;32</xref>). In light of observations that mildly oxidized mammalian mitochondrial aconitase is subject to Lon-mediated proteolysis, it is possible that Lon participates in nucleoid remodeling by degrading mtDNA-bound aconitase in response to metabolic changes and environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). However, no data as yet support the localization of mammalian aconitase to mitochondrial nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The role of Lon in mitochondrial homeostasis is indispensable in normal fibroblasts; depletion of the protease using an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide leads to apoptosis and collapse of mitochondrial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Nevertheless, understanding Lon's physiological importance is enmeshed by its multiple functions as a protease and a DNA-binding protein. Thus, it remains unclear the extent to which mtDNA binding contributes to the essential role of Lon in mitochondrial biology.</p><p>Although the function and mechanism of Lon-mediated proteolysis is understood in detail, the physiological relevance and structural dynamics of nucleic acid binding by Lon remain unclear. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrate that both bacterial and mammalian Lon show a propensity for binding GT-rich oligonucleotides. Bacterial Lon binds to double-stranded DNA, whereas mouse and human Lon bind to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). Observations that the DNA-binding and enzymatic activities of bacterial and mammalian Lon are coordinately regulated and that hLon binds to mtDNA in cells, support the notion that the association of Lon to DNA is physiologically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments have shown that hLon specifically binds to a ssDNA sequence that is referred to as LSPas, which overlaps the light strand promoter anti-sense or G-rich strand mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Additional <italic>in vitro</italic> data also demonstrate that hLon binds G-rich oligonucleotides corresponding to regions present throughout the heavy strand of mtDNA but shows the highest affinity for LSPas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). An hLon-binding consensus has been suggested by results obtained using a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> and cell-based assays along with bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Furthermore, in cultured mammalian cells, hLon has been shown to associate with sites distributed primarily within one-half of the genome and preferentially with the control region for mtDNA replication and transcription encompassing LSPas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In oxidatively stressed cells, hLon binding to mtDNA is reduced. However, it is unknown whether oxidative stress directly divests hLon of its DNA-binding property, or whether hLon binding is blocked by the oxidative modification of mtDNA-binding sites <italic>per se</italic>, or by other proteins recruited to repair these damaged sites.</p><p>Previous studies on the binding of hLon to ssDNA provided limited insight into the specificity, stability and dynamics of this interaction. It has been suggested that hLon may recognize G-rich sequences that form guanine tetraplexes, or quadruplexes, which are four-stranded structures based on the hydrogen-bonded guanine tetrad, or G-quartet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). G-quartet DNA is a high-ordered structure that contains polyanionic groups, and thus might interact with basic proteins in a nonspecific manner. In this study, we demonstrate that mtDNA sequences bound by hLon form parallel G-quadruplexes. Results show that hLon selectively binds to DNA sequences that have a propensity for forming G-quartets. However, the presence of G-quartets does not confer specificity for hLon association. Human Lon complexed with LSPas exhibits a large negative heat capacity change, which is a thermodynamic signature of sequence-specific interactions. By contrast, the interaction between hLon and other G-rich sequences examined leads to little or no significant change in heat capacity, and is primarily entropy driven. Taken together, these energetic data show that the affinity of hLon for ssDNA is determined by the propensity of the ssDNA sequence to form G-quartets, whereas the sequence specificity of hLon binding hinges on the extent of structural adaptation and release of interfacial solvent molecules between the protease and its DNA ligand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of human Lon protease</title><p>The expression plasmid of human <italic>lon</italic> was transformed into Rosetta 2 competent <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Novagen), and recombinant hLon was expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) with some modifications.

At mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0223c; 0.6&#x02013;0.8), hLon production was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG for 1.5 h.

After serial washes with Buffer A and Wash Buffer B (the same as A but containing 80 mM imidazole), hLon was eluted in Elution Buffer (the same as Buffer A but containing 400 mM imidazole). Purified hLon was concentrated with Amicon-50000 (Millipore), and dialyzed extensively against a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES&#x02013;NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM DTT and 20% glycerol (v/v) unless specified otherwise. The purification steps described above were conducted at 4&#x000b0;C to avoid autodigestion of hLon.

The putative mtDNA-binding target of hLon within CR overlaps the light strand promoter (LSP) and corresponds to the previously characterized oligonucleotide sequence referred to as LSPas. LSPas is a 24-base sequence located on the heavy (or antisense) strand of mtDNA (5&#x02032;-AATAATGTGTTAGTTGGGGGGTGA-3&#x02032;). Notably, the mtDNA heavy strand has a higher content of guanine and thymine residues, in contrast to the complementary light strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). LSPas contains six contiguous guanine bases, rendering a high-order structure demonstrated by electrophoretic analysis using both native and denaturing gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Two forms of LSPas were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 2): a monomeric form that migrated slightly slower than the complementary LSPs CA-containing oligonucleotide (lane 1) and a high-order structure that migrated slower than the double-stranded LSP (compare lanes 2 and 3). Similar migration differences were also observed for an 18-mer counterpart (LSPas18) that lacks six bases from the 5&#x02032; end of LSPas but retains the G-rich core sequence. The slower migrating forms of both LSPas and LSPas18 remained unchanged on denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 2 and 5, respectively), suggesting the presence of a structural motif, which was later identified by CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, an 8-mer TG<sub>6</sub>T migrated much slower than its complementary AC<sub>6</sub>A (Figure S1, lanes 5 and 7, respectively). TG<sub>6</sub>T was unaffected by heat treatment at 120&#x000b0;C for 2 h, whereas the slower migrating form of LSPas was disrupted after heat treatment (Figure S1, compare lane 5 with 6, and lane 1 with 2). The susceptibility to heat denaturation may be attributed to the length of the ssDNA oligonucleotide, in addition to the number of bases flanking the G-rich core sequence. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Electrophoretic mobility of G-rich and control oligonucleotides.

Typically, parallel G-quartets are characterized by a positive CD band at &#x0223c;260 nm and a negative one at &#x0223c;240 nm, whereas antiparallel G-quartets have a positive band at &#x0223c;295 nm and a negative one at &#x0223c;260 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The structure of LSPas remained mostly intact between 10&#x000b0;C and 30&#x000b0;C, the range of which was thus selected for monitoring its association with hLon in the ITC and DSC experiments (discussed later). LSPas became relatively unstructured at above 50&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The CD profile of LSPas with respect to temperature in a Na<sup>+</sup>-containing denaturing buffer (the native buffer with 1-M urea; spectra not shown) was compared to that in the native buffer. However, the G-quartet signature of LSPas was dramatically weakened in the denaturing buffer without NaCl; the ellipticity not only decreased but also red shifted with the temperature increment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This result suggested the importance of monovalent cations in stabilizing G-quartet LSPas DNA. It has been reported that K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and several other monovalent cations stack between adjacent G-tetrads in G-quartet DNA to coordinate the eight carbonyl groups in every two tetrads, thereby making the G-quartet rigid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47 B48 B49">47&#x02013;49</xref>). In particular, Na<sup>+</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> have been shown to neutralize the peripheral phosphate groups of G-quartets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). In contrast to LSPas, TG<sub>6</sub>T exhibited a comparatively rigid G-quartet as revealed in the CD results; it was only mildly denatured by high temperature or by denaturing buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, compare C with D; Figure S1, compare lane 5 with 6). TG<sub>6</sub>T showed a strong positive peak at 262 nm and a negative one at 242 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The sequences of both LSPas and TG<sub>6</sub>T contain no contiguous guanines other than a 6-nt G cluster; the contexts hardly allow the formation of hairpins or intramolecular G-quartets. Based on the electrophoretic and CD data, LSPas and TG<sub>6</sub>T form intermolecular parallel G-quartet structures in Na<sup>+</sup> solutions. LSPas was more vulnerable than TG<sub>6</sub>T to thermal and chemical denaturation because of the flanking sequence effect: the repulsion caused by the unpaired bases hinders the formation of LSPas quadruplex (see the schematic structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Human Lon selectively binds to G-quartets</title><p>The number of consecutive guanine bases in an intermolecular G-quartet is the main determinant of its stability. When we replaced the third and fourth guanines within LSPas with adenines, the resulting ssDNA oligonucleotide referred to as LSPasGA did not form a G-quartet (Figure S1, lane 4). The EMSA was used to examine the binding of hLon to fluorescein-conjugated LSPas or LSPasGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The results showed that hLon selectively interacted with the G-quartet form of LSPas but not with the monomer. When 7-deaza-guanines (7-deaza-Gs) were substituted for the 6-nt G cluster of LSPas, the sequence failed to form a G-quartet because the C-7 cannot be an electron donor for Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. The 7-deaza-G modified LSPas was not bound by hLon (data not shown). The binding of hLon to fluoresceinated LSPas was competed by the addition of 50-fold excess of unlabeled LSPas but not LSPasGA.

However, previous studies did not directly determine the extent to which any of these G-rich ssDNAs form G-quartets. For this purpose, we analyzed the G-quartet-forming capabilities of these G-rich oligonucleotides by native gel electrophoresis (Figure S2). Some of these G-rich ssDNAs formed extensive high order structures. Although spectroscopic analysis was not performed because of the structural complexities, the high order forms likely represented G-quartets resulting from 2&#x02013;3 discrete G-clusters in their sequence contexts. Results showed that the sequences capable of forming high order structures were better able to compete with LSPas for hLon binding (Figure S3).

Moreover, the CD spectral analysis of these hLon&#x02013;DNA complexes suggested that neither hLon nor the DNA molecules were subjected to global conformational transitions upon binding (Figure S5). The G-quartet structures recognized by hLon remain largely unperturbed as demonstrated by the CD spectra of DNA from 250 to 350 nm, within which DNA is sensitive to conformational changes whereas the protein has very weak signal (Figure S5). Although the CD intensity of DNA weakened in the presence of hLon, it underwent no structural transition (no chromatic shift was observed).

The transition temperature of hLon was &#x0223c;46&#x000b0;C, and was followed by an abrupt decrease in heat capacity that indicated a step of dramatic exothermic reaction. The onset of this exothermic reaction occurred at &#x0223c;50&#x000b0;C, which most likely resulted from the aggregation of hLon immediately after or partly during the thermal denaturation. When significant interactions between hLon and DNA occur, the complex can be populated with multiple microstates in the pretransition region [Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M8">8</xref>)], which means an extra energy accumulation attributed to this binding. The effect of DNA binding on the overall heat capacity in the pretransition region from 10&#x000b0;C to 30&#x000b0;C was qualitatively assessed by Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M8">8</xref>). Since the transition temperatures of the DNA oligonucleotides were all found beyond 80&#x000b0;C, at which the heat capacity of buffer began to deviate from the baseline, we therefore undertook the evaluation by assuming that the differences caused by DNA were negligible in these cases. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Heat capacity thermograms of hLon in the presence and absence of DNA. (<bold>A</bold>) The partial molar heat capacity of hLon is shown between 10&#x000b0;C and 70&#x000b0;C.

The positive value signified that more heat was absorbed to weaken the interactions between hLon and LSPas. In addition, the endothermic dissociation of the hLon-LSPas complex appeared to partly compensate the drastic decrease of heat capacity that arose from hLon aggregation. However, the gain of extra &#x02202;<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic>/&#x02202;<italic>T</italic> for DNA binding was not observed in other G-rich sequences. The &#x00394;(&#x02202;<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic>/&#x02202;<italic>T</italic>) of the hLon&#x02013;TG<sub>6</sub>T complex was &#x02212;0.271 kcal/mol/K<sup>2</sup>, signed negative and relatively small, and the hLon in complex with LS1as, LS2as and LS3as also showed little significant change in &#x02202;<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic>/&#x02202;<italic>T</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The data of LS4as and LS5as are likely to be invalid because the hLon aggregated when either sequence was added in the solution prior to scan. In brief, these results revealed that hLon binding to LSPas was significantly involved in weak interactions as indicated by the relatively large positive change in the pretransition heat capacity relative to temperature, but it was not the case in other G-rich sequences although they formed G-quartets. The DSC data are fairly consistent with the ITC results: hLon binding to LSPas was accompanied by a highly negative heat capacity change, which was absent from the binding to TG<sub>6</sub>T. The combination of ITC and DSC analyses sheds new light on the DNA-binding mechanism of hLon; whereby the specific binding of the protease to LSPas is coupled with structural adaptation as demonstrated by the large negative heat capacity change of the association. By contrast, the heat capacity measurements on hLon in complex with other G-rich sequences showed little or no significant change in heat capacity. Moreover, the dissociation constants for hLon binding to LSPas and TG<sub>6</sub>T at 20&#x000b0;C were 3.30 and 7.35 &#x000b5;M, respectively. This result suggests that hLon has similar affinity for both sequences, but the binding to TG<sub>6</sub>T has a relatively negligible heat capacity change and a lesser extent of structural stabilization, which can be referred to as rigid-body association. <table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Determination of the pretransition slopes of heat capacity in hLon and hLon/DNA complexes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkm1140i2.jpg"/></inline-formula></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkm1140i3.jpg"/></inline-formula></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkm1140i4.jpg"/></inline-formula></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02329; &#x02202; <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> /&#x02202; <italic>T</italic>&#x0232a; (kcal/mol/K<sup>2</sup>)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394; &#x02329; &#x02202; <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> /&#x02202; T&#x0232a; (kcal/mol/K<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hLon</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.745</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.871</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hLon/LSPas</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.572</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.727</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.715</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+1.844</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hLon/TG<sub>6</sub>T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.596</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.739</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.600</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.271</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hLon/LS1as</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.581</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.730</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.711</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.160</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hLon/LS2as</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.581</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.729</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.914</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+0.043</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hLon/LS3as</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.577</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.729</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.804</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.067</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hLon/LS4as</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.589</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.730</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.199</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.672<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF2"><sup>a</sup></xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hLon/LS5as</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.587</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.730</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">-0.556</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.427<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF2"><sup>a</sup></xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Calculation of the partial-specific volume of hLon (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkm1140i2.jpg"/></inline-formula>) was performed with the program SEDNTERP (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm">http://www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm</ext-link>).

Polyelectrolyte effects are a consequence of dehydration upon complex formation, and the relocation of water molecules from the solute hydration shell to the bulk solvent is entropy oriented. Nonpolyelectrolyte effects resulting from hydrophobic and other weak interactions are directed by enthalpy changes. The influence of these effects on the binding of hLon to DNA is determined by thermodynamic-driving forces: the enthalpy and entropy changes. The polyelectrolyte effect is noticeably temperature dependent compared to the nonpolyelectrolyte effect; apolar hydration heat capacity decreases with temperature increment, and thus the favorable gain of dehydration entropy for a complex formation is expected to increase with temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56 B57 B58">56&#x02013;58</xref>). Meanwhile, dehydration is likely to occur with a mild positive change in enthalpy. This inherent dependence of entropy and enthalpy on temperature gives rise to a partial positive heat capacity change. Nevertheless, hLon binding to LSPas was associated with a dramatic decrease in heat capacity; the ensemble enthalpy change was negative over the temperature examined, and the entropy change became quite negative at higher temperatures. The compensation temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>C</sub> (where the &#x00394;<italic>H</italic> and the &#x02212;<italic>T</italic>&#x00394;<italic>S</italic> converged) of hLon binding to LSPas was 12.79&#x000b0;C, above which the enthalpy term predominated. By contrast, hLon binding to TG<sub>6</sub>T was accompanied by a slight increase in heat capacity; its <italic>T</italic><sub>C</sub> was &#x02212;5.15&#x000b0;C, above which the reaction was primarily driven by entropy. Taken together, these results suggested that hLon binding to LSPas revolves around nonpolyelectrolyte effects, whereas the binding to TG<sub>6</sub>T is primarily influenced by polyelectrolyte effects.</p><p>Despite striking differences in their heat capacity changes and major driving forces, hLon binding to LSPas and TG<sub>6</sub>T showed similar association constants and free energy changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). An underestimation of the LSPas parameters unavoidably occurs for hLon binding to the G-quartet form because because LSPas DNA was present in reactions as both monomeric and G-quartet forms. The thermodynamic parameters including the association constants and free energy changes are of the right order of magnitude; however, they should be corrected for the fraction of LSPas G-quartets present in order to compare more accurately the binding of LSPas and TG<sub>6</sub>T to hLon (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In energetic terms, the DNA-binding affinity of a protein is reflected by the free energy change, which is relatively insensitive to subtle changes in either binding component. It has been shown in recent studies that only a few crucial regions within a macromolecule complex determines the free energy of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). The remaining regions are more relevant to binding specificity (stereochemistry), and contribute little to the overall &#x00394;<italic>G</italic>. The deletion or mutation of specificity-determining groups that do not damage the structural integrity of the complex would not likely affect the binding free energy; thus thermodynamic homeostasis could be maintained. Nonetheless, the &#x00394;<italic>H</italic> and the &#x00394;<italic>S</italic> would be susceptible to minor structural changes, even though these two terms may compensate in a similar fashion resulting in an invariant free energy change.</p><p>The thermodynamic &#x02018;neutral&#x02019; was observed in the binding of hLon to TG<sub>6</sub>T, whose free energy change was comparable to that of LSPas. This phenomenon revealed that TG<sub>6</sub>T, the core region of G-quartet formation residing in LSPas, is essential for the stabilization of hLon&#x02013;DNA complex by conferring most of the binding energy. As indicated by EMSA results, disrupting the G-quartet in LSPas by replacing two guanines with adenines interfered with binding to hLon. This result suggested that the DNA substrate determines the binding preference of hLon at free energy level. In other words, hLon binding to LSPas is significantly weakened if LSPas loses its ability to form G-quartet. However, the binding specificity should be addressed by its thermodynamic properties and heat capacity change. The weak dependence of entropy and enthalpy on temperature for hLon binding to TG<sub>6</sub>T parallels the association with LSPas at low temperatures. But at high temperatures, weak bond formation apparently dominates the interactions between hLon and LSPas, rendering more negative the enthalpy as well as the entropy of reaction; while in the case of TG<sub>6</sub>T, dehydration appears to dominate the thermodynamics of this complex formation. In addition, the drastic difference in heat capacity change between these two cases signifies their fundamental discrepancy in the degree of temperature dependence for the individual thermodynamic parameters including the enthalpy and entropy changes. For a ligand-binding reaction, heat capacity change is primarily concerned with hydrophobic interactions and dehydration of apolar groups. Summing up the thermodynamic results, we infer that the small change in heat capacity for the binding of hLon to TG<sub>6</sub>T mainly accounts for the extent of dehydration, whereas the binding to LSPas associated with the large negative heat capacity change reflects a considerable involvement of hydrophobic interactions. Supported further by the DSC results, these findings suggest that hLon binds to most G-quartet-forming sequences present in mtDNA principally through electrostatic interactions which are thermodynamically inadequate for specific binding. By contrast, hLon recognizes LSPas as a specific target by enhancing the structural stability of the complex. In addition, these results raise the possibility that a sequence-specific recognition step might be preceded by nonspecific binding to G-quartet structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p><p>The human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) consists of 16,569 bp. Although the base composition of mammalian mtDNA is biased with a high frequency of contiguous guanines on the heavy (H) strand as compared with the complementary light (L) strand, only a few studies have addressed the physiological implications of G-quartets in this closed circular genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Analysis of human mtDNA with two G-quartet motif-searching programs, Quadfinder and QGRS Mapper, revealed 20 intramolecular G-quartet-forming hits on the H strand, while none were found on the L strand (Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). Fourteen out of these 20 sequences are located between LSP and O<sub>L</sub> on the heavy strand. LSPas is contained within one of these hits positioned between 438 and 471.</p><p>One model of mtDNA replication as proposed by Clayton and the colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>) holds that replication proceeds in an asymmetric manner. Synthesis is initiated at the origin of the H strand (O<sub>H</sub>) that is downstream from the LSP. The single-stranded parental H strand is displaced during replication, and expands until approximately two-thirds the genome is replicated reaching the origin of the L strand (O<sub>L</sub>), at which point L-strand replication ensues in the opposite direction. Studies have found that replication of the leading H strand terminates prematurely at TAS (termination-associated sequences), resulting in a 7S DNA; this three-stranded structure referred to as D-loop (displacement-loop), consists of the parental L-strand template, the nascent prematurely terminated H strand and the displaced single-stranded parental H strand (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). It has been proposed that the rate of mtDNA replication is regulated by the turnover of the D-loop, which is likely mediated by the formation of secondary structures at certain conserved sequences within the D-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>) and some <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors binding to these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71 B72 B73">71&#x02013;73</xref>). We suggest that the single-stranded parental H strand exposed to solution might allow the formation of G-quartets at various G-rich clusters between LSP and O<sub>L</sub> as identified by Quadfinder (Table S1). Recent findings by Maizels and the colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>) on the G-quartet-containing structures called G-loops may strengthen the validity of our suggestion. However, it is unclear whether hLon interacts with intramolecular LSPas quadruplex, and if the binding is accompanied by similar heat capacity effect: it remains to be clarified whether the specific recognition of the LSPas sequence requires the flanking bases to present quadruply. Although it has been debated on the biological relevance of intramolecular parallel G-quartets arising from topological constraints, a FRET-based investigation reveals that parallel and antiparallel G-quartet conformations can coexist and interconvert under physiological relevant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). In our study, the combination of electrophoretic, spectroscopic and thermodynamic data indicates that hLon preferentially binds to intermolecular parallel G-quartet structures. Given that multiple copies of mtDNA molecules frequently concentrate to form heritable units of mtDNA or to facilitate intermitochondrial recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76 B77 B78">76&#x02013;78</xref>), formation of G-quartets between separate mtDNA molecules could be possible <italic>in vivo</italic> (see the schematic structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We have found that the G-quartet-forming motifs on mtDNA are thermodynamically favorable to form intermolecular G-quartets while kinetically prone to form intramolecular G-quartets <italic>in vitro</italic> (our unpublished data). However, whether mtDNA forms G-quartets intra- and/or intergenomically remains to be determined.</p><p>This study reveals that hLon has a general preference for G-quartet DNA, and selectively binds to LSPas along with structural adaptations for the overall structural tightening. Our findings are consistent with recent work identifying a G-rich consensus sequence for hLon binding that matches well with a sequence contained within LSPas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Additional consensus sequences showing the best fit for hLon binding sites are primarily located downstream of O<sub>H</sub> and before O<sub>L</sub>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, purified hLon binds with higher affinity to ssDNA oligonucleotides that conform to this G-rich consensus. Consistent with these findings, hLon binds preferentially in cultured human cells to the CR/D-loop region as well as to sites between O<sub>H</sub> and O<sub>L</sub>. Our data support the notion that hLon binding to mtDNA sequences in <italic>vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> is determined by the propensity of ssDNA to form G-quartets. We demonstrate that hLon is able to recognize its binding target with a notable reduction in thermal fluctuations. In addition, the high proportion of G-rich clusters in the H strand raises the possibility that these sites serve as hot spots of binding for hLon. We propose that hLon associates with the G-quartet-forming regions during the expansion of D-loop, and selectively binds to target sequence(s) on the basis of different binding heat capacities. Thus, the finding of specific target(s) by hLon to mtDNA might be facilitated by initial binding to these hot spots rather than random diffusion or one-dimensional sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>).</p><p>Potential G-quartet-forming regions that have been characterized in eukaryotic nuclear genome are principally found in telomeres, immunoglobulin heavy-chain switch regions, ribosomal DNA, G-rich microsatellites and certain promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>). Telomeres are guanine-rich tandem repeats at the ends of linear chromosomes, which tend to form G-quartet structures to prevent the 3&#x02032; single-stranded overhang from nonhomologous end joining. Telomere integrity is regulated by some G-quartet destabilizing factors as well as telomerase. Telomere-binding proteins such as Pot1 and G-quartet-specific helicases like BLM and WRN syndrome proteins render the telomeric DNA accessible to telomerase for end extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>). Deregulations of telomerase activity and the helicase-mediated unwinding of G-quartets at telomeres are potentially associated with many types of cancer. On the other hand, many putative G-quadruplexes have been identified in nontelomeric regions, of which promoter sequences are intensely concerned with the correlation between the G-quartet stability and gene expression. Stabilization and destabilization of the G-quartet structures at the promoter regions of c-<italic>myc</italic> and Ki-<italic>ras</italic> proto-oncogenes have been revealed to be important to the gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>). It is of great interest to discover how gene expression is regulated by some G-quartet-binding proteins that are involved in the turnover of G-quartet structures at the control regions.</p><p>The specialized nucleic acid structures found in nuclear genome broaches an intriguing issue of whether they exist in organelle genomes, and if they are under similar or shared regulation. Unlike nuclear DNA, typical mitochondrial genomes are circular and thus do not require telomere/telomerase system for an end-replication problem. However, linear mtDNA molecules are found in certain yeast strains, which have mitochondrial telomere-binding proteins for maintaining their genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>). Our data raise the possibility that some regions of mtDNA may form G-quadruplexes. Although this conjecture awaits further experimental validation, recent findings on localization of potential G-quartet-binding proteins at mitochondria suggest they might interact with G-quartet structures on mtDNA. Telomere reverse transcriptase (TERT) that normally guards the end integrity of chromosomes in nuclei carries a mitochondrial targeting sequence and retains telomerase activity in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>). Translocation of TERT from nuclei to mitochondria is triggered by oxidative stress and exacerbates mtDNA damage, in contrast to its protective role in nuclei. Topoisomerase I (Top1) has also been identified in mitochondria with yet unclear functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>). The existence of mitochondrial Top1 might be relevant to the topologic problems encountered during mtDNA replication/transcription. Its nuclear counterpart interacts with and promotes the formation of G-quartet structures <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>). However, whether the mitochondrial Top1 as well as TERT associates with G-quartet structures on mtDNA is unknown.</p><p>The dissociation constants of hLon binding to LSPas and TG<sub>6</sub>T were found at micromolar range by using ITC. The binding strength seems to be weak, but reasonable because hLon most likely functions as a regulatory protein. It has been reported that hLon binding to DNA is inhibited by nucleotides whereas is stimulated by protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The physiological functions of mtDNA bound by hLon are still unclear. As hLon functions as an ATP-dependent protease and is a likely sensor of environmental stress in mitochondria, it is possible that hLon selectively degrades components of the mtDNA replication, repair and transcription machinery in response to changes in cellular metabolism. A variety of mitochondrial intermediate enzymes seemingly unrelated to mtDNA transactions such as aconitase, acetohydroxyacid reductoisomerase and serine/threonine deaminase have been identified in mitochondrial nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93 B94 B95">93&#x02013;95</xref>), suggesting that they may be important in coordinating metabolic regulation with mtDNA maintenance. Further investigation is required to determine whether these respective enzymatic activities are functionally linked to their association with mtDNA binding, and whether they are selectively degraded and thereby regulated by hLon during cellular stress such as the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and/or hypoxia.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm1140_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1140_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Dr Ming-Chya Wu for access to the differential scanning calorimeter.
