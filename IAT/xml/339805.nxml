Alignment of this sequence with that of the mouse IL-3 gene has allowed the structure of the rat IL-3 gene to be deduced. The intron-exon boundaries are conserved and extensive nucleotide homology (approx 90%) is present in the 5' flanking region and the portion of the gene coding for the signal peptide. Several proposed regulatory sequences are conserved and an analogous element to the tandem repeat in intron 2 of the mouse gene is also present. The predicted amino acid sequence for mature rat IL-3 shows surprisingly low homology (54%) with its murine counterpart, although all four cysteine residues are conserved. The rat IL-3 gene was expressed in monkey COS-1 cells and colony assays established that rat IL-3 is a multi-lineage haemopoietic growth regulator. There was little cross-reactivity of the respective IL-3 species on mouse and rat bone marrow cells suggesting that rat IL-3, in concert with its receptor, has evolved significantly away from the mouse IL-3/receptor system.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0050-a" xlink:role="3646"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3641"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3642"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3643"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3644"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3645"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3646"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3647"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3648"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3649"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3650"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3651"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3652"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3653"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3654"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3655"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3656"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3657"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00278-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3658"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
