They also colonize the nostrils of about one in five adults permanently and another one in three adults intermittently. Although these bacteria usually coexist peacefully with their human carriers, they can cause minor infections such as pimples and boils if they enter the skin through a cut or a sore. They can also cause potentially life-threatening infections such as blood poisoning and pneumonia. These serious, invasive infections are often &#x0201c;autoinfections.&#x0201d; That is, they are caused by strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> that are present in the patient's nose before they become ill. Minor <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> infections can be treated without antibiotics&#x02014;by draining a boil, for example. Invasive infections are usually treated with antibiotics such as flucloxacillin.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>There is no effective vaccine against <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> infections and these bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to flucloxacillin, methicillin, and other antibiotics. Worryingly, although methicillin-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> (MRSA) infections occur most frequently among people in health-care facilities who have weakened immune systems, community-acquired MRSA infections among otherwise healthy people are increasingly common. Consequently, new ways to avoid <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> infections are urgently needed. Because persistent nasal carriers of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> have an increased risk of infection, one strategy might be to prevent nasal colonization with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>. How these bacteria colonize the nose is poorly understood, but is likely to involve interactions between molecules expressed on the surface of the bacteria and molecules expressed on the surface of the cells lining the nostrils. In this study, the researchers use a new human nasal colonization assay to investigate the involvement of a bacterial surface protein called clumping factor B (ClfB) in the survival of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> in the human nose. ClfB binds to cytokeratin 10, a protein expressed by cells lining the human nose, and has been implicated in the colonization of mouse noses by <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers introduced a strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> that made ClfB and an otherwise identical, mutant strain that lacked ClfB into the nostrils of healthy human volunteers and measured how long the two strains survived. For safety reasons, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strains used in this study have an additional defect that makes them less likely to colonize and persist in the human nose than the strains found in natural <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> carriers. Although both strains grew equally well in the laboratory, the mutant strain was eliminated from human noses much quicker than the strain that made ClfB. Mutant bacteria lacking ClfB were cleared from the nostrils of all the volunteers within two weeks, whereas the bacteria that made ClfB were still present in some of the volunteers four weeks after their introduction. When the researchers investigated how well the two strains stuck to a layer of human cytokeratin 10 in a plastic dish, they found that the bacteria that made ClfB stuck to the human protein but the mutant bacteria did not. Furthermore, the strain with ClfB stuck particularly well to cytokeratin 10 when the bacteria had been grown in conditions where nutrients were limiting, a situation that mimics bacterial growth in the human nose.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that ClfB is an important factor in the establishment of human nasal colonization by <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> and suggest that ClfB might be a target for <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> decolonization strategies. Furthermore, although ClfB is clearly important in human nasal colonization by <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>, it is likely that additional bacterial factors will also be involved in this process. The human nasal colonization model used in this study may be useful in the identification of these additional factors and also as a test bed for potential <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> decolonization strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050017">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050017</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus encyclopedia has a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007261.htm"><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and MRSA</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ar_mrsa_ca.html">community-associated MRSA</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service's health website (NHS Direct) provides information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=346&#x00026;sectionId=1">staphylococcal infections</ext-link> and about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=252&#x00026;sectionId=1">MRSA</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/staphylo/default.htm">UK Health Protection Agency </ext-link>provides information about <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Wertheim HFL, Walsh E, Choudhurry R, Melles DC, Boelens HAM, et al.

At the end of follow-up, only 19&#x00025; of the volunteers carried the 8325&#x02013;4 strain, not 50&#x00025;.

As mentioned before, this strain has a defect in the stationary phase SigB and is therefore unlikely to colonize and persist as well as wild-type strains we would find in natural <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> nasal carriers. We chose this strain because it facilitated a safe inoculation protocol for humans and actually made this experiment possible. A <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain from a natural carrier with no major virulence factors, such as superantigens, would be preferred for future artificial inoculation experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Nicole Lemmens, who performed elegant ClfB expression analysis experiments with quantitative mRNA PCR techniques, but her data were eventually not used in the final version of this manuscript.
