Most of the detected cases of monosomy 21 correspond to partial monosomies, suggesting that critical chromosomal regions or haploinsufficient genes may be responsible for the observed phenotypes. However, to date, relatively few of those genes have been identified that can be linked to specific phenotypes, and specifically to mental retardation. The clinical phenotype of patients varies according to the size and location of the deleted chromosomal fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Huret1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

The present report investigates the intrinsic ability of Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice to form spatial memories, a function that is disturbed in patients with mental retardation and relies on particular weakness in hippocampal functions. We have selected the Morris water maze task to address the possible abnormalities in spatial memory in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice to identify the roles of <italic>Dyrk1A</italic>. However, since previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Stasko1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> suggested that specific mental retardation models might be more responsive to potential stressors and more prone to swim-induced hypothermia, we have also tested our mice in a swimming test designed to determine the influence of the levels of aversiveness associated with the test. Finally we have used other hippocampally-dependent task, such as novel object recognition that has been shown to present profound alterations in Ts65Dn, but not in Ts1Cje Down syndrome mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Fernandez2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. We have used a simple protocol involving a pair of different objects during the familiarization phase separated from the testing phase by 24 hours, a time frame typically used to evaluate rodent long-term memory. Our experiments indicate that haploinsufficiency of <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> might contribute to the impairment of cognitive functions and adaptative behavior of human monosomy 21.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Morris Water Maze</title><p>In the MWM, both Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; and wild type mice showed a significant reduction of the escape latency along the four sessions of the acquisition phase (MANOVA, &#x0201c;session&#x0201d;: F<sub>(3&#x02013;32)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;24.2, P&#x0003c;0.0001). However, whereas the ability of wild types to reach the hidden platform improved along the acquisition trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice did show an improvement in finding the hidden platform only during the first sessions, but their escape latency differed significantly from the wild types in the last sessions (third session P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.058, fourth session P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02), and they thus did not reach the same execution levels. As a consequence, the slope of the escape latency curves for Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; and wild type mice significantly differed (MANOVA F<sub>(3, 29)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;24.22, P&#x0003c;0.05). However, the distance traveled was decreased along acquisition sessions in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice similar to wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Swim speed and the use non-spatial search strategies are very important in determining the total swim time. In fact, the average swimming speed of Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice was significantly lower with respect to wild types (MANOVA F<sub>(3, 33)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;24.22, P&#x0003c;0.01), thus suggesting that the increased escape latency was due at least in part, to a reduced swimming speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, it should be noted that swimming speed did not change along acquisition sessions in either group of mice (MANOVA, &#x0201c;session&#x0201d;: F<sub>(3&#x02013;32)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.04, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.39) and though significant in some sessions, the differences were not very marked (wild type: 12,15 cm.s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><italic>vs.</italic> Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212;: 13.14 cm.s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, MANOVA, &#x0201c;session&#x0201d;: F<sub>(1&#x02013;16)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2,182, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.159).

To better understand this phenotype we performed a cued version of the water maze (see below). To test whether the mice had indeed learned the spatial location of the hidden platform, and were able to remember this information, the probe trial was conducted after the cued session (4 days after training). During the probe trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), the latency to cross the annulus of the hidden escape platform was longer in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice compared to wild types (wild type: 24.47&#x000b1;3.06 s vs. Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212;: 32.13&#x000b1;4.30 s), although the difference did not reach statistic significance (<italic><underline>t</underline></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;1.08, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.08 Student's <italic><underline>t</underline></italic> test), and the number of crosses was similar between genotypes (wild type, 2.77&#x000b1;0.32; Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212;, 2.01&#x000b1;0.30; <italic><underline>t</underline></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.56, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.12, Student's <italic><underline>t</underline></italic> test). Moreover, no differences between genotypes were detected in the preference for the trained quadrant, neither in percentage of time (<italic><underline>t</underline></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.04, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.31, Student's <italic><underline>t</underline></italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) nor in the distance traveled (<italic><underline>t</underline></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.66, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.52, Student's <italic><underline>t</underline></italic> test). These observations support the conclusion that Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice indeed remember the location of the platform.

However, they show an impaired learning efficiency compared to wild types that does not seem to be dependent on their reduced swimming speed.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Floating behavior</title><p>To gain further insight into the reduced speed Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mutants showed in the MWM, we studied the floating behavior of these mice and that of their wild type counterparts. Floating behavior, which is characterized by periods of immobility in the swimming tank, is a phenomenon associated with the performance of the MWM by rodents, particularly mice. Even relatively short intervals of floating behavior can cause significant changes in the mean raw average speed of a trial. We quantified the number of episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and the average floating time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) during each trial across genotypes and experimental conditions used in the present MWM experiment. Floating was operationally defined here as any period equal to or longer than 5 s, during which the average mouse swimming speed stayed below 3 cm/s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Although the analysis of the number of floating episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) or the cumulative floating time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) did not reveal a significant effect of genotype on floating behavior for the acquisition, visible, probe and reverse platform tasks (<italic><underline>t</underline></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.130, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.898, Student's <italic><underline>t</underline></italic> test), a clear difference in the floating pattern along sessions was observed between Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; and wild type mice. Whereas Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice did not show significant amounts of floating in any of the testing periods, wild types showed a significantly higher percentage and time of floating behaviors that was decreased along acquisition sessions, but increased again in the visible platform and reversal learning sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g002">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>). These results suggest that an increased floating behavior cannot account for the reduced swimming speed of Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice in the MWM. One possible explanation for the increased floating behavior in wild type mice could be that rather than being a stress response, the floating behavior may reflect a spatial orientation phase of the animals. To test this hypothesis we determined the occurrence of orientation movements (e.g., turns in the swim path) during such floating period. Only wild type mice did orientation movements during the floating periods (1,5&#x000b1;.01 orientations in wild type).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Thigmotaxis</title><p>To discard other possible non-spatial learning strategies, such as thigmotaxis (swimming along the walls of the pool), we analyzed the time and distances traveled by the mice in the periphery and the center of the tank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g002">Fig. 2C and 2D</xref>). This analysis did not reveal differences between genotypes in the first acquisition sessions. However, wild type mice showed a significant decrease in the amount of time spent in the periphery in the last sessions of the acquisition phase, which was not observed in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mutants. In the cued session, Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice spent more time in the periphery than wild types, but the number and the time of floating episodes were reduced. Thus, the worse performance of mutants in the last sessions might be due to an altered searching strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Learning strategies in the MWM</title><p>Since the poorer execution of heterozygous mice during the acquisition phase was not directly correlated with the reduced speed (that was constant along sessions) nor with an increased floating behavior, but the searching trajectory of the mice was significantly different, we sought to analyze in detail the learning strategies used by Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice. To this end, we used a customized analysis program, <italic>jTracks</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g003">Fig. 3</xref> shows the scatter plots of the swimming patterns observed in the MWM, showing the integrated tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and the color-coded frequencies of stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), being the most frequently visited areas in red and orange. Plotted along the four acquisition sessions, the swimming patterns show that wild type mice develop a clear spatial preference, whereas heterozygotes distribute their activity similarly across all quadrants, indicating reduced spatial learning. Moreover, a careful analysis of the time of permanence in each quadrant along sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), revealed that Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice did not show the increase in the percentage of time spent in the platform quadrant (NW in blue), that characterizes spatial learning, and that was present in wild types. Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; showed a similar percentage of time in the trained quadrant along all acquisition sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

The swimming speed of mice in the water maze can vary dramatically depending on the environmental conditions, especially the water temperature. However, comparing the swimming speed of a mutant strain of mice with the raw average swimming speeds of control mice during an entire trial does not allow distinguishing between an intrinsic inability to sustain typical levels of swimming speed because of primary motor dysfunction or behavioral and/or neurosensory artifacts. The swimming test, allows to revisit and to expand the specific analysis of motor and stress-related behaviors. In this experiment we have decreased the sampling interval to 1s and analyzed second-to-second variations in swimming speed of Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice in order to improve temporal resolution and potentially capture finer details of the speed variability. We analyzed swimming speed during 60 s in the water tank at 25&#x000b0;C and the following day at 17&#x000b0;C, a temperature that is more stressful for the animal. We decided to use these conditions, since the goal was to analyze the contribution of &#x0201c;despair-like&#x0201d; behaviors to the reduced performance in the navigation task. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> displays the raw average swimming speeds during the whole trial as a function of the genotype of animals under non-aversive circumstances (25&#x000b0;C).

As assessed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA (with water temperature and genotype as the main factors), the reduction in water temperature in the swimming tank from 25&#x000b0;C to 17&#x000b0;C produced significant genotype-dependent effect on the swimming speed, which showed a significant interaction between water temperature and genotype.

One possibility in the present experiments was that the impairment observed was in fact contributed by other factors, or the use of non-spatial learning strategies, as has been also demonstrated in other mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Stasko1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard, previous works in our laboratory showed that the Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; phenotype is characterized by a marked hypoactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Fotaki2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This was also the case in the water maze experiment, since Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice showed a constant reduction in swimming speed, that could contribute to the differences in escape latency, since distance was less affected. However, even though the reduced speed was constant along all sessions, escape latencies only showed significant differences in the last two acquisition sessions. This could be attributed to the fact that wild type mice reduced their tigmotactic behavior along sessions, whereas Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice persisted in the use of this non-spatial strategy. Moreover, both groups displayed very few behaviors indicative of sensorimotor impairments during place task performance; i.e., although escape latencies were increased in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice, there were no differences in failing to climb onto the platform, or jumping off the platform.</p><p>To investigate further if impaired learning strategies could account for the observed deficits we performed a careful analysis of the swimming trajectories. This analysis showed that spatial preference for the platform quadrant was only developed by wild type mice, whereas heterozygous mice distributed their activity similarly across all quadrants, indicating reduced spatial learning. As a consequence, permanence time in the target quadrant did not increase along sessions in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, the calculated searching error and the Wishaw's index corresponding to the percentage of path traveled within a straight corridor connecting the start and the goal, was increased in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice thus most probably contributing to their worse performance. These results indicate that <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> dose reduction may contribute to impairment in the development of adequate spatial learning strategies, although it does not completely abolish the learning capacities of these mice, thus suggesting that the correct dosage of <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> is necessary for the adequate performance of the spatial learning task. It should be borne in mind, however, that transgenic mice overexpressing <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> show a more severe learning phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Altafaj1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Ahn1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Regarding the spatial memory component of the task, that is explored during the probe trial, even though Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice demonstrated certain knowledge of the correct quadrant, thus discarding other non-cognitive problems, such as vision problems, they made significantly fewer target crossings over the exact location where the platform had originally been located than wild types.</p><p>In view of the relatively slight effects on the MWM paradigm, and since alterations in other hippocampal-dependent tasks have been described in DS models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Fernandez2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> we performed a novel object recognition test.

These data provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence associating <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> expression levels with CREB phosphorylation, hippocampal morphological aberrations and learning deficits.

In support of this hypothesis, the learning and memory pattern observed in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice is similar to hippocampally-lesioned animals that also learn at a slower rate than sham-lesioned animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Packard1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Gaffan1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, but show partially preserved memory.

Reduced swimming speed could be dependent on increased floating behavior, that has been considered a non-searching strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Stasko1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the analysis of floating bursts revealed that floating was not predominant in heterozygous mice. This reduced floating is a striking observation, in view of the poorer performance of mutant mice in the MWM. Thus, we analyzed the occurrence of orientation movements (e.g., turns in the swim path) during such floating periods. The presence of orientation movements was only detected in wild type animals, suggesting the possibility that the floating behavior detected in our experiments may reflect a spatial orientation phase of the animals.</p><p>However, since floating behavior may also reflect a stress-related response, being thus a potential confounding factor in the interpretation of these results, we attempted to modulate the degree of aversiveness associated with the water maze task by using a swimming test in which we could decrease the temperature of the water in the same pool used for the water maze, from 25&#x000b0;C to 17&#x000b0;C. Thus, the experimental design used in the swimming test shared some of the characteristics of the Porsolt swimming test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Porsolt1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, with the exception of the size of the pool. Surprisingly, under the less aversive circumstances (25&#x000b0;C) that were the same used in the spatial learning task (water maze), no genotype-dependent differences in average swimming speeds are observed, contrary to the results attained when the escape platform was present in the pool. Although this result is difficult to interpret, it may be argued that the different performance of Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice may be dependent on an altered reactivity to situations with a stress component. Confirming this hypothesis significant genotype-dependent differences were detected in swimming speed when the temperature was reduced to 17&#x000b0; in the swimming test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002575-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, the present results indicate that genotype-dependent differences in raw swimming speed observed by us and others are most likely the result of behavioral phenomena affecting swimming patterns rather than a direct effect of motor dysfunction affecting swimming in Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice.</p><p>In conclusion, the reduced performance levels in the spatial navigational task provide evidence about the role of <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> in spatial learning in mice and support a role for <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> in the hippocampally-mediated interaction between stress and cognitive performance. We thus propose that <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> is a dosage-sensitive gene that is necessary to form spatial learning and memory storage and provide a further functional link between human <italic>DYRK1A</italic> and partially monosomy 21. Taken together, our results suggest that specific phenotypes associated with monosomy arise from the removal of critical, haploinsufficient genes such as <italic>DYRK1A</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Generation of <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> mutant mice has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Fotaki1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

The water maze consisted of a circular pool (diameter, 1.20 m; height, 0.5 m). It was filled with tepid water (24&#x000b0;C) opacified by the addition of powdered milk (0.9 kg). A white escape platform (15 cm diameter, height 24 cm) was located 1 cm below the water surface in a fixed position (NE quadrant, 22 cm away from the wall). In each trial, mice were placed at one of the starting locations in random order &#x0005b;north, south, east, west (N, S, E, W), including permutations of the four starting points per session&#x0005d; and were allowed to swim until they located the platform. Mice failing to find the platform within 60 s were placed on it for 20 s (the same period of time as the successful animals). At the end of every trial the mice were allowed to dry for 15 min in a heated enclosure and were returned to their home cage. The cue session was performed to test the swimming speed and visual ability using the visible platform, elevated 1 cm above the water and its position was clearly indicated by a visible cue (black flag). White curtains with affixed black patterns to provide an arrangement of spatial cues surrounded the maze. It was performed 24 hours after the fourth training sessions and 5 days after completion of the hidden platform training protocol. To test whether the mice remembered the location of the platform, probe trials were performed. In the probe session the platform was removed and mice were allowed to swim for 60 s. The time spent in the trained and non-trained quadrants as well as the number of platform annulus crossings during 60 s were recorded. On the next day (5 days after the last acquisition session), mice performed the reversal learning session. In this test, the platform position was changed to the opposite quadrant (SW).</p><p>All the trials were recorded and traced with an image tracking system (SMART, Panlab, Spain) connected to a video camera placed above the pool. Escape latencies, length of the swimming paths and swimming speed for each animal and trial were monitored and computed. Path length was defined as the total distance swum from the start location to the target and latency as the total duration of the trial from when the mouse was placed in the water until it located the escape platform. To better evaluate the spatial distribution of the behavior of the mice, the paths traveled in peripheral (15 cm wide) and central rings were measured in each trial. Several measures were used to assess accuracy of spatial learning in the water maze. The primary measures were cumulative search-error on training trials and a learning index (Gallagher's proximity index) computed from the trials given over the course of training. These measures rely on a computation of distance from the platform during the trial (Fernandez et al., unpublished). Briefly, to quantify proximity of the animal to the target of a water maze over the course of the search (Gallagher's proximity index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Gallagher1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>) the distance from the platform is sampled 5 times per second during the trials; these distances are averaged in 5 s bins. Swim trajectory errors were measured as the inability of a mouse to swim in a relatively direct path from the start position to the location of the hidden platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Whishaw2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002575-Whishaw3">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. A correct score (assigned a value of 100) was obtained when the subject swam directly to the platform while remaining within a 20 cm wide corridor, extending from the start location to the platform. Swimming outside the 18-cm corridor resulted in an incorrect score (given a value of 0). Gallagher's cumulative distance and Gallagher's average proximity from the goal were calculated using the SMART&#x000ae; video-tracking software and a custom-designed analysis program, jTracks (Fernandez D. et al., unpublished). The aim of this software is to expand the SMART&#x000a9; analysis by providing Gallagher proximity index, cumulative searching errors, distance traveled, escape latency, Whishaw's index, permanence time in quadrants or in center-periphery, average speed per areas and floating and to provide graphic representational tools.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Cued version of the MWM</title><p>To carefully analyze the possible factors involved in the worse performance of Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; in the MWM, a separate group of Dyrk1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) and wild type mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7) were tested in an entirely cued version. The water maze apparatus and experimental conditions are the same than in the spatial MWM protocol. One training session (four trials) was performed in which the platform was located in the center of the apparatus, protruding above the surface of the water. At the beginning of each trial, mice were placed in the maze facing the wall at one of the different starting positions &#x0005b;north, south, east, west (N, S, E, W), including permutations of the four starting points per session&#x0005d;. They were allowed to swim freely or until they reached the platform. Mice failing to find the platform within a fixed period of 60 seconds were gently guided by hand to the platform and a maximum escape latency of 60 seconds was recorded. After the animals had climbed onto the platform, they were allowed to remain on it for additional 20 seconds. Mice were then submitted to two consecutive test sessions of four trials with an inter-session resting period of 15&#x02013;20 minutes during which they were returned to their home cage. On test sessions, the escape platform was located in a fixed position (NE quadrant, 22 cm away from the wall), and had a 10 cm height visible cue (black flag) to indicate its location. The first test session was performed 1 hour after the training session 24 hours later the second test session was performed.

The apparatus was the same pool used in the MWM experiments. To maintain the same experimental conditions in the navigation task as in the MWM, milk was diluted to obtain a white opaque color and to avoid the distraction of the animal. The task consisted of two sessions that were performed along two consecutive days. During the first session (day 1), each mouse was allowed to swim during 60 s in the tank at temperature of 25&#x000b0;C. In the second session (day 2), the time of swimming was again 60 s, but the constant temperature of the water was diminished to 17&#x000b0;C.

Mice were placed into an open-field (OF) apparatus consisted of a rectangular area (70 cm wide&#x000d7;90 cm long&#x000d7;60 high) made of metacrylate. In the training trial (familiarization phase) the animals were presented with a pair of identical objects until they had explored the objects during 20 seconds, in a maximum period of 15 minutes. The exploration of the objects is considered as any investigative behavior (head orientation or sniffing occurring) or deliberate contact that occurred with each object in a distance &#x0003c; or&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2 cm or when touching with the nose. In the testing trial (the test phase), performed 24 hours later, one of the familiar objects was changed for another new, and the animals were left in the OF during 15 min. The exploration time for the familiar (TF) or the new object (TN) during the test phase was recorded. Memory was operationally defined by the discrimination index for the novel object (DI) as the proportion of time animals spent investigating the novel object minus the proportion spent investigating the familiar one in the testing period &#x0005b;Discrimination Index, DI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(Novel Object Exploration Time/Total Exploration Time)&#x02013;(Familiar Object Exploration Time/Total Exploration Time)&#x000d7;100&#x0005d;.
