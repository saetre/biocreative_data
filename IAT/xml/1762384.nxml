However, the role of mutant JAK2 in disease pathogenesis is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We expressed murine JAK2 WT or V617F via retroviral bone marrow transduction/transplantation in the hematopoietic system of two different inbred mouse strains, Balb/c and C57Bl/6 &#x00028;B6&#x00029;. In both strains, JAK2 V617F, but not JAK2 WT, induced non-fatal polycythemia characterized by increased hematocrit and hemoglobin, reticulocytosis, splenomegaly, low plasma erythropoietin &#x00028;Epo&#x00029;, and Epo-independent erythroid colonies. JAK2 V617F also induced leukocytosis and neutrophilia that was much more prominent in Balb/c mice than in B6. Platelet counts were not affected in either strain despite expression of JAK2 V617F in megakaryocytes and markedly prolonged tail bleeding times. The polycythemia tended to resolve after several months, coincident with increased spleen and marrow fibrosis, but was resurrected by transplantation to secondary recipients. Using donor mice with mutations in Lyn, Hck, and Fgr, we demonstrated that the polycythemia was independent of Src kinases. Polycythemia and reticulocytosis responded to treatment with imatinib or a JAK2 inhibitor, but were unresponsive to the Src inhibitor dasatinib.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings demonstrate that JAK2 V617F induces Epo-independent expansion of the erythroid lineage in vivo. The fact that the central erythroid features of PV are recapitulated by expression of JAK2 V617F argues that it is the primary and direct cause of human PV. The lack of thrombocytosis suggests that additional events may be required for JAK2 V617F to cause ET, but qualitative platelet abnormalities induced by JAK2 V617F may contribute to the hemostatic complications of PV. Despite the role of Src kinases in Epo signaling, our studies predict that Src inhibitors will be ineffective for therapy of PV. However, we provide proof-of-principle that a JAK2 inhibitor should have therapeutic effects on the polycythemia, and perhaps myelofibrosis and hemostatic abnormalities, suffered by MPD patients carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) are clonal disorders characterized by overproduction of mature myeloerythroid cells, abnormalities of hemostasis and thrombosis, and tendency to progress to acute leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Dameshek1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-VanEtten1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The cause of CML is the product of the Philadelphia chromosome, the BCR-ABL fusion tyrosine kinase.

PV is characterized by overproduction of mature erythrocytes, increased hematocrit and red cell mass, and splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Spivak1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Many PV patients also have increased circulating granulocytes and platelets. PV can be complicated by abnormalities of hemostasis, including platelet dysfunction and bleeding, as well as arterial and venous thrombosis. The disease infrequently evolves to acute myeloid leukemia, while progression to a &#x0201c;spent&#x0201d; phase, characterized by myelofibrosis and normal or low hematocrit, is more common. A hallmark of PV is the presence of endogenous erythroid colonies (EEC), erythroid progenitors that form colonies in vitro in the absence of exogenous erythropoietin (Epo) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Prchal1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, but demonstrate hypersensitivity to insulin-like growth factor-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Correa1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Biochemical and molecular studies of PV patients have revealed no mutations in the Epo receptor, but granulocytes from PV patients have increased transcripts for the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor family member PRV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Temerinac1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas PV platelets show decreased expression of c-Mpl, the receptor for thrombopoietin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Moliterno1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Abnormally increased tyrosine phosphatase activity has also been characterized in erythroid progenitors in PV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Xu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, whether these abnormalities are fundamental to the pathogenesis of PV was unclear.</p><p>JAK2 is a member of the Janus family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and is required for signaling from the Epo receptor and other type I cytokine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Parganas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, a somatic mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase was identified in MPD patients. Studies of erythroid progenitors from PV patients demonstrated that Epo-independent erythroid maturation was impaired by a JAK2 inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Ugo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and by siRNA knockdown of JAK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-James1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This prompted sequencing of the JAK2 gene, which identified a G to A point mutation, resulting in substitution of phenylalanine for valine at amino acid 617 (V617F) in the JAK2 pseudokinase domain in the majority of PV patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-James1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The JAK2 V617F mutant had constitutive kinase activity in vivo in the absence of Epo stimulation, and retroviral expression in murine BM caused erythrocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-James1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The same mutation was independently identified through genomic sequencing of tyrosine kinases in MPD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Baxter1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Levine1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and by investigation of loss of heterozygosity involving the JAK2 gene on chromosome 9p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Kralovics1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The JAK2 V617F mutation is found in nearly every patient with PV and is present in homozygous form through mitotic recombination in up to 30&#x00025; of patients.

However, it is not clear whether JAK2 V617F can be implicated as the direct and primary cause of PV, ET, or CIMF, nor is the relationship between the different MPDs that share the JAK2 mutation understood. Here, we investigated the role of JAK2 V617F in the pathogenesis of MPD by expression of the mutant kinase in the hematopoietic system of laboratory mice, using retroviral BM transduction and transplantation. Our results suggest that JAK2 V617F is the primary cause of PV, but not of ET.

In both strains, recipients of JAK2 V617F-transduced BM exhibited markedly increased blood hematocrit and hemoglobin levels that were evident by three weeks after transplantation and sustained for months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>), while recipients of JAK2 WT- or vector-transduced BM were normal. Polycythemia was accompanied by a striking increase in circulating reticulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). The erythrocyte lifespan in JAK2 V617F recipients was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), and polycythemia was accompanied by a proportional increase in red cell mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicate that the polycythemia in these recipients was due to primary overproduction of erythrocytes, not to an increase in red cell survival or decrease in plasma volume. Plasma Epo levels were suppressed in JAK2 V617F recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), demonstrating that the erythropoiesis in these mice is autonomous, and not driven by overproduction of Epo. CFU-E from BM or spleen of these recipients showed increased sensitivity to Epo, with about 25&#x02013;30&#x00025; of CFU-E growing in the absence of exogenous Epo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g001">Figure 1H</xref>), demonstrating the presence of EEC in the polycythemic mice. Interestingly, the frequency of Epo-independent BFU-E in these recipients was much lower (data not shown), suggesting that JAK2 V617F acts in the most differentiated erythroid progenitors to promote Epo-independent maturation. Together, these results indicate that JAK2 V617F expression directly induces polycythemia in mice through Epo-independent overproduction of erythrocytes. The fact that the central erythroid features of PV are recapitulated by expression of JAK2 V617F argues that it is the primary and direct cause of human PV.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>JAK2 V617F induces strain-dependent leukocytosis, but not thrombocytosis</title><p>In contrast to the polycythemia, the effects of JAK2 V617F expression on leukocyte and platelet counts were more variable.

The majority of the leukocytes were mature neutrophils with some immature erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), and there was a notable absence of circulating immature myeloid progenitors that are characteristic of BCR-ABL-induced CML-like MPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

Flow cytometric analysis of BM and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) demonstrated GFP expression in myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and lymphoid cells, with a shift in erythropoiesis to the spleen, and a relative increase in immature (CD71<sup>&#x0002b;/lo</sup>TER119<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) erythroid progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g003">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Constitutive activation of JAK2 V617F and downstream signaling pathways in polycythemic mice</title><p>To determine the biochemical properties of JAK2 V617F in vivo, we performed western blot analysis of extracts from primary myeloerythroid cells from recipients of JAK2 V617F- and JAK2 WT-transduced BM. There was modest (2- to 3-fold) overexpression of JAK2 in both cohorts, relative to the level of endogenous JAK2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). There was constitutive activation of JAK2 V617F in BM and spleen cells, as evidenced by phosphorylation at the activation loop tyrosines 1007 and 1008, whereas JAK2 WT was not detectably phosphorylated. We also analyzed several signaling pathways that are activated by Epo receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). There was increased phosphorylation of Gab2 and ERK in spleens and BM from JAK2 V617F recipients that were somewhat variable from sample to sample, but no consistent activation of Akt (data not shown). There was constitutive activation of Stat5 and detectable expression of the Stat5 target Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> in BM of both normal and polycythemic mice, with increased Stat5 phosphorylation and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> in spleens from JAKV617F recipients, although this could in part reflect the increase in splenic myeloerythroid cells in these mice. These results suggest that JAK2 V617F activates several signaling pathways in primary murine hematopoietic cells. Southern blot analysis of proviral integration demonstrated that multiple proviral clones contributed to the MPD induced by JAK2 V617F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), similar to that observed for BCR-ABL-induced CML-like MPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Roumiantsev1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Progression of polycythemia to myelofibrosis</title><p>The polycythemia induced by JAK2 V617F was maximal at 3 to 4 months post-transplantation, but tended to decrease with time in both strains, with hematocrit and reticulocyte counts returning to nearly normal ranges by 7 to 8 months after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and some mice developing overt anemia. This coincided with a gradual but marked increase in fibrosis in the BM and spleen of JAK2 V617F recipients that was not observed in JAK2 WT recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This is reminiscent of evolution of human PV to a &#x0201c;spent phase&#x0201d; resembling CIMF. Interestingly, polycythemia and reticulocytosis were efficiently resurrected in secondary mice by transplantation of BM and/or spleen cells from primary JAK2 V617F recipients, and this was equally true for donors harvested in the early, polycythemic phase of the disease as well as the later, myelofibrotic phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000018-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that JAK2 V617F expression induces myelofibrosis, but the resulting impairment of erythropoiesis is due to a defect of the hematopoietic microenvironment, rather than a deficiency of malignant hematopoietic stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>JAK2 V617F-induced polycythemia is independent of Src kinases</title><p>This model of JAK2 V617F-induced polycythemia can be used to investigate signaling pathways critical for disease pathogenesis.

The results demonstrate that these particular Src kinases are not required for polycythemia induced by JAK2 V617F, and might even play a negative role in JAK2 V617F signaling. There is a possibility that one or more of the other six vertebrate Src family kinases might compensate for lack of these three, particularly Fyn, Yes, and c-Src, which are expressed in myeloid cells.

This suggests that compensation by other Src family members is unlikely to play a role in polycythemia induced by JAK2 V617F in these mutant cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>JAK2 V617F-induced polycythemia responds to kinase inhibitor therapy</title><p>We treated cohorts of polycythemic JAK2 V617F recipient mice for a 2-week period with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib and the dual ABL/Src inhibitor dasatinib (BMS-354825).

However, the facts that polycythemia induced in mice by JAK2 V617F is polyclonal and manifested immediately following engraftment argue that JAK2 V617F is both necessary and sufficient for this phenotype. Increased expression of JAK2 V617F in patients with homozygous mutations may increase severity of the phenotype in PV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Tefferi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, perhaps because the mutant and WT JAK2 kinases compete for Epo receptor binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-James1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In our model, robust polycythemia is induced by modest overexpression of JAK2 V617F in BM with two normal JAK2 genes, but further studies will be necessary to determine whether the phenotype is influenced by levels of normal JAK2. Taken together, these results establish JAK2 V617F as the direct cause of PV.</p><p>In contrast to the polycythemia, the effect of JAK2 V617F on the leukocyte and platelet counts was more variable. JAK2 V617F induced striking leukocytosis and neutrophilia in Balb/c mice, but leukocytosis was much milder in B6 recipients. This finding suggests that genetic differences between the two inbred strains modify the leukocyte response to the mutant JAK2 kinase. Somewhat surprisingly, there was no effect of JAK2 V617F on the platelet count in either strain, despite the detection of proviral gene expression (GFP) in CD41<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from spleen and BM, and in megakaryocytes purified from short-term in vitro cultures. This suggests that JAK2 V617F does not directly induce an increase in platelets, and that additional mutations or factors are necessary to explain the thrombocytosis in ET patients with JAK2 V617F. This is consistent with clinical studies demonstrating that the allelic ratio of the JAK2 V617F mutation does not account for the clonal hematopoiesis in many ET patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Levine2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, and that ET patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation tend to have PV-like features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Campbell2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the lack of effect on platelet number, JAK2 V617F expression caused profound abnormalities of megakaryocyte maturation and platelet function, manifested by small megakaryocytes, abnormal mitoses during proplatelet formation, and a markedly prolonged tail bleeding time. These findings imply that JAK2 V617F might be the direct cause of the hemostatic abnormalities and mucosal bleeding frequently encountered in PV patients. We did not observe any obvious thrombotic events in our cohorts of polycythemic mice despite the significant elevation in hematocrit, and further studies will be necessary to determine if recipients of JAK2 V617F-transduced BM have abnormalities of coagulation.</p><p>The polycythemia induced by JAK2 V617F was sustained for several months, but eventually hematocrit and reticulocyte counts returned to normal levels in both strains by 8 months after transplantation. This was accompanied by prominent fibrosis in both BM and spleen of these recipients. This process bears a striking resemblance to the &#x0201c;spent&#x0201d; phase of PV, a condition resembling CIMF. CIMF patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation are clinically distinct from those lacking JAK2 mutation, and have a worse overall prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Campbell3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings suggest that some or all CIMF patients with JAK2 V617F might actually represent PV patients that progressed to myelofibrosis prior to diagnosis. It is not clear whether the defective hematopoiesis in spent phase PV and CIMF is due to a deficiency of hematopoietic stem cells, or to a defective hematopoietic microenvironment. The fact that polycythemia can be efficiently transplanted to secondary recipients from mice with myelofibrosis argues that the problem is with the soil, not the seed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Westervelt1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This model system of human PV should be valuable for investigating the signaling pathways required for disease pathogenesis, and for testing the response to novel therapies, particularly drugs directed against specific molecular targets. In this report, we investigated the role of Src family kinases in the pathogenesis of JAK2 V617F-induced polycythemia. Although Src kinases are activated by JAK2 in erythroid cells upon Epo stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Richmond1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and a Src inhibitor impaired Epo-independent maturation of PV erythroid progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-James1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, we demonstrated that polycythemia induced by JAK2 V617F was independent of Lyn, Hck, and Fgr, the three principal Src family kinases expressed in myeloerythroid cells. In complementary studies where diseased mice were treated with dasatinib, a potent inhibitor of both ABL and Src kinases, there was minimal response of polycythemia and reticulocytosis to a regimen that is very effective for treatment of mice inoculated with BCR-ABL-expressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Shah1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest that other Src family kinases are not compensating for deficiency of Lyn, Hck, and Fgr, and argue that therapy directed at Src kinases will be ineffective in PV patients. By contrast, imatinib therapy did cause a significant decrease in hematocrit and reticulocyte counts in JAK2 V617F recipients, and similar responses have been reported in PV patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Jones2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that imatinib was more effective than dasatinib indicates that a target other than ABL or c-Kit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000018-Schittenhelm1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> mediates these responses. By analogy to CML, if PV is caused directly by JAK2 V617F, then the disease should be exquisitely sensitive to small molecule inhibitors of JAK2. There are no inhibitors of JAK kinases in current clinical use, and existing preclinical JAK2 inhibitors are compromised by lack of oral bioavailability and short in vivo half-life. Nevertheless, continuous parenteral delivery of the tyrphostin JAK2 inhibitor AG-490 to polycythemic mice caused a modest but significant drop in hematocrit, with a more profound decrease in reticulocyte count. These results provide proof-of-principle that more chronic administration of a potent, orally delivered JAK2 inhibitor should have therapeutic effects on the polycythemia, and perhaps the myelofibrosis and hemostatic abnormalities, suffered by MPD patients carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation. Further studies using this model should clarify the molecular pathogenesis of JAK2 V617F-associated MPD, and allow preclinical testing of novel therapies for these diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mo-Ying Hsieh and Oya Cingoz for assistance with erythroid colony and Epo assays and Drs.
