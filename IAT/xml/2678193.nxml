Higher plasma levels of IL-6, in turn, increase the risk of many conditions associated with aging including age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms underlying this association between IL-6 and cognitive vulnerability remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We investigated the role of IL-6 in brain aging in young (4 mo) and aged (24 mo) wild-type C57BL6 and genetically-matched IL-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and determined that IL-6 was necessary and sufficient for increased neuronal expression of the superoxide-producing immune enzyme, NADPH-oxidase, and this was mediated by non-canonical NF&#x003ba;B signaling. Furthermore, superoxide production by NADPH-oxidase was directly responsible for age-related loss of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, neurons essential for normal information processing, encoding, and retrieval in hippocampus and cortex. Targeted deletion of IL-6 or elimination of superoxide by chronic treatment with a superoxide-dismutase mimetic prevented age-related loss of PV-interneurons and reversed age-related cognitive deficits on three standard tests of spatial learning and recall.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Present results indicate that IL-6 mediates age-related loss of critical PV-expressing GABAergic interneurons through increased neuronal NADPH-oxidase-derived superoxide production, and that rescue of these interneurons preserves cognitive performance in aging mice, suggesting that elevated peripheral IL-6 levels may be directly and mechanistically linked to long-lasting cognitive deficits in even normal older individuals. Further, because PV-interneurons are also selectively affected by commonly used anesthetic agents and drugs, our findings imply that IL-6 levels may predict adverse CNS effects in older patients exposed to these compounds through specific derangements in inhibitory interneurons, and that therapies directed at lowering IL-6 may have cognitive benefits clinically.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple studies have found that circulating markers of inflammation, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), are increased in older individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Krabbe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Ershler1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and are strongly associated with enhanced risk of disease and disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Ershler1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Despite this body of literature, the specific mechanisms which link peripheral IL-6 and central nervous system impairment are still largely unknown.</p><p>In the periphery, IL-6 is well characterized as a pleiotropic cytokine with trophic effects on T-cells and other immune cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Maggio1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Ershler1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Trikha1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>). IL-6 also acts as an important pro-inflammatory cytokine and key mediator of the acute phase response, including induction of C-reactive protein (CRP). Canonical IL-6 signaling involves binding of IL-6 to its cognate receptor (IL-6R)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Boulanger1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> to cause dimerization of two gp130 proteins, which in turn activate intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulation through the Jak/STAT (janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway, and the transcription factor SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-3). An alternative signaling pathway involves cleavage of the full-length membrane-bound IL-6R to produce the soluble sIL-6R, which binds to IL-6 and can then activate gp130 signaling directly, even in cells lacking membrane IL-6 receptors(reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Maggio1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). Our understanding of the biology of IL-6 in the nervous system is more limited. Brain expression of IL-6 has been shown to mediate the sickness behavior, a syndrome of neurocognitive changes in response to acute infection which includes lethargy, confusion, and cognitive deficits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Cartmell1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Emerging evidence, however, suggests a more complex role for brain IL-6 in CNS function, including modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Qiu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Campbell1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have recently reported in a mouse model of schizophrenia that administration of the dissociative anesthetic and drug-of-abuse, ketamine, to young mice increased brain expression of IL-6 and NADPH oxidase (Nox2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Behrens1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent studies also suggest that even in healthy older adults without MCI or AD, circulating IL-6 is inversely correlated with cognitive performance, and that there is a linear relationship between elevated plasma IL-6 and poor cognitive function. Because of this consistent association between higher plasma IL-6 and adverse health outcomes, IL-6 was named &#x0201c;the gerontologist's cytokine&#x0201d; by William Ershler, who speculated that this cytokine regulates a key aging pathway in man<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Ershler2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the question of whether IL-6 is primarily a marker or is mechanistically integral to age-related nervous system dysfunction has not been established.</p><p>We found that expression of Nox2, the respiratory burst oxidase, was significantly increased in neurons throughout the hippocampus and cortex in aged mouse brain, as documented by immunocytochemistry, Western blot analysis, and mRNA (data not shown). Increased Nox2 protein was associated with enhanced Nox2 activity and superoxide production in neurons and in synaptosomes, and in fact, Nox2 appeared to be the major source of increased cytosolic and synaptosomal superoxide production in old animals. This was supported by results showing that systemic administration of the Nox inhibitor, apocynin reduced superoxide production in neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> to levels similar to those in young animals. Moreover, two chemically distinct Nox inhibitors, apocynin and AEBSF, fully blocked the age-related increase in Nox2 activity (O<sub>2</sub> consumption) in synaptosomes prepared from old animals, and apocynin reduced synaptosomal superoxide production to levels in young synaptosomes, as well. Our data further indicated that Nox2 is tonically active in neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, as evidenced by ongoing neuronal superoxide production in normal awake mice which was blocked not only by apocynin, but by oral treatment with the SOD mimetic, <italic>C<sub>3</sub></italic>. Nox2 was also found to be constitutively active in synaptosomes; Nox2-dependent O<sub>2</sub> consumption and superoxide production in synaptosomes was detected immediately after addition of the substrate, NADPH, and in contrast to a number of other studies which have required agents, such as phorbol esters, to induce assembly of the Nox2 complex, required no other additions to observe O<sub>2</sub> consumption and superoxide generation. These results suggest that in neurons and at the synapse, Nox2 is in the assembled, superoxide-capable form, and is responsible for a sustained increase in neuronal and synaptic superoxide production in the aged brain. Thus, we believe this to be the first report that Nox2 is the major source of neuronal and synaptic superoxide production in normal aging brain.</p><p>There has been debate over whether apocynin inhibits the p47<sup>phox</sup>-dependent Nox isoforms (Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, and Nox5), with a recent paper suggesting that in vascular smooth muscle cells, apocynin may be acting as an antioxidant rather than a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and that standard chemiluminescence-based assays for Nox activity may produce artifacts in the presence of apocynin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Heumuller1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our ability to induce Nox2 in brain by direct peripheral IL-6 administration suggests that the former process may be operative in our experiments.

The decreased expression of Nox2 we observed in old <italic>IL-6-/-</italic> mice compared to wild-type mice was accompanied by a significant reduction in nuclear NF&#x003ba;B activity. Although IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; are strong inducers of NF&#x003ba;B activation, expression of these two cytokines, measured by RT-qPCR, was not statistically different between old wild-type and old <italic>IL-6-/-</italic> mice (data not shown) suggesting that the specific loss of IL-6 expression, not changes in these other cytokines, was responsible for decreased nuclear NF&#x003ba;B activity in aged <italic>IL-6-/-</italic> mouse brain. More importantly, direct application of IL-6 to cultured neurons resulted in a significant increase in Nox-2 expression and superoxide production which was fully blocked by the NF&#x003ba;B translocation inhibitor, SN50. It has recently been shown in epithelial tumor cells that IL-6 activates NF&#x003ba;B signaling through binding of unphosphorylated STAT3 (U-STAT3) to NF&#x003ba;B, promoting STAT3-NF&#x003ba;B translocation to the nucleus via nuclear targeting sequences in STAT3, resulting in subsequent transcription of a subset of NF&#x003ba;B-dependent genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Yang1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it has become increasingly clear that NF&#x003ba;B signaling is highly complex, and is dependent on the stimulus, tissue, cell type, and context. For example, NF&#x003ba;B activated by TNF&#x003b1; induces transcription of a panel of genes, including IL-6 and RANTES, whereas NF&#x003ba;B activation by notch fails to induce these two genes. Therefore, although both Nox2 and p22<sup>phox</sup> are classic NF&#x003ba;B target genes which are induced by TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, this is to our knowledge, the first report that IL-6 acting through non-canonical NF&#x003ba;B signaling can directly induce Nox2 expression in neurons.</p><p>Recent work has suggested that the brain maintains a physiological range of superoxide production that is required for normal nervous system function. Perturbations of superoxide levels in either direction are associated with impaired LTP, altered glutamatergic neurotransmission, and poorer cognitive performance.

Thus, superoxide in brain has been the focus of several recent studies on cognitive deficits in aging.</p><p>Increased neuronal superoxide production at the synapse, specifically the glutamatergic synapse, can affect a number of redox-regulated proteins important to synaptic activity and plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Behrens2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Kishida2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Dysregulation of the activity of these proteins would in turn affect normal glutamatergic transmission, and thus cognition. We recently reported that acute (days) elevation of superoxide production in brain by ketamine caused the loss of phenotype of PV-interneurons, as demonstrated by reduced PV and GAD67 immunoreactivity, which recovered over a few days. In contrast, here we show that sustained superoxide production by Nox2 during aging produces a significant decrease in these same neurons throughout hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. There was loss of 45&#x00025;, 20&#x00025;, 33&#x00025;, and 17&#x00025; of these neurons in hippocampal CA3, CA1, DG, and prefrontal cortex, respectively, in 24 month-old mice. This decline was completely rescued by treatment of mice with the small molecule SOD mimetic, <italic>C<sub>3</sub></italic>, from middle age. Systemic treatment with <italic>C<sub>3</sub></italic> has been previously shown to reduce brain superoxide levels significantly. These results strongly suggest that sustained Nox-dependent superoxide production during aging may be responsible for the decline in PV-interneuron numbers. In addition, as predicted by our results showing that injected IL-6 induces brain Nox2, and that <italic>IL-6-/-</italic> mice lack induction of Nox2, there was preservation of these interneurons in aged <italic>IL-6-/-</italic> mice which was highly significant for CA3, and approached significance for CA1. While our data suggest that neurons are the primary source of Nox2-derived synaptic superoxide, and that in this model of non-pathological aging, very few astrocytes have detectable Nox2 protein or superoxide production, there is no way to rule out local Nox-dependent superoxide release by astrocytes at the synapse as contributing to the observed effects.</p><p>PV-interneurons subserve an important role in cognitive processes, and are critically positioned to modulate hippocampal and PFC-dependent cognitive processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Bartos1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

To determine whether rescue of PV-interneurons was associated with improved cognitive performance, we carried out behavioral testing, and found that aged IL-6-/- mice, which had significant preservation of PV-neurons in CA3, had significantly greater recognition of three novel objects, and then showed greater habituation to compared to wild-type controls. Habituation to a novel environment tests simple learning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Hunsaker1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005518-Bakker1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> without the need for aversive stimuli, and has been shown to be impaired in animals with lesions to CA3. In addition, while aged wild-type mice showed impaired abilities in finding the escape chamber in the Barnes maze, <italic>IL-6</italic>-/- mice progressively found the escape chamber more quickly across trials.

Taken together, our data suggest that loss of PV-interneurons in the hippocampus could underlie age-related cognitive deficits in older humans. Furthermore, the data suggests that decreasing IL-6 induction of Nox2, or eliminating downstream superoxide production directly can preserve cognitive performance.</p><p>Increased circulating IL-6 is a highly prevalent finding in older adults, with estimates based on the clinical literature that more than 80&#x00025; of individuals over the age of 65 will have circulating levels of IL-6 greater than 5 pg/ml. This indicates that a sizeable and growing number of older individuals might be at risk for IL-6-mediated cognitive effects. In addition, our results showing that sustained elevation of peripheral IL-6 results in loss of PV-interneurons with aging provide several clinically-testable hypotheses. The PV-interneurons targeted by IL-6 represent the same interneuron population that is selectively vulnerable to injury from commonly-used general anesthetics, and this vulnerability is observed even at low doses of these agents. Thus, the use of general anesthetics in patients with chronic elevation of circulating IL-6 might be predicted to increase the risk of adverse cognitive outcomes after anesthesia. Because treatments which lower plasma IL-6 levels and/or block IL-6 signaling are currently in clinical use for other indications, these agents could be used to test idea that lowering IL-6 may preserve in the integrity of the PV-inhibitory system and prevent associated cognitive deficits. Clinical testing of the mechanisms presented here could further contribute to our broader understanding of the role of inflammatory signaling in both physiology and pathology the brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Antibodies used were as follows: anti-parvalbumin rabbit polyclonal was from Swant (Bellizona, Switzerland), and anti-GAD67 monoclonal from Chemicon (Millipore).

Each mouse was then moved to a holding cage, and three novel objects (plastic toy animals glued to a 4&#x000d7;4 in Plexiglas base) were placed in three corners of the testing chamber. After a brief interval, the mouse was placed back into the chamber for another 5 minutes; exploration was assessed by analyzing the number of contacts, defined as nose-first approaches to within 2&#x02013;4 cm of an object, with a given object in a trial, and habituation was assessed by comparing the number of contacts made with each object over the course of two subsequent trials, three in all. Between animals, the testing chamber, as well as the objects, were cleaned with AirX44 disinfectant and odor counteractant (AirX Laboratories; Folcroft, PA), to remove olfactory cues.
