Accurate annotation of sequenced genomes heavily depends on the availability of gene and protein sequences from other species to allow identification and functional characterization of novel genes by similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Another area that benefits from interspecies comparisons through the use of cellular and animal model systems is the study of human disease, in which it is often not possible to investigate underlying defects directly. Key to the applicability of these models is the extent to which they accurately reflect the biologic system of interest. Here we address this issue for two metal homeostatic systems, by examining the conservation of transcriptional responses to changing copper and iron levels in budding and fission yeast.</p><p>Because of its redox properties, copper is an essential cofactor of many enzymes involved in free radical scavenging, including copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and the respiratory chain (cytochrome <italic>c </italic>oxidase). On the other hand, an excess of free copper can react with oxygen, generating reactive oxygen species that damage cellular components such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. To prevent this from happening, specialized homeostatic mechanisms that tightly control the availability of copper within cells are present in virtually all organisms. These mechanisms have been extensively studied in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and the components involved are highly conserved from prokaryotes to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>provides a complementary model of copper homeostasis. It is estimated that <italic>S. pombe </italic>diverged from <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>approximately 0.3 to 1.1 billion years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and many gene sequences are as distantly related between the two yeasts as to their human homologs. A comparison between budding and fission yeast can therefore provide valuable information on the degree to which copper pathways have diverged during evolution.</p><p>Copper trafficking in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>begins at the plasma membrane, where it is taken up as Cu(I) by the Ctr1p and Ctr3p transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Under normal conditions this also requires the action of the ferric/cupric reductases Fre1p and Fre2p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Regulation of the copper uptake system is mediated at the transcriptional level by the copper-sensing regulator Mac1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Once in the cytoplasm, copper is shuttled to its target proteins by specific intracellular copper chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. One of these chaperones, namely Atx1p, delivers copper to the Ccc2p ATPase in the Golgi system for incorporation into the cuproenzymes Fet3p and Fet5p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These paralogous proteins are multi-copper oxidases that exhibit ferrous oxidase activity and form a high-affinity iron transport complex with the Ftr1p and Fth1p proteins, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Copper must therefore be available for the iron transport/mobilization machinery to function, and low copper availability leads to secondary iron starvation in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Similar to copper, iron must be reduced before its uptake at the plasma membrane. This process is partly mediated by the same Fre1p and Fre2p reductases that play a role in copper uptake, together with four additional paralogs (Fre3p to Fre6p) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A second, nonreductive iron uptake system involves the four proteins Arn1p to Arn4p, which can acquire iron from siderophore-iron chelates in the medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The intimate link between copper and iron metabolism in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>is reflected by the fact that Rcs1p (Aft1p), which is the transcription factor responsible for induction of the iron uptake systems, also regulates <italic>FRE1</italic>, <italic>CCC2</italic>, <italic>ATX1</italic>, <italic>FET3 </italic>and <italic>FET5</italic>, which are involved in copper trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A second iron-responsive transcription factor, Aft2p, regulates a subset of Aft1p targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but its role in iron homeostasis is less well understood.</p><p>When copper levels are high, <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>specifically induces expression of <italic>SOD1 </italic>and the <italic>CUP1a/b </italic>and <italic>CRS5 </italic>metallothioneins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Metallothioneins represent a group of intracellular, low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich proteins that sequester free metal ions, preventing their toxic accumulation in the cell. The response to high copper is mediated by the transcriptional regulator Ace1p (Cup2p) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Compared with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, copper metabolism in <italic>S. pombe </italic>is less well understood, although homologs to several budding yeast core components have now been experimentally characterized. Three genes encode the high affinity copper uptake transporters: <italic>ctr4 </italic>and <italic>ctr5</italic>, whose products are localized to the plasma membrane, and <italic>ctr6</italic>, which encodes a vacuolar membrane transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Expression of these transporters is regulated by Cuf1p, which is functionally similar to <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Mac1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Both the reductive and nonreductive iron uptake systems are also present in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. The reductive system consists of the ferric reductase Frp1p, the Fio1p multi-copper oxidase, and the Fip1p permease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], whereas the siderophore-iron transporters are encoded by <italic>str1</italic>, <italic>str2</italic>, and <italic>str3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. When sufficient iron is available, expression of the reductive and nonreductive uptake systems is repressed by the Fep1p transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, in contrast to <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Mac1p, the copper-dependent regulator Cuf1p was reported to repress directly the reductive iron uptake system during copper starvation in <italic>S. pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Only two genes have thus far been implicated in resistance to high copper stress in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. These encode the superoxide dismutase copper chaperone Ccs1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and a phytochelatin synthase (PCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Phytochelatins are a class of peptides that play an important role in heavy metal detoxification in plants and fungi, but which are absent in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. They are nontranslationally synthesized by PCS from glutathione and can sequester unbound heavy metals. Loss of function of either of the genes encoding Ccs1p or PCS results in increased sensitivity to high copper levels in fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. One metallothionein gene, <italic>zym1</italic>, has also been identified in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, but exposure to high copper did not affect its expression level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. No transcription factors that regulate the response to high copper have thus far been described.</p><p>Global gene expression studies have been insightful in exploring transcriptional responses to stress in both budding and fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. To identify novel fission yeast genes that may play a role in copper and iron homeostasis, we used DNA microarrays to evaluate differential gene expression in <italic>S. pombe </italic>cells growing under varying copper and iron levels. The results were compared with data gathered from a similar set of experiments conducted in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] in order to determine the extent to which responses to changes in environmental copper levels have diverged between the two yeasts. We show that despite conservation of core elements, significant differences exist in the regulation of copper and iron metabolism genes in budding and fission yeast, in particular in their responses to copper toxicity. Our findings also provide new insights into the coregulation of copper and iron metabolism in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We monitored global gene expression in <italic>S. pombe </italic>wild-type cells in response to changes in environmental copper levels. Two conditions were initially investigated: copper starvation (100 &#x003bc;mol/l bathocuproinedisulfonic acid [BCS], a copper chelator) and copper excess (2 or 25 &#x003bc;mol/l CuSO<sub>4</sub>). These conditions allowed induction of known copper-dependent genes without adverse effects on growth rate that could confound the results. The conditions for copper starvation were chosen based on data from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. For copper excess, we tested a number of concentrations close to the levels that were known to affect growth in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and selected those that did not negatively affect <italic>S. pombe </italic>growth rate (data not shown). RNA samples were collected at regular intervals after addition of either BCS or CuSO<sub>4 </sub>and compared with untreated wild-type cells by DNA microarray analysis.</p><sec><title>Copper deprivation does not cause significant iron starvation in fission yeast</title><p>The classes of genes whose expression was either induced or repressed under copper starvation in fission yeast are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> (also see Additional data file 1 [Supplementary table 1]). A major group of genes upregulated by BCS addition was involved in metal ion uptake, including genes encoding copper transporters, namely <italic>ctr5 </italic>and <italic>ctr6</italic>, which have previously been reported to be induced in states of low copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Ctr5p is known to form a functional complex with Ctr4p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The gene for the latter protein was not represented on the arrays, but it was found to be highly induced (&#x0003e;24&#x000d7;) in a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) performed on the same samples used for the microarray experiment (Additional data file 1 [Supplementary table 1]).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Gene classes induced and repressed upon changes in <italic>S. pombe </italic>copper or iron status</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Condition</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Induced</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Repressed</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Classification</td><td align="left">Gene number</td><td align="left">Classification</td><td align="left">Gene number</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Low copper (100 mmol/l BCS)</td><td align="left">Metal ion transport</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">Oxidoreductases and dehydrogenases</td><td align="left">3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Peroxisomal proteins</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">Flavoproteins</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Other transport</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">Antioxidants</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Others</td><td align="left">3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Low iron (300 mmol/l FZ)</td><td align="left">Metal ion transport</td><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">Localized to the mitochondrion</td><td align="left">6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Other transport</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">Transporters</td><td align="left">3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Peptide biosynthesis</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">Metal metabolism</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Iron-Sulfur cluster assembly</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">Iron/sulfur cluster proteins</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Others/Unknown</td><td align="left">19</td><td align="left">Thiamine biosynthesis</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">Others/unknown</td><td align="left">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">High copper (2 mmol/l CuSO<sub>4</sub>)</td><td align="left">Protein folding/chaperone</td><td align="left">12</td><td align="left">Transporters</td><td align="left">7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Antioxidants</td><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">Amino acid metabolism and transport</td><td align="left">4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Sulphur amino acid biosynthesis</td><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">Ribosomal proteins</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Carbohydrate metabolism</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">Others/unknown</td><td align="left">11</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Stress response</td><td align="left">4</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Iron uptake</td><td align="left">3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Signaling and transcription regulation</td><td align="left">2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Lipid biosynthesis</td><td align="left">2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Peptide biosynthesis</td><td align="left">2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Other/unknown</td><td align="left">28</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>BCS, bathocuproinedisulfonic acid; FZ, ferrozine.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>A number of predicted flavoproteins, oxidoreductases, and dehydrogenases were downregulated during copper starvation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These enzymes catalyze a wide range of biochemical reactions, and their repression may reflect a need for copper in some of these processes. Reduced expression of the antioxidant genes <italic>gst2 </italic>and <italic>sod1</italic>, which encode a glutathione S-transferase and a copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, respectively, is not surprising, considering the aforementioned link between copper and the generation of free radicals. Downregulation of <italic>sod1 </italic>may also result from the reduced availability of copper, which is needed to convert apo-Sod1p to its active form.</p><p>Previous expression studies in budding yeast have identified a number of genes that are consistently differentially expressed in varying copper levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For our comparison with fission yeast, we used a recent microarray time-course dataset that closely matches ours with respect to experimental setup, allowing direct comparison between the two yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this study, four gene clusters were described whose mRNA expression was altered in copper starvation or excess. Three of these clusters contain genes that are involved in copper uptake, copper detoxification, or iron uptake, which are respectively regulated by Mac1p, Ace1p, and Rcs1p/Aft2p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The late induction of the iron regulon in conditions of low copper is thought to result from a secondary iron starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A fourth cluster was downregulated after prolonged copper deprivation and contains genes that function in the mitochondrion, including a large component of the respiratory chain. Regulation of this latter group is believed to be linked to a dependency on copper or iron by these metabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Many of the genes that are implicated in copper and iron metabolism in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>have homologs in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. For this study we used orthologs from a manually curated list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; when these were unavailable, homologs were identified on the basis of sequence similarity. To determine the extent to which the <italic>S. pombe </italic>homologs are similarly controlled at the transcriptional level as their <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>counterparts, we compared their expression patterns during varying copper conditions. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a direct comparison between homologous gene pairs in four transcriptional clusters with a specific role in copper or iron metabolism in either yeast. The same gene clusters are used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> to summarize how many genes from each group exhibit conserved regulation between <italic>S. pombe </italic>and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>in response to changing copper and iron availability.

We therefore searched for Cuf1p and Fep1p binding motifs upstream of 11 genes that were upregulated in low-copper conditions and 32 genes that were upregulated in low-iron conditions (Additional data file 1 [Supplementary tables 1A and 2A]). Seven genes contained one or more copies of the CuSE binding motif, which may reflect direct regulation by Cuf1p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Putative Fep1p binding motifs were found in 21 genes, including five out of the six genes encoding previously identified Fep1p targets (<italic>fip1</italic>, <italic>frp1</italic>, <italic>fio1</italic>, <italic>str1</italic>, and <italic>str3</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

The absence of significant additional expression changes relative to standard conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) confirms that the observed target gene regulation is indeed conferred by the copper or iron responsive transcription factors, as opposed to indirect effects related to a reduction in metal availability.</p><p>Based on our stringency cut-offs, we can identify two novel Cuf1p targets, namely <italic>pex7 </italic>and SPAC3G6.05, both of which are predicted to encode peroxisomal proteins. This strongly suggests a role for this organelle in <italic>S. pombe </italic>copper homeostasis, perhaps linked to its function in reactive oxygen species metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].

The expression of <italic>isu1 </italic>points to a link to iron-sulfur biosynthesis, which may further involve the sulfiredoxin Srx1p. SPBC947.05c is predicted to have ferric-chelate reductase activity based on sequence similarity, and it is expected to play a role in iron reduction before uptake, analogous to Frp1p. The role of the remaining proteins (Rds1p, SPAC1F8.02c, and SPBC27B12.03c) in iron homeostasis is currently unclear. The considerable induction of SPAC1F8.02c, greater than that for all previously identified Fep1p targets, indicates that this glycoprotein plays an important role in iron uptake.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>S. pombe </italic>responds to high copper levels with a general stress response</title><p>Exposure of fission yeast to limited copper stress (2 &#x003bc;mol/l CuSO<sub>4</sub>) resulted in a rapid (within 15-30 min) but transient transcriptional response involving 93 genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref> and Additional data file 1 [Supplementary table 3]). When copper levels were increased to 25 &#x003bc;mol/l CuSO<sub>4</sub>, this number rose dramatically to 1,259 genes, and the expression changes persisted for the 2-hour time course, reaching a plateau after 30 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The size of the response suggests additional cell stress at these copper levels and is likely to result from secondary effects of elevated copper levels. Considering that <italic>S. pombe </italic>is able to sustain growth in copper concentrations up to 10 mmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and that growth rate was not impaired compared with standard conditions (data not shown), the observed expression changes indicate a physiologic response to copper rather than cytotoxic effects. We focused on the genes that were also differentially expressed in the limited copper experiment, because they were the first to respond to high-copper stress and are therefore more likely to represent direct copper-specific regulation.</p><p>The global character of the <italic>S. pombe </italic>gene expression response to medium and high copper levels is in stark contrast to the limited expression changes found in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells treated with copper (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Notably, the changes in fission yeast already occur at much lower levels of copper (2 &#x003bc;mol/l versus 8 &#x003bc;mol/l). The genes that are induced by high copper levels are involved in a variety of functions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). As expected, these include antioxidants with an established role in heavy metal detoxification such as glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (SPAC688.04c and SPCC965.07c), thioredoxin (SPBC12D12.07c and <italic>trx2</italic>), zinc metallothionein (<italic>zym1</italic>), and superoxide dismutase (<italic>sod1</italic>).</p><p>Interestingly, a number of iron uptake genes, including <italic>frp1</italic>, <italic>str1</italic>, and <italic>fip1</italic>, were induced in response to high copper (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>), which is consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. A small and transient induction of iron metabolism genes was also observed in budding yeast, peaking after a 30 min exposure to 8 &#x003bc;mol/l CuSO<sub>4 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The same group, however, is also known to be upregulated in response to other stressors such as cadmium or hydrogen peroxide, with the exception of <italic>fip1</italic>, which is downregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Regulation of these genes may therefore be the result of general stress and unrelated to copper metabolism. Another possible explanation for the induction of iron regulon genes is that excess copper triggers iron starvation by competing with iron uptake. It is known that the low-affinity Fet4p iron transporter in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>can be inhibited by elevated concentrations of cobalt and cadmium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Fet4p and its <italic>S. pombe </italic>ortholog (SPBP26C9.03c) may well be similarly affected by copper.</p><p>A large proportion of the genes (41%) exhibiting changes in high copper are part of the core environmental stress response (CESR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], which is known to be activated in response to several distinct stress conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The major conserved regulators of this general stress response in <italic>S. pombe </italic>that have been identified to date are the Sty1p kinase and the transcription factor Atf1p. Sty1p is turned on as part of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by a variety of stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].

The majority of the induced CESR genes were indeed part of the set of known Sty1p or Atf1p regulated genes (27 out of 38) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], suggesting an important role for these proteins in the regulation of at least part of the response to high copper.</p><p>Considerable overlap was also found with genes previously described to be induced in response to the heavy metal cadmium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and almost all of the genes expressed in response to high copper were also induced by cadmium (data not shown). In particular, genes involved in the sulfur amino acid biosynthetic pathway (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Additional data file 1 [Supplementary table 3A]), which is required for both glutathione and phytochelatin synthesis, were upregulated in both experiments. Expression of the <italic>S. pombe </italic>phytochelatin synthase itself (SPAC3H1.10) could not be determined because it did not produce measurable signals at most time points.</p><p>Our results further underscore the general nature of the <italic>S. pombe </italic>response to high copper, even when only a relatively small subset of genes that reacted early to copper stress is considered. From comparisons with previous microarray experiments in <italic>S. pombe </italic>subjected to environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], however, we can identify a small subset of genes that are specifically downregulated in response to high copper (<italic>ptr2</italic>, SPBC13A2.04c, SPAP7G5.06, SPAC5H10.01, SPCC132.04c, SPCC1223.09, SPAC11D3.18c, SPAC11D3.15, and SPAC1039.08).

The function of the other three genes (SPCC11E10.01, <italic>vht1</italic>, and <italic>isu1</italic>) is less well understood, but their conserved regulation suggests an important role in metal metabolism. SPCC11E10.01 is the fission yeast counterpart to YFR055W, which encodes a protein of unknown function and has been reported as a Mac1p target in a number of microarray studies in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

The fission yeast ortholog to the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Ccc2p ATPase was not picked up as differentially expressed in iron deprived conditions, but only failed to reach our threshold by a narrow margin.</p><p>In response to copper deprivation, we found that <italic>frp1 </italic>and <italic>str1 </italic>are upregulated, suggesting a positive link between copper and iron metabolism in <italic>S. pombe </italic>similar to that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

This repression has been proposed to occur by direct binding of Cuf1p to TTTGTC motifs in the promoter region of these genes, as suggested by the observation that iron metabolism genes are induced in <italic>cuf1</italic>-&#x00394; mutants, as well as by mutagenesis studies of the TTTGTC motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Although these findings seem contradictory, the currently established role of Cuf1p as a transcriptional activator of high affinity copper transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], together with the identification of DNA motifs that confer Fep1p regulation on the iron metabolism genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], now allow for an alternative interpretation of the previous results and are consistent with our findings.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>An updated model for transcriptional regulation by Cuf1p and Fep1p. <bold>(a) </bold>Previously proposed mechanism for Cuf1p-dependent repression of iron uptake genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. <bold>(b) </bold>Revised model of Cuf1p and Fep1p regulation in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, including novel regulatory targets.

Instead, the CuSEs identified in <italic>S. pombe </italic>are similar to the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Ace1p binding motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Moreover, the DNA binding domain of Cuf1p closely resembles that of Ace1p in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and a chimerical Cuf1p protein with an Ace1p DNA binding domain can complement a <italic>cuf1</italic>-&#x00394; null mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the absence of additional DNA binding domains, it seems unlikely that Cuf1p would bind both the CuSE and TTTGTC motifs during copper starvation and simultaneously function as a transcriptional activator and repressor.</p><p>The proposed role of the TTTGTC motifs in negative regulation of iron metabolism genes has been further supported by mutagenesis studies in a 271 base pair fragment of the <italic>fip1 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Mutations in two out of three TTTGTC motifs encompassed by this fragment abolished the apparent copper dependent repression of a reporter construct. Interestingly, a re-examination of this promoter fragment reveals that one of the TTTGTC motifs is located between two Fep1p binding sites, and mutation of this motif also alters two residues that are conserved between the Fep1p motifs in the <italic>fip1 </italic>and <italic>frp1 </italic>promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). It is therefore likely that the induction of the reporter construct in the mutant resulted from the loss of Fep1p rather than Cuf1p regulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Proximity of TTTGTC motifs to Fep1p binding sites in the <italic>fip1 </italic>promoter.

Instead, the minor induction of the iron uptake system during copper deprivation (as identified in the present study) and the strong induction in <italic>cuf1</italic>-&#x00394; mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) points to a link between copper and iron metabolism similar to that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, in which copper starvation leads to delayed induction of the complete iron regulon as a result of a secondary iron starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that <italic>frp1 </italic>is also directly involved in copper metabolism, by binding of Cuf1p to the CuSE elements identified in its promoter region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This model would be in accordance with the situation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, in which copper uptake by the Ctr1p and Ctr3p transporters depends on the Frp1p homologs Fre1p and Fre2p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], both of which are induced as part of the copper regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although other ferric reductase homologs exist in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, none of these are induced upon copper starvation. An updated model for Cuf1p and Fep1p regulation in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, including novel validated target genes, is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>. The relative minor induction of the iron uptake system during the time of copper depletion assayed here could indicate that <italic>S. pombe </italic>contains larger iron stores than does <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, because the copper and iron concentrations in the synthetic media used to grow the two yeasts were identical. Alternatively, it could reflect a reduced demand for iron in <italic>S. pombe </italic>compared with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, perhaps linked to the slower growth rate of the former.</p><p>The global transcriptional response to excess copper in <italic>S. pombe </italic>differs greatly from the highly specific detoxification mechanism adopted by <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The limited response favored by <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>is more efficient and conserves energy that would otherwise be used to synthesize the large number of proteins needed to protect the cell from oxidative stress. Interestingly, the response of budding yeast to other stressors such as hydrogen peroxide and heat shock results in the induction of a global stress response similar to that in <italic>S. pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The difference in the characteristics of copper response in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>is in accordance with the belief that it uniquely evolved to deal with high levels of copper found in its environment.</p><p>A remaining question is how is the <italic>S. pombe </italic>response to excess copper regulated? Fission yeast utilizes several mechanisms for the sequestration of heavy metals, such as phytochelatin synthase, glutathione synthesis, and the metallothionein Zym1p. Although a previous study suggested that the role of Zym1p is limited to zinc metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], expression of its gene is increased in response to a number of other stresses as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and we also found its induction to be more than twofold greater in high copper conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In contrast to budding yeast, however, we found that these detoxification systems cannot prevent the upregulation of a large number of additional stress response genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><p>There are two possible explanations for this difference. One is that the response to copper is nonspecific and purely regulated by general mechanisms that indirectly sense the effects of copper toxicity such as oxidative stress. An alternative explanation is that a specific response to detoxify excess copper exists, but it is not sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, resulting in an additional stress response. A number of observations suggest that the former model is more likely. First, the response to excess copper is similar to cadmium stress, suggesting that they are triggered by the same mechanism. A large number of the differentially expressed genes are known to be regulated by Sty1p and Atf1p, both of which are responsive to a wide variety of stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], arguing against a unique role for copper. Further evidence comes from the timing of the transient response to low levels of copper, which is consistent with the response to other <italic>S. pombe </italic>stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and does not appear to be preceded by any specific response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Two predicted glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferases (SPAC688.04c and SPCC965.07c), as well as <italic>zym1</italic>, are upregulated simultaneously with other stress response genes, suggesting that putative metal scavenging systems are induced as part of the same response. Phytochelatin synthase expression could not reliably be measured on the arrays and experiments are currently underway to determine whether it is also induced together with the rest of the stress response. Our finding of a small number of genes specifically repressed during copper stress shows that some elements of the response may still be unique to copper, although regulation in these genes may be related to the toxic effects of copper rather than a copper dependent transcription factor.</p><p>Concentrations of free copper in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>are normally kept at less than one atom per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. In the absence of metallothionein expression, the buffering capacity for copper is greatly reduced, raising intracellular copper levels and causing toxicity. Interestingly, we found that <italic>ace1</italic>-&#x00394; mutants subjected to excess copper do not induce a common environmental stress response, which is normally found when budding yeast is faced with an oxidative stress such as hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. This suggests that <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>is unable to mount an alternative response to compensate for the oxidative stress triggered by copper in the absence of <italic>ACE1</italic>, giving a possible explanation for the previously described hypersensitivity to copper in these mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Alternatively, the toxic effects of copper may be mediated by other mechanisms, such as displacement of similar trace metals (for example, zinc) from their physiologic binding sites, which become apparent before copper levels are sufficiently high to cause free radical stress. One way to test this would be to check whether the oxidative response to a small dose of hydrogen peroxide reduces copper hypersensitivity in <italic>ace1</italic>-&#x00394; mutants. The phenomenon that a moderate response to one stressor can provide increased resistance to other types of stress is known as cross-protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Cross protection between copper or hydrogen peroxide induced stresses is only expected to occur if oxidative damage is the main reason for copper toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our comparisons between budding and fission yeast reveal that their considerable evolutionary distance has resulted in substantial differences in the regulation of copper and iron homeostasis. Despite these differences, the regulation of a core set of genes involved in the uptake of these metals remains conserved and provides valuable clues to key features of metal metabolism, as demonstrated by the putative regulation of <italic>frp1 </italic>by copper and iron in both yeasts. Genome wide comparisons are therefore useful to gain insight into the extent of conserved mechanisms between different species and can help to reveal the plasticity and adaptation of different aspects of cellular physiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains, culture conditions and RNA isolation</title><p>For the experiments in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we used the wild-type strain <italic>972 h</italic>-, as well as the <italic>leu1-32 h</italic>- pREP3X-<italic>CUP1 </italic>strain, which over-expresses the <italic>S. cerevisiae CUP1 </italic>metallothionein gene from a plasmid under the regulatable <italic>nmt1 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>].
