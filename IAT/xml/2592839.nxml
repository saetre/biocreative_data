In addition, MTs can be generated from preexiting MTs in a &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;dependent manner in yeast, plant, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we show the spindle-associated protein FAM29A promotes MT-dependent MT amplification and is required for efficient chromosome congression and segregation in mammalian cells. Depletion of FAM29A reduces spindle MT density. FAM29A is not involved in the nucleation of MTs from centrosomes and chromatin, but is required for a subsequent increase in MT mass in cells released from nocodazole. FAM29A interacts with the NEDD1&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin complex and recruits this complex to the spindle, which, in turn, promotes MT polymerization. FAM29A preferentially associates with kinetochore MTs and knockdown of FAM29A reduces the number of MTs in a kinetochore fiber, activates the spindle checkpoint, and delays the mitotic progression. Our study provides a biochemical mechanism for MT-dependent MT amplification and for the maturation of kinetochore fibers in mammalian cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: FLIP, fluorescence loss in photobleaching; MT, microtubule; Plk1, polo-like kinase 1.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitotic spindle, a dynamic assembly of microtubules (MTs) polymerized from the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin subunit, controls accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wittmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scholey et al., 2003</xref>). MT-associated proteins, such as motor and nonmotor proteins, act together to orchestrate the assembly, dynamics, and function of the spindle and the congression and segregation of chromosomes in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karsenti and Vernos, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gadde and Heald, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kline-Smith and Walczak, 2004</xref>). Among these proteins, factors that nucleate MTs are most important ones, as they initiate spindle assembly and maintain MT density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wiese and Zheng, 2006</xref>).</p><p>At least two well-characterized pathways control MT nucleation and spindle assembly in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gadde and Heald, 2004</xref>). In one pathway, centrosomes recruit factors to nucleate astral as well as spindle MTs. The plus end of individual spindle MT grows and shrinks to &#x0201c;search and capture&#x0201d; individual chromosomes, leading to the attachment of a single MT to a kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maiato et al., 2004</xref>). How a single attached MT is quickly matured into a kinetochore fiber of 25&#x02013;30 MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McIntosh et al., 2002</xref>) remains as one of the most important questions unanswered in cell biology. The second pathway is mediated through a chromatin-dependent nucleation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wilde and Zheng, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gadde and Heald, 2004</xref>). The chromatin-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RCC1, promotes the formation of a gradient of Ran-GTP in the vicinity of mitotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastiaens et al., 2006</xref>), which, in turn, activates spindle assembly factors to promote nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karsenti and Vernos, 2001</xref>) and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gruss and Vernos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jang et al., 2008</xref>) of MTs around chromosomes. Other mechanisms also contribute to the formation of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O'Connell and Khodjakov, 2007</xref>). For example, it has been demonstrated that MTs can grow from the side of existing MTs in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murata et al., 2005</xref>) and in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Janson et al., 2005</xref>) to amplify cytoskeleton structure locally in interphase, although the molecular mechanism for this phenomenon remains unknown. Very recently, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Augmin complex has been shown to be required for centrosome-independent MT generation within the spindle in culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goshima et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Nucleation of MTs from centrosomes is mediated by a MT nucleator, the &#x003b3;-tubulin ring complex (&#x003b3;TuRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wiese and Zheng, 2006</xref>). &#x003b3;TuRC is recruited to centrosomes, where &#x003b3;-tubulin promotes the polymerization of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin subunits into MT polymers. During mitosis, &#x003b3;TuRC is localized to both centrosomes and to spindle MTs and a regulatory protein, NEDD1, interacts with &#x003b3;-tubulin and targets &#x003b3;TuRC to these mitotic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luders et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, NEDD1 and &#x003b3;TuRC are required for chromatin-mediated nucleation of MTs and the NEDD1&#x02013;&#x003b3;TuRC complex is targeted to multiple foci on chromatin to promote MT polymerization in mitotic cells released from a nocodazole arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luders et al., 2006</xref>). The mechanism for the recruitment of NEDD1 in mitosis remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luders et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a mitotic kinase that regulates spindle assembly and mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van Vugt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petronczki et al., 2008</xref>). In a proteomic study on the function and regulation of Plk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Seki et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">b</xref>), we identified human FAM29A (family with sequence similarity, member 29A) as a novel Plk1-interacting protein. We report here that FAM29A is a MT-associated protein that preferentially associates with kinetochore MTs (k-MTs). Depletion of FAM29A reduces the spindle MT density, including that of k-MTs, weakens the MT&#x02013;kinetochore attachment, and activates the spindle checkpoint. We demonstrated that FAM29A interacts with the NEDD1&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin complex and is responsible for recruiting this complex to the mitotic spindle where &#x003b3;-tubulin promotes the polymerization of additional MTs in a manner independent of centrosomes and chromatin. The FAM29A&#x02013;NEDD1 pathway controls the MT-dependent MT polymerization, a process important for the assembly of the spindle, for the maturation of k-MTs, and for normal progression of mitosis in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>FAM29A is a novel spindle protein preferentially associated with kinetochore MTs</title><p>To study the function and regulation of Plk1, we previously purified the Plk1 complexes from mitotic HeLa S3 cells and identified its associated proteins by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Seki et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">b</xref>). One of the Plk1-binding proteins discovered was FAM29A (14 peptides identified from 3 independent purifications [unpublished data]), a protein that shares a weak sequence homologue to the Dgt6 subunit of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Augmin complex (32% aa identity over a 100-aa region) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goshima et al., 2008</xref>). We raised and affinity purified an anti-FAM29A antibody, which recognized both the endogenous and ectopically expressed FAM29A (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1</ext-link>). In a coimmunoprecipitation experiment, we confirmed that endogenous Plk1 interacted with FAM29A (unpublished data). The functional importance of this interaction will be reported in a future study.</p><p>We analyzed the expression of FAM29A in the cell cycle. HeLa S3 cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary by a double-thymidine treatment, and then released into fresh media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fang et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">b</xref>). The cell cycle profile was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. The FAM29A protein was present in G1, S, and G2, and its levels were increased in M. Mitotic FAM29A migrated slower at a time point right before degradation of cyclin B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; also see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). This form of FAM29A is hyperphosphorylated, as its mobility was restored by a treatment with &#x003bb;-phosphatase (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>; unpublished data).</p><p>We analyzed the cellular localization of FAM29A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). At early prometaphase, FAM29A colocalized with MTs within the boundary defined by condensed chromosomes, whereas MTs polymerized in all directions around DNA. From late prometaphase to metaphase FAM29A associated with the mitotic spindle, and from anaphase to cytokinesis it also colocalized with central spindle and midbody MTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In interphase, FAM29A was presented at centrosomes where it colocalized with or was adjacent to centrin at centrioles. This centrosomal localization is independent of MTs. Depolymerization of MTs by nocodazole in mitotic cells revealed that FAM29A is preferentially associated with one of the centrioles in the mitotic centrosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The specificity of FAM29A localization was confirmed by expression of GFP-FAM29A and by depletion of FAM29A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; also see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>; unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>FAM29A is a spindle protein preferentially associated with kinetochore MTs.</bold> (A) HeLa S3 cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by a double-thymidine arrest and harvested at the indicated time after release.

When the monopolar spindle was formed by monastrol, an Eg5 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayer et al., 1999</xref>), FAM29A localized on MTs within the chromosome sphere, but not on the long MTs that extended beyond chromosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Co-staining of FAM29A with Hecl revealed that FAM29A-positive MTs almost invariably ended at, but did not extend beyond, the Hecl-positive kinetochores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Incubation of HeLa cells at 4&#x000b0;C removed unstable MTs in the spindle, resulting in a decrease in MT density (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). The remaining MTs after a 10-min incubation at 4&#x000b0;C are cold-resistant k-MTs. Interestingly, FAM29A intensity in the spindle remained stable during the incubation, whereas the spindle MT intensity decreased dramatically from 0 min to 10 min after shifting from 37&#x000b0;C to 4&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Furthermore, FAM29A remained colocalized with spindle MTs in metaphase cells incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 min (unpublished data). Thus, FAM29A preferentially associated with cold-resistant k-MTs. Consistent with this, depletion of the kinetochore protein Nuf2 greatly reduced the spindle-associated FAM29A signals (Fig. S1, B and C), as depletion of Nuf2 prevents stable MT&#x02013;kinetochore interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">DeLuca et al., 2002</xref>). Mitotic phosphorylation of FAM29A and its colocalization with k-MTs suggested that FAM29A is a novel MT-associated protein acting in mitosis.</p></sec><sec><title>FAM29A is required for mitotic progression</title><p>To investigate the function of FAM29A in mitosis, we analyzed the kinetics of mitotic progression in HeLa cells depleted of FAM29A. Two independent siRNAs each reduced the FAM29A protein by 90% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, top) and gave a similar phenotype. Depletion of FAM29A by siRNAs increased the mitotic index by two- to fourfold (Fig. S2, A and B; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1</ext-link>). This phenotype is specific, as transfection of an siRNA targeting to the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of FAM29A (siFAM29A-B) into a cell line stably expressing GFP-FAM29A (HeLa/GFP-FAM29A) did not affect the expression of transgene and rescued the mitotic phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>; Fig. S2, A and B).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>FAM29A controls mitotic progression.</bold> (A) HeLa cells and HeLa/GFP-FAM29A cells were transfected with either control (siControl) or FAM29A-specific siRNAs (siFAM29A-A and B) and analyzed by Western blotting.

We analyzed the kinetics of mitotic progression by time-lapse imaging of HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-histone H2B (HeLa/GFP-H2B). Depletion of FAM29A greatly increased the duration of metaphase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Although control metaphase cells all initiated anaphase within 40 min after chromosome alignment (Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1</ext-link>), not a single metaphase cell depleted of FAM29A segregated its chromosomes within this time frame and the majority of depleted cells stayed at metaphase for over 120 min (Video 2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p><p>This prolonged metaphase in siFAM29A cells resulted from a less efficient capture of chromosomes and a lack of tension on kinetochores of aligned chromosomes. Among metaphase cells, over 25% siFAM29A cells had chromosomes unaligned outside the metaphase plate, compared with &#x0003c;1% in control cells (Fig. S2 C). Even for chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate, the pulling force, or tension, generated by attached MTs across sister kinetochores was substantially reduced in siFAM29A cells, as indicated by a shorter inter-kinetochore distance in metaphase cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Confocal time-lapse microscopy in HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-CenpA (HeLa/GFP-CenpA) (Fig. S2 D; Videos 3 and 4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1</ext-link>) indicated that depletion of FAM29A not only reduced the inter-kinetochore distance, but also attenuated the movement of sister kinetochores relative to each other, another indicator for the lack of pulling force from attached MTs. Consistent with a lack of tension, the kinetochore-associated BubR1 signals were twofold higher on aligned chromosomes in FAM29A-depleted metaphase cells than those in control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>), indicating that the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pinsky and Biggins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>) is active in metaphase cells depleted of FAM29A.</p></sec><sec><title>FAM29A controls spindle structure and function</title><p>Given the association of FAM29A with the spindle and its function in mitosis, we investigated the role of FAM29A in spindle assembly, dynamics, and function.

Although previous electron microscopic studies indicate that the majority of normal metaphase cells have multiple astral MTs, these astral MTs were usually not detectable under our immunofluorescence studies due to the fixation and assay conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Thus, in control metaphase cells, only 10% metaphase cells have detectable astral MTs under our assay conditions. However, in FAM29A-depleted metaphase cells, the percentage increased to 70&#x02013;80% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In addition, there is a greater than fivefold increase in FAM29A-depleted mitotic cells with multi-polar spindles compared with control mitotic cells (Fig. S3 B). Interestingly, the majority of FAM29A-depleted cells with multi-polar spindles still had their chromosomes aligned on a metaphase plate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), suggesting a possibility that multiple poles in depleted cells resulted from splitting of the spindle poles that occurred after the formation of a bipolar spindle and the alignment of chromosomes.

Although spindle MTs in both control and FAM29A-knockdown cells were depolymerized with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml nocodazole within 15 min, the rate of depolymerization was slightly faster in siFAM29A cells (Fig. S5 A; Videos 5 and 6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807046/DC1</ext-link>).

Thus, FAM29A has a stabilizing effect to the mitotic spindle.</p><p>Next, we examined the role of FAM29A in MT polymerization. Metaphase MTs in control or siFAM29A cells were completely depolymerized with nocodazole and the rate of MT repolymerization was determined by confocal time-lapse microscopy upon release from nocodazole.

FAM29A is not required for MT nucleation and polymerization at early time points, but is essential for MT growth at later stages and for efficient formation of the bipolar spindle once sufficient amounts of MTs are polymerized. We propose that MT growth at later stages is derived from the MT-dependent MT polymerization in which FAM29A recruits the NEDD1&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin complex to the mitotic spindle to promote additional MT polymerization. In this model, the FAM29A&#x02013;NEDD1&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin complex amplifies MTs in the spindle, thereby efficiently increasing the MT mass for timely formation of the bipolar spindle. Depletion of FAM29A prevents this MT amplification and delays the spindle formation.</p><p>This model predicts that depletion of FAM29A does not interfere with initial recruitment of NEDD1 to centrosomes and chromatin, but prevents the association of NEDD1 with newly synthesized MTs. In the presence of nocodazole, NEDD1 remained at centrosomes independent of FAM29A (unpublished data). Furthermore, within 5 min of release from nocodazole treatment, NEDD1 was efficiently targeted to chromatin foci in both control and FAM29A-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). In control mitotic cells, the intensity of NEDD1 signals increased over time, when increasing amounts of FAM29A were recruited to the growing MT mass. In contrast, in mitotic cells depleted of FAM29A, the amounts of NEDD1 associated with spindle poles and chromatin did not increase over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, D and E</xref>). These data supported our model in which FAM29A promotes MT amplification through the recruitment of the NEDD1&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin complex to the mitotic spindle in a manner independent of centrosomes and chromatin.</p><p>Our study suggests a role of FAM29A-mediated MT amplification in spindle assembly during unperturbed mitosis.

However, in FAM29A-depleted cells, the intensity of spindle EB1 punctates appeared much dimmer (by 30%) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, F&#x02013;H</xref>), indicating a substantial reduction in the number of growing MTs. Furthermore, the EB1 signals outside the spindle increased in siFAM29A metaphase cells, approaching the intensity of EB1 inside the spindle. The EB1 around the spindle poles remained the same or increased in siFAM29A cells.

At prometaphase, individual MTs nucleated from centrosomes grow and shrink to search and capture individual kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scholey et al., 2003</xref>). However, a mature kinetochore fiber consists of 25&#x02013;30 MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McIntosh et al., 2002</xref>). FAM29A plays a key role in the formation of the mature kinetochore fiber from a single attached MT. In FAM29A-depleted cells, bipolar spindles form and the majority of chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate after a kinetic delay, indicating that k-fibers can form with a reduced level of FAM29A. However, the facts that FAM29A preferentially associates with k-fibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and that depletion of FAM29A reduces the k-MT intensity and weakens MT&#x02013;kinetochore interactions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) provide evidence for a direct role of FAM29A-mediated MT amplification in the maturation of k-fibers. Our data support a model in which once a single MT captures a kinetochore and therefore is stabilized, the FAM29A pathway uses this attached MT as a template to quickly generate mature k-fibers, thereby displacing the checkpoint protein Mad2 and turning off the checkpoint signal from this kinetochore (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>, module IIIc). The poleward flux then actively transports the minus ends of MTs in the k-fiber toward the spindle pole to stably connect the pole to the kinetochore (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>).</p><p>Another source of k-fibers is MTs polymerized from chromatin, which are subsequently captured by spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O'Connell and Khodjakov, 2007</xref>). Chromatin-mediated formation of k-fibers can be directly analyzed in our MT repolymerization assay, as MTs repolymerized upon release from nocodazole treatment originate from BubR1-positive kinetochores (Fig. S5 D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tulu et al., 2006</xref>). Our data indicate that FAM29A-mediated MT amplification is also important for the maturation of k-fibers derived from chromatin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8 B</xref>, module IIIb). We should also point out that although FAM29A preferentially associates with k-MTs, we cannot exclude the possibility that FAM29A also binds to and amplifies other MTs.</p><p>In addition to spindle assembly and k-fiber maturation, another M phase event that likely requires efficient MT amplification is the formation of central spindles at anaphase. Once chromosomes are segregated, the mitotic spindle disassembles and reorganizes into the central spindle of bundled MTs between two sets of segregating chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mishima et al., 2002</xref>). It is likely that FAM29A-mediated MT amplification also plays a role here to promote efficient formation of the central spindle. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations. First, FAM29A and NEDD1 colocalized to the central spindle at anaphase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; Fig. S4 A). Second, depletion of FAM29A also reduced the NEDD1 signals on the central spindle (unpublished data). Third, depletion of FAM29A reduced the rate of chromosome segregation by 30% in anaphase (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of FAM29A</title><p>FAM29A is a cell cycle&#x02013;regulated protein that functions in mitosis. The localization of FAM29A to spindle MTs only occurs in mitosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Similarly, although both FAM29A and NEDD1 proteins are present throughout the cell cycle, they only interact in mitosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, the FAM29A&#x02013;NEDD1 pathway is under active regulation, either through post-translational modifications or through an involvement of other uncharacterized factors. Interestingly, FAM29A was identified as a Plk1-interacting protein in our proteomic study, raising the possibility that Plk1 may control the FAM29A-mediated MT amplification.</p><p>We speculate that FAM29A-mediated MT amplification may function beyond the cell cycle in other physiological processes. For example, terminally differentiated neurons have axons and dendrites that are several feet away from centrosomes, and local organization of MTs using existing MTs as a template could be an efficient mechanism to reinforce the cytoskeleton structure through a positive feedback loop. Thus, MT amplification ensures a local regulation at places where MTs are needed. We propose that this important MT nucleation mechanism may act in many different physiological processes under different regulatory inputs that control the association of FAM29A with the MT cytoskeleton.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids, antibodies, and cell lines</title><p>The full-length FAM29A was subcloned into the pCS2&#x0002b; vector.
