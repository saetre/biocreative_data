However, the process of reprogramming remains inefficient and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report the optimization of somatic cell fusion with embryonic stem cells in order to provide an efficient, quantitative assay to screen for factors that facilitate reprogramming. Following optimization, we achieved a reprogramming efficiency 15&#x02013;590 fold higher than previous protocols. This allowed observation of cellular events during the reprogramming process. Moreover, we demonstrate that overexpression of the Spalt transcription factor, Sall4, which was previously identified as a regulator of embryonic stem cell pluripotency and early mouse development, can enhance reprogramming. The reprogramming activity of Sall4 is independent of an N-terminal domain implicated in recruiting the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase corepressor complex, a global transcriptional repressor. These results indicate that improvements in reprogramming assays, including fusion assays, may allow the systematic identification and molecular characterization of enhancers of somatic cell reprogramming.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The developmental programs of somatic cells are characterized by remarkably stable patterns of gene expression and repression.

In methods such as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to an enucleated oocyte for reprogramming to an embryonic cell state, through the use of the endogenous machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Hochedlinger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Hochedlinger2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Wilmut1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the case of cell fusion, although the cells are in great supply, the procedure results in the formation of tetraploid cells that are genetically unstable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Cowan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Silva1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Tada1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, although genetic reprogramming by co-expression of the stem cell factors Oct4, Sox2, c-myc and Klf4 is remarkable in that it yields ESCs capable of contributing to both the somatic and germ cell lineages, use of the reprogrammed cells to generate offspring results in increased tumorigenesis in progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Okita1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Maherali1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

We reasoned that if a factor functions in reprogramming, overexpression of that factor in somatic cells might increase the efficiency with which the cells can be reprogrammed. Thus, we tested whether overexpression of the following factors, individually, increased reprogramming efficiency of MEFs: Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Sall4.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Optimization of an Efficient Reprogramming Assay</title><p>Several different protocols have been developed to reprogram somatic cells via cell fusion with ESCs, with protocol efficiencies typically less than 0.001&#x00025; (i.e. ranging from approximately 1 reprogramming event per 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> to 4&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> total somatic cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Cowan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Tada1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Such low efficiencies lead to technical difficulties in screening for positive regulators of somatic cell reprogramming.

FACS (fluorescent-activated cell sorting) analysis of MEFs and ESCs, which were fluorescently labeled with Vybrant DiD and Vybrant DiO respectively, indicated that the fusion efficiency was 4.6 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 0.1&#x00025; at 5 h post-fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001955-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001955-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001955.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Establishment of an efficient fusion assay.</title><p>A) Fusion efficiency of the assay.

The dual-labeled cells in the unfused population was most likely due to non-specific binding between the ESCs and MEFs. The green fluorescent dye Vybrant DiO was only used in the determination of fusion efficiency but not in a typical reprogramming experiment (due to interference with the observation of GFP signal). B) Morphology change of MEFs during reprogramming. The forward- and side-scatter profiles of the GFP positive cells were FACS analyzed at 24, 48 and 72 h post-fusion.

The percentage of GFP-positive cells, in the population of MEFs that overexpressed each candidate gene, was compared to that of uninfected MEFs and MEFs that overexpressed the negative control proteins, firefly luciferase and the red fluorescent protein, mCherry. At 24 h post-fusion, GFP expression in MEFs that overexpressed negative control proteins was similar to that of the uninfected control, indicating that lentiviral-mediated protein overexpression did not affect GFP expression in MEFs carrying the <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001955-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, MEFs that overexpressed the known reprogramming facilitators, Oct4, Nanog and Sox2, also did not show a significant increase in <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> expression relative to controls. Although this was unexpected, the lack of enhanced GFP expression when Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 were overexpressed in MEFs might be attributed to several possibilities (this is further described in the discussion section below). In contrast, we observed that the percentage of GFP-positive cells in MEFs that overexpressed the Spalt transcription factor, Sall4, increased 7-fold relative to controls.

However, given this data, we also considered whether Sall4 might directly activate the <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> transgene in the absence of overall reprogramming. To examine this alternative possibility, we tested whether increased GFP expression at 24 h and 48 h post-fusion was due to transcription activity of Sall4 alone. For this purpose, we overexpressed Sall4, as well as the negative controls, in MEFs carrying the <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> transgene. Half of the infected MEFs were then cultured alone, and the remainder was fused with ESCs.

We found that the observed increase in the number of GFP-positive cells was dependent on fusion with ESCs; MEFs that overexpressed Sall4 but were not fused with ESCs did not demonstrate increased <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> expression. This indicated that increased GFP expression in cells overexpressing Sall4 is not a direct effect of Sall4 interacting with the <italic>Oct4</italic> promoter of the <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> transgene, but rather is a result of the enhancement of reprogramming.</p><fig id="pone-0001955-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001955.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Sall4 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> positive regulator of reprogramming.</title><p>A) Overexpression of Sall4 in <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> MEFs did not induce GFP expression.

Only MEFs overexpressing Sall4 and fused to ESCs showed an increased number of GFP positive cells when compared to the negative controls, indicating that overexpression of Sall4 alone did not induce GFP expression. The numbers of GFP positive cells in the infected cells relative to that of the uninfected cells were shown. B) Overexpression of Sall4 did not increase cell doubling time in MEFs. mCherry and two different constructs of Sall4 were overexpressed in MEFs, which were plated onto 6 well plates and assayed for cell number every 24 h. Note that another clone of Sall4 of identical sequence was used as a duplicate. C, D) Infection of Sall4-expressing lentiviruses did not increase the colony formation efficiency in ESCs.

For this purpose, we used both wildtype ESCs and subcloned lines of tetraploid (4N, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001955-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) reprogrammed cells. In order to test the effect of Sall4 overexpression on ESC colony formation efficiency, we infected ESCs and 4N cells with constructs that expressed the negative control proteins and Sall4. We observed under a microscope that the fluorescent intensity of the negative control, mCherry, was significantly lower in infected ESCs than in infected MEFs from previous experiments; Western blotting also suggested that the expression level of Sall4 in infected ESCs was not significantly increased relative to endogenous levels (data not shown).

Nonetheless, we reasoned that the lower expression levels in ESCs parallel observations during reprogramming: when reprogrammed mCherry-infected MEFs gain ESC-like characteristics after fusion, there appears to be a sharp decline of mCherry expression during colony formation (data not shown). After infection, we plated the infected ESCs and 4N cells with and without feeders, and assayed colony formation after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001955-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The efficiency of forming colonies in uninfected ESCs, or ESCs infected with constructs expressing the negative controls mCherry and luciferase, was approximately 20&#x00025; on gelatin and 45&#x00025; on feeder cells, similar to previously reported values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Ying1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed that cells infected with the Sall4 construct also did not demonstrate enhanced ability to form colonies in either the presence or absence of feeders. Similar results where obtained with expression of Sall4 in the 4N reprogrammed ESCs (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Structure-Function Studies of Reprogramming by Cell Fusion</title><p>Taken together, the data described above suggested that Sall4 is a positive regulator of somatic reprogramming.

Thus, we tested whether the N-terminal 12-amino acid motif of Sall4 is required for somatic cell reprogramming. For this purpose, we generated a truncated Sall4 mutant (Sall4 d12) that lacked the N-terminal 12-amino acid motif and repeated the fusion assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001955.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

We also noted that overexpression of Sall4 d12 did not alter the GFP expression pattern or growth rate of MEFs carrying the <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> transgene, nor did overexpression increase colony formation efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001955.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001955.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001955.s004">S4</xref>).

Moreover, by taking advantage of the fact that the <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> transgene is activated within the first 24&#x02013;48 h of reprogramming, the assay allows for further physical and molecular characterization of the reprogramming process by microscopy and FACS.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Sall4: An Enhancer of Reprogramming</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Sall4 can enhance somatic cell reprogramming as evidenced by both enhanced <italic>Oct4-gfp</italic> expression and colony formation. Previously, Sall4 had not been shown to function in somatic cell reprogramming. Sall4 is a member of the Spalt family of transcription factors which was originally identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a homeotic gene required for head and tail development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Sweetman1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Frei1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Jurgens1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammals, Sall4 is essential for early embryo development including establishment and maintenance of the early cell lineages of the inner cell mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Elling1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Sall4 is also essential for the maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal of ESCs and for their derivation from blastocysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Elling1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Although Sall4 may act as a transcription factor that regulates numerous genes, one of the few known target genes is <italic>Oct4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Zhang1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Together, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and Sall4 form a regulatory circuit to maintain pluripotency of ESCs, prompting our exploration of these factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Wu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Wang1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggesting that Sall4 enhances reprogramming in cell fusion prompts further analyses regarding whether it may enhance reprogramming in other reprogramming strategies; in addition, it is very likely that additional enhancers remain to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Comparisons to Other Reprogramming Assays</title><p>A previous report by Silva and colleagues demonstrated that overexpression of Nanog in mouse ESCs enhances reprogramming of neural stem cells nearly 200-fold and reprogramming of MEFs 10-fold as measured by colony formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Silva1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In the current study, when we overexpressed Nanog in MEFs rather than in ESCs, surprisingly, we achieved only a 3-fold increase in reprogramming efficiency as judged by colony formation. Further consideration and comparison of these studies is merited: First, it is apparent from several studies, including that of Silva and colleagues, that it is more difficult to reprogram somatic cells such as MEFs than neural stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Silva1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, perhaps due to the state of differentiation of MEFs and/or epigenetic status of key pluripotency genes. Second, we note that overexpression of Nanog in ESCs resulted in greater enhancement of reprogramming efficiency compared to overexpression in MEFs. This observation might reflect fundamental differences between the two studies. Since Nanog is an important pluripotency factor, it is highly likely that the overexpression of Nanog in ESCs may reinforce the pluripotency regulatory circuit, or stem cell properties, of ESCs. In contrast, in our study, the overexpression of Nanog and other positive regulators of reprogramming in MEFs most likely enhances reprogramming by priming and preparing the somatic cell genome for reprogramming. Thus, we suspect, from comparisons of this data to that from other publications, that the latter is a far less efficient process than reinforcing the pluripotency regulatory circuit of ESCs.</p><p>Recently, several reports have demonstrated that MEFs can be reprogrammed by co-overexpressing the pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2, C-myc and Klf4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Okita1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Wernig1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, neither Oct4 nor Sox2 overexpression in the somatic compartment led to early activation of <italic>Oct4</italic> during reprogramming of MEFs, and only Sox2 led to increased numbers of reprogrammed colonies. It is possible that activation of <italic>Oct4</italic> is not one of the earliest events to occur during reprogramming, and clearly that not all factors that facilitate reprogramming will lead to early activation of <italic>Oct4</italic>. Thus, the lack of early Oct4 activation in our assay does not preclude a factor from being an enhancer of reprogramming. Furthermore, the expression level of Oct4 is regulated in a precise manner in ESCs such that an increase in Oct4 expression level leads to differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm, whereas a decrease results in trophectoderm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001955-Niwa2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we speculate that overexpression of Oct4 alone without other reprogramming factors may actually inhibit reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Finally we note that it is possible that the role of reprogramming factors may differ depending on the method of reprogramming, be it SCNT, cell fusion or over-expression of a subset of genetic factors. The fusion reprogramming assay as optimized here is useful for identification and characterization of new regulators or enhancers of somatic reprogramming and may bypass some of the difficulties with other methods. Together, the array of methods for reprogramming holds great promise for the generation of patient-specific stem cells for use in diverse basic and clinical studies in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Mouse ESCs (E14) were cultured on plates coated with 0.1&#x00025; gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in ESC medium &#x0005b;(Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 15&#x00025; knockout serum replacement (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1&#x00025; non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.57 &#x000b5;M beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 1&#x00025; penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.3&#x00025; leukemia inhibitory factor&#x0005d;.
