Among the signaling proteins that regulate cell adhesion are members of the mucin family of proteins. Signaling mucins are cell-surface proteins composed of a heavily glycosylated extracellular domain that contains a Ser/Thr/Pro-rich mucin homology domain (MHD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silverman et al., 2003</xref>), which is connected to a cytoplasmic domain that regulates RAS/RHO GTPases and their effector MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carraway et al., 2007</xref>). Proteolytic processing separates the domains and results in the shedding of the extracellular glycodomain from the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh and Hollingsworth, 2006</xref>). Signaling mucins also contribute to the regulation of other pathways including the Wnt, nuclear factor-&#x003ba;&#x003b2;, and estrogen receptor pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wei et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the signaling mucin Msb2p regulates MAPK activity by interaction with the RHO GTPase Cdc42p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>), a global regulator of cell signaling and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson, 1999</xref>). Cdc42p and its effector kinase Ste20p regulate multiple MAPK pathways including the filamentous growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leberer et al., 1997</xref>), pheromone response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simon et al., 1995</xref>), and high osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tatebayashi et al., 2006</xref>). Differential MAPK activation is regulated in part by pathway-specific MAPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madhani et al., 1997</xref>) and recruitment of core signaling modules to pathway-dedicated receptor complexes by scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butty et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2001</xref>). Msb2p is required for activation of the filamentous growth pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>) and may function in a minor way in the HOG pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Rourke and Herskowitz, 2002</xref>). Indeed, Msb2p associates with the tetraspan protein Sho1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>), which operates in both the filamentous growth and HOG pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maeda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zarrinpar et al., 2004</xref>). Although it is unclear how Msb2p becomes activated, loss of the MHD induces the signaling function of the protein, which suggests an inhibitory role for this domain in MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we show that Msb2p, like its mammalian counterparts, is processed into secreted and cell-associated forms. This discovery, coupled with the fact the secreted domain of Msb2p is inhibitory, suggests a mechanism where processing and release of the extracellular domain activates the protein. We confirmed this hypothesis and identified an aspartyl protease, Yps1p, that is required for Msb2p processing. Intriguingly, the gene encoding Yps1p is induced in response to nutrient limitation, which provides a straightforward mechanism for regulated processing of Msb2p. We speculate that cleavage-dependent activation may be a general feature of mucin receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Msb2p is processed into distinct polypeptides</title><p>The extracellular portion of the Msb2p protein was detected in supernatants by Western blotting, which indicates that it is secreted from the cell. To determine if secretion results from processing in the extracellular domain, a version of the protein was examined in which the extracellular (HA, at 500 residues) and cytoplasmic (GFP, at 1,306 residues) domains were differentially tagged. Conditioned media derived from cells expressing HA-Msb2p-GFP showed that the extracellular but not cytoplasmic domain was secreted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This result confirms topological and subcellular fractionation data that indicate that Msb2p is a membrane-spanning protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>). Although the extracellular domain of Msb2p migrated as a single heavily glycosylated product at &#x0003e;250 kD, the cytoplasmic domain migrated as multiple intermediate forms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), which indicates that it is unstable. Consistent with this result, the extracellular portion of Msb2p tagged with GFP was found evenly distributed throughout the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), whereas the cytoplasmic domain tagged with GFP was predominately localized to vacuoles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These results indicate that Msb2p is processed into multiple polypeptides with different stabilities and localization patterns.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Msb2p is processed in the cleavage domain and the extracellular portion of the protein is secreted.</bold> (A) Western blot of supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions derived from cells containing HA-Msb2p-GFP.

Additional deletion analysis was performed using HA-Msb2p as the template because epitope fusions in the cytoplasmic domain were unstable and difficult to detect. An extracellular region of the protein adjacent to the transmembrane (TM) domain was identified that was required for secretion (cleavage domain [CD] 1,045&#x02013;1,145 residues; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). The CD overlaps with the predicted cleavage site by Western blotting (the 55-kD product in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and resides between the glycosylation-rich extracellular domain and basic C terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). A version of Msb2p lacking the TM and cytoplasmic domains was secreted at higher levels (<italic>TM-CYT</italic>&#x00394;; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that the TM domain anchors Msb2p to the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>The aspartyl protease Yps1p processes Msb2p</title><p>To identify the protease required for Msb2p processing, protein processing mutants from the ordered deletion collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>) were examined for defects in secretion of HA-Msb2p.

Yps1p is a member of a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartyl proteases called yapsins (Yps1p, Mkc7/Yps2p, Yps3p, Yps6p, and Yps7p; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krysan et al., 2005</xref>). HA-Msb2p was poorly secreted in the <italic>yps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, more so than other <italic>yps</italic> single mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

By these criteria, Msb2p is a likely substrate of Yps1p and the first physiological target to be identified. Several lines of evidence support this possibility. First, <italic>yps</italic> mutants are not generally defective in protein secretion, and several proteins have been examined that are secreted in <italic>yps</italic> mutants to wild type (WT) or higher levels (unpublished data). The Msb2p protein was delivered to the cell surface in <italic>yps</italic> mutants based on the fact that HA-Msb2p lacking its TM domain was secreted in the 5<italic>yps&#x00394;</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Intriguingly, Msb2p-GFP was absent from vacuoles in <italic>yps</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Several other cell-surface proteins showed a similar localization pattern (unpublished data), which suggests a general requirement for Yps proteins in delivery of a subset of cell-surface proteins to vacuoles. Second, although <italic>yps</italic> mutants have defects in cell integrity and cell wall biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krysan et al., 2005</xref>), secretion of HA-Msb2p was not restored by conditional rescue of the cell integrity defect of the <italic>5yps&#x00394;</italic> mutant grown in 1 M sorbitol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Likewise, cell-wall mutant combinations defective for &#x003b2;-1,3 and &#x003b2;-1,6-glucan synthesis that mimic <italic>yps</italic> phenotypes showed elevated secretion of HA-Msb2p (Fig. S1 B). Third, the <italic>yps1&#x00394;</italic> mutant was defective in processing Msb2p-TAP, resulting in accumulation of the full-length protein and loss of a processing intermediate (Fig. S1 C).</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage of Msb2p is required for MAPK activation and is stimulated by nutrient limitation&#x02013;dependent induction of YPS1 expression</title><p>Msb2p lacking the MHD hyperactivates the filamentous growth pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>). Versions of Msb2p lacking larger portions of the extracellular domain were also hyperactive, more so than Msb2p<sup>&#x00394;MHD</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), which confirms that the extracellular domain (from 100 to 950 residues) functions in an inhibitory capacity. Cleavage of the inhibitory domain may provide an explanation for how the protein becomes activated. In support of this possibility, the noncleavable version of Msb2p, Msb2p<sup>&#x00394;CD</sup>, was defective for MAPK activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and filamentous growth (not depicted).

Secretion of HA-Msb2p was induced &#x0003e;10-fold by nutrient limitation, and the enhanced secretion was Yps1p dependent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Unprocessed Msb2p accumulated in the <italic>yps1&#x00394;</italic> mutant under this condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). To determine how Yps1p regulates Msb2p processing in a nutrient-dependent manner, we turned to the expression of the <italic>YPS1</italic> gene, which is highly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krysan et al., 2005</xref>). Expression of <italic>YPS1</italic> was induced under nutrient-limiting conditions that promote filamentous growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>YPS1</italic> or <italic>MKC7/YPS2</italic> from a high-copy plasmid or inducible promoter stimulated Msb2p-dependent MAPK activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) and polarized growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref> and not depicted). Cells lacking Yps1p were partially defective for MAPK activity, and this effect was exacerbated in cells lacking Mkc7p and Yps3p (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Therefore, Msb2p processing is regulated by starvation-dependent induction of its cognate protease. Cleavage by Yps1p may trigger Msb2p activation or be a prerequisite for activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Activated Msb2p functions through Sho1p</title><p>Msb2p interacts with the tetraspan protein Sho1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen et al., 2004</xref>).

To better understand the role of Sho1p in Msb2p-dependent signaling, alleles of <italic>SHO1</italic> were isolated that hyperactivate the filamentous growth pathway.

The mutation at P120L did not affect Sho1p protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>) but stimulated the filamentous growth pathway based on hyperpolarized growth of haploid and diploid cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), agar invasion phenotypes (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200704079/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200704079/DC1</ext-link>), and induction of filamentous growth pathway reporters (Fig. S2 B).

We also tested for an interaction between Sho1p and the positional marker Bud8p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harkins et al., 2001</xref>), which is required for unipolar budding during filamentous growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taheri et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cullen and Sprague, 2002</xref>) and for GEF recruitment during vegetative growth by the bud-site selection GTPase Rsr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shimada et al., 2004</xref>). Sho1p and Bud8p were found to associate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that Sho1p contributes to Bud8p-dependent recruitment of Cdc24p by a mechanism that requires MAPK activation. Sho1p and Cdc24p might interact by affiliation with bud-site selection proteins; however, the Sho1p&#x02013;Cdc24p interaction was independent of Rsr1p (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and Bud8p (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Hyperactive alleles of <italic>SHO1</italic>, or its overexpression, induced hyperpolarized growth in a manner that was partially independent of bud-site selection cues and the MAPK pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). These results indicate that Sho1p may also have a function in stabilization of Cdc24p at polarized sites.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Sho1 interacts with Cdc24p and Bud8p and contributes to Cdc24p polarization by multiple mechanisms.</bold> (A) Sho1p and Cdc24p interact by co-IPT analysis.

Cleavage-dependent activation has been found for Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schweisguth, 2004</xref>) and PAR receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barry et al., 2006</xref>) and may extend to other members of the signaling mucin family. We have also identified a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartyl protease that regulates Msb2p function. In mammalian cells, secreted aspartyl proteases are coregulated with signaling mucins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liaudet-Coopman et al., 2006</xref>), which suggests the possibility that aspartyl proteases may be general regulators of signaling mucin receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids, and microbiological techniques</title><p>Yeast strains are listed in Table S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200704079/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200704079/DC1</ext-link>) and plasmids in Table S2. &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays were performed as described and represent at least two independent trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cullen et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>FUS1-HIS3</italic> expression was used to confirm <italic>FUS1-lacZ</italic> reporter data and was measured by spotting equal amounts of cells onto synthetic medium lacking histidine and containing 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole.
