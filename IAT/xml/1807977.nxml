Its tenth subunit was recently discovered in yeast as Tfb5. Unlike other TFIIH subunits, Tfb5 is not essential for cell survival. We have analyzed the role of Tfb5 in NER. NER was deficient in the <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cell extracts, and was specifically complemented by purified Tfb5 protein. In contrast to the extreme ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity of <italic>rad14</italic> mutant cells that lack any NER activity, <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells were moderately sensitive to UV radiation, resembling that of the <italic>tfb1-101</italic> mutant cells in which TFIIH activity is compromised but not eliminated. Thus, Tfb5 protein directly participates in NER and is an accessory NER protein that stimulates the repair to the proficient level. Lacking a DNA binding activity, Tfb5 was found to interact with the core TFIIH subunit Tfb2, but not with other NER proteins. The Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction was correlated with the cellular NER function of Tfb5, supporting the functional importance of this interaction. Our results led to a model in which Tfb5 acts as an architectural stabilizer conferring structural rigidity to the core TFIIH such that the complex is maintained in its functional architecture.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a major cellular mechanism for removing DNA lesions, especially helix distorting lesions, such as <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) adducts and the major ultraviolet (UV) lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Deficiency in NER results in human diseases xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne's syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD), depending on the specific mutations affecting various NER genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). NER consists of two sub pathways, global genome repair and transcription-coupled repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), and the repair pathways involve damage recognition, incision, excision, repair synthesis and DNA ligation.</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, multiple proteins are involved in the early steps of NER, which include Rad1, Rad2, Rad4, Rad7, Rad10, Rad14, Rad16, Rad23, Rad26, Rad28, TFIIH and RPA. Rad7, Rad16, Rad26 and Rad28 are pathway-specific NER proteins in that the Rad7&#x02013;Rad16 complex is specifically required for global genome repair, while Rad26 (CSB homologue) and Rad28 (CSA homologue) are specific to transcription-coupled repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The remaining proteins are further divided into two categories: indispensable NER proteins, and accessory NER proteins. Losing any of the indispensable NER proteins results in complete inactivation of NER. In contrast, an accessory NER protein, such as Rad23 is required for full NER activity, but not all NER activity. In the absence of an accessory NER protein, some residual levels of repair remain, leading to moderate rather than severe cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents.</p><p>TFIIH is a large protein complex indispensable for both NER and RNA polymerase II transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The holo TFIIH is composed of two sub-complexes: core TFIIH and TFIIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). While core TFIIH is sufficient for the NER function, holo TFIIH is essential for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). For a long time, it was believed that core TFIIH consists of six subunits, Ssl2, Rad3, Tfb1, Tfb2, Ssl1 and Tfb4; and TFIIK is composed of three subunits: Tfb3, Kin28 and Ccl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Recently, Ranish <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) identified the tenth subunit of TFIIH, named Tfb5, by quantitative proteomic analysis of RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes. Tfb5 is believed to constitute a component of the core TFIIH complex, as it co-precipitates and co-purifies with the core TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). However, TFB5 is in drastic contrast to the other nine subunits of TFIIH in that it is not essential for cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Furthermore, Tfb5 is an unusually small protein of only 8 kDa. The tfb5 deletion mutant cells are sensitive to UV radiation, an indication that this protein likely plays a role in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The discovery of Tfb5 led to the finding that its human homologue is encoded by the TTD-A gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). TTD-A cells lacking the functional TTD-A protein are known to be deficient in NER and sensitive to UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). The uniqueness of Tfb5 protein raised the possibility that it may play an unusual role in TFIIH.</p><p>To better understand the Tfb5 function, we analyzed its <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> role in NER and examined its physical relationship with other subunits of TFIIH and NER proteins. In this report, we (i) demonstrate that Tfb5 interacts with the core TFIIH subunit Tfb2; (ii) provide evidence that the Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction is important for the NER function of Tfb5 in cells; (iii) show that Tfb5 protein directly participates in NER and (iv) reveal that Tfb5 is an accessory NER protein that stimulates the repair to the proficient level. Our results led to a model in which Tfb5 acts as an architectural stabilizer conferring structural rigidity to the core TFIIH such that the complex is maintained in the functional architecture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Purified yeast Tfb5 protein was obtained from Enzymax (Lexington, KY), which was purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells overexpressing the yeast <italic>TFB5</italic> gene.

The agarose&#x02013;protein G-antibody complex was washed with 1 ml of the binding buffer four times to remove free antibody. Purified His<sub>6</sub>-Tfb5 protein was mixed with purified Rad3 or Tfb2 protein (2 &#x003bc;g each) and incubated on ice for 1.5 h.

Protein bands were identified and visualized by western blot analysis using two sequential detection steps. First, the nitrocellulose membrane containing transferred protein bands was incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG.

The yeast <italic>TFB5</italic> gene was cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vector pAS2 and used to determine pair-wise interactions of its gene product with the other 9 subunits of TFIIH in the pACT2 vector. Positive protein&#x02013;protein interaction results in activation of the reporter gene &#x003b2;-galactosidase in yeast cells, which turns yeast colonies blue in a filter assay in the presence of X-gal. Without interaction, the yeast colonies remain &#x02018;colorless&#x02019;. Positive interaction was readily detected between Tfb5 and Tfb2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). An interaction was not observed between Tfb5 and any of the eight remaining TFIIH subunits, Ssl2, Rad3, Tfb1, Ssl1, Tfb4, Ccl1, Tfb3 and Kin28 (data not shown). In the pACT2 vector, TFB5 gene alone activated the &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter gene (data not shown), thus preventing us from performing the yeast two-hybrid assays in such an orientation.</p><p>To confirm the direct physical interaction between Tfb5 and Tfb2 proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using purified yeast Tfb5 and Tfb2 proteins. Tfb5 was tagged with His<sub>6</sub> at its N-terminus and purified to apparent homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Purified yeast Tfb2 and Rad3 proteins were tagged at their <italic>N</italic>-termini with the CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), instead of the His<sub>6</sub> tag. While Tfb5 was detected by western blot analysis using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to the His<sub>6</sub> tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 2), Tfb2 and Rad3 were detected by western blot analysis using a protein detecting agent specific to the CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (lane 5), the anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody was able to precipitate the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Tfb5 protein. As expected, immunoprecipitation by the anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody was not observed with either purified yeast Tfb2 or Rad3 protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 6 and 7). After mixing the purified Tfb5 with Tfb2 proteins, Tfb2 was co-precipitated with Tfb5 by the anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 8). In contrast, the purified Rad3 could not be co-precipitated with Tfb5 by the anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 9). These results show that Tfb5 directly interacts with Tfb2 and suggest that Tfb5 is incorporated into the 10 subunit holo TFIIH complex through its interaction with the core subunit Tfb2.</p><p>In addition to the TFIIH complex, many Rad proteins are required in the multi-step NER pathway. Protein&#x02013;protein interaction is a key mechanism in the complex process of NER. To gain insights into how Tfb5 might be engaged, if any, in NER, we examined physical interactions between Tfb5 and the NER Rad proteins. Pair-wise interactions were determined by the yeast two-hybrid assay. An interaction was not observed between Tfb5 and any Rad proteins examined: Rad1, Rad2, Rad4, Rad7, Rad10, Rad14, Rad16, Rad23, Rad26 and Rad28 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Deficient NER in <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cell extracts</title><p>In yeast, deleting the <italic>TFB5</italic> gene results in cellular sensitivity to UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).

In this assay, plasmid DNA containing AAF adducts was used as the repair substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, +AAF DNA band), and another undamaged plasmid larger in size was used in the same reaction as the internal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, &#x02212;AAF DNA band). Repair was monitored by [<sup>32</sup>P]dCMP incorporation into the repair patch during repair DNA synthesis. Repair products were separated by electrophoresis on an argarose gel and visualized by autoradiography of the gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). We have previously shown that under the conditions used, AAF DNA adducts are repaired specifically by the NER pathway in yeast cell-free extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).</p><p>Proficient <italic>in vitro</italic> NER results in damage-specific radio labeling of the AAF-containing plasmid in cell-free extracts of the wild-type strain, as compared to the internal control of undamaged DNA (lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 1). In contrast, repair in the <italic>rad14</italic> deletion mutant extracts was deficient (lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 2), as expected. DNA recovery from various repair reactions were similar as revealed by staining the gel with ethidium bromide (upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (lane 3), <italic>in vitro</italic> NER in <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant extracts was deficient. The deficient repair was complemented by <italic>rad14</italic> mutant extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 4), indicating that the tfb5 mutant extract was properly prepared and the repair deficiency was not an <italic>in vitro</italic> artifact. These results show that the <italic>TFB5</italic> gene significantly contributes to NER in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>Complementation of deficient NER by purified Tfb5 protein</title><p>TFIIH functions in both NER and transcription by RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Thus, to test the possibility that Tfb5 is directly involved in NER, we performed complementation experiments with the purified yeast Tfb5 protein. To avoid contamination by any yeast proteins, Tfb5 was expressed and purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> NER was deficient in the <italic>tfb5</italic> mutant extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 1, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 5). However, addition of the purified Tfb5 protein to the repair reaction efficiently complemented the deficient NER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 6). The complemented NER was as efficient as repair in the wild-type extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 11 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 1). As a control, purified Tfb5 had no effect on deficient repair of the <italic>rad14</italic> mutant extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;10). Adding purified Tfb5 protein to the wild-type extracts also had no effect on the proficient repair (Figure 4B, lanes 2&#x02013;4), suggesting that this protein is not limiting in the wild-type yeast extracts. These results show that Tfb5 protein specifically complements the deficient NER of the tfb5 mutant extracts <italic>in vitro</italic>, and suggest that Tfb5 protein directly participates in the biochemistry of NER.</p></sec><sec><title>UV sensitivity of <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells</title><p>Most NER proteins, such as Rad14, are indispensable for repair. Cells lacking any of those proteins exhibit extreme UV sensitivity. Several factors, such as Rad23, however, belong to a class of accessory NER proteins, without which NER activity is reduced but not eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Cells lacking an accessory NER protein show moderate UV sensitivity. Although NER is deficient in <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), the <italic>in vitro</italic> repair assay is not sensitive enough to allow for a clear distinction between an indispensable role versus an accessory role for Tfb5 in NER. To determine whether Tfb5 is an indispensable or accessory NER protein, we compared UV sensitivity of the <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant strain with several other strains as an indication of <italic>in vivo</italic> repair capacity in the absence of Tfb5. As reported previously by Ranish <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), tfb5 deletion mutant cells were sensitive to UV radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, this sensitivity was only moderate, in contrast to the extreme UV sensitivity observed with the <italic>rad14</italic> deletion mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). For example, at a UV dose of 10 J/m<sup>2</sup>, survivals of the wild-type, <italic>tfb5</italic>, and <italic>rad14</italic> deletion mutant cells were &#x0223c;95, 42 and 0.1%, respectively.</p><p>Unlike Tfb5, the other 9 subunits of the holo TFIIH are essential for cell survival under normal growth conditions. Therefore, mutants, such as the <italic>tfb1-101</italic> retain partial function of TFIIH. Deficient <italic>in vitro</italic> repair in the <italic>tfb1-101</italic> mutant extracts and the moderate UV sensitivity of this strain reflect partial NER activity of these mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). The moderate UV sensitivity of the <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells resembled that of <italic>tfb1-101</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), in contrast to the extreme UV sensitivity of <italic>rad14</italic> deletion mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results suggest that NER in the absence of Tfb5 is much reduced, but not abolished. Thus, Tfb5 is an accessory NER protein that promotes the repair rather than plays an indispensable role in the repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Tfb5 lacks a DNA binding activity</title><p>One possibility for Tfb5 to promote NER may be its binding to DNA at an early step during the repair. To test this possibility, we examined whether the Tfb5 protein is capable of binding to DNA by using the EMSA. A 79mer oligonucleotide labeled with <sup>32</sup>P at its 5&#x02032; end was incubated with increasing amounts of the purified Tfb5 protein. Protein binding to the DNA would retard its electrophoretic mobility on a native polyacrylamide gel. Under the conditions used, DNA binding was readily detected with the single-stranded binding (SSB) protein of the T4 bacteriophage. However, DNA binding was not observed with the purified Tfb5 protein (data not shown). Similarly, DNA binding was also not detected with Tfb5 using the double-stranded 79mer DNA (data not shown). In the control experiment, binding of the double-stranded DNA by the purified yeast PCNA was readily observed (data not shown). These results suggest that Tfb5 lacks a general DNA binding activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence that the Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction is important for the NER function of Tfb5 in cells</title><p>To examine whether the physical interaction between Tfb5 and Tfb2 proteins is relevant to the NER function of Tfb5 in cells, we constructed several Tfb5 mutant proteins and correlated the repair function of these mutants with their ability to interact with Tfb2. The crystal structure of the human TFB5 protein (TTD-A) has been solved (deposited to the PDB database by F. Forouhar, W. Edstrom, R. Xiao, T. B. Acton, G. T. Montelione, L. Tong and J. F. Hunt). The human protein contains two helices and three &#x003b2;-strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Sequence alignment indicates that segments corresponding to these structural elements are conserved between the yeast and the human proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, the yeast Tfb5 protein likely exhibits a similar structure as its human counterpart. Accordingly, we constructed four Tfb5 mutants: Tfb5&#x00394;N7 and Tfb5&#x00394;N14 lacking the N-terminal 7 and 14 amino acids, respectively; Tfb5&#x00394;C7 and Tfb5&#x00394;C14 lacking the C-terminal 7 and 14 amino acids, respectively. Purified Tfb5 mutant proteins were examined for their ability to interact with pure Tfb2 protein using a co-precipitation method. Tfb2 protein was tagged at its N-terminus with a CBP and thus effectively precipitated by calmodulin-conjugated agarose beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 2). Like the wild-type Tfb5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 4), Tfb5&#x00394;N7 and Tfb5&#x00394;C14 mutant proteins were specifically co-precipitated with Tfb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;8). Interaction between Tfb5&#x00394;C7 and Tfb2 was revealed by the yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). The N-terminal Tfb5 deletion mutants alone activated the &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter gene in either the pAS2 or the pACT2 two-hybrid vector (data not show), thus preventing us from performing interaction experiments with these mutant proteins by the yeast two-hybrid assay. These results show that Tfb5&#x00394;N7, Tfb5&#x00394;C7 and Tfb5&#x00394;C14 mutant proteins retain the ability to interact with Tfb2 protein.</p><p>In contrast, Tfb5&#x00394;N14 could not be co-precipitated with Tfb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 9 and 10). To exclude the possibility that this negative result might result from reduced sensitivity of the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Tfb5&#x00394;N14 protein to the anti-His monoclonal antibody during western blotting, we performed the co-precipitation experiment again using the more sensitive detection method of HRP-linked secondary antibody for western blotting. The detection was so sensitive that a faint Tfb5&#x00394;C14 band non-specifically precipitated in the absence of Tfb2 protein was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 3). With the Tfb5&#x00394;N14 co-precipitation experiment, only a non-specifically precipitated faint band (Tfb5&#x00394;N14) was detected in the absence or presence of Tfb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, the Tfb5&#x00394;N14 mutant protein is unable to interact with Tfb2 protein.</p><p>To determine the NER function of these mutant Tfb5 proteins in yeast cells, we expressed each mutant protein from a plasmid in the <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant strain and measured UV sensitivity of these transformed cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, UV sensitivity of the wild-type cells was not affected by transformation with either the empty vector or the wild-type <italic>TFB5</italic> gene. The <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells remained sensitive to UV radiation when transformed by the empty vector, and were fully complemented by transformation of the wild-type <italic>TFB5</italic> gene, as expected. UV sensitivity of the mutant cells were also complemented by the mutant proteins Tfb5&#x00394;N7, Tfb5&#x00394;C7 and Tfb5&#x00394;C14, respectively. In contrast, the Tfb5&#x00394;N14 mutant protein was unable to complement the UV sensitivity of the <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells. These results show that whereas the Tfb5&#x00394;N7, Tfb5&#x00394;C7 and Tfb5&#x00394;C14 mutant proteins are proficient for NER, the Tfb5&#x00394;N14 mutant protein has lost its NER function in cells.</p><p>Taken together, these results correlate the Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction with the cellular NER function of Tfb5. Deleting the C-terminal 14 amino acids of Tfb5 did not significantly affect its interaction with Tfb2 and its NER function. On the other hand, deleting the N-terminal region of Tfb5 by only 14 amino acids abolished its interaction with Tfb2. Consequently, the NER activity of Tfb5 was inactivated. Thus, these results suggest that the Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction is important for the NER function of Tfb5 in yeast cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we examined the role of Tfb5 protein in yeast NER by two approaches: its physical interaction with NER proteins and its contribution to <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> repair. We found that Tfb5 protein physically interacts with Tfb2 and directly participates in NER. However, NER is largely but not completely dependent on Tfb5. In the absence of Tfb5, NER becomes rather inefficient, but is not eliminated. Our results suggest that Tfb5 functions as an accessory NER protein to facilitate efficient repair. This facilitating role of Tfb5 is reminiscent of the role of Rad23 in NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>Based on the observation that Tfb5 co-precipitates and co-purifies with the core TFIIH, Ranish <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) concluded that Tfb5 is a component of the core TFIIH. The core TFIIH is indispensable for both transcription and NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In contrast, the TFIIK of the holo TFIIH, which consists of Tfb3, Kin28 and Ccl1, is not required for NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Our results extend the studies of Ranish <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) by showing that Tfb5 is incorporated into the core TFIIH sub-complex through its interaction with Tfb2. Moreover, our results that Tfb5 plays an important role in NER indicate that Tfb5 is indeed both a structural and functional component of the core TFIIH. Among the 10 subunit holo TFIIH, the following physical interactions are known: Ssl1-Rad3, Ssl1-Tfb1, Ssl1-Tfb4, Rad3-Ssl2, Ssl2-Tfb2, Rad3-Tfb3, Tfb3-Kin28, Kin28-Ccl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) and Tfb2-Tfb5 (this study). Low-resolution electron microscopic structures of TFIIH crystals were also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Based on these reports and the Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction of this study, a model of the holo TFIIH is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>As a component of TFIIH, Tfb5 is unique in that it is not essential for cell survival under normal growth conditions. Thus, the contribution of Tfb5 protein to NER can be definitively determined by using the <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> biochemical experiments demonstrated that Tfb5 is an NER protein. Its role in repair, however, is intriguing as revealed by the UV sensitivity experiments. Deleting the <italic>TFB5</italic> gene results in moderate rather than extreme UV sensitivity. Quantitative comparison of UV sensitivity suggests that cells retain some NER activity in the absence of the Tfb5 protein, a situation similar to when TFIIH is only partially functional. Consistent with such a partial or inefficient TFIIH function in repair, tfb5 deletion mutant cells also exhibit a slow growth phenotype, indicating that the transcription activity of TFIIH is not fully functional in the absence of the Tfb5 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Thus, whereas the core TFIIH and six of its subunits, Ssl2, Rad3, Tfb1, Tfb2, Ssl1 and Tfb4, are essential for both transcription and repair, Tfb5 plays an accessory role for both transcription and repair as the seventh subunit of the core TFIIH. This functionally sets Tfb5 apart from the other 6 subunits of the essential core TFIIH factor.</p><p>What is the molecular role of the Tfb5 protein in NER? One possibility might be an indirect role for Tfb5 by maintaining adequate transcription of one or more NER genes. We have excluded this possibility by showing that the purified Tfb5 protein alone is sufficient to complement the deficient NER of the <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant extracts. That is, without the Tfb5 protein, other NER proteins are present in sufficient quantities. Hence, the Tfb5 protein directly functions in the biochemistry of the NER pathway. Then, how does the Tfb5 protein act in the biochemistry of the repair? Since TFIIH acts between damage recognition and DNA incisions, this protein complex is recruited and is likely involved in recruiting other NER proteins to the lesion site through protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Indeed, physical interactions, such as Rad2-Tfb1 and Rad2-Ssl2 have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Thus, we examined Tfb5 interaction with other NER proteins by the yeast two-hybrid assay. However, we did not observe an interaction between Tfb5 and any of these NER proteins: Rad1, Rad2, Rad4, Rad7, Rad10, Rad14, Rad16, Rad23, Rad26 and Rad28. Another important activity during repair is DNA binding. Again, we did not observe a Tfb5 binding activity to either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA.</p><p>We propose that Tfb5 functions as an architectural stabilizer to maintain the proper architecture of the core TFIIH complex. The properly structured 6 subunit core TFIIH consisting of Ssl2, Rad3, Tfb1, Tfb2, Ssl1 and Tfb4 would be sufficient to attain its biochemical activity in repair and transcription. However, without the small Tfb5 protein, the core TFIIH complex would become fragile and prone to collapse. Thus, in the <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells, whereas some core TFIIH complexes remain functional, a fraction of them would lose activity due to architectural collapse of the complex. This would explain the phenotype of partial TFIIH function in transcription and repair for these mutant cells. Adding purified Tfb5 protein to the mutant extracts would restore the collapsed core TFIIH complexes, leading to <italic>in vitro</italic> complementation of the deficient NER. Reminiscent of Tfb5, another accessory NER protein is Rad23. However, Rad23 plays two different roles in NER: preventing Rad4 protein degradation by the protesome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>); and directly stimulating repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).</p><p>Tfb5 is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. Its human homologue is the TTD-A protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Inactivating mutations have been found in TTD-A patient cells, indicating that it is not essential for cellular growth like its yeast counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Inherited loss of TTD-A in humans results in the hereditary disease TTD, a complex disease showing clinical symptoms that include photosensitivity, ichthyosis (scaly skin), brittle hair, impaired intelligence, decreased fertility and short stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Clinical manifestations of the TTD-A disease and phenotypes of the yeast <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells share the common functional defects: insufficient TFIIH activity leading to deficiencies in both NER and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) (this study). Therefore, our architectural stabilizer model for Tfb5 may be extrapolated to the human TTD-A protein, which is able to explain the cellular and clinical consequences of the TTD-A disease in a similar way as we explained the phenotypes of the yeast <italic>tfb5</italic> deletion mutant cells. Indeed, the Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction was also observed recently in the human system between TTD-A and p52 (the Tfb2 homologue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Thus, the Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction is conserved from yeast to humans, consistent with our conclusion that this interaction is functionally important. A difference, however, is noted. In yeast, deleting the TFB5 gene does not alter cellular concentrations of other TFIIH components, as demonstrated by western blot analyses of the Tfb1 and Kin28 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and our results that Tfb5 protein alone is sufficient to complement deficient NER in the mutant extracts. In human TTD-A mutant cells, it was reported that the steady-state level of TFIIH is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). We speculate that architectural collapse of some core TFIIH complexes in the absence of TTD-A protein may lead to degradation of the individual subunits in mammalian cells.</p><p>Our studies led to the model that 9 subunits form a large and functional, but fragile protein complex, the holo TFIIH, which requires the tenth subunit, Tfb5/TTD-A, to stabilize its elegant architecture, in order to attain its full cellular proficiency in transcription and repair. Such a role of architectural stabilizer is a unique and novel mechanism in the NER pathway. As an architectural stabilizer, the Tfb5/TTD-A protein needs to be stable/non-fragile itself, which would be best served by a small instead of a large protein. This is consistent with the fact that Tfb5/TTD-A is the smallest NER protein (&#x0223c;8 kDa), an unusually small protein even among all types of DNA repair systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Jeffrey A.

A ring structure is formed by Ssl1, Rad3 and Ssl2, on which another layer of ring structure is formed by Tfb1, Tfb2 and Tfb4 through Ssl1&#x02013;Tfb1, Ssl1&#x02013;Tfb4 and Ssl2&#x02013;Tfb2 interactions. However, Tfb1, Tfb2 and Tfb4 do not interact with each other, resulting in a fragile layer of ring structure. This fragile 6 subunit core TFIIH is stabilized by fitting the small Tfb5 into the structure through the Tfb5&#x02013;Tfb2 interaction. Tfb5 may also help locking Tfb1 in place in the core TFIIH ring structure. Thus, the Tfb5 protein uniquely serves as the architectural stabilizer of the core TFIIH. The TFIIK sub-complex consisting of Tfb3, Kin28 and Ccl1 is assembled onto the core TFIIH through the Tfb3&#x02013;Rad3 interaction, forming the 10 subunit holo TFIIH.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1085f9"/></fig></sec></back></article>
