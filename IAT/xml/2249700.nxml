SKAP-55 could potentially act as a node to coordinate the modulation of adhesion with downstream signaling. In this regard, the GTPase p21<sup>ras</sup> and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway play central roles in T-cell function. In this study, we report that SKAP-55 has opposing effects on adhesion and the activation of the p21<sup>ras</sup> -ERK pathway in T-cells. SKAP-55 deficient primary T-cells showed a defect in LFA-1 adhesion concurrent with the hyper-activation of the ERK pathway relative to wild-type cells. RNAi knock down (KD) of SKAP-55 in T-cell lines also showed an increase in p21<sup>ras</sup> activation, while over-expression of SKAP-55 inhibited activation of ERK and its transcriptional target ELK. Three observations implicated the p21<sup>ras</sup> activating exchange factor RasGRP1 in the process. Firstly, SKAP-55 bound to RasGRP1 via its C-terminus, while secondly, the loss of binding abrogated SKAP-55 inhibition of ERK and ELK activation. Thirdly, <italic>SKAP-55&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> primary T-cells showed an increased presence of RasGRP1 in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) following TCR activation, the site where p21<sup>ras</sup> becomes activated. Our findings indicate that SKAP-55 has a dual role in regulating p21<sup>ras</sup>-ERK pathway via RasGRP1, as a possible mechanism to restrict activation during T-cell adhesion.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conjugate formation between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is mediated by lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 and is accompanied by the rearrangement of receptors at the immunological synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Dustin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Kupfer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given this, we were surprised by the observation that T-cells with reduced or a loss of SKAP-55 expression showed a consistent amplification of the activation of extracellular receptor kinases (ERKs) in response to anti-CD3 ligation. Initially, SKAP-55&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and <italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> T-cells were compared by staining with AlexaFluor647 labeled anti-pERK to the phosphorylation sites pThr185/pTyr187 followed by flow cytometric analysis. Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) and percent of positive cells were measured. As shown in one representative experiment, anti-CD3 increased the MFI staining of SKAP-55&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; T-cells from 6.53 to 8.58 (upper left panel; upper right histogram).

The percentage of cells with TGN localized RasGRP1 was the same as in resting cells. This was observed in four independent experiments. Further, this was not the result of an overall increase in RasGRP1 expression in one group of cells versus another since anti-RasGRP1 analysis by FACS confirmed comparable levels of RasGRP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

In this way, SKAP-55 could act as a node to integrate or modify signals for adhesion (i.e. conjugation) and TCR signaling. This would also be in keeping with the observation that other adaptors such as SLP-76 and ADAP can regulate more than one event in cells. Distinct regions of SLP-76 can regulate cytokine production versus adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Koretzky1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, while ADAP has recently been connected to the NF&#x003ba;B pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Medeiros1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we have identified a novel function of SKAP-55 in the negative regulation of the p12ras-ERK pathway in T-cells, in addition to its positive regulation of LFA-1 adhesion. <italic>SKAP-55&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> primary T-cells showed an increase in TCR mediated ERK activation, while the use of multiple independent shRNA knock down (KD) T-cells showed an increase in TCR mediated ERK and p21<sup>ras</sup> activation. Conversely, SKAP-55 over-expression inhibited ERK phosphorylation at pThr185/pTyr187 and the activation of its downstream target ELK. In turn, the loss of RasGRP1 binding to the C-terminus of SKAP-55 abrogated the ability of SKAP-55 to inhibit ERK/ELK phosphorylation and ELK-dependent transcriptional activity. Lastly, <italic>SKAP-55&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> primary T-cells showed an increase in RasGRP1 in the trans-Golgi network in response to anti-CD3 ligation, the location where p21<sup>ras</sup> is primarily activated in T-cells. These findings indicate that SKAP-55 has a dual regulatory function of enhancing LFA-1 mediated adhesion, while suppressing or raising the threshold needed for the activation of the ERK pathway.</p><p>The finding that SKAP-55 suppresses the p21<sup>ras</sup>-ERK pathway was observed in models that included primary SKAP-55 deficient T-cells, the Jurkat cell line, the DC27.10 hybridoma and the use of three independent shRNAs to knock-down SKAP-55 expression. The loss of SKAP-55 by genetic ablation or the reduction in expression by shRNA consistently resulted an increase in anti-CD3 induced ERK activation, and an increased RBD binding to p21<sup>ras</sup>, while the over-expression of SKAP-55 suppressed ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g001">Figs 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g003">3</xref>). Intriguingly, these effects occurred under conditions where an opposing effect on LFA-1 clustering and adhesion was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Reduced or a loss of SKAP-55 expression caused an impairment of LFA-1 adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Wang2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, while increased SKAP-55 expression enhanced adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Wang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Wang2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This points to a highly unusual situation in T-cells where a single mediator has opposing effects on p21<sup>ras</sup>-ERK activation and adhesion. To our knowledge, this opposing dichotomy in T-cells has not been previously reported. What might therefore be the purpose of these opposing effects? Could it be related to a need for dampening TCR signalling during the adhesion of T-cells, or a requirement for reduced adhesion during T-cell activation? One possibility could relate to the temporal regulation of TCR signaling events during T-cell/APC conjugation, or the migration of T cells along vessel surfaces where they exit into lymph nodes and/or other tissues. Lymphocytes use LFA-1 that binds to ICAMs expressed by APCs and on epithelial cells lining the blood vessels. In the context of conjugation, contact between T-cells and APCs is initially induced by chemokines followed by TCR induced &#x02018;inside-out&#x02019; signals that leads to a major increase in the number of TCR-MHC peptide interaction events. The dampening of p21<sup>ras</sup>-ERK activation during an increase in adhesion and conjugation induced by SKAP-55 could alter the threshold of T-cell activation. In the context of certain MHC-peptide interactions, this could prevent the generation of partial activation signals that leads to anergy induction or non-responsiveness. Similarly, it could dampen the activation process during the initial contact period between T-cell and APC, before the T-cell has had an opportunity to assemble sufficient TCR-MHC interactions to produce a sufficiently strong signal needed for activation. By concurrently suppressing ERK activation, it would guard against incomplete or partial signaling linked to the induction of anergy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Smith1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Fields1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Impaired ERK activation has also previously been shown to participate in anergy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Fields1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, SKAP-55 may act to prevent responses to low affinity ligand such as auto-antigen. Lastly, it may also operate to reduce integrin activation of the ERK pathway in the absence of TcR stimulation. In this context, VLA-4 ligation has been shown to activate ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-McGilvray1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In the same vein, SKAP-55 may act to prevent inappropriate T-cell responses during the migration of T cells along vessel surfaces where they exit into lymph nodes and/or other tissues. Further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>The suppression of ERK activation could have resulted from the direct regulation of ERKs or their upstream regulator p21<sup>ras</sup>. Although p21<sup>ras</sup> was not assayed in SKAP-55&#x02212;/&#x02212; T-cells, shRNA knock-down of the adaptor in cell lines showed an increased activation of p21<sup>ras</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The increased p21<sup>ras</sup> activation was also frequently observed in resting T-cells. This pointed to a connection with a regulator of p21<sup>ras</sup> that in turn led to the identification of SKAP-55 binding to RasGRP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). During the preparation of this paper, the same observation was independently made by another group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Kosco1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. This would fit nicely in a scheme where SKAP-55 binding reduces the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RasGRP1 and/or its intracellular localization in the cell. Binding to other GEFs such as SOS or 3CG was not observed (data not shown). RasGRP1 GEF activity is difficult to measure and so we have initially focused on the effect of the loss of RasGRP1 binding on SKAP-55 inhibition of ERKs and its localization in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The loss of binding to the C-terminus of SKAP-55 resulted in a concurrent loss of RasGRP1 binding and its suppression of ERK and ELK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). This has provided initial evidence to link the two events. The one complication is that mutations of WW residues of the SH3 domain that are essential for SH3 domain function did not interfere with RasGRP1/SKAP-55 binding (data not shown). Therefore, instead of classic SH3 domain binding, there is a requirement for the C-terminal region for the binding to RasGRP1 that includes residues that comprise an SH3 domain. In this way, the loss of residues in the C-terminus was used to connect RasGRP1 binding to a loss of SKAP-55 suppressor activity, a result consistent with the need for RasGRP1 binding in the regulator of ERK. Further work will be needed to clearly define in a more precise way the molecular basis of binding between these two proteins.</p><p>Our findings differ from Kosco <italic>et al</italic>. who found that over-expression of SKAP-55 increased TCR-dependent AP-1 transcriptional activity, while the knock-down of SKAP-55 decreased ERK phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Kosco1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the basis for this difference is not clear, it could be related to different cell conditions and levels of over-expression.

The strength of our study is in the consistency of findings using both <italic>SKAP-55&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> primary cells and over-expression or knock-down analysis in different cell lines.

In all cases, the loss or reduction in SKAP-55 expression resulted in enhanced p21ras or ERK activation.</p><p>Lastly, another observation that implicated RasGRP1 in the suppression ediated by SKAP-55 was the greater level of RasGRP1 in the TGN in anti-CD3 activated <italic>SKAP-55&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001718-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Philips and coworkers have shown that the active form of p21<sup>ras</sup> in T-cells induced by anti-CD3/TcR ligation is found in the Golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Chiu1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Bivona2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the molecular basis of the observation needs greater definition, it is compatible with the notion of greater p21ras activation in T-cells linked to a connection between SKAP-55 and RasGRP1. The increased presence of the GEF could be due to increased migration to the TGN, or more likely, a lesser degree of RasGRP1 movement from the TGN in response to TCR signals. Active p21ras has been reported in both the TGN and the plasma membrane, depending on the cell type examined. In Jurkat T-cells activated by anti-CD3 alone, active p21ras has been reported to remain in the TGN, while coligation with LFA-1 promotes more translocation to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Bivona1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Caloca1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings are compatible with the notion of a weaker TcR signalling or decoupling in SKAP-55 deficient T-cells. The net result was to maintain more RasGRP1 in the Golgi, the location where p21ras is activated in T-cells. We also observed an increase in the expression of Ras in the Golgi (data not shown). Overall, this would fit with the model where SKAP-55 plays a role in modulating the coupling of the TCR with the localization of RasGRP1, although this observation will require more work to define this clearly. RasGRP1 activates Ras with the involvement of diacylglycerol via phospholipase C-&#x003b3; and actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Caloca2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001718-Guilbault1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Future studies will be needed to assess whether SKAP-55 can act as a chaperone for the translocation of RasGRP1 to the plasma membrane. The PH domain of SKAP-55 could provide a mechanism to facilitate the movement of a portion of RasGRP-1 from different intracellular compartments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and Antibodies</title><p>Murine hybridoma T8.1, a kind gift from Dr. Oreste Acuto (Oxford University, Oxford, UK) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 200 nM methotrexate, 1 mg/ml G418, 10 percent fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M 2-mercaptoethanol.
