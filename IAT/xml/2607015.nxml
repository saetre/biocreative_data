In this study, we characterized the interaction between erythrocytes and unrelated Ad serotypes, human 5 (HAd5) and 37 (HAd37), and canine 2 (CAV-2). While these serotypes agglutinate human erythrocytes, they use different receptors, have different tropisms and/or infect different species. Using molecular, biochemical, structural and transgenic animal-based analyses, we found that the primary erythrocyte interaction domain for HAd37 is its sialic acid binding site, while CAV-2 binding depends on at least three factors: electrostatic interactions, sialic acid binding and, unexpectedly, binding to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on human erythrocytes. We show that the presence of CAR on erythrocytes leads to prolonged <italic>in vivo</italic> blood half-life and significantly reduced liver infection when a CAR-tropic Ad is injected intravenously. This study provides i) a molecular and structural rationale for Ad&#x02013;erythrocyte interactions, ii) a basis to improve vector-mediated gene transfer and iii) a mechanism that may explain the biodistribution and pathogenic inconsistencies found between human and animal models.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In most cases, adenoviruses are thought to initially enter the host via contact with epithelial cells and spread within the host via an unknown mechanism. Most adenovirus serotypes use a cell adhesion molecule dubbed &#x0201c;CAR&#x0201d; to attach to cells. To assess, predict and understand adenovirus biology and vectorology, many <italic>in vivo</italic> studies use mice and monkeys. These animal models have been considered reliable models in the realm of viral pathogenesis and gene transfer. One of the implications of our study suggests that the rat may be a more appropriate model during intravenous adenovirus delivery because like humans, and unlike mice and monkeys, they also express CAR on their erythrocytes. The identification of CAR on human erythrocytes explains a 50-year-old enigma of adenovirus hemagglutination, helps us better understand adenovirus <italic>in vivo</italic> biology and may open new avenues to understand the role of cell adhesion molecules during erythropoiesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adenoviruses (Ads) are nonenveloped double-stranded DNA pathogens that infect all vertebrate classes. To date, all Ads display a characteristic, icosahedral symmetry in which 240 subunits of the trimeric hexon protein form the facets and 12 copies of the penton, comprising the pentameric penton base protein and the externally projecting trimeric fiber, form the vertices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Cusack1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. While the stoichiometry of the penton base and hexon is apparently conserved, the fiber can exist as a single or double copy at each vertex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Gelderblom1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. At least <italic>in vitro</italic> and for most cell types, the fiber mediates the initial attachment to primary receptors, such as the D1 domain of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), sialic acids, CD46, and others (for review see Zhang &#x00026; Bergelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Zhang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). Interaction with auxiliary receptor(s), in particular some of the dimeric integrins via the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence (an integrin-interacting motif) on the penton base, may induce internalization of some serotypes. However, other auxiliary receptors or mechanism of internalization may exist for human serotypes 40 and 41 (HAd40/41), and canine serotype 2 (CAV-2), which have no identifiable integrin-interacting motif in the penton base <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Albinsson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Soudais1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Greater than 150 Ad serotypes have been isolated. Approximately 50 of these are currently classed as human pathogens that, in most cases, generate subclinical ocular, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections. In the immunocompromised host however, lethal HAd infections can spread, via unknown mechanisms, to the kidney, liver and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Lenaerts1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Hierholzer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The human Ads (HAds) are divided into subgroups (or species or subgenera) A - F. The triage of the human serotypes into subgroups is based in part on serotype-specific <italic>ex vivo</italic> erythrocyte cross-linking (or hemagglutination) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Rosen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The clinical hemagglutination assays use lysates from virus-infected cells to crosslink erythrocytes from a handful of species. This highly heterogeneous lysate contains whole virus particles, empty capsids, penton monomers, penton dodecahedrons, fiber monomers, hexon etc. By using fractionated infected cell lysate, a handful of laboratories found that the multivalent complexes containing fiber were responsible for hemagglutination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Norrby1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Marusyk1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Erythrocyte membranes contain highly sialated glycoproteins and glycolipids. One of the most abundant glycoproteins on erythrocytes is glycophorin A (&#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> copies/cell). With its high sialic acid content, glycophorin A is the main contributor to the net negative cell-surface charge and is critical for minimizing cell&#x02013;cell interactions and preventing erythrocyte aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Chasis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Sialic acid is a collective term for a family of 9-carbon monosaccharides, which are often found as terminal sugar residues on glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids (usually &#x003b1;2-3, -6 or -8 linked). In addition to some HAds, a number of viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, papovaviruses, coronaviruses, reoviruses and parvoviruses bind to sialic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Forrest1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-SchwegmannWessels1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Among the HAds, serotype 37 is unusual: its fiber head can bind CAR, CD46 and sialic acid, but the virus appears to use only the latter two as functional receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Seiradake1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Wu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Burmeister et al. found that the sialic acid moiety bound to a basic patch close to the center of the trimeric fiber heads of HAd37 and HAd19p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Burmeister1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the putative hemagglutination domain in subgroup D heads partially aligns with the sialyl-lactose binding site, which on the basis of sequence alignments is likely to be conserved in other members of this subgroup. These observations raise the question as to whether Ad-erythrocyte interaction is a consequence of fiber head-sialic acid interaction.</p><p>In this study we initially characterize the erythrocyte binding of unrelated serotypes, HAd5, HAd37 and CAV-2. Although both HAd37 and CAV-2 agglutinate human erythrocytes at low particle-to-cell ratios, they use different receptors (sialic acid and CD46 vs. CAR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Soudais1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Arnberg1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Wu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, have different clinical tropisms (ocular vs. respiratory tract) and infect different species. We found that HAd37-erythrocyte interaction is primarily due to sialic acid binding. We show by structural analysis that the CAV-2 fiber head also contains a sialic acid binding site, but in contrast to HAd37 this site is modestly involved in hemagglutination. Unexpectedly, our biochemical and competition analyses suggested that CAV-2-erythrocyte interactions also depend on binding to CAR on human and rat erythrocytes. Using a transgenic mouse that expresses CAR on erythrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Asher1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> we demonstrate that CAR-binding Ads can be sequestered by CAR-expressing erythrocytes, and prevent liver infection. Our study provides a molecular and structural rationale for the 50-year-old enigma of <italic>ex vivo</italic> Ad-erythrocyte interactions. In addition to the relevance for Ad pathogenesis and vector biology, the expression of CAR by human erythrocytes may shed light on the role of cell adhesion molecules during erythropoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Hemagglutination assays using Ads</title><p>Consistent with previous reports, we found that at a modest physical particle (pp)-to-erythrocyte ratio (&#x0223c;130) HAd37 efficiently agglutinates human erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Although we have no evidence suggesting that CAV-2 can use sialic acid as a functional receptor, it is possible that the efficient CAV-2 agglutination of human erythrocytes is due to multiple and coordinated binding of sialic acid. For example, each of the 12 homotrimeric fiber heads on the end of the flexible CAV-2 shaft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Schoehn1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> could bind three sialic acid moieties (theoretically up to 36/capsid). Because the predicted subgroup D fiber head hemagglutination domains (in the CD and GH loops) appear to be well conserved, we tried to identify the corresponding domain in the CAV-2 fiber head using a mutagenesis strategy based on sequence homology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000277.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This approach was unsuccessful (data not shown), suggesting that Ad hemagglutination sites are not strictly conserved.</p><p>To address possible sialic acid binding via an alternative approach, we soaked CAV-2 fiber head crystals in solutions containing 2-3 sialyl-D-lactose. The crystal diffracted to 1.9 &#x000c5; and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using our model of CAV-2 fiber head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Seiradake1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> (crystallographic details are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000277.s006">Table S1</xref>). The electron density maps showed clear density for six N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5AC) moieties in the asymmetric unit, three per fiber head trimer. Sialyl-lactose is composed of three sugar rings, the sialic acid moiety being linked to lactose (galactose-glucose). The density for the lactose moieties was weak, implying that these are flexible within the crystal. Only one of the six galactose rings in the asymmetric unit could be modeled. This molecule is located in between the two fiber head trimers in the asymmetric unit and forms a distant hydrogen bond (distance 3.25 &#x000c5;) to Lys503 via the galactose oxygen 6. It is unlikely that this interaction is enough to immobilize the galactose ring because the other five galactose moieties in the asymmetric unit are not equally well visible in the electron density. More likely, the stabilization is due to the spatial restrictions imposed by the proximity of the other fiber head trimer.</p><p>We found that the sialic acid binding site on CAV-2 head is distinct, both in sequence and location, from that found on the HAd37 fiber head. On the CAV-2 fibers head, sialic acid binds further away from the three-fold symmetry axis at the periphery of the trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000277-g003">Figure 3A&#x02013;D</xref>). The residues involved in binding (Asn435, Ser419, Ser416, Gln417 and Arg515) do not align with those involved in sialic acid-binding by HAd37 fiber head (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000277.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The HAd37 sialic acid binding site consists of three residues forming hydrogen bonds (Tyr213, Pro317 and Lys345) and two residues contacting sialic acid in hydrophobic interactions (Tyr308 and Val322) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000277-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). All seven interactions between CAV-2 fiber head and sialic acid are hydrogen bonds or salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000277-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting a relatively strong interaction compared to HAd37. Unlike HAd37 fiber head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Arnberg2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, no hydrophobic contacts contribute to sialic acid binding.

Due its sensitive and semi-quantitative potential, we returned to hemagglutination assays to understand the erythrocyte interactions.</p><p>Freshly purified CAV-2H<sup>wt</sup>, which predominantly consists of individual trimeric fiber heads, did not cause hemagglutination, presumably because it is not sufficiently multivalent to crosslink erythrocytes. However, several His-tagged Ad fiber heads, including those of HAd41 short fiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Seiradake2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and HAd37, form multimers that dissociate into single trimeric fiber heads upon removal of the histidine tag. Similarly, His-tagged CAV-2 fiber head forms multimers of a defined size that are stable on a size-exclusion column and can be visualized with an electron microscope (not shown). Removal of the His-tag yields single fiber heads. We found that His-tagged CAV-2H<sup>wt</sup> agglutinated erythrocytes, while His-tagged CAV-2H<sup>SA&#x02212;1</sup> and CAV-2H<sup>SA&#x02212;2</sup> (two CAV-2 fiber heads with one or two mutations in the sialic acid binding site, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000277-t002">Table 2</xref>) showed reduced hemagglutination titers.

Our results demonstrate that HAd37 interaction with human erythrocytes is primarily due to sialic acid binding via a conserved sialic acid binding site on this subgroup D HAd fiber head. CAV-2, a serotype that like the prototype HAd5 is &#x0201c;CAR-tropic&#x0201d; and by most criteria is unrelated to HAd37, interacts with human erythrocytes via a mechanism depending on several factors, including most notably binding to CAR.</p><p>Most subgroup D HAd sialic acid binding site residues are conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Burmeister1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, and structural analysis suggest that they bind sialic acid in an equivalent fashion. Unexpectedly, we found that the CAV-2 fiber head harbors a sialic acid binding site. But, in contrast to the well-conserved location of the CAR binding domains on some Ad fiber heads, location of the sialic acid binding site is not conserved.</p><p>Following the structure-based identification of the amino acids in the CAV-2 and HAd37 fiber heads that interact with sialic acid, we introduced mutations to assay the role of these sites in sialic acid binding and erythrocyte interaction. In a number of conditions and approaches we showed that hemagglutination by HAd37 depends primarily on sialic acid binding. First, removing sialic acids from erythrocytes with neuraminidase eliminated erythrocyte cross-linking by HAd37 and a chimeric capsid harboring the HAd37 fiber head. Likewise, pre-incubation with neuraminidase significantly reduced hemagglutination caused by protein complexes containing multiple copies HAd37 fiber heads. Second, mutating single residues in the sialic acid binding sites reduced the hemagglutination activity of these protein complexes. Third, wild type HAd37 fiber heads bound more efficiently to erythrocytes or glycophorin than those carrying a point mutation in the sialic acid binding site. Our binding assays using wild type and mutated HAd37 heads also suggested that the sialic acid affinity is partially charge-driven. In addition, although HAd37 head also binds CAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Seiradake1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, in the context of the virus it does not appear to use CAR as a receptor, possibly due to its relatively short fiber. Therefore, CAR on erythrocytes is likely to be less important for HAd37 biodistribution.</p><p>In spite of our structural data showing a well-defined sialic acid binding site, we could not detect notable binding between CAV-2 fiber head and glycophorin, a highly sialated protein. It was possible that the affinity of CAV-2 fiber head to erythrocytes or glycophorin was lower than that of HAd37 fiber head, and that the efficient erythrocyte binding of CAV-2 depended on the avidity of multiple fibers. As the CAV-2 fiber head is less positive than HAd37 fiber head (pI's of 8.4 and 9.2 respectively), this could have explained the lower affinity. The affinity between virus proteins and sialic acid is usually in the millimolar range; therefore it was conceivable that the affinity of single CAV-2 fiber heads to erythrocytes or glycophorin was low. Consistent with this assumption, we previously found that CAV-2 is more neutrally charged than other Ads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Schoehn1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Paradoxically though, CAV-2 agglutinates at a lower particle-to-cell ratio than HAd37 and our crystallography data suggested that sialic acid binding should be at least as strong as HAd37. However, one cannot reliably predict affinity from structural data.</p><p>The identification of CAR expression by erythrocytes from species that are agglutinated by CAR-tropic Ads is a crucial observation. Using <bold>i)</bold> competition assays with recombinant fiber heads harboring point mutations in the sialic acid and CAR binding sites and <bold>ii)</bold> transgenic mice expressing CAR on erythrocytes, we characterized the unexpected and significant role of CAR in Ad binding.</p><p>As mentioned previously, Ad serotypes differ in their ability to bind erythrocytes from various species.

For example, some non-CAR-tropic Ads that agglutinate human erythrocytes may preferentially bind Neu5AC, the most abundant sialic acid on human erythrocytes. With respect to charge, both HAd37 and HAd19p bind sialic acid with equal affinity and the only two residues that differ between their heads are not close to the sialic acid-binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Arnberg2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. With the limited amount of data available, subgroup D HAds tend to have heads with higher pI's and interact with sialic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Arnberg2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the residues that make up the CAV-2 sialic acid binding site are conserved in the CAV-1 fiber head (data not shown), suggesting a conserved sialic acid binding function. With respect to CAR affinity, the CAV-2 fiber head binds human CAR with the highest affinity of any fiber head known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Seiradake1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, which may favor its efficient hemagglutination.

This is also consistent with a rather large difference between HAd5 and CAV-2 hemagglutination: to the best of our knowledge the HAd5 head does not harbor a sialic acid binding site and its pI (6.25) is less basic than HAd37 or CAV-2. Finally, we cannot exclude a role of the inter- and intra-species differences in the quantity of CAR expressed by erythrocytes.</p><p>Phylogenetically, CAR expression by erythrocytes appears to be random; we tested several other species (dogs, mice, rabbits, lemurs and monkeys) and did not find CAR expression. However, CAR levels on rat erythrocytes were relatively high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000277-g006">Figure 6</xref>) and consistent with our hypothesis that CAR-tropic Ads agglutinates human and rat erythrocytes via CAR binding. It is possible, but unlikely, that our lack of detection of CAR on erythrocytes on some species was due to the limit of sensitivity of our bank of anti-CAR antibodies, which nonetheless detected CAR expression on other cell types from these species (not shown). In the context of the significant amount of HAd5-mediated gene transfer data, our data highlights an important parallel. While a 30-gram mouse can be injected intravenously with up to 10<sup>12</sup> pp of an HAd5 vector with minimal side effects, injection of the same dose in a 250-gram rat is normally lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000277-Morrissey1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.
