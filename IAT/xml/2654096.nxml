In the past century IAV induced several world-wide pandemics, the most aggressive occurring in 1918 with a death toll of 20&#x02013;50 million cases. However, infection with IAV alone is rarely fatal. Instead, death associated with IAV is usually mediated by superinfection with bacteria, mainly <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. The reasons for this increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfection have not been fully elucidated. We previously demonstrated that triggering of TLR7 causes immune incompetence in mice by induction of lymphopenia. IAV is recognized by TLR7 and infections can lead to lymphopenia. Since lymphocytes are critical to protect from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> it has long been speculated that IAV-induced lymphopenia might mediate increased susceptibility to superinfection. Here we show that sub-lethal pre-infections of mice with IAV-PR8/A/34 strongly increased their mortality in non-lethal SP infections, surprisingly despite the absence of detectable lymphopenia. In contrast to SP-infection alone co-infected animals were unable to control the exponential growth of SP. However, lymphopenia forced by TLR7-triggering or antibody-mediated neutropenia did not increase SP-susceptibility or compromise the ability to control SP growth. Thus, the immune-incompetence caused by transient lympho- or leukopenia is not sufficient to inhibit potent antibacterial responses of the host and mechanisms distinct from leukodepletion must account for increased bacterial superinfection during viral defence.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) belongs to the class of orthomyxoviridae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Doherty1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Subbarao1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and presents with high genetic variability which is the cause for regularly occurring epidemics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Subbarao1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> or world-wide pandemics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Taubenberger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The natural host-defence comprises complement-mediated phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN).

A number of explanations exist (comprehensively reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-McCullers1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>). The most widely used concept is focussed on the destruction of the respiratory epithelium by IAV allowing increased adhesion of bacteria to the tracheal wall and thus better retention and growth of pneumococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-McCullers2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, also less destructive variants of IAV are able to induce lethal synergism in a mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-McCullers2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> arguing for additional mechanisms. E.g. a massive induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in IAV-infected animals recruiting large numbers of PMN which ultimately destroy the lung tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-McCullers1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Speshock1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, other groups could demonstrate the opposite, a strongly reduced recruitment of PMN during pneumococcal infection in mice 4&#x02013;6 weeks after recovering from IAV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Didierlaurent1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This was associated with a decreased response of alveolar macrophages (AM) in IAV-infected mice in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands of bacterial origin leading to their inability to produce neutrophil attracting chemokines such as Mip-2 and KC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Didierlaurent1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter study, however, fails to explain why a natural mechanism should exist that renders animals highly susceptible to secondary bacterial infections for several weeks after a single viral infection. It is difficult to imagine how such a process should have survived through evolution in the presence of a constant bacterial threat.</p><p>It seems more conceivable that immediate mechanisms directly associated with the viral defence process might be responsible for the increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfection during ongoing antiviral action and not after successful viral depletion. Along those lines it has been demonstrated, that impairment in AM phagocytosis of pneumococci 8&#x02013;9 days after IAV infection was dependent on the reduction of the scavenger receptor MARCO on AM via T cell-derived interferon &#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Indeed it has been shown that increased susceptibility of mice to superinfection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> after LCMV infection is caused by enhanced apoptosis of PMN leading to leukopenia and drastically reduced PMN infiltration at bacterial infection sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Navarini1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Is it possible, that similar mechanisms underlie the increased pneumococcal superinfection of IAV infected hosts? The host response to IAV is initiated by TLR7- and RIG-I-mediated recognition of the viral genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Diebold1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Pichlmair1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> leading to a rapid and massive production of type I interferons which are able to establish a so-called antiviral state. We have shown that triggering of TLR7 by the specific ligand R-848 rapidly induces lymphopenia in mice lasting 36&#x02013;48 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Gunzer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This lymphopenia renders animals unable to mount peripheral immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Gunzer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Also IAV infections can cause massive lymphopenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Tumpey2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> peaking at day 7 of the infection. In IAV and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> co-infection models the time point of highest susceptibility for the bacterial superinfection was at day 7 after IAV pre-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-McCullers2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, correlating precisely with the peak of lymphopenia seen during IAV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Tumpey2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus we reasoned that TLR7 induced lymphopenia might increase susceptibility to pneumococcal superinfection.</p><p>To test this we established a mouse model for co-infection of the mouse adapted IAV-strain PR8/A/34 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-McCullers2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and the invasive <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strain TIGR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Tettelin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Sandgren1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Individually, both infections were sublethal but showed strong synergistic action when combined.

Previous studies on this issue suffered from the lack of examples where both, the time course of peripheral blood leukocyte counts and the susceptibility for bacterial superinfection were followed within the same system. Either one of the parameters was measured separately, but never both simultaneously.</p><p>In addition, the different experimental systems varied greatly e.g. in the employed pneumococcal and viral isolates as well as the strains of mice.

We further demonstrate that a forced reduction of peripheral leukocytes does not predispose for pneumococcal infection, at least in the model system analyzed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004840-g004">Figs. 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004840-g005"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004840-g006">6</xref>).</p><p>This might point to the fact that neither PMN nor lymphocytes are necessary in the early phase of the response to this bacterial infection.

Removal of PMN by a single injection of RB6-8C5 induces a profound immune suppression in C57Bl/6 mice rendering the normally resistant mice highly susceptible to a pulmonary infection with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (data not shown).

However, IAV-1918 is special leading to an uncontrolled and not well timed cytokine storm in infected animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Kobasa1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> making this human-adapted strain also highly pathogenic for mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Kobasa2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Kash1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, these findings can only partially explain the processes in co-infected animals in the model used here. We have used the viral strain PR8/A/34 leading to a relatively mild form of the viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004840-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The majority of mice can cope well with the infection and clear it without a large health burden which is in sharp contrast to IAV-1918. What causes increased superinfection here must remain open. Our data show that depletion of peripheral leukocytes is not critical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004840-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004840-g004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004840-g005"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004840-g006">6</xref>). In contrast, analyses of BAL from co-infected mice in our model suggest a highly increased infiltration of the lung with PBMC (data not shown). Unable to protect from superinfection, these cells could even be toxic and their depletion might result in a health benefit in a mouse model of pneumococcal infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-Marks1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. If this can be further substantiated, it might be considered for future IAV epidemics to combine a prophylactic antibiotic treatment, which on its own is not protective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004840-McCullers3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> with some form of medical control for overt leukocyte recruitment and the uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mike Hasenberg for help with the PMN depletion experiment.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
