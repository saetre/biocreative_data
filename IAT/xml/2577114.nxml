Thus, FGF2 may be required for the maintenance of the pool of adult cortical progenitor cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>FGF2, one of the most potent among the fibroblast growth factor ligands, is expressed in the neuroepithelium of the central nervous system ventricular zone (VZ) from early embryonic development, along with the transmembrane FGF receptors FGFR1-FGFR3. FGF2 promotes growth in the cerebral cortex by increasing the number of cortical progenitor cells in the VZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The microinjection of FGF2 into the ventricles of E15.5 rat embryos increases cortical volume and the total number as well as density of glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes in the cortex; however, FGF2 treatment does not affect cortical thickness or cortical layer architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The <italic>in vivo </italic>injection of FGF2 does not appear to shorten the cell cycle of progenitor cells, indicating that it does not act on the kinetics of cell division. Rather, the increase in total cell number can be attributed to an increase in the number of progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The expression of FGF2 is steadily down-regulated during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, FGF2 protein accumulates postnatally in neurons of the CA2 region of the hippocampus and the cytoplasm and nucleus of astroglial cells throughout the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]-.</p><p>The analysis of <italic>Fgf2 </italic>null (<italic>Fgf2 </italic>-/-) mice demonstrated its unique role in regulating neurogenesis. Specifically, there is a 40% decrease in the number of neurons and astrocytes in the cerebral cortex of <italic>Fgf2 </italic>-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], as well as a decreased number of dividing progenitors in the VZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This supports the earlier finding that FGF2 acts on the progenitor population, and when it is missing, the pool of cortical progenitor cells is significantly decreased. FGF2 may uniquely affect the development of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Pyramidal neurons identified using SMI-32, latexin, and glutamate antibodies were decreased by 38% in the cortex; in contrast, cortical GABAergic interneurons were not significantly affected. Remarkably, this disruption in excitatory cell number was most significant in the anterior regions of the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The data are consistent with the notion that FGF2 is important for the development of radial glial cells, which are neuroepithelial progenitors of the VZ that give rise to excitatory neurons and astrocytes during neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, FGF2 also seems to control cell migration, since a fraction of the neuronal progenitors remain in the deeper cortical layers and cannot reach layers 2 and 3 in <italic>Fgf2 </italic>-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p><italic>Fgf2 </italic>is encoded by three exons, exon 1, 2, and 3. In the original knockout studies, <italic>Fgf2 </italic>null mice were generated by deleting exon 1 and immediately upstream sequences in the <italic>Fgf2 </italic>gene locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]-. However, other <italic>Fgf2 </italic>mRNA variants have been described that lack the canonical exon 1 and utilize alternative exons (i.e., exon 1b, 1c) that are located downstream from exon 1 and can be spliced to the second exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These studies raise the possibility that these alternatively spliced transcripts may compensate for the lack of canonical exon 1 in the <italic>Fgf2 </italic>-/- mice. To answer this question, we generated a new recombinant mouse model that lacks exon 3, an exon that is conserved among the <italic>Fgf2 </italic>transcript variants.</p><p>Because exon 3 is over 5 kb long, the current strain of <italic>Fgf2 </italic>knockout mice was generated by inserting a stop codon in front of this exon. This stop sequence was flanked by Cre recognition sites, and as such it is amenable to being excised by Cre recombination, reconstituting the wild type gene. An important question to be addressed is whether these mice would show the same or more profound deficits in CNS development, as compared with the original exon 1 <italic>Fgf2 </italic>knockout line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation and characterization of Fgf2 exon 3 knockout mice</title><p>A targeting vector was constructed containing the SA&#x003b2;geolox2 transcriptional STOP cassette (obtained by Dr. Phillip Soriano, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] flanked by approximately 5 Kb and 3 Kb of upstream and downstream <italic>Fgf2 </italic>genomic sequence, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

A rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes FGF2 epitopes encoded in exons 1 and 2 was used (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Molecular weights were determined by Precision Plus Protein standards (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA). Visualization was by chemiluminescence (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Brain samples were obtained by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M Phosphate Buffered Solution (PBS), pH 7.4, followed by post-fixation overnight in 4% PFA and cryprotection in 20% sucrose. Thirty minutes prior to perfusion, the mice were injected with 100 mg/kg 2-bromodeoxururidine (BrdU). Brains were sectioned with a cryostat at 50&#x003bc;m thickness. For each antibody staining, a series of free-floating sagittal sections (1 out every 10) were blocked for one hour in a 0.1 M PBS/10% normal goat serum solution, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Triton-X-100 and 0.1% Tween 20. Immunohistochemistry was performed with the following antibodies: neuronal-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) (1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:2000, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), T-box brain 1 protein (TBR-1) (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Dr. Chris Englund, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], parvalbumin (1:2500, Sigma-Aldrich, MO).

Double-immunostaining was visualized by a 594 and 488 nm double exposure filter. Nuclear profiles were counted in 3-dimensional counting frames (size, 100 &#x000d7; 100 &#x000d7; 5 &#x003bc;m), using a sampling grid of 500 &#x000d7; 500 &#x003bc;m randomly placed over the drawings of the cerebral cortex.

The upper cortical boundary was at the pia, and the lower boundary was the white matter. Hippocampal regions were not included. Counting frames were placed in the upper portion of the section (1 &#x003bc;m below the surface) to avoid variations due to differential penetration of antibodies. Between 50 and 150 sampling frames were counted in the cerebral cortex per brain. Counts were extrapolated to the entire cerebral cortical volume to obtain total cell number. Total volume was obtained using the Cavalieri method.

Exon 3 contains receptor-binding and heparin-binding domains, therefore its absence is likely to result in loss of function. Furthermore, the &#x003b2;<italic>-gal-neomycin </italic>gene product is expressed in place of exon 3 in these mice, resulting in loss of FGF2 immunoreactivity, likely due to a major conformational change of the protein. Alternatively, the aberrant FGF2-&#x003b2;GEO fusion protein may be unstable and subjected to degradation. The faint band at ~18 kD in the exon 3 lane (2% of the intensity of the 18 kD band from the wild type mouse) is likely non-specific because were it to have resulted from read-through of the truncating stop codon, it would also appear at the 21 kD and 22 kD positions since all three isoforms are translated from the same transcripts, and it does not (0% of the intensity of the wildtype 21 kD and 22 kD bands).</p><p>This study shows that the lack of <italic>Fgf2 </italic>exon 3 causes significant deficits in several major cortical cell populations. Overall, cortical NeuN+ neuron number was decreased by 23% and that of GFAP+ astrocytes by 34%; one subpopulation of cortical GABAergic interneurons, the PV+ interneurons, was not significantly affected, although we cannot exclude that a larger sample may reveal a deficit in this population, as well. This replicates the results obtained in our previous study of <italic>Fgf2 </italic>null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which were generated by deleting exon 1 in the <italic>Fgf2 </italic>gene locus. In that study, NeuN+ cells were decreased by 24% and glial cells by 38%. Thus, the degree of deficit in these two cell populations in the two <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO models is strikingly similar. The decrease in GFAP+ cells in the adult cortex is also in agreement with the results previously reported by another group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Also, in agreement with the present results, all prior studies of <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO mice reported a minimal decrease or no significant change in total cortical volume. Given the decrease in neuron number, it is conceivable that some compensatory mechanism maintains normal cortical volume; an expansion of dendritic or synaptic neuropil is a possibility.</p><p>Another group reported findings on the cortical phenotype of <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO mice that are slightly different from those described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Dono et al. reported a 25% reduction in the number of PV+ neurons, but no change in GFAP+ astroglial cells in the cortex of their <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO mice lacking exon 1. Possible reasons for this discrepancy include the genetic background (C57BL/6J/129/Sv versus Black Swiss/129/Sv in our mice) and the quantitative methods used for estimating cell numbers. We examined both total number and density of cells by stereology using the optical fractionator and unbiased sampling methods, whereas Dono et al. assessed cell density, presumably by counting cells in selected sections.</p><p>The decrease in excitatory neurons expressing TBR-1 is less than what was previously found in the exon 1 KO mice using immunostaining for the neurotransmitter glutamate. However, TBR-1 + excitatory neurons represent only a subset of pyramidal cells, those predominantly found in layer 6 in adult mice. The data suggest that FGF2 may be relatively more important for the genesis of pyramidal cells in other cortical layers.</p><p>In our prior exon1 <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] the mutants showed no significant decrease in cortical interneurons, as assessed by GABA immunostaining. In the current study, we also found no significant decrease in GABAergic neuron types expressing PV in the cortex. Although the data tend to confirm the lack of a phenotype among the GABAergic cell population, we cannot exclude that a non-PV+ subtype of GABAergic cells is affected by the lack of FGF2. Recent studies from our laboratory suggest that the conditional disruption of FGFR1 resulted in a clear loss of PV+ and somatostatin+ interneurons in the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This disparity suggests that other FGF ligands may be important for the development of cortical GABAergic cells.</p><p>The implications of these results are manifold. First, the results demonstrate that the phenotype of two completely different <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO mouse lines, lacking exon 1 or exon 3, is remarkably similar. The combined results from these KO models clearly indicate that FGF2 plays a role in cortical cell genesis in embryos as well as in adulthood. This is shown by the similar phenotype in the two lines: a decrease in total cortical neuron number, due to a deficit in pyramidal cells as well as in astrocytes, as shown by NeuN, TBR-1 and GFAP immunostaining. Pyramidal neurons and astrocytes are progeny of radial glial cells, which are located in the VZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This is consistent with the previously demonstrated loss of proliferative progenitors in the VZ during embryonic development in <italic>Fgf2 </italic>exon 1 KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Another cell type that is drastically curtailed in the <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO mice are proliferating stem/progenitor cells in the adult subventricular zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], which are, too, progeny of radial glial cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It can be hypothesized that this loss in radial proliferative "units" explains the decrease in number of excitatory pyramidal neurons, astrocytes and SVZ neural stem cells.</p><p>The current results also show that FGF2 is required for normal cell proliferation in the mature cortex. In previous studies on exon 1 KO mice, proliferating cells were assessed only in embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The current study indicates for the first time that FGF2 is required for the maintenance of the pool of progenitor cells that populate the cortical parenchyma in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study illustrates a novel way of preventing the expression of a specific exon of the <italic>Fgf2 </italic>gene by inserting a transcriptional STOP cassette by homologous recombination in the <italic>Fgf2 </italic>genomic locus. Previous research has shown that there are three putative splice variants of exon 1: 1a, 1b, and 1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Exon 1a, the canonical exon, was deleted in the previous <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]-. Alternative splicing of exon 1, in principle, could have given rise to different products exerting compensatory roles in the absence of exon 1a in the previously described <italic>Fgf2 </italic>KO mice. However, whether these FGF2 variants are actually transcribed into mRNA and protein is unclear. The generation of an exon 3 KO in the current study sought to verify the role of FGF2 in development because exon 3 is conserved in the all known FGF2 variants. The results clearly show that the phenotype of the <italic>Fgf2 </italic>exon 3 KO mice show no greater severity, and that the decrease in cell populations is very similar to that found in the exon 1 studies. Overall, the role of FGF2 in regulating cortical development is confirmed by removing the conserved exon 3. The relatively mild phenotype in this <italic>Fgf2 </italic>mutant may be explained by compensatory or redundant relationship with other FGF family genes. Furthermore, this line will allow for future studies in which the intact <italic>Fgf2 </italic>gene can be reconstituted by Cre recombination at selective stages in development or adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KC carried out the characterization of the brain phenotype of <italic>Fgf2 </italic>exon 3 KO mice by molecular, immunohistochemical and stereological analyses and drafted the manuscript.
