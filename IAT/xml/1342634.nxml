We asked if this diversity could be used to enrich our understanding of basic biological processes. As a test case, we examined a simple trait: the utilization of di/tripeptides as nitrogen sources. The capacity to import small peptides is likely to be under opposing selective pressures (nutrient utilization versus toxin vulnerability) and may therefore be sculpted by diverse pathways and strategies. Hitherto, dipeptide utilization in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was solely ascribed to the activity of a single protein, the Ptr2p transporter. Using high-throughput phenotyping and several genetically diverse strains, we identified previously unknown cellular activities that contribute to this trait. We find that the Dal5p allantoate/ureidosuccinate permease is also capable of facilitating di/tripeptide transport. Moreover, even in the absence of Dal5p and Ptr2p, an additional activity&#x02014;almost certainly the periplasmic asparaginase II Asp3p&#x02014;facilitates the utilization of dipeptides with C-terminal asparagine residues by a different strategy. Another, as-yet-unidentified activity enables the utilization of dipeptides with C-terminal arginine residues. The relative contributions of these activities to the utilization of di/tripeptides vary among the strains analyzed, as does the vulnerability of these strains to a toxic dipeptide. Only by sampling the genetic diversity of multiple strains were we able to uncover several previously unrecognized layers of complexity in this metabolic pathway. High-throughput phenotyping facilitates the rapid exploration of the molecular basis of biological complexity, allowing for future detailed investigation of the selective pressures that drive microbial evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Model organisms have allowed researchers to characterize basic biological processes in exquisite detail. Homann et al. suggest that this knowledge base presents a unique opportunity to exploit the natural genetic variation found in diverse isolates of the same species to gain new insights. Using high-throughput technology to assay growth, Homann et al. found that laboratory strains, vineyard isolates, and clinical isolates of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> exhibit very different capacities to utilize di/tripeptides as nutrient sources. This led to the discovery of new di/tripeptide utilization activities and an elaboration of their specificities. Variations in the strength of these activities determine the spectrum of di/tripeptides that are preferentially utilized in a given strain. In turn, this influenced the vulnerability of these strains to a toxic peptide, which exploits the transport machinery to gain entry into the cell. This raises the intriguing possibility that opposing selective pressures, in which the benefit of utilizing di/tripeptides as a nutrient source is offset by the risk of importing toxic peptides, may have shaped the observed natural diversity. The natural genetic diversity present among isolates of model organisms augurs a rich resource for revealing complexities in molecular pathways and exploring the selective pressures that shaped them.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Homann OR, Cai H, Becker JM, Lindquist SL (2005) Harnessing natural diversity to probe metabolic pathways.

Following the &#x0201c;gold rush&#x0201d; ushered in by the sequencing of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, efforts are being made to revisit this natural diversity.

Such analyses should also be applicable to the elucidation of pathways that face strong diversifying selection, such as those governing uptake and metabolism of nutrients. As a test case, we employed high-throughput phenotyping of diverse <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains to dissect the multiple activities contributing to the utilization of di/tripeptides as a nitrogen source.</p><p>The capacity to import small peptides is a ubiquitous cellular function, found in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Although small peptides have clear nutritional value as a source of amino acids, carbon, and nitrogen, they can have additional beneficial functions. For example, studies in bacteria have demonstrated a link between peptide transport and chemotaxis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, sporulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, and the recycling of cell wall peptides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Peptide transport systems, however, can also be a source of biological vulnerability. A variety of antimicrobial and antifungal agents utilize the di/tripeptide transport machinery to gain entry into the cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the benefits and risks associated with peptide import represent conflicting evolutionary pressures that may help shape the regulation and substrate specificity of peptide transporters. In a similar vein, transporters of small peptides are also of great interest for their medical applications, as routes for delivery of peptidomimetic drugs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Members of the PTR family of peptide transporters transport a variety of substrates, including nitrates, amino acids, and di/tripeptides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although many organisms, such as humans and plants, contain multiple PTR2 family members, the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contains only one, the di/tripeptide transporter Ptr2p.</p><p>The regulation of <italic>PTR2</italic> expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is strongly influenced by the composition of the extracellular environment. <italic>PTR2</italic> expression is induced in the absence of preferred nitrogen sources &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;&#x02014;even more so when the medium contains particular amino acids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Import of di/tripeptides containing basic or bulky hydrophobic N-terminal residues also induces <italic>PTR2</italic> by reducing cellular levels of the <italic>PTR2</italic> repressor Cup9p. Specifically, these di/tripeptides serve both as ligands and as regulators of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1p, which mediates a protein degradation system that is governed by the identity of N-terminal amino acids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These peptides are too small to serve as targets for degradation by the proteasome, and they are assimilated as nutrients via other peptidases in the cells. However, di/tripeptides with basic (Type 1: Arg, His, or Lys) and bulky (Type 2: Ile, Leu, Phe, Trp, or Tyr) N-terminal residues can compete with larger protein substrates for binding at the Type 1 and Type 2 Ubr1p substrate-binding sites. Upon binding, these peptides allosterically activate Ubr1p-mediated degradation of Cup9p by release of the Ubr1p autoinhibitory domain, thus exposing a substrate-binding domain that binds an internal degron in Cup9p &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Relief of Cup9p repression of <italic>PTR2</italic> results in enhanced <italic>PTR2</italic> expression. This initiates a positive regulatory feedback loop in which di/tripeptide uptake perpetuates Ubr1p-mediated degradation of Cup9p, up-regulation of <italic>PTR2,</italic> and additional di/tripeptide uptake &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="pgen-0010080-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Di/Tripeptide Uptake Is Enhanced by a Positive Feedback Loop Governed by the N-End Rule Pathway</title><p>The E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1p contains binding sites for proteins containing Type 1 (Arg, His, and Lys) and Type 2 (Ile, Leu, Phe, Trp, and Tyr) N-terminal amino acids. In the absence of di/tripeptides, the <italic>PTR2</italic> repressor Cup9p is abundant and <italic>PTR2</italic> expression is minimal. Upon binding of Type 1 and/or Type 2 di/tripeptides to Ubr1p, an autoinhibitory domain blocking the recognition of an internal Cup9p degron dissociates from the Cup9p binding site, decreasing the half-life of Cup9p (t <sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) from approximately 5 min to less than 1 min. Consequently, <italic>PTR2</italic> repression is relieved and elevated levels of Ptr2p enhance di/tripeptide uptake, initiating a positive feedback loop.

The PM system facilitates the classification of bacterial and fungal species by generating a characteristic phenotypic profile, which reflects the metabolic capabilities and chemical sensitivities of different species. The strong representation of peptides in the PM assay plates&#x02014;284 of the 400 possible dipeptide permutations and 11 tripeptides&#x02014;provides a unique opportunity to assay the capacity of different <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains to import and utilize dipeptides as nitrogen sources.</p><p>Using high-throughput data from PM assays, we uncovered extensive variation in dipeptide utilization in different strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We exploited this variation to uncover a diversity of strategies that may serve to balance the opposing selection pressures of nutrient utilization and toxin vulnerability. We find that Ptr2p provides only one of at least four distinct molecular activities that facilitate the utilization of dipeptides in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The varying strengths of these activities in different strains were key to their identification. No single strain would have revealed the full complexity of dipeptide utilization, underscoring the importance of natural genetic variation for developing a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes. We suggest that the comparison of genetically diverse strains will provide many new avenues for exploring the malleability of basic cellular functions and the evolutionary mechanisms and selective pressures that shape complex traits.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To advance our understanding of the processes contributing to nitrogen utilization in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> we studied a panel of strains isolated from several widely differing growth environments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010080-t001">Table 1</xref>). We included two related laboratory strains, S288c and W303, two California vineyard isolates, RM3 and RM8, a vineyard isolate thought to be of French origin, Y55 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, and a clinical isolate, YAT7.

Cells were grown in 96-well plates in which each well contained a different nitrogen source. A proprietary tetrazolium dye solution, which is reduced to the purple compound formazan, was included in each well. Plates were photographed every 15 min, generating a growth curve for each well that primarily reflected dye reduction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. The remaining growth signal was attributable to turbidity resulting from cell growth.</p><p>Because the technology was developed for bacterial cells, we first asked how well the PM signal curves reflect yeast cell growth and respiration, and how reproducible these phenotypes were in standard yeast laboratory media. Reduction of the tetrazolium dye ostensibly results from cellular respiration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, but when we tested petite strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the PM assay, they remained capable of robust dye conversion (data not shown). Thus, mitochondrial respiration is not required to produce reductants for this dye. Next, we employed dye-independent measures of growth, such as measuring optical density of PM plates lacking the tetrazolium dye and plating serial dilutions of cells from PM plates to solid media to measure the number of colony-forming units in each PM well. Dye conversion correlated well with growth (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), except that dipeptides containing the amino acids histidine, lysine, and/or cysteine sometimes caused dye reduction in the absence of growth (data not shown). Interestingly, this growth-independent dye reduction occurred only in the presence of cells. Since it reflects an unknown metabolic process, these dipeptides were omitted from our analyses. It should be noted, however, that this growth-independent dye reduction exhibited strong inter-strain variation, suggesting yet another source of metabolic variation for further study.</p><p>The PM assay utilizes a viscous medium that supports less-vigorous growth than typical laboratory media (data not shown). To determine if growth on diverse substrates in PM plates correlates well with standard laboratory media, we assayed growth on dipeptides as the sole nitrogen source in both solid and liquid standard media (see below), using optical density at 600 nm to measure growth in the liquid assays. Given the sensitivity of the dipeptide transport machinery to environmental cues, it is unsurprising that some differences were observed between these platforms. In large part, however, these differing growth conditions provided similar results, and the reproducibility on all tested media was robust.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Shared Properties and Inter-Strain Variation in Nitrogen Source Utilization</title><p>Next, we asked if the natural diversity in our yeast strains produced phenotypic diversity in nitrogen source utilization.

To assist visualization of the data, dipeptides were separated into two classes: N-end rule dipeptides, which up-regulate <italic>PTR2</italic> by enhancing Ubr1p-mediated degradation of the Cup9p repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), and non&#x02013;N-end rule dipeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The clinical isolate YAT7 utilized the broadest spectrum of dipeptides (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>C in particular) and tripeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Indeed, it grew robustly on many peptides that none of the other strains could utilize well, if at all. (Preliminary analyses of two additional clinical isolates, YAT17 and YAT21, suggest that robust di/tripeptide transport may be a common feature of strains adapted to the atypical mammalian host environment; data not shown.) The laboratory strain W303 utilized the fewest dipeptides. It lacked the broad capacity for N-end rule dipeptide utilization characteristic of the other strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), but it did grow robustly on some of these dipeptides. In contrast, growth of the French vineyard isolate Y55 was limited on the non&#x02013;N-end rule dipeptides in comparison to the other strains tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).

However, S288c and W303 did share two characteristics: Both grew robustly on all of the dipeptides in the array that contained C-terminal asparagine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">2</xref>C, boxes with red borders), and both grew well on D-asparagine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>E).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Overexpression of <italic>PTR2</italic> Masks Inter-Strain Variation and Enhances Di/Tripeptide Utilization</title><p>The diversity of dipeptide-utilization traits suggests profound differences in the underlying mechanism of di/tripeptide import among our conspecific strains.

The promoter region in W303 differed from that of S288c at only one base, a C&#x02192;T transition at position &#x02212;799. However, this polymorphism was shared by the strain RM8, which unlike W303 is sensitive to Ala-Eth and exhibits robust <italic>PTR2</italic>-dependent utilization of N-end rule dipeptides. Thus, differences in promoter sequence are not a likely source for the altered regulation of <italic>PTR2</italic> in W303.</p><p>Telomeric regions are common sites of epigenetic regulation, and <italic>PTR2</italic> is located in proximity (~50 kb) to a telomere. In our analyses of GFP-tagged <italic>PTR2,</italic> a small subpopulation (1 in 50 to 1 in 1,000, depending on conditions) of strongly fluorescent W303 cells was consistently observed during growth in either the MMA&#x0002b;Leu medium or in YPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g008">Figure 8</xref>; inset). W303 cells exhibiting robust <italic>PTR2</italic> expression also arose spontaneously at a high frequency (&#x0003e;0.1&#x00025;) on solid media. These cells maintain competency for <italic>PTR2</italic> expression following serial propagation on media that relieve selection for active dipeptide transport (J. Manjrekar and S. Lindquist, personal communication). These switching events were far too frequent to reflect mutation, suggesting that an epigenetic switch exists that can stably confer competency for PTR2 expression in W303 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results establish that the rich inter-strain diversity and genetic tractability of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can be combined with high-throughput phenotyping to provide new insights into basic cellular processes. Using this approach, we have uncovered previously unrecognized functions and regulatory systems governing the utilization of dipeptides as a nitrogen source. The natural diversity in these systems included variation in sensitivity to a toxic dipeptide, suggesting that dipeptide utilization can be considered in the context of an adaptive landscape shaped by opposing selective pressures.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Using High-Throughput Phenotyping to Study Di/Tripeptide Utilization</title><p>The exploration of natural diversity using high-throughput phenotyping techniques has the potential for tremendous synergy with the existing high-throughput technologies that have shaped our understanding of the cellular circuitry of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

The technology for global analysis of growth phenotypes remains largely underdeveloped and unexploited&#x02014;despite the fact that it is phenotype that determines how cellular systems interface with selective pressures. Thus, the broad synthesis of our understanding of genomic, transcriptional, and phenotypic diversity is contingent upon the development of robust technologies for high-throughput phenotyping.</p><p>Here, we have tested one of the first such systems by assaying dipeptide and tripeptide utilization on a previously unfeasible scale. The PM phenotypic assay allows simultaneous testing of approximately 2,000 growth conditions, providing a tremendous savings in time and labor. The technology was typically very robust and provided reliable and reproducible data that were easily manipulated using the accompanying software. However, the PM technology also has several drawbacks that need to be addressed before this technology is broadly suitable for use by the yeast research community. Due to the initial design focus on generalized bacterial phenotyping, many of the available PM assay plates are not optimized for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Thus, the number of useful growth conditions is considerably less than 2,000. This issue is compounded by the high cost of the PM assay plates. Further, different batches of media and PM assay plates provided by the manufacturer often affected reproducibility. Such technical difficulties are not atypical for a new technology, and the power of such tools in exploring the phenotypic diversity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is clear. Hopefully, the importance of high-throughput phenotyping will lead to reduced costs and enhanced suitability of these technologies.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Uncovering Unexpected Complexity in Di/Tripeptide Utilization</title><p>Through extensive phenotyping, we found that Ptr2p is but one component of a multifaceted system in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> governing the utilization of dipeptides as nitrogen sources. The discovery of these additional components was made possible by the dramatic inter-strain variation observed in the contributions of these activities to dipeptide utilization (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010080-t002">Table 2</xref>). We have clearly identified one previously unknown component of this system&#x02014;the allantoate/ureidosuccinate permease Dal5p&#x02014;and have defined parameters of two others that suggest mechanistic explanations.</p><table-wrap id="pgen-0010080-t002" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Activities Contributing to the Utilization of Dipeptides as a Nitrogen Source in Each Strain Background</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0010080.t002"/></table-wrap><p>Of these four components, Ptr2p exhibits the broadest dipeptide utilization activity. Relief of <italic>PTR2</italic> repression by deletion of <italic>CUP9</italic> facilitated robust growth on nearly all di/tripeptides tested. This was even true of W303, which otherwise grew on only a limited subset of the N-end rule dipeptides that supported growth of the other wild-type strains. This restricted utilization of potential Ptr2p substrates provides a window into the complex <italic>PTR2</italic> regulatory system. For example, one can ask why W303 is capable of growing on Trp-Arg, but not Arg-Trp (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), even though both are N-end rule peptides composed of identical residues. One possibility is that the N-end rule pathway in W303 is more responsive to Type 1 ligands (basic N-terminal residues; e.g., Arg) than Type 2 substrates (bulky hydrophobic N-terminal residues; e.g., Trp). Alternatively, substrate preference may arise from dipeptidase specificity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d; resulting in more robust hydrolysis of Trp-Arg upon import. Although beyond the scope of this analysis, additional insights and hypotheses can be derived from the wealth of data provided by our high-throughput analysis, and the approach developed here&#x02014;the application of a diverse panel of strains to the PM assay to analyze di/tripeptide utilization&#x02014;can be employed in future studies to enrich our understanding of <italic>PTR2</italic> regulation and Ptr2p function.</p><p>Dal5p, a second component of the dipeptide utilization system, was previously identified as a permease for the pyrimidine biosynthetic precursor ureidosuccinate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d; and the nitrogen source allantoate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is therefore fitting that Dal5p also is involved in the utilization of dipeptides as a nitrogen source. With the exception of Tyr-Gln, all Dal5p di/tripeptide substrates belonged to the non&#x02013;N-end rule class. Many of the dipeptides supporting growth in RM8-<italic>ptr2</italic>&#x00394; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g003">Figure 3</xref>) did not support growth in RM8-<italic>dal5</italic>&#x00394; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, Dal5p-mediated dipeptide transport is not redundant to that of Ptr2p, but rather a complementary activity that enhances the range of dipeptides that can be utilized.</p><p>A third component, evident in strains W303 and S288c, governs the utilization of dipeptides containing C-terminal asparagine residues as nitrogen sources (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that the Asp3p periplasmic asparaginase facilitates the utilization of these substrates. Asp3p activity is closely linked to nitrogen utilization. Nitrogen starvation has been demonstrated to up-regulate <italic>ASP3</italic> expression and promote the secretion of asparaginase II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of asparaginase II hydrolyzes either L- or D-asparagine into ammonia and aspartate, facilitating the use of D-asparagine as a nitrogen source &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Of the strains tested, only W303 and the related laboratory strain S288c were able to utilize D-asparagine in the PM assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Genomic analyses utilizing microarrays have noted a lack of detectable <italic>ASP3</italic> in Y55 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d; and a clinical isolate, YJM789 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Neither Y55 nor our clinical isolate, YAT7, were capable of utilizing the putative Asp3p substrates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Most important, the asparaginase of the bacterial plant pathogen <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> has been shown to deamidate C-terminal, but not N-terminal, asparagine residues of small peptides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. This specificity precisely matches the dipeptide utilization phenotypes observed for W303 and S288c. Both strains are unable to utilize the two dipeptides with N-terminal asparagine residues present in the PM nitrogen plates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), but are able to utilize all dipeptides containing C-terminal asparagine residues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>; boxes with red borders). To our knowledge, our study provides the first evidence for such an activity in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> in which mechanisms of extracellular peptide processing are rare.</p><p>A fourth component of the dipeptide utilization system, evident in strain RM8 but not W303, governs the use of dipeptides containing C-terminal arginine residues, and Met-Arg in particular. Utilization of Met-Arg is clearly enhanced by deletion of <italic>DAL5</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g006">Figure 6</xref>) and persists in the <italic>ptr2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dal5</italic>&#x00394; double mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010080-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), and thus represents another previously unrecognized mechanism of dipeptide utilization. Given the specificity for a nitrogen-rich C-terminal residue, an arginase activity comparable to the asparaginase activity of Asp3p would seem a likely candidate.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Balancing the Benefits and Potential Risks of Robust Di/Tripeptide Import</title><p>Variation in the relative strengths of the activities contributing to dipeptide import can strongly impact the range of dipeptide substrates utilized by the cell. Although di/tripeptides can serve as a valuable source of nutrients, evolutionary pressures opposing indiscriminate import may reinforce mechanisms promoting transport specificity. One such pressure might be the need to avoid import of antifungal agents that exploit the di/tripeptide transport machinery to gain entry into the cell (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>Of the di/tripeptide-utilization activities characterized in this study, the Ptr2p transporter provides the means to transport the broadest spectrum of dipeptide substrates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g003">Figure 3</xref>), yet it is also the source of vulnerability to the toxic Ala-Eth dipeptide (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, strains that exhibit robust <italic>PTR2</italic> expression, such as the clinical isolate YAT7, efficiently utilize a broad spectrum of dipeptides as a nitrogen source (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>), but are also vulnerable to Ala-Eth toxicity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, the limited <italic>PTR2</italic> expression in strain W303 provides protection from Ala-Eth at the cost of a more limited capacity to utilize di/tripeptides. However, in certain growth conditions, a fraction of W303 cells exhibit robust <italic>PTR2</italic> expression, suggesting a possible epigenetic mechanism for employing both high- and low-risk di/tripeptide utilization strategies in an isogenic population.</p><p>The optimal strategy for dipeptide utilization will vary between environments. For instance, in the presence of toxic peptidomimetics that resemble Dal5p substrates, strain Y55 would have a significant fitness advantage over the other strains tested in this study, as it exhibits no detectable Dal5p activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010080-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In environments with a strong risk of exposure to a variety of toxic di/tripeptides, the risks of Ptr2p- and Dal5p-mediated import may outweigh the potential nutritional benefits. In such cases, the utilization of a limited subset of di/tripeptides may represent a low-risk mechanism by which some nutritional benefit can be extracted from the available di/tripeptides. For example, extracellular release of ammonia from C-terminal asparagine residues by Asp3p would serve as a more limited, but risk-free, means of obtaining nitrogen from dipeptides. In contrast, in an environment in which nitrogen sources are scarce and the risk of importing toxic species is minimal, robust expression of <italic>PTR2</italic> would be a beneficial trait. We note that the clinical isolates YAT7 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>), YAT17, and YAT21 (data not shown) exhibit the most robust dipeptide utilization of the strains studied, perhaps reflecting the environmental pressures of the strains' atypical growth environment in the human host. Further investigation into the ecology, population structure, and population genetics of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> would benefit future attempts to link phenotypic diversity to likely environmental pressures.</p><p>High-throughput phenotyping and genetic diversity can provide new insights into the genetic determinants governing adaptation to the nutritional and chemical challenges of diverse environments.

These additional measures confirmed that, with the exceptions noted above, the PM assay signal is a reliable indicator of growth in the presence of the nitrogen sources discussed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Bioscreen growth curve analysis.</title><p>A selection of PM assay dipeptide-utilization phenotypes were verified using a Bioscreen C (Growth Curves USA) plate reader. Strains were cultured as described for the PM assay, but were inoculated at an optical density at 595 nm (OD<sub>595</sub>) of 0.02 into MM supplemented with the indicated nitrogen source. The mixture was inoculated into a 100-well plate and incubated in the Bioscreen C at 30 &#x000b0;C with heavy shaking. Measurements of OD<sub>600</sub> were made at 45-min intervals. Each growth curve was conducted in duplicate wells and was repeated at least once.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Screen for Ptr2p-independent dipeptide utilization.</title><p>The screen was conducted using a pRS202-based genomic library (2 &#x003bc;m; URA3) containing Sau3AI-digested genomic DNA with an average insert size of 6&#x02013;8 kb (gift of Dr. Gerald Fink; originally constructed by Connelly and Hieter from a strain congenic with S288c &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010080-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;).

Ethionine (Eth) is an analog of methionine, and utilization of Eth causes cell death. The tested strains were grown overnight in MMA. Yeast cells were harvested and washed three times with sterile, distilled water, then counted and adjusted to 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. One ml of the cell suspension was added to 0.8&#x00025; noble agar (3 ml) and plated onto MMA with or without leucine (30 &#x003bc;g/ml), an inducer of <italic>PTR2</italic> expression. Four 6-mm sterile paper disks containing either 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, or 0.025 &#x003bc;moles of Ala-Eth were placed on the lawn of cells. The size of the halo was measured after two days of incubation at 30 &#x000b0;C. Between two and four replicates were conducted for each assay. Although strains Y55 and RM3 were unable to utilize allantoin in the PM assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010080-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) and in additional Bioscreen C assays using liquid medium (0.5 mM allantoin; data not shown), both strains were capable of utilizing allantoin in the solid halo assay medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Sequencing upstream of <italic>PTR2.</italic></title><p>Although the region comprising the <italic>PTR2</italic> promoter has yet to be clearly defined, the sequenced span, an 889-bp region immediately upstream of the <italic>PTR2</italic> start codon, should contain the key regulatory elements.

A 927-bp fragment containing the desired sequence was amplified with primers O-321 and O-324, using an equal amount of Taq and Vent polymerases. Each reaction mix was split into eight aliquots and repooled following amplification. This approach was taken to help control for the possibility that a single replication error could propagate through the entire sample. PCR products were then purified with a Qiagen PCR purification kit (Valencia, California, United States) and sequenced in both directions by Northwoods DNA Inc. (Solway, Minnesota, United States) using oligos O-321, O-322, O-323, and O-324.
