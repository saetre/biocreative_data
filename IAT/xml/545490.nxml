DNA polymerase &#x003b1; (Pol &#x003b1;)-primase is required to prime synthesis of the leading strand and each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand, whereas DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (Pol &#x003b4;) is required for the elongation stages of replication, a function it appears capable of performing on both leading and lagging strands, at least in the absence of DNA polymerase &#x003b5; (Pol &#x003b5;).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here it is shown that the catalytic subunit of Pol &#x003b1;, Pol1, interacts with Cdc27, one of three non-catalytic subunits of fission yeast Pol &#x003b4;, both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Pol1 interacts with the C-terminal domain of Cdc27, at a site distinct from the previously identified binding sites for Cdc1 and PCNA. Comparative protein sequence analysis identifies a protein sequence motif, called the DNA polymerase interaction motif (DPIM), in Cdc27 orthologues from a wide variety of eukaryotic species, including mammals. Mutational analysis shows that the DPIM in fission yeast Cdc27 is not required for effective DNA replication, repair or checkpoint function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The absence of any detectable phenotypic consequences arising from mutation of the DPIM suggests that despite its evolutionary conservation, the interaction between the two polymerases mediated by this motif is a non-essential one.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Three conserved DNA polymerase enzymes whose activities are essential for complete chromosomal DNA replication have been identified through biochemical studies in mammalian systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and combined genetic and biochemical studies in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During S-phase, the DNA polymerase &#x003b1;-primase complex synthesises the short RNA-DNA segment that is used to prime synthesis of the leading strand at the chromosomal replication origin and synthesis of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand. The short RNA segment is synthesised by the primase and then extended by 10&#x02013;20 nucleotides by Pol &#x003b1;. The 3' end of the RNA-DNA primer is recognised by replication factor C (RFC), which displaces the Pol &#x003b1;-primase complex and catalyses the loading of the sliding clamp PCNA at the primer-template junction. PCNA then acts as a processivity factor for the Pol &#x003b4; and/or Pol &#x003b5; enzymes. The exact roles played by Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x003b5; remain unclear (for a recent perspective, see ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and references therein) but Pol &#x003b4; is most likely responsible for lagging strand replication and may also play a role on the leading strand. Yeast lacking Pol &#x003b5; catalytic activity are viable but are slow growing and somewhat impaired in chromosome replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In such cells, Pol &#x003b4; is thought to perform the bulk of nascent DNA chain elongation, raising the possibility that this enzyme performs a similar function in wild-type cells. If this is the case, Pol &#x003b5; could have a specialised role, at replication origins for example, or in the replication of sites of sister chromosome cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Each of the three essential polymerases is a multi-subunit entity, comprising a large catalytic subunit and a number of smaller subunits that are presumed to play either regulatory or structural roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Little is known of the biochemical functions of the smaller subunits but in yeast most are, like the three catalytic subunits, essential proteins. In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the Pol &#x003b1;-primase and Pol &#x003b4; complexes are both heterotetrameric in structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The catalytic subunits of the two complexes, Pol1 and Pol3 respectively, are members of the B family of DNA polymerases typified by bacteriophage T4 polymerase or Pfu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Both complexes also contain related B-subunits. These proteins are members of a larger family of phosphotransferase and nuclease enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although no enzymatic activity has been detected for either of the DNA polymerase subunits. In fission yeast, the B-subunit of Pol &#x003b4; is the Cdc1 protein. Fission yeast Pol &#x003b4; also contains two further subunits: the C-subunit Cdc27, which functions in part to link the polymerase to PCNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and the D-subunit Cdm1. Of the four Pol &#x003b4; subunits, only Cdm1 is non-essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Orthologues of all four of these proteins (Pol3, Cdc1, Cdc27 and Cdm1) make up mammalian Pol &#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, there have been few reports of physical interactions between the various polymerase enzymes believed to be present at the eukaryotic replication fork. One exception to this comes from large-scale functional analysis of the budding yeast proteome where an interaction was uncovered between the catalytic subunit of the Pol &#x003b1;-primase complex, Pol1, and the C-subunit of the Pol &#x003b4; complex in budding yeast, Pol32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interaction between these proteins was detected using the two-hybrid system, raising the possibility that the interaction was not a direct one, but was instead mediated via a third protein factor or complex. Recently, the two-hybrid result was independently confirmed and a direct interaction between the budding yeast Pol &#x003b1;-primase and Pol &#x003b4; demonstrated by mixing of the purified enzyme complexes followed by co-immunoprecipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. By this method, Pol &#x003b1;-primase and Pol &#x003b4; were shown interact in a Pol32-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A form of Pol &#x003b4; containing a mutant Pol32 protein lacking a 40 amino acid region of the C-terminal domain (Pol32-8, lacking amino acids 270&#x02013;309) was also shown to be unable to co-immunoprecipitate with Pol &#x003b1;-primase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], providing the first indication of the location of the Pol &#x003b1; binding site on Pol32.</p><p>In this paper, it is shown that the orthologues of the budding yeast Pol1 and Pol32 proteins in fission yeast, Pol1 and Cdc27 respectively, also interact in the two-hybrid system. It is also shown that these proteins are capable of interacting directly with one another, <italic>in vitro</italic>, using purified recombinant proteins and peptides. Interaction is also seen between the human Cdc27 and Pol1 homologues, p66 and p180. The binding site for Pol1 maps to the extended C-terminal domain of the Cdc27 protein and requires the presence of a short protein sequence motif, which we have designated the DPIM, for DNA polymerase interaction motif. This short sequence is conserved in Cdc27 orthologues from a wide variety of eukaryotic species. Despite this evolutionary conservation, mutational inactivation of the Pol1 binding motif does not affect Cdc27 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. The implications of these results are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Interaction between fission yeast Pol1 and Cdc27</title><p>To test for interaction between fission yeast Pol1 and Cdc27, the two-hybrid system was used. Full-length Cdc27 fused to the activation domain (AD) of the yeast Gal4 protein was tested for its ability to interact with amino acids 278&#x02013;527 of fission yeast Pol1 fused to the DNA binding domain of the bacterial transcription factor LexA (see Materials and methods for details). Amino acids 278&#x02013;527 correspond to the smallest region of budding yeast Pol1 shown to interact with Pol32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Reporter gene induction, measured by &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity assay, was observed in the presence of the Gal4 AD-Cdc27 and LexA-Pol1-278-527 (LexA-Pol1) proteins, but not when either protein alone was present (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1A</xref>, upper part). Thus, as in budding yeast, the catalytic subunit of Pol &#x003b1; is able to interact with the C-subunit of Pol &#x003b4;.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of the Pol1 interaction site on Cdc27 using the two-hybrid system. </bold>Full-length and thirteen truncated Cdc27 proteins, expressed as Gal4 transcription activation domain fusions, were tested for their ability to interact with Cdc1-LexA, Pcn1-LexA and Pol1(278&#x02013;512)-LexA baits in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>CTY10-5d.

Cdc1 binds within the globular 160 amino acid N-terminal domain of the 372 amino acid Cdc27 protein, whereas PCNA binds at the extreme C-terminus of Cdc27 at a conserved p21<sup>Cip1</sup>-like PCNA binding sequence, the PIP box. To map the Pol1 binding site, a series of thirteen truncated Cdc27 proteins fused to the Gal4 AD were tested against LexA-Pol1 in the two-hybrid system. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Pol1 binds within the extended C-terminal domain of Cdc27, with the smallest construct capable of binding spanning a forty amino acid region, from amino acids 293&#x02013;332. Therefore, the Pol1 binding region is distinct from both the globular N-terminal domain and C-terminal PIP box. In support of this, two-hybrid analysis showed that Cdc27 could bind to both Pol1 and Pcn1 (PCNA) proteins simultaneously: Gal4 AD-Pcn1 and LexA-Pol1 fusion proteins (which do not interact in the two-hybrid system) could be brought together by co-expression of Cdc27 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1A</xref>, lower part).</p></sec><sec><title>Cdc27-Pol1 interactions with recombinant proteins</title><p>In order to test whether the interaction between Pol1 and Cdc27 was a direct one, purified recombinant Cdc27 and Pol1 proteins were assayed for their ability to interact <italic>in vitro</italic>.

In each mutant protein one or more conserved amino acids is replaced with alanine. For example, the Cdc27-P1 mutant sees the conserved triplet DEE (residues 309&#x02013;311) substituted with AAA.

Removal of fifty amino acids from the N-terminus, or twenty amino acids from the C-terminus, of the Pol1 (278&#x02013;527) protein was found to abolish the interaction with Cdc27 altogether (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1D</xref>).</p><p>Previously, the isolation of a temperature-sensitive mutant <italic>pol1 </italic>allele, <italic>pol1-ts13</italic>, had been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

Understanding how the four subunits of the complex interact with one another, and how they interact with other components of the replication machinery, is an important goal. Once interactions are identified and the sites of interaction precisely mapped, reverse genetic analysis allows determination of the effects of disrupting individual protein-protein interactions on replisome function.</p><p>In this paper we show that the C-subunit of fission yeast Pol &#x003b4;, Cdc27, is able to interact both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>with Pol1, the catalytic subunit of Pol &#x003b1;. The Pol1 binding site on Cdc27 has been mapped by <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>approaches and a region of 40 amino acids, from amino acids 293 &#x02013; 332, has been shown to be sufficient for binding. Protein sequence alignments of Cdc27 homologues across this 40 amino acid region identify a short protein sequence motif (D -- G --VT) that is highly conserved and which is essential for Pol1 binding. This DNA polymerase interaction motif (DPIM) is flanked by relatively highly charged sequences. Ten basic amino acids are found flanking the DPIM in the fission yeast Cdc27 protein sequence, nine of which are located N-terminal to the central conserved motif. Similarly, there are ten acidic amino acids, all of which lie either within the conserved DPIM or C-terminal to it. Our mutagenesis data clearly implicates several of these charged groups in the binding to Pol1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Secondary structure predictions suggest that the conserved DPIM is likely to form a turn or loop, raising the possibility that the sequences on either side of the conserved motif interact with one another. The distribution of positively and negatively charged amino acids in most, though not all, of the Cdc27 homologues in other species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is similar to that in fission yeast. The most obvious exception to this is in the <italic>C. albicans </italic>Cdc27 protein, where six acidic amino acids are found N-terminal, and seven basic amino acids C-terminal, to the DPIM. This organisation of charged residues appears again to be compatible with the notion the sequences on either side of the DPIM may interact with one another.</p><p>The Cdc27 protein has an elongated shape, with a frictional ratio of 1.85 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The same is true of its budding yeast orthologue Pol32 which has a frictional ratio of 2.22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The elongated shape of Cdc27 is due to the C-terminal region of the protein. The N-terminal Cdc1 binding domain, comprising amino acids 1&#x02013;160 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], behaves in solution as a globular protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The protein-protein interaction motif described in this study is the second to be mapped to the extended C-terminal domain. Previously we showed that Cdc27 interacts with PCNA via a conserved sequence at the extreme C-terminus of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Our results indicated that this interaction was essential for cell viability. Consistent with this, Cdc27-PCNA contact is vital for maximal polymerase processivity <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, recently we obtained evidence that the Cdc27-PCNA interaction is a non-essential one (H. Tanaka, G. Ryu, Y.-S. Seo and S.M., submitted).</p><p>Recently, the results of a deletion analysis of Pol32, the budding yeast orthologue of Cdc27, were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], including analysis of Pol32-Pol1 interaction. The results of these studies showed that amino acids 270&#x02013;309 of Pol32 were required for Pol1 binding in the two-hybrid system. This region corresponds to amino acids 286&#x02013;325 in fission yeast Cdc27 and includes the conserved DPIM sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Deletion of amino acids 250&#x02013;289 (266&#x02013;305 in Cdc27) greatly reduced Pol1 binding, consistent with the results reported here with the Cdc27-P3, -P4 and -P5 mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), as did deleting amino acids 310&#x02013;343 (326&#x02013;363), consistent with the Cdc27-P7 mutant result. (As expected, the latter Pol32 deletion also disrupted binding to PCNA.) In addition, it was shown that that Pol &#x003b1;-primase and Pol &#x003b4; could be co-immunoprecipitated following mixing of the purified complexes, but that this interaction was effectively abolished when Pol &#x003b4; contained the 270&#x02013;309 deletion of Pol32 rather than the full-length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, cells expressing the DPIM mutant protein Cdc27-Q1 were shown to be no more sensitive then wild-type to HU, MMS, CPT, UV and BMS (see Results), while analysis of budding yeast cells expressing Pol32 lacking the DPIM (270&#x02013;309 deletion) showed them to be no more sensitive than wild-type to HU and UV, and to show normal rates of mutagenesis following UV exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Indeed, in all situations examined, <italic>S. pombe cdc27-Q1 </italic>cells were indistinguishable from wild-type. No genetic interactions were observed between <italic>cdc27-Q1 </italic>and various other DNA replication or checkpoint mutants, including the key checkpoint kinase Rad3.</p><p>In conclusion, while the interaction between Pol &#x003b1;-primase and Pol &#x003b4; mediated via Cdc27 could play an important role in coordinating the events of lagging strand synthesis, we have yet to obtain any evidence that this is the case. This raises two possibilities. First, that the observed interaction does not play an important role in chromosomal replication. We believe that this is unlikely to be the case, given the high degree of conservation of the DPIM sequence across evolution, in a region of the Cdc27 protein that is very poorly conserved at the primary sequence level. The second possibility is that there are multiple redundant interactions within the lagging strand machinery. In this case, an important role for the Cdc27-Pol1 interaction might only be uncovered when another protein-protein interaction is perturbed, in which case, the <italic>cdc27-Q1 </italic>mutation might be expected to be synthetically lethal or sick with a mutant that disrupted the overlapping redundant function. With the genetic tools available in yeast, this is a hypothesis that is readily testable.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In fission yeast, interaction between Pol &#x003b1; and Pol &#x003b4; is mediated, at least in part, by direct binding of the Pol &#x003b4; C-subunit Cdc27 to the Pol &#x003b1; catalytic subunit Pol1, and requires the presence of a short sequence motif (DPIM) in the C-terminal region of Cdc27.

The 763 bp BamHI fragment was then transferred to pBTM116, to generate pBTM116-Pol1(278&#x02013;527).

Plasmids expressing C-terminally truncated Pol1(278&#x02013;527) proteins were constructed by PCR amplification using oligo POL15 in conjunction with POL25-3 (5'-GTGTGGTTTG<underline>GGATCC</underline>TAAGGACCCATAACTCTTCTACT-3'), POL13-487 (5'-GTGTGGTTTG<underline>GGATCC</underline>TAAAAATTTGGTTGTTGTATTTT-3'), POL1-497 (5'-GTGTGGTTTG<underline>GGATCC</underline>TACCGGCACCAACTAGCATTTTT-3') or POL1-507 (5'-GTGTGGTTTG<underline>GGATCCT</underline>AGTTCTGAGGTGACGAACATCC-3'), cloning directly to pBTM116 following BamHI cleavage of the PCR product, and sequencing. The resulting constructs encoded the following proteins as Lex A fusions: Pol1(278&#x02013;477), Pol1(278&#x02013;487), Pol1(278&#x02013;497) and Pol1(278&#x02013;507).
