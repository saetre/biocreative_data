Inheritance may be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked recessive, and even among these genetic subtypes there is considerable genetic heterogeneity. Most progress has been made in identifying genes causing autosomal dominant and X-linked disease (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/retnet/">RetNet</ext-link>). In recessive RP, current genes account for only 50% of families in which retinal disease is the only manifestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>].</p><p>As part of a larger study investigating the genetic causes of RP and early onset retinal dystrophies, we used autozygosity mapping in two consanguineous families with autosomal recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa (arRP)to identify a common autozygous region on chromosome 10q. We subsequently identified null mutations in protocadherin-21 <italic>(PCDH21)</italic>, a photoreceptor-specific gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], as the cause of the retinal disease in these families.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Recruitment of families</title><p>Two families with an adult onset form of arRP were ascertained at our institution and pedigrees constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The first (family 1) was a two-generation consanguineous family of Middle-Eastern descent with 4 affected (2 male and 2 female) and two unaffected siblings. The affected individuals ranged in age from 32 to 42 years. The second (family 2) was a consanguineous family of South Asian descent with one affected male individual and three unaffected siblings. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants, and the study conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Two 10&#x000a0;ml EDTA tubes of peripheral venous blood were drawn from all available family members, including both affected and unaffected individuals, and samples were frozen. DNA was extracted using the Nucleon&#x02122; BACC-2 genomic DNA kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Following cell lysis, deproteinization was performed using sodium perchlorate. DNA extraction was achieved with chloroform and Nucleon&#x02122; resin before DNA recovery and washing.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The pedigrees of the two families that took part in the study (denoted family 1 and 2 in the text) are displayed.

DNA samples from all affected family members were genotyped using the Affymetrix human GeneChip&#x000ae; Mapping Array (version Xba142 2.0) for family 1 and the GeneChip&#x000ae; Human Mapping 100 K set array for family 2 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The detailed methodology for genotyping using the GeneChip&#x000ae; array has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Briefly, 250 ng of genomic DNA was digested with XbaI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 2 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, ligated with XbaI adaptors using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The ligation reaction was diluted in 1:4 (vol/vol) with molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l. Ten &#x000b5;l of the diluted ligation mix was used to setup selection by PCR (Fragment Selection by PCR) in triplicates. The pooled PCR products were purified using QIAGEN MinElute 96 UF plate (Qiagen, Duesseldorf, Germany). The concentration of PCR products was quantified using ND-1000 Nanodrop spectrometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Purified PCR product (90 ng) was fragmented with 0.25 units DNaseI ('Fragmentation Reagent'; Affymetrix), labeled with 'Labeling Regent' (Affymetrix). The labeling reaction (70&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l) was mixed with 190&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l hybridization reagent and denatured at 99&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10 min (all as detailed in the Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 100K Assay Manual). Finally the denatured hybridization mixture was injected into Affymetrix Human Mapping XbaI chips and incubated at 48&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 16 h, followed by automatic washing and staining in a Fluidics Station 450, and scanned by using the GeneChip&#x000ae; Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix). Primers for direct sequencing were as described by Bolz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. PCR amplification was performed using a 20-&#x000b5;l reaction mix, including Abgene Reddymix with or without dye (AB795, AB793; Abgene, Epsom, UK). Ten microliters of Reddymix was combined with 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of deionized water, 2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l (10 pmol) of forward and reverse primer, and 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l (50&#x02013;100 ng) of genomic DNA. All exons were optimized and amplified at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. DNA fragments were purified using Montage PCR cleanup plates, according to the standard protocol (Millipore, Watford, UK). PCR cleanup (purple plates) was performed using 15 &#x003bc;l of PCR product made up to 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l with deionized water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) and transferred to the purple plates. Ten min of vacuum was applied to the plates until the wells were empty. Twenty five &#x003bc;l of ddH<sub>2</sub>O was added to each well and a further 3 min vacuum was applied. Twenty &#x003bc;l of ddH<sub>2</sub>O was added to each well; the plate covered and vortexed at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. The remaining contents of each well (clean PCR product) was then transferred for storage. The Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing reaction was then performed using a 10-&#x000b5;l reaction mixture containing 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of BigDye v3.1 Applied Biosystems&#x02122; (ABI Ltd, Warrington, Cheshire. UK), 2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of PCR product, 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of 5 picomolar (pM) forward or reverse primer, 3.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of ddH<sub>2</sub>O, and 2.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of sequencing buffer (ABI Ltd) containing 5x Tris-HCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The sequencing reaction mixture was purified using the Montage sequence cleanup plate (Millipore, Watford, UK): 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of injection solution (Millipore,) were added to each well, and the total 35&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l was transferred to the blue plate and vacuumed for 3 min. A further 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of injection solution was added to each well and vacuumed again for 4 min. Twenty five &#x003bc;l of injection solution was again added to each well, the plate covered and vortexed for 10 min. The remaining volume was transferred to the sequencing plate and run on the ABI 3700 sequencer. The DNA sequence was analyzed using DNAStar&#x000ae; Inc. (Madison, WI). To check segregation of the mutant alleles with disease, restriction digests were performed. Family 1 was investigated using HaeIII enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>; New England Biolabs Ltd, NEB, Hitchin, Herts, UK), while in family 2 a digest using an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that carries the <italic>BglI</italic> gene from <italic>Bacillus globigii</italic> (Bg<italic>l</italic>I [NEB]) was performed. One unit (0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) of enzyme was combined with 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 1x NEBuffer 3 (NEB, Herts, UK), 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of PCR product and brought to a 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l reaction volume with deionized H2O (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) and digested for 16 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

Our study provides evidence that <italic>PCDH21</italic> is a rare cause of nonsyndromic RP.</p><p>The retinal phenotype is consistent in the two families with night vision loss in the late teenage years but relatively well preserved central vision until the late 30s. In the early 40s vision deteriorates markedly. There are characteristic circular patches of pigment epithelial atrophy both at the macula and in the periphery appearing late in the disease process. This atrophy of the RPE and inner choroid occurring together with photoreceptor dysfunction suggest that phagocytosis of abnormal outer segments of the mutant retina might have a toxic effect on the RPE. All affected individuals examined had severe color vision defects, and ERGs performed at the referring institution (family 1) and at our institution (family 2) revealed severe cone and rod degeneration; the youngest affected individual had a cone&#x02013;rod pattern of disease, suggesting that the earliest manifestation of mutations in <italic>PCDH21</italic>is a cone&#x02013;rod dystrophy.</p><p>In summary, we have identified two consanguineous families who have separate, novel, homozygous, frame-shifting deletions that result in stop mutations that would be expected to abrogate protein function and cause nonsense-mediated decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] of the transcribed RNA. The phenotype is of a retinal dystrophy that begins in late teenage years with nyctalopia and visual field defects and by the fourth decade results in significantly impaired central vision.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Mohamed F.
