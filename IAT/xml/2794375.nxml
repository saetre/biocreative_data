This polarization of flotillins appears specific for hematopoietic cells, as it is not observed in other, non-hematopoietic polarized cell types. Moreover, flotillins accumulated at the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) during immunological synapse formation concomitant with membrane ordering in these regions.

Do leukocytes prearrange certain molecules and machineries in a polarized fashion prior to the acquisition of polarized morphologies, or are extrinsic cues alone responsible to induce all events required for cellular polarization? Since chemokine induced polarization of leukocytes and synapse formation between lymphocytes typically occurs within seconds, existence of intrinsic cues for polarization cannot be ruled out.

However, no direct evidence for intrinsic asymmetry at a molecular level has been shown thus far. From our study we propose that cells of hematopoietic origin do possess intrinsic asymmetry of at least a subset of raft-associated proteins, in particular, flotillins.</p><p>Raft-associated proteins have been previously documented to translocate to uropod-like domains upon migration, as well as to the immune synapse during T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Manes3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Viola1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Giri1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, if one considers flotillins as raft-markers, it might not be surprising to find them in these domains. However, our studies show that flotillins, in contrast to membrane rafts, are preassembled prior to polarization and that could potentially contribute to the formation of uropods or IS upon extrinsic cues. If flotillin polarization during cell migration and activation were the mere consequence of raft coalescence, one would expect them to be enriched in the apical membrane of MDCK epithelial cells, as this compartment is a coalesced raft domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Simons1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. However, lack of any observable flotillin polarization in these cells rules out that flotillins are &#x0201c;passive&#x0201d; raft markers and suggests that they have a functional role in hematopoeitic cell polarization. The results presented here suggest that pre-assembled flotillin domains could act as a scaffold wherein rafts coalesce, and thereby contribute to the formation and maintenance of uropods. Similar observations of flotillin localization to uropods during polarization of neutrophils were recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Rossy1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, the authors report that in neutrophils, flotillins redistribute to uropods in a polarized manner only after stimulation with chemoattractant and that flotillins interact with PSGL-1 (P-selecting glycoprotein ligand -1) during polarization. Further work is needed to conclusiverly show if pre-assembled regions of flotillin are the sites of uropod formation. Several studies show that a complex restructuring of the leukocyte membrane takes place during migration enabling certain proteins to acquire raft affinity during polarization. Since raft association of flotillins remains unchanged during polarization process, these results show that the microenvironment in which flotillins reside is preserved during polarization while other signaling proteins such as PI3K undergo translocation to raft domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-GomezMouton2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results suggest that in resting cells, preassembled flotillin platforms serve as guidepost for the coalescence of uropod raft components thereby aiding in the uropod assembly.</p><p>How do flotillins acquire their asymmetry in resting cells? We have previously shown that flotillin polarization is acquired during cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Rajendran1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. During cell division in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and neurogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, cell fate determinants are asymmetrically distributed and maintained. Recent work shows that proteins that control asymmetric localization of cell fate determinants also control T cell polarity suggesting conserved mechanisms of polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Russell1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, antigen stimulated, mitotic T cells have been shown to asymmetrically distribute proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Russell1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence it is attractive to speculate that flotillins acquire their polarization during cell division and also maintain their polarized distribution thereafter. Basal PI3K activity (probably maintained through the serum factors) might also be essential for maintaining flotillin polarization in resting state as inhibition of PI3K activity abolishes the asymmetric localization of flotillins and chemokine-induced PI3K activity by establishing cytoskeletal rearrangements might also aid in stabilizing uropod localization of flotillins during polarization. Interestingly, treatment with cytochalasin D or Latrunculin B did not affect the asymmetric localization of flotillins in unstimulated cells suggesting that actin cytoskeleton does not play a major in maintaining the polarity of flotillins. (data not shown). However, actin destabilization clearly affected migration of CD34 positive cells and consequently the localization of flotillins to the uropod in the migrating cells. While actin is not required to maintain the intrinsic polarity of flotillins, migration induced uropod formation requires actin assembly. Whether pre-assembled polarized flotillin platforms give rise to uropods upon migratory cues or migratory cues enable floitllins to localize to newly formed uropods is still to be understood.</p><p>Additional mechanisms such as polarized endocytosis and exocytosis could also explain the maintenance of uropod localization of flotillins and other proteins.

Indeed inhibition of endocytosis dramatically reduced both flotillin polarity and migratory polarity (our unpublished observations). Elucidation of the exact mechanism by which pre-assembled flotillin platforms recruit certain raft associated proteins during activation, migration and signaling could provide insights into the raft-clustering induced polarization of leucocytes.</p><p>Since disturbances in membrane domain organization and membrane lipid homeostasis affect migration and homing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-GomezMouton1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-GomezMouton2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, study of mechanisms that control polarization could lend strategies for therapy.

In the same way, it is possible that interfering with flotillin polarization might affect uropod formation and be a way to reduce metastasis but achieving specificity could be a problem. Indeed high flotillin-2 expression has been shown to be associated with lymph node metastasis and melanoma progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Doherty1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Hazarika1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref> and expression of flotillin-1 and -2 was induced during G-CSF induced myeloid progenitor cell proliferation and granulocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-Iida1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. 5&#x02032;-flanking promoter region of flotillin-1 has shown to contain putative binding sequences for such as myeloid-specific transcription factors AML-1a and MZF-1/2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-LopezCasas1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings encourage a rigorous investigation of the role of flotillins in leukemia, specifically whether reduction in flotillin polarization reduces malignancy. As migratory polarity is intrinsically coupled with metastasis, one might expect that proteins/genes involved in polarization are upregulated during metastasis and targeting polarization processes might be of therapeutic interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and Reagents</title><p>Human peripheral T lymphocytes were isolated essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008290-delPozo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.
