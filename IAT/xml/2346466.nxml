We have used the sensory system of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo to shed light on the mechanism by which the L1-type cell adhesion molecule Neuroglian regulates axon growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have found a highly penetrant sensory axon stalling phenotype in <italic>neuroglian </italic>mutant embryos. Axons stalled at a variety of positions along their normal trajectory, but most commonly in the periphery some distance along the peripheral nerve. All lateral and dorsal cluster sensory neurons examined, except for the dorsal cluster neuron dbd, showed stalling. Sensory axons were never seen to project along inappropriate pathways in <italic>neuroglian </italic>mutants and stalled axons showed normal patterns of fasciculation within nerves. The growth cones of stalled axons possessed a simple morphology, similar to their appearance in wild-type embryos when advancing along nerves. Driving expression of the wild-type form of Neuroglian in sensory neurons alone rescued the <italic>neuroglian </italic>mutant phenotype of both pioneering and follower neurons. A partial rescue was achieved by expressing the Neuroglian extracellular domain. Over/mis-expression of Neuroglian in all neurons, oenocytes or trachea had no apparent effect on sensory axon growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that Neuroglian is necessary to maintain axon advance along axonal substrates, but is not required for initiation of axon outgrowth, axon fasciculation or recognition of correct growth substrates. Expression of Neuroglian in sensory neurons alone is sufficient to promote axon advance and the intracellular region of the molecule is largely dispensable for this function. It is unlikely, therefore, that Nrg acts as a molecular 'clutch' to couple adhesion of F-actin within the growth cone to the extracellular substrate. Rather, we suggest that Neuroglian mediates sensory axon advance by promoting adhesion of the surface of the growth cone to its substrate. Our finding that stalling of a pioneer sensory neuron is rescued by driving Neuroglian in sensory neurons alone may suggest that Neuroglian can act in a heterophilic fashion.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The growing axon is directed to its synaptic target by interactions between molecules on the surface of the growth cone and specific cues in its environment. Such molecular interactions either promote or inhibit the advance of the growth cone in a particular direction. A key element in models that seek to explain axon advance is the level of adhesion between the growth cone and its substrate. A large body of experimental data from both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>systems points to the important role that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play in the regulation of axon advance, fasciculation and turning (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]).</p><p>One of the best studied classes of CAMs is the L1-type family, represented in vertebrates by the four members L1, Neurofascin, Nr-CAM and CHL1. Invertebrate homologues of L1 proteins include the insect protein Neuroglian (Nrg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the leech protein Tractin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These molecules all share an extracellular region of six immunoglobulin-like domains, three to five Fibronectin type III domains and a single transmembrane domain. The cytoplasmic region contains ankyrin (FIGQY) and Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) binding motifs, which allow the molecule to link to spectrin and actin, respectively. Most members of the L1-type family mediate cell-cell adhesion <italic>in vitro </italic>by a homophilic mechanism, although heterophilic interactions have also been reported for some vertebrate L1-type members (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]).</p><p>The genetic tools available in <italic>Drosophila </italic>have been particularly useful in elucidating the roles played by L1-type CAMs in the regulation of axon growth <italic>in vivo </italic>and the molecular mechanisms underlying those functions. The fly genome contains only one member of this family, <italic>nrg</italic>, which undergoes alternative splicing to generate two transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These encode a short form of the protein, Nrg<sup>167</sup>, which is expressed widely on epidermis, muscle, glia and trachea, and a longer form, Nrg<sup>180</sup>, which is restricted to neurons. The two isoforms have identical extracellular and transmembrane regions and differ only in the carboxy-terminal ends of their cytoplasmic domains.</p><p>Nrg has been shown to regulate axon growth in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) during both embryonic and post-embryonic development of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Null <italic>nrg </italic>mutants display a highly penetrant motor axon stalling phenotype in the body wall of the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This phenotype, together with the normal Nrg expression pattern, suggests that Nrg mediates the recognition of target muscles by embryonic motor axons by a homophilic mechanism, although this hypothesis has not yet been formally tested.</p><p>Nrg is also involved in guidance of bristle mechanosensory (BM) and ocellar pioneer (OP) axons in the adult ocellar sensory system (OSS) of <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Ablation of Nrg function specifically in late larval stages with a temperature sensitive loss-of-function (LOF) allele results in several types of axon defects. These include abnormal growth of OP axons along the head epidermis, stalling or premature detachment of BM axons from the epidermis and failure of both OP and BM axons to project to the brain. The complexity of these mutant phenotypes suggests that Nrg plays multiple roles in axon guidance in this system, including promotion of axon advance, axon fasciculation and axon turning. However, the precise nature of those roles remains to be clarified. It is also unclear whether Nrg acts purely as a cell-cell adhesion molecule in this context and whether its effects are mediated by homophilic or heterophilic molecular interactions.</p><p>There are conflicting data as to whether the intracellular domain of Nrg is necessary to mediate the effects of this molecule on axon growth. Expressing an artificial, glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI)-anchored form of Nrg in wing sensory neurons and their epidermal substrate can generate the same gain-of-function phenotypes as the full length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that only the extracellular portion of Nrg is essential for its function in this system. On the other hand, Nrg<sup>167</sup>, which has an identical extracellular region to Nrg<sup>180</sup>, fails to rescue OSS axon defects in the <italic>nrg </italic>LOF mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This result suggests that the intracellular Nrg region does play an important role in the regulation of axon growth.</p><p>Clearly, many questions remain concerning the mechanism of action of Nrg in the regulation of axon growth. We have chosen the sensory nervous system of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo as a model to further explore these issues. The cellular events underlying the peripheral growth of individual sensory axons are well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and several of the molecules involved in their guidance have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], providing us with an ideal opportunity to link molecular mechanisms of Nrg function to cellular outcomes. Studying the embryonic sensory system means that we can examine phenotypes in embryonic lethal, null <italic>nrg </italic>mutants, rather than studying adult phenotypes of hypomorphic or temperature sensitive mutants. This should provide us with a more reliable assessment of normal gene function. Our analysis shows that Nrg is essential for maintenance of sensory axon advance in the embryo, but not for correct axon fasciculation or pathfinding. The requirement for Neuroglian function in embryonic sensory neurons appears, therefore, to be less complex than in other contexts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Nrg expression is required in sensory neurons alone and the extracellular region of the molecule is at least partially able to perform this function. Our findings may also suggest that Nrg can promote sensory axon advance by a mechanism involving heterophilic molecular interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Nrg is required for maintenance of sensory axon advance</title><p>In this study, we have focused on the growth of axons from the dorsal and lateral sensory neuron clusters in abdominal segments A1 to A7. During normal development, sensory axons contact other sensory neurons or their axons shortly after emerging from the neuron cell body. The dorsal cluster axon fascicle initially grows internally to the transverse connective branch of the trachea, turns ventrally, joins the intersegmental nerve (ISN) in the dorsal body wall region and continues growing ventrally towards the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has previously been reported that the dorsal branch of the ISN is pioneered by the dorsal hair es neurons desA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, we find that when dbd and other dorsal cluster neurons are labeled with DiI in different hemisegments of the same embryo, dbd's axon has always advanced further along the ISN than other axons (Steinel and Whitington, unpublished observations). Lateral cluster axons fasciculate as they initially grow anteriorly, following the pioneering axon for the lateral cluster, lch5-1. They then turn internally along the spiracular branch of the trachea, fasciculate with efferent motor axons of the ISN and advance ventrally towards the CNS parallel to, but separated from, the dorsal cluster sensory fascicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. While v'ch1 lies in the lateral cluster, its axon follows a different path to the rest of these neurons: it initially grows ventrally to contact cell bodies of sensory neurons in the v' (ventral') cluster and follows their axon fascicle towards the CNS within the segmental nerve (SN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. SN axons converge with ISN axons at the edge of the ventral nerve cord. The sensory axonal pathways are summarized in schematic form in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>. After entering the CNS, sensory axons advance into the neuropile. The lateral cluster lch5 axons pause at this stage (early stage 16) and acquire a flattened growth cone morphology with multiple filopodia, before turning antero-posteriorly along the longitudinal connectives (LC). Sensory neurons of different modalities and from different positions in the body wall diverge and form specific central arborization patterns within the neuropile. These specific sensory projections have been established by stages 16&#x02013;17, depending on the neuron type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b&#x02013;d</xref> shows the mature embryonic projections of the lateral cluster neuron lch5-5, the v'ch1 neuron and the dorsal cluster neuron dbd, as revealed by single neuron, juxtacellular staining with DiI.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Axon morphology of sensory neurons in wild-type <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo. <bold>(a) </bold>Diagram of the pathways and substrates followed by sensory axons in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo.

While there is some normal variability in the timing of axon growth, all of the identified sensory neurons we examined have entered the neuropile and begun to form terminal arborizations by mid-stage 16 in 100% of wild-type embryos (n = 19 for lch5-1, 27 for lch5-5, 19 for v'ch1, and 8 for dbd). Sensory neurons showed a highly penetrant axon stalling defect in <italic>nrg </italic>mutant embryos. Axons were judged to have stalled if they had not entered the neuropile. Stalled axons consistently showed a simple morphology, terminating in the nerve with a simple, club-shaped growth cone with, at most, one or two projecting filopodia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b&#x02013;g</xref>).

Axons seldom stalled before entry into the ISN: Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref> shows an example of such an early lch5-3 stall. Most lateral cluster axon stalls occurred in the periphery some distance along the peripheral nerve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a&#x02013;c</xref>), but in a number of cases axons stalled just before they entered the CNS or shortly after entry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,d</xref>). Dorsal cluster axon stalls occurred most frequently just before entry to the CNS. The location of axon stalls did not obviously correlate with the position of nerve branches or other structural features. The inherent variability in the stalling point is highlighted by the observation that adjacent neurons of the same lch5 cluster can stall at very different points along the nerve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f,g</xref>).</p><p>We injected a range of identified lateral and dorsal cluster sensory neurons, including the five lateral chordotonal neurons lch5-1 to lch5-5, v'ch1, lesB, ldaA, ldaB, dbd as well as other cells in the lateral and dorsal clusters that could not be unambiguously identified at the individual neuron level.

Stalled sensory axons in the mutant showed the same close association with ISN motor axons and separation from dorsal sensory axons (0.5&#x02013;1.0 &#x003bc;m) as seen in wild-type embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,d,i</xref>).

Sensory axon stalling defects were not evident in embryos stained with mAb22C10 alone (as has been noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), presumably because individual sensory axons stall at different, variable locations rather than consistently at particular sites along the nerve. The relative timing of axon outgrowth from lateral cluster neurons, as assayed by mAb22C10 immuno-staining, is also unaffected by loss of <italic>nrg </italic>function: as in wild-type embryos, lch5-1 is the pioneer for the lateral cluster fascicle in <italic>nrg</italic><sup>14 </sup>mutants (in 24/24 hemisegments, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2k</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Nrg in sensory neurons is sufficient to rescue the <italic>nrg </italic>LOF phenotype</title><p>During embryogenesis, Nrg shows a widespread pattern of expression.

This defect is displayed by all neurons examined, except for the dorsal cluster neuron, dbd, which apparently leads other dorsal cluster axons as it grows along the ISN into the CNS. The fact that this pioneering neuron is unaffected by loss of <italic>nrg </italic>function may suggest that Nrg is necessary for axon advance only along axonal substrates. This idea is supported by our observation that lateral cluster axons in <italic>nrg </italic>mutants almost always advance successfully along their initial non-neuronal growth substrate, the spiracular branch of the trachea, and stall only after they have subsequently joined the ISN.</p><p>As sensory axons in <italic>nrg </italic>mutants generally advance for some distance along nerves before stalling, Nrg is apparently required to maintain axon growth along axonal substrates, rather than to initiate it. Most axon stalls occur in the periphery, but their locations are quite variable and do not obviously coincide with particular structures, such as nerve branches, pointing to a stochastic component in the stalling process.</p><p>Stalled sensory axons in <italic>nrg </italic>mutants are always found in their correct nerve pathways. The absence of axon misprojection phenotypes shows that Nrg is not necessary for recognition of correct growth substrates by sensory axons.</p><p>We also observed that sensory axons in <italic>nrg </italic>mutants fasciculate normally with other axons. The simple growth cone morphology of the stalled axons &#x02013; club-shaped with few filopodia &#x02013; is similar to that seen in wild-type sensory axons when they are growing along nerves. These observations show that Nrg is not necessary for axon-axon fasciculation in this system. The Ig-CAM Fasciclin2 (Fas2) is a key regulator of motor axon fasciculation in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and also acts redundantly to Nrg in the regulation of OP axon growth in the adult OSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, Fas2 is unlikely to be acting redundantly with Nrg in regulating sensory axon fasciculation in the embryo, as embryonic sensory axons do not express Fas2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, the pattern of 22C10 sensory nerve staining is normal in <italic>fas2 </italic>LOF mutants and in embryos over/misexpressing Fas2 in sensory neurons and their growth substrates (Steinel and Whitington, unpublished observations). Whether Nrg acts redundantly with some other CAM to mediate sensory axon fasciculation remains to be determined.</p><p>The sensory axon defects seen in <italic>nrg </italic>mutant embryos are similar to those reported for motor axons, although motor axons stall at a later stage of growth, close to their synaptic targets, the body wall muscles, and unlike sensory axons, some motor axons misproject in <italic>nrg </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The <italic>nrg </italic>LOF phenotype in the embryonic sensory system is much more stereotypic than in the adult OSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This difference may indicate that Nrg performs more diverse functions in the adult OSS, including regulation of axon fasciculation and guidance in addition to axon advance.</p><p>While Nrg is expressed in both sensory axons and several of their growth substrates, including trachea and motor axons, our mutant rescue experiments demonstrate that expression in sensory axons alone is sufficient to mediate their advance. It is unlikely, therefore, that the sensory axon defects are secondary to other known morphological defects in <italic>nrg </italic>mutants, such as motor axon stalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or failure of glial cell ensheathment of peripheral nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>An important, unresolved question is whether the effects of Nrg on axon growth are mediated by homophilic interactions between Nrg on the growth cone and its substrate or whether heterophilic interactions are involved. Substrate-bound Nrg has been shown to promote neurite extension from Nrg-expressing neurons <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but it is unclear whether the same holds true <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have shown that expression of Nrg in sensory neurons completely rescues the axon stalling phenotype of lch5-1 seen in <italic>nrg </italic>mutants. In wild-type embryos and in <italic>nrg </italic>mutants, lch5-1 is the pioneer for the lateral cluster fascicle and associates with motor axons, rather than dorsal cluster sensory axons as it grows towards the CNS. Our lch5-1 mutant rescue findings might suggest, therefore, that Nrg is acting in a heterophilic fashion to promote advance of this axon. This conclusion rests upon the assumption that, in <italic>nrg </italic>mutant embryos in which the lch5-1 stall phenotype has been rescued, the lch5-1 growth cone does not employ the dorsal sensory axons as a growth substrate as it advances along the ISN. Observations of the dynamics of lch5-1 growth cone activity, and its association with sensory and motor axons in the ISN as it advances along the nerve in these rescued embryos, would help to resolve this question.</p><p>Our mutant rescue experiments show that the intracellular region of Nrg is largely dispensable for its role in promoting sensory axon advance. It has long been known that Nrg-mediated cell-cell adhesion does not require the intracellular region of the molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, mutation of the intracellular ankyrin-binding domain of L1-type CAMs does have clear effects on their membrane mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and their coupling to retrograde actin flow in growth cones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Given the linkage between ankyrins and the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton, this has led to suggestions that L1-type CAMs may transmit traction force generated by actin flow to the extracellular substrate, as posited by the 'molecular clutch' hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The recent finding that mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of the ankyrin-binding site regulates neurite growth from cerebellar granule neurons on a Ng-CAM coated substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] highlights the potential importance of the intracellular region of L1-type CAMs in mediating their effects on axon growth. However, this view is difficult to reconcile with our current results. One possible explanation is that the <italic>in vitro </italic>models used in most vertebrate studies to date do not accurately reflect the <italic>in vivo </italic>functions of L1-type CAMs. Alternatively, Nrg, the <italic>Drosophila </italic>L1 homologue, may function differently to vertebrate L1-type CAMs in promoting axon growth.</p><p>Our finding that the intracellular region of Nrg is not essential for its ability to promote sensory axon advance raises the question of how Nrg-mediated adhesion of the growth cone to its substrate is coupled to retrograde F-actin flow. Current models assume that such a coupling provides the motive force for growth cone advance. One possibility is that Nrg interacts in <italic>cis </italic>with another receptor or CAM, which in turn is coupled to the cytoskeleton of the growth cone. A genetic screen, using the sensory axon stalling phenotype described in our study as an assay, would be one way of identifying such a Nrg-interacting molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results suggest that Nrg may mediate sensory axon advance along nerves in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo by promoting adhesion between the surface of the growth cone and its axonal substrates. This adhesive interaction is likely to involve a heterophilic interaction between Nrg on the growth cone and some other, as yet unidentified molecule, on the substrate. Intracellular signaling by the Nrg molecule does not appear to be essential for its function in this context. Our findings for Nrg are mirrored by the recent discovery that the adhesive, rather than the signaling activity, of another CAM, <italic>Drosophila </italic>N-cadherin, is essential for its role in target selection of photoreceptor afferents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila </italic>stocks</title><p>All stocks were raised on standard cornmeal and sugar medium.
