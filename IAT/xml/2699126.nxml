During onset of autoimmunity, dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to be critical for priming of self-reactive T cells that have escaped tolerance induction. However, because DCs can also induce T cell tolerance, it remains unclear whether DCs are required under steady-state conditions to prevent autoimmunity. To address this question, we crossed CD11c-Cre mice with mice that express diphtheria toxin A (DTA) under the control of a loxP-flanked neomycin resistance (neo<sup>R</sup>) cassette from the ROSA26 locus. Cre-mediated removal of the neo<sup>R</sup> cassette leads to DTA expression and constitutive loss of conventional DCs, plasmacytoid DCs, and Langerhans cells. These DC-depleted (&#x00394;DC) mice showed increased frequencies of CD4 single-positive thymocytes and infiltration of CD4 T cells into peripheral tissues. They developed spontaneous autoimmunity characterized by reduced body weight, splenomegaly, autoantibody formation, neutrophilia, high numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells, and inflammatory bowel disease. Pathology could be induced by reconstitution of wild-type (WT) mice with bone marrow (BM) from &#x00394;DC mice, whereas mixed BM chimeras that received BM from &#x00394;DC and WT mice remained healthy. This demonstrates that DCs play an essential role to protect against fatal autoimmunity under steady-state conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The adaptive immune system can respond to a huge variety of pathogens as a result of a broad repertoire of antigen receptors on T and B cells generated by genomic recombination during development of these cells. To avoid autoimmune reactions, self-reactive lymphocytes have to be deleted or rendered tolerant. Normal polyclonal and self-tolerant T cell repertoires depend on positive and negative selection of developing T cells in the thymus. Positive selection is mediated by thymic cortical epithelial cells, whereas negative selection can occur in the cortex or in the medulla and is induced by both BM&#x02013;derived cells and medullary thymic epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). It has been demonstrated that thymic DCs are very efficient in mediating negative selection of developing thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Furthermore, peripheral DCs can migrate to the thymus and contribute to negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, because B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), and perhaps other cells of hematopoietic origin, could also be involved in negative selection, it remains unclear whether a selective lack of DCs would result in impaired clonal deletion and release of self-reactive T cells into the periphery. Self-reactive T cells that escaped clonal deletion in the thymus need to be further controlled by peripheral tolerance mechanisms to prevent tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Under steady-state conditions, DCs are thought to play an important role in peripheral tolerance induction by various mechanisms, including production of soluble factors like IL-10, TGF-&#x003b2; or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), induction of T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), and initiation of abortive T cell proliferation resulting in clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether DCs are required to protect from spontaneous onset of autoimmunity. To address this important question, we generated constitutively DC-depleted mice. These mice rapidly developed spontaneous autoimmunity, which demonstrates for the first time that DCs are essential to maintain a self-tolerant immune system.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Efficient ablation of DCs in CD11c-Cre/R&#x02013;diptheria toxin A (DTA) mice</title><p>To determine the role of DCs for maintenance of self-tolerance, we bred mice that selectively express the Cre recombinase in DCs (CD11c-Cre mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) with a strain carrying the diphtheria toxin &#x003b1; chain (DTA) under control of a loxP-flanked stop cassette in the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 locus (R-DTA mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). As a consequence, DTA is expressed directly in DCs causing their constitutive elimination.</p><p>CD11c-Cre/R-DTA mice (&#x00394;DC mice, for short) lack &#x0003e;90% of DCs in thymus, spleen, and LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Ablation affected all major DC subsets, including myeloid, lymphoid, and plasmacytoid DCs, whereas the recently described interferon-producing killer DC population (IKDC; CD11c<sup>lo</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Furthermore, only few remaining Langerhans cells were detectable in epidermal sheaths of the ear from &#x00394;DC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). DCs can efficiently present foreign antigens and prime naive T cells. To determine whether &#x00394;DC mice are impaired in generating a primary immune response, we analyzed the efficiency of CD4 T cell priming in &#x00394;DC mice by adoptive transfer of OVA-specific TCR transgenic CD4 T cells (OT-II) followed by vaccination with MVA-OVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), a modified vaccinia virus Ankara which encodes chicken ovalbumin complementary DNA. At the peak of T cell expansion, 4 d after vaccination, total cell counts of transferred OT-II cells in the spleen of &#x00394;DC mice were fourfold lower as compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In addition, OT-II cells in &#x00394;DC mice were only partially activated, which is indicated by inefficient down-regulation of the surface marker CD62L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Low expansion of OT-II cells was also observed when DC-depleted OT-II cells were transferred, indicating that remaining DCs or other APCs were able to induce a weak CD4 T cell proliferation (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082394/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082394/DC1</ext-link>). Indeed, purified B cells, macrophages, or deletion-resistent DCs were all able to stimulate OT-II cell proliferation in vitro (Fig. S2). We further observed only a weak OVA-specific response of CD8 T cells upon MVA-OVA immunization of &#x00394;DC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). To determine the requirement of DCs for generation of an efficient immune response against gastrointestinal nematodes, we infected &#x00394;DC mice with the helminth <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>. Adult worms were efficiently cleared from WT mice, whereas &#x00394;DC mice could not eliminate the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>-infected &#x00394;DC mice showed impaired recruitment of eosinophils to the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). These immunization and infection experiments clearly demonstrate that DCs are required for efficient priming of naive T cells and execution of protective immune responses, which is consistent with their role as major APCs of the immune system. Next, we addressed the question of whether DCs are required for maintenance of immunological tolerance against self-antigens.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Efficiency of DC depletion in &#x00394;DC mice.</bold> (A) Single cell suspensions of thymus (TH), spleen (SP), and mesenteric LN from &#x00394;DC and control mice were stained for CD11c and MHC class II (I-A<sup>b</sup>).

To determine whether the reduced number of DCs in &#x00394;DC mice results in impaired negative selection, we analyzed the frequency of different thymocyte populations in &#x00394;DC and control mice. &#x00394;DC mice showed 30% higher frequencies and total numbers of CD4 single-positive (SP) thymocytes, whereas CD8 SP cells were not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>; and Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082394/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082394/DC1</ext-link>). The TCR expression level on SP thymocytes was comparable between &#x00394;DC and control mice (Fig. S3). Furthermore, the expression levels of CD5, CD24, and CD69 on CD4 or CD8 SP thymocytes were comparable between &#x00394;DC and control mice, indicating normal thymocyte maturation (unpublished data). The increase of CD4 SP cells was not a result of recirculation of peripheral CD4 T cells because &#x00394;DC mice showed no significant increase of Qa2<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>lo</sup> cells (Fig. S4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). We generated BM chimeras to determine whether the increased frequency of CD4 SP cells is linked to hematopoietic cells and whether it can be prevented by coadministration of BM from WT mice. Lethally irradiated WT mice received either BM from &#x00394;DC mice or WT mice (single chimeras) or a 1:1 mixture of BM from &#x00394;DC and WT donors (mixed chimeras). 9 wk after reconstitution, the frequency of CD4 SP cells in &#x00394;DC&#x02192;WT chimeras was 21%, as compared with 11% in mixed &#x00394;DC + WT&#x02192;WT chimeras or WT&#x02192;WT chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The ratio of CD4 SP/CD8 SP thymocytes was significantly increased in &#x00394;DC mice and &#x00394;DC&#x02192;WT chimeras as compared with WT mice or mixed chimeras (Fig. S5). This supports the concept that DCs contribute mainly to clonal deletion of CD4 but not CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), although thymic epithelial cells can also mediate negative selection of both T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>T cell development in &#x00394;DC mice.</bold> (A and B) Frequency of SP thymocytes in &#x00394;DC mice (filled bars) compared with controls (open bars).

To this end, CD11c-Cre mice on C57BL/6 background were crossed once with R-DTA mice on a BALB/c background carrying the endogenous retroviruses Mtv-6, 8, and 9, which encode sAgs that cause deletion of V&#x003b2;3<sup>+</sup> (Mtv-6) or V&#x003b2;11<sup>+</sup>/V&#x003b2;12<sup>+</sup> (Mtv-8/9) thymocytes. Because only Mtv-6 is expressed by thymic DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), we expected impaired deletion of V&#x003b2;3<sup>+</sup> CD4 SP thymocytes in &#x00394;DC mice, whereas deletion of V&#x003b2;11<sup>+</sup> and V&#x003b2;12<sup>+</sup> thymocytes should not be affected. Indeed, &#x0223c;60% of V&#x003b2;3<sup>+</sup> CD4 SP cells was deleted in DC-sufficient mice whereas only 25% was deleted in &#x00394;DC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). In contrast, negative selection of Mtv-8/9&#x02013;responsive V&#x003b2;11<sup>+</sup> and V&#x003b2;12<sup>+</sup> cells appeared to be DC independent. It has been estimated that 50&#x02013;60% of initially positively selected CD4 T cells are subsequently deleted by hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). As we detected only a 30% increase of CD4 SP cells in &#x00394;DC mice, it remains possible that other cell types, including thymic B cells, also participate in negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We found no difference in the frequency of natural T reg cells in the thymus of &#x00394;DC mice as compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>), which supports previous observations demonstrating that intrathymic natural T reg cell development occurs independently of MHC class II expression on BM-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>&#x00394;DC mice develop severe pathology</title><p>&#x00394;DC mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio but they appeared smaller in size, had a hunched posture, and their body weight was reduced by &#x0223c;30% as compared with controls at 6 wk of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). 40% of the mice died within 8 wk of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

However, the number of F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages was increased twofold and Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells increased more than 20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>).

Analysis of the TCR-V&#x003b2; repertoire revealed no major differences between &#x00394;DC and control mice, which demonstrates that the effector T cell populations in &#x00394;DC mice did not result from oligoclonal T cell expansion (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082394/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082394/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotype of T cells in &#x00394;DC mice.</bold> (A) Frequency of activated (CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) T cells in the spleen of indicated mice.

The frequency of T reg cells among total lymphocytes in the small intestine was increased in &#x00394;DC as compared with control mice and, therefore, the inflammatory immune response does not seem to be caused by a local lack of T reg cells in &#x00394;DC mice (Fig. S8, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082394/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082394/DC1</ext-link>). We also observed a significant reduction of CD8 T cells in the small intestine of &#x00394;DC mice, which could at least partially be explained by infiltration of large numbers of CD4 T cells resulting in a relative decrease of other lymphocyte populations. In addition, DCs in the small intestine might be required for survival or recruitment of CD8 T cells. Increased CD4 T cell infiltration was also observed in single &#x00394;DC&#x02192;WT BM chimeras as compared with mixed &#x00394;DC + WT&#x02192;WT BM chimeras, providing further evidence that DCs are required to prevent spontaneous CD4 T cell activation and infiltration of peripheral tissues (Fig. S9).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Infiltration of CD4 T cells in peripheral organs.</bold> (A and B) Frequency of CD4 and CD8 T cells in indicated organs of 6&#x02013;8-wk-old &#x00394;DC or control mice.

To determine whether a similar activation of the humoral immune response occurred in &#x00394;DC mice despite the near complete ablation of DCs, we measured the concentration of immunoglobulin isotypes in the serum. All isotypes were elevated with the largest increase observed for IgM and IgG2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). To determine whether &#x00394;DC mice generated autoantibodies, we performed Western blot analysis where protein extracts from kidney, liver, and spleen of Rag-deficient mice was probed with serum from four individual &#x00394;DC mice and one negative littermate as control. Several distinct bands could be observed that varied between different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Individual mice showed only partially overlapping patterns, indicating that autoantigens from individual mice recognized different self-antigens. Staining of HEp-2 cells with serum from &#x00394;DC and control mice revealed the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) in &#x00394;DC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). To further define whether ANAs from individual mice recognize different nuclear antigens, we stained tissue sections from the liver of Rag-deficient mice with sera from &#x00394;DC mice. We observed a variety of staining patterns of subnuclear structures with sera from individual mice, which complements the result of the Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Because intestinal inflammation was observed in most &#x00394;DC mice, we further analyzed the staining pattern of autoantibodies directed against intestinal antigens. Tissue sections from the small intestine of Rag-deficient mice were stained with serum from three individual &#x00394;DC mice. The sera stained either nuclei (mouse #1), the lamina propria (mouse #2), or the epithelial layer (mouse #3), whereas no staining was observed with serum from negative littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Collectively, &#x00394;DC mice generated a variety of autoantibodies directed against nuclear and tissue-specific antigens with specificities that differed between individual mice.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Hyperimmunoglobulinemia and autoantibodies in &#x00394;DC mice.</bold> (A) Immunoglobulin isotype concentrations in the serum of &#x00394;DC mice (filled bars) or controls (open bars). <italic>n</italic> = 5 from two independent experiments.

It seems counterintuitive that lack of DCs, the most potent APC type, results in autoimmunity. Indeed, transiently DC-depleted adult mice have not been reported to develop such pathological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), which suggests that either presence of DCs in the young animal is sufficient to promote long-term immune tolerance or that spontaneous priming and expansion of self-reactive T cells in the periphery can only occur when DCs are depleted for a prolonged period of time. The same strain of CD11cCre mice that we used in this study to generate &#x00394;DC mice has also been crossed to another strain of conditional ROSA26-DTA mice that encodes DTA and the neomycin resistance gene behind a loxP-flanked LacZ cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). These mice developed a myeloid proliferative syndrome indicated by an increased frequency of Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells in a manner similar to that in &#x00394;DC mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). However, they remained healthy and no signs of autoimmunity were reported. This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the fact that plasmacytoid DCs and Langerhans cells were not ablated in these mice so that immune tolerance may still be functional. Both plasmacytoid DCs and Langerhans cells have been shown to provide powerful tolerogenic signals to prevent activation of alloreactive or allergen-specific T cells, so it seems likely that they also control self-reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>).</p><p>Negative selection by DCs in the thymus is a very efficient process. Using reaggregate cultures, it has been demonstrated that central tolerance against alloantigens can be achieved by only one DC per 200 thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of peptide MHC-specific TCR transgenic cells was still efficient when the frequency of thymic APCs was lowered to &#x0223c;1% of normal numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Therefore, the potential requirement of DCs for negative selection can only be observed in mice with almost complete depletion of thymic DCs. The efficient ablation of thymic DCs in &#x00394;DC mice may result in release of autoreactive T cells into the periphery where they could be primed by the few remaining DCs or other APCs. Importantly, autoimmunity was not caused by unspecific DTA expression in nonhematopoietic cells or by bystander toxicity of DTA released from dieing DCs because autoimmunity could be induced by reconstitution of WT mice with BM from &#x00394;DC mice but not by cotransfer of BM from WT and &#x00394;DC mice. The role of DCs in regulation of autoimmunity remains controversial. It has been shown that extending the lifespan of DCs can also result in autoimmunity in some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) but not all transgenic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>).</p><p>Why does autoimmunity develop when the life span of DCs is shortened or prolonged? When DC life span is prolonged, they might increase their expression of costimulatory molecules which could lead to priming of self-reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Our results indicate that if DC life span is too short so that they cannot build up a normal-sized pool of DCs, tolerance induction of CD4 T cells is impaired. This can occur at two levels: in the thymus (impaired negative selection) and in the periphery (lack of tolerogenic DCs). We observed that &#x00394;DC mice have significantly more CD4 SP thymocytes as compared with control mice. In addition, &#x00394;DC mice show less efficient deletion by DC-restricted endogenous retroviral sAgs. Both observations are consistent with the view that DCs play an important role in negative selection of CD4 T cells. Mice that express MHC class II only on thymic cortical epithelial cells generate autoreactive CD4 T cells, yet these mice do not develop spontaneous autoimmunity as a result of lack of MHC class II expression on APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Transfer of these autoreactive T cells into nonirradiated WT mice results in only mild autoimmunity, which is different from the severe phenotype of &#x00394;DC mice we describe in this paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that in addition to their important role in negative selection, DCs might be required to maintain peripheral tolerance. This assumption is further supported by our recent observation that autoreactive T cells accumulated in mice with DCs that were defective for uptake of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>).</p><p>It remains unclear at the moment whether the activated CD4 T cells were primed by the few remaining DCs or by other hematopoietic MHC class II<sup>+</sup> APCs, such as B cells or macrophages, or whether they recognize MHC class II directly on tissue cells such as enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). This latter possibility might explain why the intestine is particularly vulnerable to fatal autoimmune attack. However, it also remains possible that the barrier function of the intestines is compromised in &#x00394;DC mice, which might result in a local inflammatory response by commensal gut flora and subsequently initiate autoimmunity. Marguerat et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>) have shown that ulcerative colitis develops in MHC class II KO&#x02192;WT BM chimeras at 6&#x02013;8 wk after reconstitution with heavy T cell infiltration into the lamina propria, which supports the possibility that antigen presentation by nonhematopoietic cells might be sufficient for priming of autoreactive T cells. In addition, conditional ablation of MHC class II in hematopoietic and endothelial cells resulted in a similar increase of CD4 SP thymocytes to that described in this paper for &#x00394;DC mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). However, peripheral T cells were not spontaneously activated, suggesting that priming of autoreactive T cells requires MHC class II expression on hematopoietic or endothelial cells.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that mice lacking integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>8</sub> on DCs have reduced frequencies of T reg cells in the colon and develop late onset of autoimmune colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Furthermore, depletion of T reg cells results in increased numbers and spontaneous activation of DCs under steady-state conditions and fatal autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). These results suggested that T reg cells prevent autoimmunity by modulation of DC activation. This model does not apply to the situation described in this paper because peripheral T reg cells were reduced only by 20&#x02013;30% in spleen and LNs of &#x00394;DC mice and autoimmunity developed despite (and as a result of) the absence of DCs. However, it remains possible that the repertoire of T reg cells is altered or that a critical subpopulation of T reg cells is missing in &#x00394;DC mice so that some autoreactive T cells may escape the control by T reg cells. The spontaneously autoreactive T cells observed in &#x00394;DC mice illustrate that DCs play an important role for tolerance induction at multiple levels throughout T cell development and homeostasis. Thymic DCs remove thymocytes with a high TCR avidity for self-antigens. As a result, peripheral T cells express TCRs with relatively low avidity for self-antigens but they probably still need to be kept under control by peripheral DCs to avoid autoimmunity.</p><p>Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that DCs play a central role in preventing spontaneous autoimmunity under steady-state conditions and suggest a functional coevolution between the T cell compartment and DCs. The result of this development is the efficient establishment of immune tolerance against self-antigens by DCs. In the absence of DCs, self-reactive CD4 T cells can become prevalent and induce devastating autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>R-DTA mice were generated by insertion of the diphtheria toxin &#x003b1; subunit (DTA) into the genomic ROSA26 locus behind a loxP-flanked STOP cassette by homologous recombination in ES cells (129/Sv background) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).
