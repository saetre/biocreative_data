Additionally, BMP-6 induced cell death in activated memory B cells. Importantly, the antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in B-cells was completely neutralized by the natural antagonist, noggin.

These cytokines can be divided into three subgroups: TGF-&#x003b2;, the activins/inhibins, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), of which the latter constitute the largest family. BMPs are 30&#x02013;38 kDa hetero- or homodimeric proteins originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated an essential role of these proteins during embryogenesis, and more recently, also in adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; has been intensively studied in normal and malignant haematopoietic cells and is one of the most potent endogenous negative regulators known to date. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In contrast, the effect of BMPs in the immune system has not been widely investigated. In that respect, BMP- 2, -4 and -7 have been found to control differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and early T cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. BMP-6 has been reported to reduce the number of cobblestone-area-forming cells of normal human haematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, BMP-2, -4, 6 and -7 had an antiproliferative and a proapoptotic effect on multiple myeloma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, by gene expression profiling, BMP-6 significantly increased the predictive value for a multi-gene signature test and was associated with a poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>BMP-6, like the other BMP members, signals through ligation and heterodimerzation of BMP type I [activin-like-kinase (ALK)] and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, which subsequently propagates the signal downstream by phosphorylating Smad proteins. BMP-6 can signal through the ligation of the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIA, and BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII, Act-RIIA and Act-RIIB, which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor Smads (Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8). The R- Smads then form complexes with the co-Smad (Smad4) and are translocated into the nucleus where they exert gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Given the reported role of BMP-6 in B-cell malignancies and haematopoietic progenitor cells, we wanted to explore its potential role in normal human B cells. We studied the effects of BMP-6 on proliferation and apoptosis on resting and stimulated B cells. Furthermore, the expression of BMP receptors and BMP-6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes <italic>Id1&#x02013;Id4</italic>, were resolved. Finally, we investigated whether B cells also were capable of producing BMP-6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BMP-6 inhibits anti-IgM induced proliferation of human B cells</title><p>The effects of BMP-6 on normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells prompted us to investigate the effects of BMP-6 on normal human B cells. All experiments in this study were performed under serum-free conditions as FCS has been shown to interfere with BMP-signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>](own observations). To study the effect of BMP-6 on proliferation, B-cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated with anti-IgM and/or CD40L in the presence or absence of BMP-6 for three days. We found that BMP-6 led to a 35% mean reduction of anti-IgM- induced DNA synthesis (n = 8; p &#x02264; 0.0002, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Similar results were obtained for B cells treated with anti-IgM and CD40L (26% mean reduction, n = 6; p &#x02264; 0.023). The BMP-6-induced inhibition of proliferation was dose-dependent in both peripheral B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos (40% reduction of DNA synthesis, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The BMP-6 effects could be reversed by addition of the extracellular inhibitor Noggin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Similarly, a combination of the soluble BMP receptors BMP-RIB-Fc and BMP-RII-Fc also neutralized the effects of BMP-6 (data not shown). Next, we wanted to test whether BMP-6 had different effect on na&#x000ef;ve and memory B cells. Na&#x000ef;ve (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup>) and memory (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>) B cells were isolated from peripheral blood by cell sorting of immunobead-isolated CD19<sup>+ </sup>B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and tested for their capacity to proliferate in the presence of BMP-6. However, BMP-6 inhibited anti-IgM induced DNA synthesis in the two subpopulations to a similar extent, with a mean reduction of DNA-synthesis of 45% (n = 5; p &#x02264; 0,004) for na&#x000ef;ve B cells and 48% (n = 5; p &#x02264; 0,001) for memory B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>BMP-6 induces cell death in human memory B cells and Ramos cells</title><p>Next, we wanted to establish whether BMP-6 also could affect the viability of normal B cells. Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining after culture with or without BMP-6 for 48 hours. Interestingly, BMP-6 showed a small, but reproducible mean increase of cell death from 17 to 23% (n = 5; p &#x02264; 0,003) in anti-IgM stimulated CD27<sup>+ </sup>memory B cells. Furthermore, Ramos cells showed a mean increase in cell death from 20 to 50% (n = 3, p &#x0003c; 0,001, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) after BMP-6 treatment. In contrast, cell death of total CD19<sup>+ </sup>cells (n = 6; p &#x02264; 0,32; data not shown) or CD27<sup>-</sup>IgG<sup>- </sup>na&#x000ef;ve B cells was not significantly affected (n = 5; p &#x02264; 0,65, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Human B cells express BMP-6 receptors</title><p>Detailed knowledge regarding expression of different BMP receptors in B cells is currently not available. To further elucidate the role of BMPs in human B cells, we performed western blot analysis for type I and type II BMP receptors. This analysis revealed that the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII and Act-RIIb are expressed on resting human B-cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Ramos cells expressed the type I receptors Act-RIA, weakly BMP-RIB and the type II receptor BMP-RII, but more weakly than normal B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). HL60 cells were used for comparison and weakly expressed Act-RIA and BMP-RII.</p><p>Taken together, these data show that normal human B cells and Ramos cells express a set of BMP receptors, previously shown to bind BMP-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>BMP-6 induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8</title><p>Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor transphosphorylates and activates the type I receptor. Type I receptors can signal via several pathways. We examined the effect of BMP-6 on Smad phosphorylation, as the activation of Smad is considered to be a major signalling pathway for BMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. B cells were cultured in serum-free media over night and then treated with BMP-6 for various time points. Total protein lysates were prepared, and the amounts of the phosphorylated forms of Smad1/5/8 were determined by western blot analysis. Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad. The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). A similar phosphorylation was observed in Ramos cells, but not in HL60 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Furthermore, we also tested whether other known downstream signalling pathways of BMP-6 could be triggered by BMP-6 in human B cells. However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>BMP-6 induces upregulation of Id1</title><p>Next, we wanted to explore whether the BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes. In this regard, the inhibitors of DNA binding proteins (Ids) are considered to be some of the major target genes for Smad-signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, B cells were pre-incubated over night in X-VIVO 15, and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP-6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA. The amount of <italic>Id1&#x02013;Id4 </italic>mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Interestingly, we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of <italic>Id1 </italic>mRNA in BMP-6-treated B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The up-regulation of <italic>Id1 </italic>mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP-6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours. In contrast, no significant changes were observed for <italic>Id2 </italic>and <italic>Id3 </italic>mRNA, whereas <italic>Id4</italic>-transcripts were not detectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, data not shown).</p><p>Western blot analysis revealed that the BMP-6-induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well. The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP-6 addition, showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t0 (p &#x02264; 0.020, n = 4) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In line with the mRNA data, no consistent change in the amounts of Id2 and Id3 protein could be observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). We were able to block the Id1 specific band with a blocking peptide (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of BMP-6 in human B cells, whereas Id2 and Id3 not seem to be involved.</p></sec><sec><title>BMP-6 production in B cells</title><p>The fact that BMP-6 has been reported to act as an autocrine stimulator in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and ovarium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], prompted us to investigate whether normal human B cells could produce <italic>BMP-6 </italic>upon stimulation. Ramos cells, which have been described to express <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA endogenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and the T cell line Jurkat, served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Endogenous <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA levels in normal B cells were quantified by real-time RT-PCR after stimulation with anti-IgM for different time points. Interestingly, the up-regulation of <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA was characteristic of an early-to intermediate inducible gene with maximal upregulation four hours after the addition of anti-IgM. The level of <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA was back to baseline after 24 hours upon stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Furthermore, both FCS and human AB-serum induced significant upregulation of <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Interestingly, in a separate study we have found that normal human T cells do not express <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA after activation (Sivertsen et al, manuscript in preparation). Next, we wanted to detect BMP-6 protein in normal B-cells and tested various commercially available antibodies. However, in our hands these anti-BMP-6 antibodies did only recognize the recombinant BMP-6 protein and not the native protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for BMP superfamily members in hematopoietic stem cells, early thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and B-cell malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but a role for BMPs in normal human B cells has previously not been reported. The present study demonstrated a significant antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in peripheral blood CD19<sup>+ </sup>B cells. Additionally, BMP-6 induced cell death in CD27<sup>+ </sup>memory B cells as well as in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Ramos). Importantly, BMP-6 induced a rapid and marked increase in Smad-1/5/8 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the BMP-6 induced Smad phosphorylation was followed by a selective upregulation of <italic>Id1 </italic>mRNA and subsequent Id1 protein.</p><p>In the present study, the demonstrated antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in anti-IgM treated B cells was significant and dose-dependent. Importantly, the anti-proliferative effect of BMP-6 could be completely neutralized by the use of a natural inhibitor, Noggin. This is in line with others, showing that Noggin can function as a BMP-6 antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, the combination of soluble BMP-RIB-Fc and BMP-RII-Fc fusion proteins also neutralized the anti-proliferative effect of BMP-6 in human B cells. Interestingly, as for other TGF family members, bifunctional effects have also been demonstrated for BMPs. Whereas several of the BMPs have been shown to promote proliferation in various cell types including condrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], antiproliferative effects and induction of apoptosis has been reported for B and T lineage cells. Similar effects as demonstrated for BMP-6 on human B cells in the present study, were demonstrated for BMP-2, 4, 6 and -7 in human myeloma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Other members of the BMP-family have also been reported to induce apoptosis, including in mouse B lineage cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Additionally, BMP-4 inhibits thymocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that the role of BMPs in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis is highly cell type dependent.</p><p>To examine how BMP-6 exerts its functional effects in B cells, we analysed BMP receptor expression by western blot analysis. Human peripheral B cells were found to express the BMP type I receptors Act-RIA and BMP-RIB, and the type II-receptors BMP-RII and Act-RIIb, which signal after binding of several BMPs, including BMP-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To further explore BMP-6 induced signalling, activation of several pathways is possible. The major signalling pathway known to date, is activation of R-Smads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In that respect, BMPs have been shown to exert antiproliferative effects in B lineage cells via phosphorylation of R-Smad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, BMP-2 has been shown to induce activation of STAT3 in myeloma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, phosphorylation of R-Smad was not investigated in that study. BMP-2 has also been shown to induce phosphorylation of p38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, phosphorylation of p38, STAT3 and Smad1/5/8 represent important BMP-signalling pathways that mediated the effects of BMPs and even cross-talk between these pathways has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the present study, we were not able to detect BMP-6-induced changes in the phosphorylation status of STAT3 or p38 in human peripheral B cells. Instead, a rapid and marked phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 was revealed. In a parallel study, we have found that other BMPs also induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in peripheral B cells (data not shown). We are currently pursuing microarray studies to identify the signalling pathways and target genes that are differently regulated by the various BMPs in human B cells.</p><p>Upregulation of <italic>Id1 </italic>via Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation is a known mechanism for BMP-6 signalling in other cell systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and regulation of Id-proteins is thought to be an important mechanism for Smad-signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the present study, real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed a specific four-fold upregulation for <italic>Id1 </italic>in BMP-6-treated B cells, while the amount of <italic>Id2&#x02013;Id4 </italic>remained unchanged. In agreement with this, western blot analysis demonstrated an upregulation of Id1 protein, while the amount of Id2 and Id3 protein levels remained unchanged. Previously, <italic>Id1 </italic>has been considered not to be expressed in later developmental stages than pro-B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and its constitutive expression has been reported to impair mouse B cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore, our demonstration of the time-dependent upregulation of Id1 mRNA and protein in mature normal human B cells is of particular interest. In that respect, it is noteworthy that TGF-&#x003b2; signalling in early and mature B cells induces both Id2 and Id3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but not Id1 (data not shown). Interestingly, these results show that various members of the TGF-&#x003b2; family regulate Id proteins differently. Id2 and Id3 are considered to be the Id proteins mainly expressed in mature B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The present study also found Id2 and Id3 protein in B cells to be more highly expressed than Id1 in resting B cells. However, BMP-6 did not induce significant changes in the protein expression of Id2 and Id3. It is believed that Id proteins block differentiation and promote proliferation in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Id proteins act as dominant-negative inhibitors of E-proteins and Pax5 function by forming dimers with these proteins, making them unable to bind DNA. It has been proposed that the balance among E-proteins, Pax5 and Id proteins might have an important role in activated B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In that respect, E-proteins have been implicated in both the promotion and inhibition of cell survival and growth at different points in lymphocyte development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The antiproliferative and death inducing effect of BMP-6 in B cells with concomitant upregulation of Id1 protein is therefore in line with the view that Id proteins are required for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in B-lymphocyte progenitors by TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, Id proteins are known as important parts of signalling pathways involved in development, cell cycle and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is well established that various members of the Id family are overexpressed in a range of human tumours and generally, <italic>Id1 </italic>appears to be the family member most widely overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], including multiple myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Additionally, our findings that BMP-6 activates intracellular signalling pathways in human B cells might be of potential pathophysiological significance in lymphoma and inflammation. High <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA expression in DLBCL has been shown to correlate to unfavourable outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this respect, it is of interest that targeted expression of <italic>Id1 </italic>to B-lymphocytes resulted in aberrant B cell development, massive apoptosis, and subsequent development of B cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover, BMP-6 has been suggested to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and elevated levels of <italic>Id1 </italic>and <italic>Id3 </italic>have been found in the synovia of RA-patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Altogether, these results point to an important role for Id proteins in the regulation of normal B cell homeostasis and in diseases, where B cells are involved. It will therefore be important to further elucidate the role of Id-1 in human B cells by selective over expression or inhibition of Id-1 gene expression.</p><p>Given the role of BMP-6 in mature human B cells demonstrated here, identification of BMP-6 producing cells in vivo with possibility of interaction with na&#x000ef;ve and memory B cells might contribute to the understanding of mature B cell biology. High <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA expression in DLBCL has been detected by gene expression profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, production of <italic>BMP-6 </italic>transcripts in normal activated B cells was detected in the same study. Of note, an autocrine BMP-6 loop has been reported by others in chondrocytes and in the ovarium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we wanted to explore the possibility for an autocrine BMP-6 loop in human B cells. We analysed the expression <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA in peripheral blood B cells by real-time PCR, and report here the upregulation of endogenous <italic>BMP-6 </italic>transcripts after stimulation with FCS, human AB-serum and, most importantly, anti-IgM. However, our attempts to study BMP-6 protein levels were unsuccessful due to problems with unspecific binding of the anti-BMP-6 antibodies tested, and lack of specific staining in control cells known to express <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA. In contrast, the recombinant protein was readily detected. In that respect, few investigators have detected BMP-6 protein in humans, especially in non-pathogenic tissue. The possibility of BMP-6 production in human B-cells is in line with a recent work that reported the production of BMP-6 in mouse B cells, infiltrating the bone marrow of mice with inflammatory arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In this study, a role for BMPs in the inflammatoric process of arthritis was suggested. The upregulation of the <italic>BMP-6</italic>-transcripts after IgM-crosslinking is of pathophysiologic interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A loss of TGF-&#x003b2;-responsiveness has been suggested to be a critical contribution to malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and similar oncogenic mechanisms have been postulated for BMPs. Lines of evidence suggest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] that at early stages of carcinogenesis, BMP-6 is not a tumour promoter, but suppresses benign and malignant tumour outgrowth. These findings are in good agreement with previous findings for other TGF-&#x003b2; family members, including TGF-&#x003b2;1 and BMP-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], indicating that cellular context of the BMP target cell might define the various observed effects. In contrast to the upregulation of <italic>BMP-6 </italic>transcript in B cells, we were not able to detect <italic>BMP-6 </italic>transcripts in human peripheral blood CD4<sup>+ </sup>or CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells (resting or stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28; data not shown), consistent with the findings in T cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and T cells in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Other potential BMP-6 sources for mature B cells in vivo might be other cells of the immune system or tissue with contact to the hematopoietic system. One well recognized source for BMP-6 production is the human bone and bone marrow stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) highly express <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], and vascular endothelium has been reported to produce BMP-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. These studies might imply a role for BMP-6 in transendothelial migration of B cells. <italic>BMP-6 </italic>mRNA has been demonstrated in murine macrophage cell lines, but not in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In accordance with these findings, other human cell lines of neutrophil and monocytic origin have been described to be negative for the <italic>BMP-6 </italic>transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To our knowledge, there is currently no report about BMP-6 production of human dendritic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results show that BMP-6 induces activation of intracellular Smad signalling in mature human B-cells with consecutive production of Id1 protein. Furthermore, we report that BMP-6 has an antiproliferative effect in B cells stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L. Additionally, BMP-6 induces cell death in activated memory B cells and Ramos cells. Taken together, these results provide a rationale to further examine the role of BMP-6 signalling in normal B cell biology as well as in pathologic conditions like B cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>If not specified, all cells were cultured in X-VIVO 15&#x02122; (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) serum-free medium at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in air.</p><p>Peripheral blood was provided by the Blood Bank at Buskerud Regional Hospital with formal agreement by the patients, and approval by the regional ethics committee.
