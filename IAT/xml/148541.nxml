We isolated cDNA and genomic DNA that encode chicken TLP (cTLP) and determined their structures. The predicted amino acid sequence of cTLP was 98 and 91% identical to that of its mammalian and Xenopus counterparts, respectively, and its translation product was ubiquitously observed in chicken tissues. FISH detection showed that chicken tlp and tbp genes were mapped at 3q2.6-2.8 and 3q2.4-2.6 of the same chromosome, respectively. Genome analysis revealed that the chicken tlp gene was spliced with five introns. Interestingly, the vertebrate tbp genes were also found to be split by five introns when we focused on the CCDs, and their splicing points were similar to those of tlp. On the contrary, another TBP-resembling gene of Drosophila, trf1, is split by only one intron, as is the Drosophila 's tbp gene. These results support our earlier assumption that vertebrate TLPs did not directly descend from Drosophila TRF1. On the basis of these results together with phylogenetical exam-ination, we speculate that tlp diverged from an ancestral tbp gene through a process of gene duplication and point mutations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
