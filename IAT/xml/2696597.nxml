Axonal filopodia, which are known to originate presynaptic specializations, are regulated in response to neurotrophic factors. The structural components of filopodia are actin filaments, whose dynamics and organization are controlled by ensembles of actin-binding proteins. How neurotrophic factors regulate these latter proteins remains, however, poorly defined. Here, using a combination of mouse genetic, biochemical, and cell biological assays, we show that genetic removal of Eps8, an actin-binding and regulatory protein enriched in the growth cones and developing processes of neurons, significantly augments the number and density of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)-dependent axonal filopodia. The reintroduction of Eps8 wild type (WT), but not an Eps8 capping-defective mutant, into primary hippocampal neurons restored axonal filopodia to WT levels. We further show that the actin barbed-end capping activity of Eps8 is inhibited by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment through MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of Eps8 residues S624 and T628. Additionally, an Eps8 mutant, impaired in the MAPK target sites (S624A/T628A), displays increased association to actin-rich structures, is resistant to BDNF-mediated release from microfilaments, and inhibits BDNF-induced filopodia. The opposite is observed for a phosphomimetic Eps8 (S624E/T628E) mutant. Thus, collectively, our data identify Eps8 as a critical capping protein in the regulation of axonal filopodia and delineate a molecular pathway by which BDNF, through MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of Eps8, stimulates axonal filopodia formation, a process with crucial impacts on neuronal development and synapse formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Neurons communicate with each other via specialized cell&#x02013;cell junctions called synapses. The proper formation of synapses (&#x0201c;synaptogenesis&#x0201d;) is crucial to the development of the nervous system, but the molecular pathways that regulate this process are not fully understood. External cues, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), trigger synaptogenesis by promoting the formation of axonal filopodia, thin extensions projecting outward from a growing axon. Filopodia are formed by elongation of actin filaments, a process that is regulated by a complex set of actin-binding proteins. Here, we reveal a novel molecular circuit underlying BDNF-stimulated filopodia formation through the regulated inhibition of actin-capping factor activity. We show that the actin-capping protein Eps8 down-regulates axonal filopodia formation in neurons in the absence of neurotrophic factors. In contrast, in the presence of BDNF, the kinase MAPK becomes activated and phosphorylates Eps8, leading to inhibition of its actin-capping function and stimulation of filopodia formation. Our study, therefore, identifies actin-capping factor inhibition as a critical step in axonal filopodia formation and likely in new synapse formation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which neurite extension and synaptogenesis occur during brain development is critical to understand the ontogenesis of the nervous system. In addition, the knowledge of the mechanisms through which initial synaptic contacts are established and modified during brain development may also shed light on synaptic remodeling and plasticity occurring in the adult brain. In the last years, evidence has accumulated indicating that filopodia, which are highly motile, narrow, cylindrical extensions emerging from both axons and dendrites, play important roles at initial stages of synaptogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Cingolani1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Jontes1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although axonal filopodia have been investigated less systematically, it is now well established that filopodia extending at the tips of axonal growth cones mediate neurite navigation and axonal path finding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Koleske1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas filopodia emerging from the shaft of distal axonal branches play a pivotal role in synapse formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Matteoli1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Axonal filopodia differ from both the growth cone and dendritic filopodia since, in addition to bundles of filamentous actin, they also contain clusters of synaptic vesicles that undergo exo-endocytotic recycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Dent1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Chang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, filopodia emerging from axons are destined to differentiate into future presynaptic sites.</p><p>The core structural and dynamic components of filopodia are actin filaments, whose dynamic formation and topological organization are controlled by ensembles of actin-binding proteins.

Remarkably, we found that in neuronal cells, Eps8-SATA was distributed to and colocalized with discrete actin-rich structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas Eps8-SETE showed a more diffuse distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), in line with the hypothesis that the latter, phosphomimetic construct is constitutively detached from actin filaments. Additionally, and more importantly, WT Eps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), but not Eps8-SATA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), was dispersed after BDNF stimulation. This is consistent with the possibility that, being unable to be phosphorylated, Eps8-SATA does not detach from actin even after BDNF treatment. Finally, the expression of Eps8-SATA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g007">Figure 7D and 7G</xref>), but not Eps8-SETE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), significantly inhibited the formation of BDNF-induced axonal filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g007">Figure 7G</xref>), acting in a dominant fashion. Collectively, these data indicate that phosphorylation of S624, T628 residues controls the barbed-end capping activity of the Eps8:Abi1 complex and Eps8 subcellular localization in response to BDNF.

Formins and Ena/VASP family proteins act independently of each other, as demonstrated by the finding that genetic removal of Ena, MENA, and VASP abrogates filopodia, which, however, can be restored by expression of the formin mDia2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Dent2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, there are likely multiple and independent mechanisms that give rise to filopodia. This is reflected by the fact that different models have been proposed to account for the initiation and elongation of filopodia with respect to other protrusions, such as lamellipodia. For instance, the convergent elongation model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Svitkina1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> proposes that the Arp2/3-dependent dendritic nucleation of actin filaments is the starting point of actin filament arrays in both lamellipodia and filopodia. The activity of capping proteins, according to this model, is then crucial to control the subsequent architectural organization of actin in these protrusions. When the capping activity is high, newly nucleated branched filaments become rapidly capped. The balance between de novo branched nucleation and elongation by Arp2/3 and blockade of filament growth by capping proteins, both competing for filament ends, would thus result in the generation of a dendritic actin network at the leading edge of lamellipodia. In this context, it is remarkable that Eps8, when expressed at high levels, causes the formation of flat, actin-rich protrusions along axons, which resemble lamellipodia extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Conversely, when capping activity is low, such as after RNAi-mediated interference or genetic knockdown of Eps8 in neurons, filaments nucleated by Arp2/3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Korobova1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> can grow longer, uncapped. Factors such as VASP family members or components of the filopodia tip complex may then promote the transient association of actin filaments, which can be further stabilized by other cross-linkers, such as fascin, thus permitting the formation of bundles of sufficient stiffness to overcome buckling and membrane resilience <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Mogilner1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Of note, filopodia initiation, rather than elongation, is affected by Eps8. A corollary of this model is that Eps8-dependent filopodia should be, at least in part, mediated by VASP. Consistently, we show here that the increased axonal filopodia of <italic>eps8</italic> null hippocampal neurons are significantly reduced upon interference of VASP functions through dominant-negative approaches, suggesting functional competition between the capping activity of Eps8 and the actin-regulatory properties of VASP. This is reminiscent of a situation similar to the one suggested by Mejillano and colleagues in nonneuronal cells, where depletion of the capping protein CP caused loss of lamellipodia and the explosive formation of filopodia, a phenotype which is counteracted by Ena/VASP proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Mejillano1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An alternative model of filopodia initiation questioned the relevance of Arp2/3-mediated nucleation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Faix2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>), claiming instead that linear filament elongation at the leading edge of protrusions is the source of bundles in filopodia.

Also in this case, however, filaments must be protected from cappers, which have been shown, in the case of CP, to compete, either directly or indirectly, with VASP as well as with formins for barbed-end binding. Whether Eps8 can compete with clustered VASP or formins for barbed ends remains to be assessed. The fact that filopodia induced by removal of Eps8 are dependent on VASP argues, however, that a balanced activity of these two proteins may be critical for proper axonal filopodia formation.</p><p>Notably, Eps8 is a multifunctional protein, whose actin-related activities, capping and bundling, are critically controlled by its binding partners, Abi1 and IRSp53, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Disanza1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Disanza2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Both capping and bundling activities need to be coordinated and regulated for the initiation and maintenance of filopodia. In neurons, in which Eps8 is tightly bound to Abi1 or Abi2, the capping function prevails, exerting a negative modulatory role on filopodia extension. Conversely, in HeLa cells, where the majority of Eps8 is associated with IRSp53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Disanza1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, and no complex with Abi1 or Abi2 is detected, the Eps8:IRSp53 complex bundles actin filaments, positively contributing to the formation of filopodia. Thus, specific patterns of protein expression and different Eps8-based complexes may be the basis of the different roles that this protein exerts in different experimental systems.</p><p>One of the major accomplishments of our study is the demonstration that extracellular cues regulate the subcellular localization and function of Eps8 through phosphorylation. This mode of regulation defines a novel mechanism through which signaling cascades, particularly those emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases, may regulate cappers. Indeed, how the activity of capping proteins is controlled in a signaling-dependent manner has remained a critical, only partially addressed issue. Phosphoinositides, whose generation is controlled through the balance of signaling-regulated lipid kinases and phosphates, can bind and inhibit both gelsolin and CP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Hartwig1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Janmey1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.

Protein:protein interaction is another way to control the activity of capping proteins. In this respect, Carmil, an adaptor protein, was shown to bind CP with high affinity and to inhibit capping, influencing the formation of lamellipodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Yang2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, Abi1 functions as an activator of the otherwise inhibited Eps8.</p><p>We show here that BDNF, in particular, controls the barbed-end capping activity of the Eps8:Abi1 complex and modulates Eps8 interaction with the cytoskeleton, strengthening the importance of spatially restricted activation of proteins in the regulation of actin dynamics. Accordingly, BDNF-mediated detachment of Eps8 from actin cytoskeleton correlates with increased filopodia formation, which can be mimicked by genetic removal of this capper. At the molecular level, this is achieved through MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Eps8 residues S624 and T628, which controls the protein capping activity, with a 10-fold reduction in barbed-end binding of the Eps8:Abi1 complex, following S624 and T628 phosphorylation. Since Eps8 localization depends on both binding to Abi1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Scita2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref> and to actin, this reduction in actin binding reasonably contributes to Eps8 subcellular relocalization in response to BDNF. Of note, BDNF-induced detachment of Eps8 from cytoskeletal structures is not accompanied by that of VASP, which remains enriched in the Triton-insoluble fraction, where it may more efficiently associate to filament ends, promoting their elongation.</p><p>The regulation of actin-capping activity of Eps8 may have consequences for the developing and adult brain. It is now widely accepted that presynaptic specializations, which are highly dynamic and are continuously added and eliminated throughout the lifetime of a neuron, play an active role in activity-dependent synapse formation and remodeling. In the mature neocortex in vivo, for example, filopodia and short axonal branches are frequently extended and retracted to form boutons onto postsynaptic structures, or to originate en-passant boutons, which are added and eliminated along the axonal shaft (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Krueger1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>). Notably, <italic>eps8</italic> null brains, at early postnatal stages, display a significantly higher number of presynaptic boutons (unpublished data) that might originate from the increased axonal filopodia during neuronal development, thus suggesting a role of the protein in controlling synapse formation in vivo. The dynamic regulation of <italic>eps8</italic> actin-capping activity may therefore play an important role in presynaptic plasticity phenomena in the developing brain and, possibly, in the adult brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Expression Vectors, Reagents, and Antibodies</title><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter&#x02013;based and elongation factor-1 (EF1)-promoter&#x02013;based eukaryotic expression vectors and GST bacterial expression vectors were generated by recombinant PCR.</p><p>Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (abs) against Eps8 and Abi1 were previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Scita1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Innocenti2">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

This domain is composed of five consecutive alpha helices, from N- to C-terminus, named alpha1 to alpha5. We previously reported through structure-function analysis using various Eps8 fragments that the one encompassing amino acids (aa) 674&#x02013;737 and including the two first alpha helices is sufficient to mediate actin capping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Disanza2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, but loses actin bundling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000138-Disanza1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that the integrity of these helices is critical for capping.

(B) The levels of RacGTP in brain cortex and hippocampus derived from WT and <italic>eps8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are similar. Equal amounts of total tissue protein extract from brains of adult wild-type (WT) or <italic>eps8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (KO) littermates were incubated in the presence of GST-fused Pak1-CRIB (Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding motif). Lysates from total tissue protein extract (lower panel, Rac) and GST-CRIB (upper panel, RacGTP) bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Rac antibodies. (C and D) Efficacy of the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 in mouse embryo fibroblasts and in hippocampal neurons. (C) Serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were incubated with NSC23766 (50 &#x000b5;M) or vehicle (mock) for 48 h before addition of PDGF(100 ng/ml for 7 min) or mock treatment. Cells were then fixed and labeled with FITC-phalloidin. The Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 completely abrogates actin ruffles induced by PDGF. (D) Levels of RacGTP in hippocampal cultures (3DIV) upon exposure to 50 &#x000b5;M NSC23766 for 3 h determined by affinity CRIB-based assay as described in (B). (E) Quantification of filopodia density in hippocampal neurons (3DIV) treated with NSC23766 (50 &#x000b5;M for 3 h); the histogram shows the normalized mean number of axonal filopodia per micronmeter (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, <italic>p</italic>&#x02264;0.001).

MBP (myelin basic protein) was used as positive control of the reaction. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (right panels). The red arrow indicates the shift of Eps8 due to phosphorylation. Left panel shows Coumassie Blue staining analysis of recombinant MBP and Eps8. MAPK-mediated phosphorylation does not affect the barbed-end capping activity of the isolated C-terminal Eps8 535&#x02013;821 fragment.

Increasing amounts of purified Eps8 WT, SATA, or SETE mutant C-terminal regions (535&#x02013;821 WT, 535&#x02013;821 SATA, and 535&#x02013;821 SETE) were mixed to MgATP&#x02013;G-actin (2.5 &#x000b5;M, 10&#x00025; pyrenyl-labeled) and 0.25 nM of spectrin&#x02013;actin seeds. Fluorescence was monitored over time. The relative inhibition of polymerization rate, calculated as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section, was plotted over different concentrations of Eps8 fragments. The affinity for actin barbed ends of each of the Eps8 C-terminal fragments is shown. (D) MAPK-mediated phosphorylation does not affect the binding of Eps8 (535&#x02013;821) to F-actin. Eps8 C-terminal fragment (GST-535-821) (1 &#x000b5;M) incubated with MAPK in the presence or absence of an excess of ATP (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) were mixed with 5 &#x000b5;M of F-actin and subjected to cosedimentation assay by high-speed ultracentrifugation.

The dissociated cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine at densities ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. After a few hours, the coverslips were transferred to dishes containing a monolayer of cortical glial cells. Live imaging recording was performed by Zeiss LSM 510 Meta. Frames were taken every 5 s for a total of 4 min. Bar indicates 10 &#x000b5;m. Insets show a magnified detail of filopodia dynamically emerging and retracting from the axonal shaft. It is evident from these movies that the average length of filopodia (3.6&#x000b1;0.8 standard error of the mean &#x0005b;SEM&#x0005d;, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;50) is not significantly affected by removal of Eps8, which instead causes an increase in the number of cell-forming filopodia and in the density of filopodia along the axon. This suggests that the capping activity of Eps8 likely regulates initiation rather than elongation of filopodia. Additionally, expression of high levels of ectopic <italic>eps8</italic> blocks the formation of filopodia rather than preventing their elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000138-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>(2.77 MB MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000138.s006.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Regeneron (Tarrytown, New York, United States) for the kind gift of BDNF, Y.
