Gastrokine-1 is abundantly and specifically expressed in superficial gastric epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Oien1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> but its function is not yet known. The current postulated role of gastrokine-1 in mucosal protection was deduced from its cellular localisation in the gastric epithelium. In previous reports, gastrokine-1 (GKN1), named before AMP-18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Toback1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-WalshReitz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> or CA11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Shiozaki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Yoshikawa1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, was already known to be highly expressed in gastric antrum mucosa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Martin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Yoshihara1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-SanchezPulido1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Previously generated mRNA expression profiles of gastric carcinoma were compared with those of normal gastric antrum and led to the identification of the gastrokine-1 transcript, which accounted for around 1&#x00025; of the total mRNA in normal stomach but was absent from gastric cancers. Gastrokine-1 shows strong evolutionary conservation in the human, mouse, rat, cow, and pig. Sequence gene analysis (accession number: BK0017373) showed that the human transcript contains two potential translation start sites (ATG). The first would generate a 199 amino acid product lacking the signal peptide, unlike the second ATG, which is in-frame, 42 bp downstream, and has a more favourable kozak context for translation initiation. Comparison with other species revealed homology around the second site only, and its mature product is predicted at 18 kDa. Micro-sequencing of the native pig protein by Martin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Martin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> confirmed that the amino terminal residue was that predicted after signal peptide cleavage. The second ATG is therefore functional. The theory that gastrokine-1 is secreted is supported by some reported evidence of its localisation in cytoplasmic vacuoles. Furthermore, using immunohistochemistry and Western blot detection, Oein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Oien1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and Toback et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Toback1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> showed that gastrokine-1 was present in mucus at the gastric luminal surface.</p><p>Extensive tissue profiling by Northern blotting, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, showed that gastrokine-1 is highly and specifically expressed in native and metaplastic gastric epithelium, but such studies are restricted to gastro-intestinal tissues and a few other tissues such as liver, testis and placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Oien1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Gastrokine-1 is absent from gastric carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Yoshihara1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> as well as from precursor lesions of intestinal metaplasia. Previous studies with a smaller range and number of samples revealed the specificity of this protein for gastric type epithelium and the absence from other normal epithelia. However, two studies using commercial sources of RNA or cDNA suggested that gastrokine-1 might also occur at low levels in normal placenta, uterus, liver, kidney, pancreas, and adrenal and salivary glands.</p><p>Protein sequence analysis predicted the signal peptide, with post-translational cleavage, 20 amino acid peptides from the N-terminus, with a conserved central domain structure named BRICHOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-SanchezPulido1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, which was postulated to contain two conservative cysteine residues that are possibly involved in intra- and/or inter-disulfide bridges. The putative association of gastrokine-1 with such a domain structure, and with at least three different possible functions, has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-SanchezPulido1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> but has not been conclusively demonstrated.</p><p>To investigate the potential role of gastrokine-1 in smooth muscle cells, we present the first protocol for purification of native gastrokine-1 from chicken gizzard. We characterised the biochemical properties of gastrokine-1 with the aim of establishing some new unexpected biological functions. Using an original purification procedure, we identified a 20 kDa protein that is strongly expressed in chicken gizzard smooth muscle. Sequence blast showed that this protein corresponds to gastrokine-1 and the protein sequence showed that this protein contains one BRICHOS domain and at least two or possibly three transmembrane regions. IAEDANS labelling of gastrokine-1 showed that the protein contains a reactive cysteine residue. The full-length protein could be shortened into a protease resistant core by eliminating the first 12 N-terminal residues. Using a newly produced polyclonal antibody, we observed that gastrokine-1 is well distributed throughout the gastric epithelium, but also colocalizes with actin in smooth muscle cells. Moreover, by cross-linking and H-NMR approaches, we identified the actin binding site on the gastrokine-1 sequence involving the N-terminal acidic region of actin and demonstrated that the presence of tropomyosin favours gastrokine dimer formation and its association with actin filaments. Our results suggest that gastrokine-1 could regulate actin filaments inside the smooth muscle cytoplasm either to anchor the actin network to the epithelium cell membrane or to lock actin filaments for the actin-myosin interaction. Our results highlight a greater role of gastrokine-1 in cell-cell contact, in the actin network and in membrane anchorage in smooth muscles.</p><p>We also present, for the first time, a purification procedure to obtain gastrokine-1 as a 90&#x00025; pure native protein from chicken gizzard muscle. A series of biochemical and structural studies on complete purified gastrokine-1 from chicken smooth muscle gizzard is also reported to investigate the properties of this protein and its possible relationship with other proteins present in smooth muscle. We demonstrate that chicken gastrokine-1 is a 20 kDa protein and contains an actin-binding site involving the N-terminal acidic region of actin and participates in actin assembly, as demonstrated by two methods, i.e. crosslinking and H-NMR techniques. Our results suggest that this gastrokine-1 could also be considered as a new actin binding protein and could have an effective locking role on actin filaments either by anchoring the actin network to the muscle cell membrane or by regulating actin-myosin interactions in smooth muscle cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purification of gastrokine-1</title><p>The chicken gizzards used in this study were dissected from dead euthanized animals obtained from a slaughterhouse in R&#x000e9;moulin (France).

It is of interest to note that our CNBR peptide described above was closely neighbouring a Met residue and corresponded to part of the BRICHOS domain described in each gastrokine-1 sequence. One conserved cysteine within the pair was not sequenced, possibly because its neighbouring region is rich in basic residues, i.e. the target of trypsin attack. However, the complete sequence of the BRICHOS domain was obtained in our peptide mapping (12 residues missing for a total of about 100 residues), with about 35&#x00025; homology. The results presented above led us to assume that our purified 20 kDa protein was clearly the chicken gastrokine-1 protein. This protein was soluble in buffer containing KCl 300 mM, EDTA 1 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5 mM and imidazole 50 mM, pH 6.9, and was found to be a heat stable protein (85&#x000b0;C for 4 min) that easily refolded. Our experiment also revealed that gastrokine-1 specifically precipitated ammonium sulphate by 60&#x00025; and could be easily re-suspended as soluble material which led us to investigate some biochemical and biological properties of gastrokine-1.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Biochemical properties of gastrokine-1</title><p>As shown by the amino acid sequence, gastrokine-1 contains four cysteine residues which could be important for the BRICHOS domain function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-SanchezPulido1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our experimental conditions, the dye was covalently incorporated into the chicken gastrokine-1 and fluorescent GNK1 could be prepared and purified without excess of fluorescent dye, as detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>. When viewed under UV light, purified GNK1 was detected as a fluorescent protein band with Mr 20 kDa, as expected, and even after tryptic cleavage the fluorescent cysteine residue remained associated with a stable 18 kDa cleaved fragment (&#x0201c;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003854-g003">Figure 3</xref>&#x0201d; top part).

When screening for the proteolytic product of gastrokine-1, this 18 kDa fragment was purified and sequenced (&#x0201c;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003854-g002">Figure 2</xref>&#x0201d;: bold and italic sequence).

Our data showed that the gastrokine-1/actin interface involves a specific proton belonging to well identified side chains of a few N-terminal actin residues. Although the proton mapping could not be precisely done for each residue, Glu-2 and -4 (E) as well as Thr- 5 and -6 or Phe-21 were clearly involved in the gastrokine-1 interaction (shown in bold in the N-terminal sequence of the 28 first actin amino acid residues). The other protons implicated in the gastrokine-1 association were in the side chain CH3 of Val/Leu and Ala or CH2 of Asp residues.

Apart from a strong tropomyosin dimer with an Mr of about 80 kDa that appeared after 5 min of crosslinking, no other new protein band was clearly detected. After adding F-actin to this mixture, we observed that gastrokine-1, actin and tropomyosin could be associated within a ternary complex. To facilitate the interpretation of the EDC-induced covalent union, the cross-linking kinetics were electro-transferred and revealed by Western blotting analysis using polyclonal anti-gastrokine-1 (&#x0201c;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003854-g008">Figure 8</xref>&#x0201d;, panel B). Three kinetics panels are presented and corresponded to the tropomyosin and gastrokine-1 mixture (left panel), the ternary complex obtained by the addition of F-actin (middle panel) and a control with gastrokine-1 alone. It is interesting to note that in the absence of actin or tropomyosin, gastrokine-1 was weakly converted into dimer form (&#x0223c;40 kDa protein band) during EDC treatment. However, when mixed with tropomyosin or with the F-actin/tropomyosin mixture, gastrokine-1 dimer formation was induced before EDC addition. As expected, the presence of F-actin also led to the new 63 kDa covalently linked product previously described in our experiments. Moreover, we observed a new protein band with Mr &#x0223c;83 kDa. We logically assumed that this product corresponded to the covalent union between actin and the gastrokine-1 dimer. In fact, we noted a decrease in gastrokine-1 dimers during the treatment, whereas the 83 kDa product increased.</p><fig id="pone-0003854-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003854.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Importance of the tropomyosin presence during F-actin-gastrokine-1 association.</title><p>EDC-induced protein stabilisation appeared as a new protein band as viewed after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Here we described the gastrokine-1 protein structure and function using conventional biochemical approaches. The putative cellular function of gastrokine-1, a component of the protein family containing the BRICHOS domain, has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-SanchezPulido1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we demonstrated the specific biochemical and cellular properties of chicken gastrokine-1. It was found that the N-terminal end of this protein was easily cleaved by proteolytic enzymes such trypsin and contained an enzyme resistant core of 18 kDa that was easily labelled by fluorescence directed against a so-called reactive cysteine residue. Gastrokine-1 was also able to form a dimer. It was previously described that this protein was expressed in normal stomach in the superficial/foveolar gastric epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Toback1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-WalshReitz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Yoshihara1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings showed that this protein was certainly present but was not restricted to this area of the stomach but was also present in smooth muscle cells. Down regulation of this protein in gastric carcinoma was postulated to be responsible for several diseases affecting the stomach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Oien1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Nardone1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, but only the potential role of gastrokine-1 in mucosal protection was proposed. We provided evidence of a strong relationship of gastrokine-1 with actin and its potential role as a new locker and/or membrane anchoring protein for actin filamentous stress fibers involving the gastrokine-1 structure in the presence of two or possibly three predicted transmembrane helices.</p><p>In fact, cell-cell adhesion could involve the actin network via cadherin-catenin or integrin complexes within which gastrokine-1 could play a powerful role, and any weakening of these interactions could lead to a loss of cell-cell contact maintenance. The recent finding that gastrokine-1 and trefoil factors could have some interacting capacities is of interest, as recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Moss1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Decreased expression of gastrokine-1 and the trefoil factor may thus favour the development of gastric cancer by weakening the actin assembly (stress fibers) and disrupting smooth cell-substratum contacts, or inducing loss of anchoring and thus anoikis, a form of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003854-Frisch1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether other pathologies related to smooth muscle but also possibly to cardiac muscle may occur when gastrokine-1 is down-regulated, it is necessary to consider how the gastrokine-1/actin complex is involved in smooth muscle contractile performance&#x02013;thus giving myosin a stronger (when GNK1 is present) but weaker (when GNK1 is absent) association with actin filaments and favoring modulation of stable actin-myosin complex formation. .Further research is needed to demonstrate this last point but already defects in smooth muscle performances must be investigated with regards to the potential involvement of gastrokine-1 in such related pathologies and the potential role of gastrokine-1 as a new potential actin-filament locker should also be considered in the light of the present data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003854.s001"><label>Supplement S1</label><caption><p>Time course of limited trypsin cleavage of native purified gastrokine-1. &#x0002a;The gastrokine-1 protein was detected as a 20 kDa protein band before tryptic attack and progressively according to the time scale indicated at the bottom of the figure.
