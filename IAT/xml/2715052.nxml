Individuals with atopic dermatitis are excluded from smallpox vaccination because of their propensity to develop eczema vaccinatum, a disseminated vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. To study the underlying mechanism of the vulnerability of atopic dermatitis patients to VACV infection, we developed a mouse model of eczema vaccinatum. Virus infection of eczematous skin induced severe primary erosive skin lesions, but not in the skin of healthy mice. Eczematous mice exhibited lower natural killer (NK) cell activity but similar cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and humoral immune responses. The role of NK cells in controlling VACV-induced skin lesions was demonstrated by experiments depleting or transferring NK cells. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 reduced NK cell activity in mice with preexisting dermatitis. Given low NK cell activities and increased IL-17 expression in atopic dermatitis patients, these results can explain the increased susceptibility of atopic dermatitis patients to eczema vaccinatum.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The smallpox vaccine consists of live vaccinia virus (VACV) and is considered the gold standard of vaccines, as it has led to the complete eradication of a lethal infectious disease from the human population. Recent fears that smallpox might be deliberately released in an act of bioterrorism have led to renewed efforts to better understand the disease mechanism and to develop a safer vaccine. Approximately 50% of US residents were born after the regular smallpox vaccination was discontinued in 1972. Thus, these unimmunized people are vulnerable to smallpox. The population landscape is very different between now and 36 yr ago, with two-to-three times more frequent incidence of atopic dermatitis in the current population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Individuals with atopic dermatitis are excluded from smallpox vaccination because of their propensity to develop eczema vaccinatum, a disseminated vaccinia infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p><p>Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The etiology of this disease is multifactorial, and involves complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The skin in a preatopic dermatitis state has been postulated to have hypersensitivity to environmental triggers, resulting from a defective skin barrier that allows the penetration of allergens and microbial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The acute phase is characterized by eczematous skin lesions with an infiltration of Th2 cells. The chronic phase is characterized by lichenification of skin and an infiltration of Th1 cells. As recent studies have established IL-17&#x02013; and IL-22&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as a distinct class of helper T cells (Th17), Th17 cells are also implicated in the acute but not the chronic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Despite the progress in our understanding of atopic dermatitis pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and immune responses to VACV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), it is not understood why atopic dermatitis patients are susceptible to developing eczema vaccinatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have established a mouse model of eczema vaccinatum using a strain of mice that are prone to develop eczematous skin lesions, characterized their immune responses to VACV infection, and showed the importance of NK cells in early suppression of VACV-induced severe eczema vaccinatum&#x02013;like skin lesions.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>We initially focused on establishing experimental conditions in which infection with VACV induces differential clinical outcomes between mice with and without eczematous skin lesions. Skin lesions were induced on the backs of dermatitis-prone NC/Nga mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) by epicutaneous treatment of shaved skin with a mite extract and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). This treatment induced elevated serum IgE levels and eczematous skin lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Skin lesions with maculopapular rash started to appear on the infected site on day 2&#x02013;3 after infection in eczematous mice and developed into severe skin erosion. The size of the primary lesion peaked at days 7&#x02013;8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), and the lesion began to subside by day 11. Unlike eczematous mice, most normal mice failed to develop skin lesions after VACV infection, and even when developed, their skin lesions were much milder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Virus titers in the lesional skin of eczematous mice were 300&#x02013;10,000 times higher than those of normal mice over an observation period of 14 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In erosive skin lesions of eczematous mice, epithelial layers were separated from the rest of the skin and more leukocytes infiltrated the diseased dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Pock-like satellite lesions distant from inoculation sites were rarely seen (only 3 cases out of 230 eczematous mice and 0 out of 187 normal mice). Although weight loss was observed in a small number of both eczematous and normal mice, there was no correlation with skin conditions (unpublished data). Unlike the intradermal infection at eczematous skin lesions, intranasal infection or intradermal infection at distant normal skin sites failed to induce clinical conditions (e.g., weight loss, survival, and size of skin lesions) distinctly different between eczematous and normal mice (unpublished data). Unlike the Western Reserve strain used throughout this study, intradermal infection with the same dose of ACAM2000, the licensed vaccine cloned from Dryvax, caused much milder skin lesions compared with Western Reserve&#x02013;induced skin lesions (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Induction of erosive primary skin lesions in VACV-infected eczematous mice.</bold> (A) Eczematous skin lesions were induced by repeated Der f/SEB (D/B) treatments, and mice with a clinical score of &#x02265;8 were infected intradermally with VACV (eczematous group).

Importantly, NK cell cytotoxic activity in the spleen was lower in eczematous mice on days 2 and 3 after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

Consistent with this, IL-4 mRNA levels in lymph nodes were not reduced in eczematous mice for the initial 7 d after infection (Fig. S1 B). Killing activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and their expression of granzyme B, perforin, and IFN-&#x003b3; in day 7 spleens did not show differences between the two cohorts (unpublished data). These results suggest that adaptive immunity does not play a major role in causing differential skin outcomes of VACV infection between the eczematous and normal mice, although these arms of immunity are critical in the control of virus infection in vaccinia-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>The role of NK cells in this eczema vaccinatum model was assessed by depletion studies. First, dermatitis was induced in NC/Nga mice. 1 d before infection and on d 3 after infection, mice were intravenously injected with anti&#x02013;asialo GM1 (&#x003b1;AGM1) or control rabbit serum (NRS). Treatment with &#x003b1;AGM1 serum drastically reduced the numbers of NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleens (73&#x02013;89% reduced as evaluated by flow cytometry) and suppressed NK cell activity in spleens in day 3&#x02013;infected normal mice (normal/&#x003b1;AGM1 group) compared with NRS-treated normal mice (normal/NRS group; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082835/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). In contrast, &#x003b1;AGM1 treatment did not significantly reduce the already low NK cell activity in day 3&#x02013;infected eczematous mice. Substantially higher virus titers were observed in lesional skins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and lungs (not depicted) of &#x003b1;AGM1-treated normal mice than those of NRS-treated normal mice. Importantly, 14 out of 16 mice in the normal/&#x003b1;AGM1 group exhibited erythematous papules at the inoculation site by day 6, whereas only 1 out of 13 mice in the normal/NRS group developed such a lesion. Some normal/&#x003b1;AGM1 and eczematous/&#x003b1;AGM1 mice developed satellite lesions as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Eczematous mice developed larger erosive skin lesions at the site of virus inoculation than noneczematous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). These primary lesions in NK-depleted eczematous mice were significantly larger than lesions in control eczematous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). As &#x003b1;AGM1 treatment might affect other cell types besides NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), we performed a second experiment in which we depleted NK cells by administering anti-NK1.1 mAb. Results were similar to those with &#x003b1;AGM1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082835/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p><p>To complement the NK depletion experiments, we performed adoptive transfer of NK cells to determine whether activated NK cells could rescue NC/Nga mice from eczema vaccinatum. NK cells were obtained by culturing splenocytes in IL-15 for 4 d. The cultured cells, composed of a &#x0003e;95% CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>, inset), were intravenously transferred to eczematous or normal mice. Transfer of NK cells either totally suppressed the development of erosive skin lesions or greatly reduced skin lesion sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). The activated NK cells also delayed the kinetics of lesion development in the subset of mice that eventually developed erosive skin lesions. Therefore, the NK depletion and transfer experiments demonstrate a critical role for NK cells in protecting mice from developing VACV-induced erosive skin lesions and satellite skin lesions in this NC/Nga mouse model of eczema vaccinatum.</p><p>NK cell function is under the control of various cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-10, which each inhibit NK cell activity. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 is produced by Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In eczematous mice, real-time PCR analysis of splenocytes showed increased mRNA expression of IL-17A and the cytokines involved in Th17 development (IL-6, TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-21, and IL-23) and effector functions (IL-21 and IL-22) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). IL-17A and IL-6 mRNAs were also increased in lesional skins of uninfected eczematous mice, whereas IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-23 mRNAs were increased in draining lymph nodes of eczematous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Consistent with these mRNA results, lymph nodes contained an increased number of Th17 cells in eczematous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In contrast with Th17-related cytokines, surface expression of NK cell receptors such as NKG2D, NKG2A/C/E, Ly49A/D, and Ly49I/G was comparable in eczematous and normal mice (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Role of IL-17A in reduced NK cell cytotoxicity in eczematous mice.</bold> (A) mRNA expression of IL-17A and Th17-related cytokines was analyzed by real-time PCR (spleen) or semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis (skin and draining lymph node).

Nevertheless, this model exhibits key features of atopic dermatitis observed in humans, including defective NK cell killing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and high IL-17A expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; are required for induction of Th17 cells, and IL-23 is required for the establishment of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). IL-21 is produced by Th17 cells and exerts critical functions in Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Th17 cells were more abundant and the Th17-related cytokines were increased in eczematous mice, suggesting that Th17 cells may be involved in reducing NK cell killing activity. The NK cell&#x02013;suppressive function of IL-17A observed in our in vitro and in vivo studies was consistent with an earlier IL-17 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), although it is possible that the increased IL-17A and Th17-related cytokines might also contribute to VACV-induced inflammation via the enhanced immunopathology. Our results also support the conclusion that NK cells are important in controlling early local and systemic spreading of VACV in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Although atopic dermatitis is still only partially understood in humans, there are strong indications that NK cell defects are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Our data now show that critical failures in NK cell&#x02013;mediated immunity allow for disastrous early spread of vaccinia after cutaneous infection, and these NK cell defects are related to the immunosuppressive effects of IL-17A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATRIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mouse infection.</title><p>NC/Nga mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) were used in all animal experiments. Eczematous skin lesions were induced as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In brief, mice were shaved on the back and dermatitis was induced by two rounds of a week-long treatment with <italic>Dermatophagoides farinae</italic> extract (Der f; Greer Laboratories) and SEB (Sigma-Aldrich). During this treatment, their back was occluded with a bandage, which was removed the following week. Mice with a clinical score of &#x02265;8 (eczematous group) were intradermally injected with 10<sup>6</sup> PFU per 3 &#x000b5;l of VACV (Western Reserve strain) at the center of skin lesions. A cohort (normal group) of age and sex-matched mice with healthy skin was also infected at the same anatomical site. Clinical scores of eczematous skin lesions are based on severity (0, no signs; 1, mild; 2, intermediate; 3, severe) of four signs (redness, bleeding, eruption, and scaling). Scoring was performed in a blind manner. The virus was prepared by repeated (three times) freeze&#x02013;thaw cycles of infected HeLa cells in DMEM/1% FCS followed by centrifugation. Uninfected HeLa cell extract was used as control. Virus titers were measured by plaque-forming assays on Vero cells. All of the mouse experiments were approved by an Institutional Review Board of the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology.</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Mac-1<sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages, and Ly49G2 (4D11)<sup>+</sup> NK cells were detected by immunochemical staining.

The purity of NK cells was checked by flow cytometry after staining with anti-NK1.1 and anti-CD3 antibodies before the use for adoptive transfer. For in vitro NK cell assays, purified splenic NK cells or whole splenocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS containing 20 ng/ml IL-4 and/or 50 ng/ml IL-17A or IL-17F with or without 2 &#x000b5;g/ml anti&#x02013;IL-17RA for 2 d, followed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry.</title><p>Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes or lymph node cells were surface stained with anti-NK1.1 and CD3.
