In addition to this chronic exposure, bacterial cells that engage the immune system of mammals can be exposed to acute level of oxidants, produced by specialized cells as strong bacteriocidal agents. In response to chronic and acute oxidative stress, bacteria have evolved signal transduction pathways that sense changes in oxidant levels and modulate gene expression before extensive damage is realized. The best-characterized sensor-regulator systems that respond to oxidative stress are the OxyR and SoxRS systems in <italic>E. coli,</italic> which regulate the responses to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001186-Zheng1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001186-Pomposiello1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>OxyR is a member of the LysR protein family that both senses intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels, and binds to DNA at promoter regions where it regulates transcriptional initiation.

The response to superoxide is partially built around the reversible oxidation of a sensor, SoxR, which enhances the expression of a regulator, SoxS.

To identify the genes responsive to superoxide and under the control of the SoxS protein, expression arrays were used to measure differences in transcript levels 45 minutes after exposure to paraquat, a generator of superoxide, and SoxS over expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001186-Pomposiello2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Out of 16 known superoxide-regulated genes at the time, 14 significantly increased in the gene array experiments and over a hundred other genes were differentially expressed. Several biological processes in the superoxide response were implicated by these experiments including pathways that reconstitute NADH and NADPH pools, iron transport and storage, sugar and amino acid transport, detoxification, protein modification, osmotic protection, and peptidoglycan synthesis. SoxS-regulated genes identified in these microarray experiments and in past genetic screens do not form complete or even partial pathways, but they may represent key metabolic steps that are sensitive to oxidants.</p><p>Some of the genes implicated in the oxidative stress response by the expression array studies were insensitive to stimulation by paraquat using reporter genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001186-Martin2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The discrepancy may be a consequence of the use of early filter-based hybridization technology with few replicates or differences in environmental conditions and genetic background between the studies.</p><p>Although comprehensive, previous global studies of oxidation-responsive genes have been limited to steady-state measurements sampled at a single time point after long-term exposure to stress. Responses to stress are typically dynamic, self-regulated and often transient, and therefore, the kinetic analysis of gene expression is necessary to characterize transcription under stress. To define the early response to superoxide, and the corresponding role of the SoxRS system, we designed a time series assay to measure genome-wide RNA levels using DNA microarrays. Our experimental approach was to mimic a rapid rise in superoxide levels by the addition of paraquat, a superoxide-producing agent. The RNA levels of isogenic <italic>wild type</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;soxR E. coli</italic> strains were measured every two minutes after exposure to paraquat to monitor the early transcriptional response. This approach allowed the discrimination of SoxR-dependent and independent effects. The data obtained was combined with a set of prior knowledge from databases, and manually added from the literature to build a model of the superoxide response network that includes 226 primary response genes. The role of SoxR-dependent genes in superoxide defense was then tested using precise deletion strains of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of paraquat-induced transcriptional patterns</title><p>To determine the immediate transcriptional response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to superoxide, we conducted a time series assay of the genome-wide mRNA levels immediately following the addition of paraquat (PQ), a redox-cycling agent that produces superoxide intracellularly at the expense of NADPH oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001186-Fridovich1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, given the paucity of knowledge of the biochemical role of most of these genes, there is still a considerable amount of work necessary to assemble an integrated physiological depiction of the superoxide response. As a starting point, we propose three broad functional categories of SoxS-regulated genes that are not adequately represented by the current biological ontologies: (1) NADPH regeneration, (2) removal of xenobiotics and recycling of damaged macromolecules and (3) damage prevention.</p><p>Some of the genes regulated by SoxS that may contribute to NADPH regeneration include: <italic>treF, zwf, pgi, gcd, poxB, ydbK, fldA, fldB, fpr, astD, feaB</italic>, and <italic>fumC</italic>.

Because there are limited methods for determining the significance of clustering results, most researchers further test the biological significance of a small subset of the clustering results through using more traditional gene-by-gene approaches. However, this does not in any way validate the clustering results.</p><p>A common statistical method for testing whether a particular group of genes with a shared function occurs more frequently in a cluster than would be expected based on random sampling of the microarray data set is the application of the hypergeometric distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001186-CastilloDavis1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Our approach uses this statistical test in an iterative fashion to identify statistically significant biological relationships in the clustering results. Our clustering objective for this analysis was to separate the genes likely to be regulated directly by SoxS and those that might be the result of secondary regulation via a SoxS activated regulator. The groupings derived from K-means clustering using Euclidean distance metrics were used because they captured the previously identified SoxS-regulated genes and did not include a cluster containing RpoH-regulated genes, which are likely to be the result of secondary regulation mediated by SoxS through RpoH. It is possible that some genes in the SoxRS regulon are regulated indirectly and that we may have excluded some SoxS-regulated genes from the model that did not have a large response. It is important to note that this statistical test is applied after the clustering analysis and that the prior knowledge of the superoxide response or any other aspect of <italic>E. coli</italic> biology does not bias the clustering methods.</p><p>Although we used clustering methods to define the set of transcripts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001186-g005">Figure 5</xref>, creating the model required manual inspection of the individual gene profiles and integrating particular interactions and transcription factors from the <italic>E. coli</italic> databases and the published literature. SoxR, OxyR, BirA and CysB transcript levels do not change, and would not have been included in the transcriptional model without prior knowledge of their regulatory mechanisms and targets. In addition, the levels of <italic>fur</italic> and <italic>iscR</italic> increase, although their well-established biological roles are as repressors and their target genes are increasing rather than decreasing.</p><p>We also observed that known members of a regulon did not necessarily group in the same cluster. For example, OxyR regulon members were concentrated in cluster 7, but were also part of clusters 5 and 8. Collecting samples more frequently, over a longer time series and with more biological replicates might generate tighter groupings. However, we do not expect all genes in the same regulon to have identical expression patterns. <italic>sodA</italic>, <italic>fur</italic>, <italic>gcd</italic> and <italic>pptA</italic> increase in response to paraquat in the <italic>wild type</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;soxR</italic>, but the paraquat response is much lower in the <italic>&#x00394;soxR</italic> strain. In the clustering results <italic>fur</italic>, <italic>sodA</italic> and <italic>pptA</italic> were part of the SoxR-dependent clusters, while <italic>gcd</italic> groups with the SoxR independent clusters. These observations are consistent with the known regulation of these genes by multiple transcription factors.</p><p>Only 16 out of 226 primary paraquat responsive genes in our transcriptional model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001186-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) were not assigned to a transcription factor. There maybe missing transcription factors in our model, but it seems more likely that these genes belong to the OxyR, IscR, Fur, or CysB regulons. There are genes that have been previously attributed to the Fur regulon that are missing from the model. Some of these genes do not have a strong response within the 10-minute time series, however they may be a part of the Fur regulon that is not expressed in response to superoxide. These results emphasize the importance of using kinetic approaches to study stress responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> responds very rapidly to changes in superoxide levels generating distinct expression patterns within the first 10 minutes. By integrating our microarray time series results with other microarray data, <italic>E. coli</italic> databases and the primary literature, we propose a model of the primary transcriptional response. There is still an enormous amount of work needed to compile an integrated physiological model of the superoxide response, since we do not understand the biochemical roles of most of the SoxS-regulated genes. This will require detailed study of many individual genes.</p><p>While we framed our discussion of the SoxS regulon in terms of NADPH regeneration, removal and recycling of damaged macromolecules and damage prevention, numerous biological processes appear to be affected by superoxide. These processes undoubtedly have multiple control mechanisms, however unlike other transcription factors, SoxS appears to modulate individual points in these processes and does not in general up regulate complete pathways. Many of the genes regulated by SoxS have homologs in the human genome. Thus, we anticipate that there will be many antioxidant mechanisms conserved between bacteria and eukaryotic organisms beyond the known examples of catalases and superoxide dismutases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strain MG1655 was used as <italic>wild type</italic> in all experiments.
