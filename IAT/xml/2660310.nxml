However, recent studies have shown that CNTF exerts effects on glial cells as well as neurons. For instance, CNTF stimulates astrocytes to secrete FGF-2 and rat microglia to secrete glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which suggest that CNTF exerts effects on astrocytes and microglia to promote motor neuron survival indirectly. As CNTF is structurally related to IL-6, which can stimulate immune functions of microglia, we hypothesized that CNTF might exert similar effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed 2-D and 1-D proteomic experiments with western blotting and flow cytometry to examine effects of CNTF on primary microglia derived from neonatal mouse brains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that murine microglia express CNTF receptor &#x003b1; (CNTFR&#x003b1;), which can be induced by interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN&#x003b3;). Whereas IL-6 activated STAT-3 and ERK phosphorylation, CNTF did not activate these pathways, nor did CNTF increase p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation. Using 2-D western blot analysis, we demonstrate that CNTF induced the dephosphorylation of a set of proteins and phosphorylation of a different set. Two proteins that were phosphorylated upon CNTF treatment were the LYN substrate-1 and &#x003b2;-tubulin 5. CNTF weakly stimulated microglia, whereas a stronger response was obtained by adding exogenous soluble CNTFR&#x003b1; (sCNTFR&#x003b1;) as has been observed for IL-6. When used in combination, CNTF and sCNTFR&#x003b1; collaborated with IFN&#x003b3; to increase microglial surface expression of CD40 and this effect was quite pronounced when the microglia were differentiated towards dendritic-like cells. CNTF/sCNTFR&#x003b1; complex, however, failed to increase MHC class II expression beyond that induced by IFN&#x003b3;. The combination of CNTF and sCNTFR&#x003b1;, but not CNTF alone, enhanced microglial Cox-2 protein expression and PGE<sub>2 </sub>secretion (although CNTF was 30 times less potent than LPS). Surprisingly, Cox-2 production was enhanced 2-fold, rather than being inhibited, upon addition of a gp130 blocking antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our studies indicate that CNTF can activate microglia and dendritic-like microglia similar to IL-6; however, unlike IL-6, CNTF does not stimulate the expected signaling pathways in microglia, nor does it appear to require gp130.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS and they exert innate and adaptive immune functions like peripheral macrophages. Normally microglia display a ramified morphology and they act as support cells. When nervous system homeostasis is disturbed by hazardous stimuli, like viruses, bacteria or traumatic injury, microglia become activated and are capable of secreting an array of soluble factors that include cytokines, chemokines and reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Activated microglia can also act as phagocytes to engulf tissue debris and dead cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. They may also become antigen presenting cells (APCs), which present antigenic peptides mounted on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to T lymphocytes to stimulate a cascade of T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These immune properties of microglia are exquisitely regulated by cytokines secreted from T cells. The Th1 cytokine, IFN&#x003b3; can stimulate microglia to increase phagocytosis and expression of MHC class II and CD40 molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], whereas Th2 cytokines, like IL4 and IL-10, can counter-act the effect of IFN&#x003b3; on microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interactions between T cells and microglia are important determinants for the extent of inflammation in the CNS.</p><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS and the expression of antigen presenting molecules on microglia has a pivotal role in the development of MS. Cell-cell interactions mediated by MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, including CD40, B7.1 and B7.2 molecules, expressed on the microglia and T cell receptors (TCR) and specific counter receptors for the co-stimulatory molecules located on the surface of T cells are essential for optimal T cell-APC adhesion and reciprocal activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Studies on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS, show that microglial activation precedes the onset of disease symptoms and the activated microglia exhibit increased expression of MHC class II, CD40 and B7 molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In addition, activated microglia may also express cyclooxygenases (Cox), which are enzymes that generate prostanoids. Prostanoids, including prostaglandins and thromboxanes, are potent factors that can act on a variety of cells and have diverse actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, these factors are short-lived and only act in a paracrine or autocrine manner. Cox-2 is the inducible form of Cox and it is rapidly expressed by microglia in response to injury. Whereas Cox-2 expression is undetectable in microglia in healthy subjects, there is a significant induction of Cox-2 in chronic active MS lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Cox-2 expression has been identified in macrophages/microglia adjacent to damaged oligodendrocytes, suggesting that microglial expression of Cox-2 is involved in the development of demyelination. The metabolites of Cox, prostaglandin D (PGD) and PGE, are at higher concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients in active disease state compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Concentrations of PGE increase sharply before the onset of clinical symptoms and drop during deterioration to return to basal levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These studies suggest that the production of Cox-2 and PGE closely correlate with the development of MS.</p><p>Brain cells can also produce cytokines that modify the extent and nature of neuroinflammatory responses. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a member of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines, is produced following brain injury by astrocytes. Named on the basis of its initially characterized bioactivity, CNTF directly supports the survival of a variety of neuronal populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, CNTF activates astrocytes, promoting their capacity to support neurons and oligodendroglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, the effects of CNTF on microglia have been only partially studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Transgenic mice studies have shown that CNTF is required to maintain motor neurons after birth because CNTF knockout mice develop a progressive loss and atrophy of motor neurons and exhibit reduced muscle strength in adulthood although they are fully viable and developmentally normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Whereas CNTF is regarded as an important injury induced cytokine, cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC), which is a structurally related factor with CNTF and binds to CNTF receptor-&#x003b1; (CNTFR&#x003b1;) leading to activation of gp130, LIF receptor and STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], is developmentally important. Similar to CNTFR&#x003b1; knockout mice, animals with CLC deletion die as neonates from loss of motor neurons affecting the facial nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>In particular, CNTF has been shown to reduce the symptoms of EAE and the absence of CNTF exacerbates the severity of MS disability. MS patients with CNTF null mutations develop disease symptoms at earlier ages with more severe motor disabilities and more relapses compared to individuals who are CNTF heterozygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Similar results are also seen in CNTF knockout mice induced with EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Whereas individuals with a CNTF null mutation develop earlier and more severe disease, being a CNTF null or heterozygote is not a risk factor for developing MS. On the other hand, intravenous injections of CNTF induce acute-phase responses in rat liver cells with increased expression of &#x003b2;-fibrinogen, &#x003b1;-1-antichymotrypsin and &#x003b1;-2-macroglobulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These effects suggest that CNTF might regulate immune responses within the CNS as well.</p><p>Several studies have shown that injecting CNTF directly into the neocortex induces several features of gliosis where astrocytes become hypertrophic with increased GFAP expression and microglia become more ameboid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Studies on cultured rat microglial cells have shown that CNTF can induce low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor and CD4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], suggesting that CNTF can exert direct effects on microglial cells. Indeed, we have recently reported that CNTF-treated rat microglia secreted soluble factors that increase motor neuron survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The goal of the current studies was to elucidate how CNTF regulates the immune functions of murine microglia.</p><p>CNTF belongs to the IL-6 cytokine family, which includes leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), oncostatin-M (OSM) and IL-11. IL-6 family cytokines share glycoprotein 130 (gp130) as a common signal transducer, and similar to other IL-6 cytokines, CNTF may also signal through Janus Kinase (Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The canonical CNTF receptor is a tripartite complex composed of the binding protein for CNTF, the CNTF receptor &#x003b1; (CNTFR&#x003b1;), the LIF receptor (LIFR) and gp130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. CNTFR&#x003b1; is linked to the cell membrane through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage and like other GPI-linked receptors it can be cleaved by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) to create a freely soluble receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The complex formed by sCNTFR&#x003b1; and CNTF can, therefore, serve as agonists for cells that do not express CNTFR&#x003b1;.</p><p>In this study, we first examined whether murine microglia express CNTFR&#x003b1;. Then, we stimulated microglia with CNTF alone or in combination with soluble CNTFR&#x003b1; to determine how the CNTFR&#x003b1; signals. We also investigated whether CNTF regulates antigen presenting molecules and prostaglandins produced by microglia. Cumulatively, our studies indicate that CNTF can activate microglia similar to IL-6, however, unlike IL-6, CNTF does not stimulate expected signal transduction pathways nor does CNTF appear to require gp130 to affect microglia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Recombinant rat CNTF (rrCNTF) was purchased from Alomone (C-245, Jerusalem, Israel), and recombinant mouse IL-6 (rmIL-6, 406-ML-005), recombinant mouse IL-6 receptors (rmIL-6R, 1830-SR-025), recombinant mouse interferon-&#x003b3; (rmIFN&#x003b3;, 485-MI-100) and recombinant mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rmGMCSF, 415-ML-010), were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

The CNTF receptor complex has been described as the CNTFR&#x003b1;, LIFR and gp130 and microglia are known to express LIFR and gp130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, we assessed expression of CNTFR&#x003b1; proteins. The pro-inflammatory cytokine, IFN&#x003b3; is a strong stimulator for microglia and it primes microglia for antigen presentation by increasing expression of a number of cell surface receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that IFN&#x003b3; would upregulate CNTFR&#x003b1; expression in microglia. Primary microglial cultures were prepared and confirmed to be greater than 99% homogenous for CD11b. Unstimulated microglia or microglia that were stimulated with murine IFN&#x003b3; at 1, 10 and 100 ng/mL for 22 hours were analyzed.

The analyses reported herein further reveal that 1) the combination of CNTF and sCNTFR&#x003b1;, but neither alone, induces Cox-2 expression and PGE<sub>2 </sub>secretion from microglia; 2) Neutralizing antibodies against gp130 fail to inhibit CNTF/sCNTFR&#x003b1;-induced Cox-2, and neither CNTF nor CNTF/sCNTFR&#x003b1; activates canonical IL-6 signal transducers, including STAT3 and ERK; 3) CNTF increases the phosphorylation of the Lyn substrate-1 and &#x003b2;-tubulin 5; 4) The combination of CNTF and sCNTFR&#x003b1; collaborate with IFN&#x003b3; to promote CD40, but not MHC class II, expression in microglia and especially in dendritic-like cells.

By contrast, Shapiro <italic>et al</italic>. showed that in human blood mononuclear cells, the combination of CNTF at 3 &#x003bc;g/mL and sCNTFR&#x003b1; suppressed PGE<sub>2 </sub>production and IL-6 showed similar inhibitory effects in their studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. One explanation for this difference in response is that microglia are not simply macrophages that are residing within the CNS. Additionally, since human CNTF, at high concentrations (beyond 50 ng/mL), can bind to IL-6R and induces STAT3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] the inhibitory effect seen in the human mononuclear cells with CNTF may be a result of activating IL-6R. CNTF at nanogram doses does not activate STAT3, which suggests that it does not bind to IL-6R. Therefore, our studies indicate that in murine microglia, CNTF in combination with sCNTFR&#x003b1; promotes Cox-2 and PGE<sub>2 </sub>production.</p><p>The majority of studies to date indicate that CNTF binds to its specific CNTFR&#x003b1; to recruit LIFR and gp130, which leads to activation of JAK/STAT and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

Intriguingly, our studies on microglia strongly suggest that CNTF conveys its signal independent of gp130. It has been shown that p38MAPK mediates the LPS induced Cox-2 expression in microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. However, we did not observe evident phosphorylation of p38MAPK after stimulating murine microglia with CNTF (10 ng/mL)/sCNTFR&#x003b1; (200 ng/mL) for 20 minutes, while LPS (10 ng/mL) induced strong phosphorylation of p38MAPK (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely, that our results are due to endotoxin contamination of the recombinant CNTF we utilized. Nevertheless, LPS is a much stronger inducer of Cox-2 than CNTF/sCNTFR&#x003b1; and thus, it may be that the CNTF/sCNTFR&#x003b1; induced p38MAPK phosphorylation is too low to be detected. Alternatively, it is possible that CNTF/sCNTFR&#x003b1; acts indirectly to induce Cox-2 via phospholipase A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>CNTF has previously been shown to exert pro-inflammatory actions.

CNTFR&#x003b1; is GPI-linked to cell membranes and is released from skeletal muscles after nerve injury, and the concentration of sCNTFR&#x003b1; is elevated in the CSF of patients with lupus, ALS and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. These data suggest that sCNTFR&#x003b1; is an injury-induced signal and is involved in central and peripheral responses to injury. It has been shown that sCNTFR&#x003b1; alone or in combination with CNTF can serve as a chemoattractant for macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Thus, our results were not completely unexpected.</p><p>Although the conventional view of sCNTFR&#x003b1; is that it conveys signals of CNTF for cells that do not express CNTFR&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], a recent study revealed that a complex formed between CNTF and sCNTFR&#x003b1; promotes neurite outgrowth and regulates expression of several neurotrophic genes on neurons, whereas CNTF alone was without effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. In agreement with this study, our studies show that although microglia respond to CNTF, the complex formed by CNTF and sCNTFR&#x003b1; effectively promotes Cox-2, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and CD40 production in microglia whereas CNTF alone is with little effect. Interestingly, the effect of CNTF and sCNTFR&#x003b1; was more pronounced in the dendritic-like microglia than in the microglial cultures, which suggests that dendritic-like microglia respond more strongly to CNTF/sCNTFR&#x003b1;. Whereas, exogenous CNTF administration has been shown to exert protective effects in MS and EAE, our data and those of others would caution against the use of CNTF as a neuroprotective agent in that the inflammatory side effects subsequent to delivery may limit the clinical usefulness of administering CNTF in treating neurodegenerative diseases, especially where there is an inflammatory component.</p><p>Our data show that CNTF does not activate STAT3 and ERK pathways in microglia. In contrast, Krady <italic>et al</italic>. (2008) showed that rrCNTF elicits a modest increase in STAT3 phosphorylation in rat microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Initially we surmised that the difference in responsiveness was species related, however, subsequent to careful analyses the discrepancy between those data and the data reported herein can be attributed to differences in the purity of the microglial cultures. Rat microglial cultures are typically enriched by incubating non-adherent cells obtained from mixed glial cultures on bacteriological dishes. Incubating rat microglia on bacteriological dishes for 10 minutes (our protocol) instead of 40 minutes (previous protocol) increases the purity of the microglial cultures from 90% to 99% as determined by CD11b and A2B5 staining. In these highly enriched rat microglial cultures STAT3 is not phosphorylated following CNTF treatment whereas in the less enriched microglial cultures CNTF induces STAT3 phosphorylation. This STAT3 signaling likely results from activation with the contaminating oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) and, to a smaller degree, astrocytes. We also assessed whether soluble factors secreted from OPCs and/or astrocytes promote microglial STAT3 phosphorylation in response to CNTF. To do so, highly enriched rat microglia were cultured in oligodendrocyte or astrocyte-conditioned media overnight followed by CNTF treatment for 20 minutes. As expected, CNTF failed to elicit STAT3 phosphorylation whether exposed to OPC or astrocyte-conditioned medium (unpublished data). Altogether, our studies demonstrate that CNTF does not elicit STAT3 phosphorylation in either rat or murine microglia, much to our surprise.</p><p>In summary, although CNTF is known for its trophic effects on neurons and oligodendrocytes, it also regulates neuroinflammation. Our results shed light on how CNTF in combination with its soluble receptor serves as a pro-inflammatory signal to enhance central and peripheral immune responses. In particular, our data show that CNTF serves as a weak pro-inflammatory signal to enhance the production of Cox-2, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and CD40 in microglia. CNTF was evaluated in clinical trials, which were halted due to unexpected side effects. Our results provide new data and new insights into possible complications of utilizing CNTF as a therapeutic treatment for motor neuron diseases. In particular, in addition to the weight loss that has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. CNTF treatment could raise central and peripheral immune responses and lead to a more inflamed environment, which may counteract its trophic activity on neurons and oligodendrocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>LIF: leukemia inhibitory factor; CNTF: ciliary neurotrophic factor; CNTFR&#x003b1;: CNTF receptor &#x003b1;: IFN&#x003b3;: interferon-&#x003b3;; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; JAK: Janus kinases; STAT: signal transducers and activators of transcription; APC: antigen presenting cell; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; MS: multiple sclerosis; EAE: experimental animal encephalomyelitis; AD: Alzheimer's disease; GMCSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor; gp130: glycoprotein 130; Cox-2: cyclooxygenase-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>H-WL participated in the design of the study, prepared the primary cultures, performed western blot and flow cytometry, PGE2 ELISA analyses, and prepared the manuscript.
