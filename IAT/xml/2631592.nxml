H1 histones, also called linker histones, stabilize compact, higher order structures of chromatin. In addition to their role as structural proteins, they actively regulate gene expression and participate in chromatin-based processes like DNA replication and repair. The epigenetic contribution of H1 histones to these mechanisms makes it conceivable that they also take part in malignant transformation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Based on results of a Blast data base search which revealed an accumulation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of H1x in libraries from neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), we evaluated the expression of H1x in NETs from lung and the gastrointestinal tract using immunohistochemisty. Relative protein and mRNA levels of H1x were analysed by Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Since several reports describe a change of the expression level of the replacement subtype H1.0 during tumourigenesis, the analysis of this subtype was included in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found an increased expression of H1x but not of H1.0 in NET tissues in comparison to corresponding normal tissues. Even though the analysed NETs were heterogenous regarding their grade of malignancy, all except one showed a considerably higher protein amount of H1x compared with corresponding non-neoplastic tissue. Furthermore, double-labelling of H1x and chromogranin A in sections of pancreas and small intestine revealed that H1x is highly expressed in neuroendocrine cells of these tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the high expression of histone H1x in NETs is probably due to the abundance of this protein in the cells from which these tumours originate.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The nuclear DNA of eukaryotic cells is organised as chromatin in association with proteins. The basal structural organisation unit of chromatin is the nucleosome consisting of the nucleosome core particle, linker DNA and histone H1. The nucleosome core particle is composed of two molecules of each of the four core histones which form an octamer around which DNA with a length of 146 base pairs is wrapped. These nucleosome cores are connected by linker DNA of variable length. H1 histones are positioned at the linker DNA between the nucleosome cores and therefore they are also called linker histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To date, eleven H1 homologous proteins have been described in humans, including the ubiquitously expressed subtype H1x [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Comparison of the biochemical behaviour of H1x with other H1 subtypes revealed similarities but also showed characteristic variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The regulation of the <italic>H1x </italic>gene expression differs from that of the replication-dependent main class subtypes, but also from that of the replacement subtype H1.0. Interestingly, the activity of H1x seems to be controlled not only on level of expression, but also by a cell-cycle-dependent change of its intranuclear distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>H1 histones actively regulate chromatin processes such as gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Aberrations in such epigenetic mechanisms can be associated with malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since histone H1 modulates both chromatin structure and transcriptional activity, it is conceivable that H1 histones may contribute to epigenetic phenomena leading to malignant transformation. Change of the H1 subtype composition during tumourigenesis has been described in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A greater number of these reports deals with the replacement H1 subtype H1.0. Some of these data showed an increase of H1.0, others demonstrated a decrease in comparison to the paired normal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. During our studies on characteristics of the H1 subtype H1x, a Blast data base search revealed an accumulation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of H1x in libraries from neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). NETs are a very heterogenous group of rare epithelial tumours that originate from neuroendocrine cells and mostly occur in the gastrointestinal tract and in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the present study we investigated the occurrence of H1x in cells of NET tissues using immunohistochemistry and compared the expression of H1x in NETs with that in paired normal tissue on protein and on mRNA level using Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Furthermore, double labelling of H1x and chromogranin A, a marker for neuroendocrine cells, of sections from normal tissue of pancreas and small intestine revealed that H1x is highly expressed in neuroendocrine cells of these tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Data base searches were carried out with the Blast program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi"/>.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumour samples</title><p>Snap-frozen as well as formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumour samples from 13 primary NETs and from 1 liver metastasis of a NET were recruited.

The 1 &#x003bc;m thick sections were mounted on sialanised slides, dewaxed, rehydrated and antigen-retrieved in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 45 min in a pressure cooker. The following steps were carried out using the Dako Cytomation ChemMate Detection Kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) according to the manufacturer's description. The sections were probed with affinity-purified anti-H1x antibody at a final concentration of 1.5 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] or anti-chromogranin A antibody (DAK-A3, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) in a 1:150 dilution.

Antigen-retrieval was done by incubation in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 45 min at 95&#x000b0;C. Sections were permeabilised with 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS for 45 min and blocked by incubation with 3% BSA in TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T). Sections were then incubated with the following primary antibodies: Affinity-purified anti-H1x antibody at a final concentration of 1.5 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] or anti-chromogranin A antibody (DAK-A3, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) in a 1:150 dilution.

Thereafter, sections were rinsed in TBS (3 &#x000d7; 5 min), dehydrated and cleared in xylol. The nuclei were visualised with the fluorochrome 4'-6-diamidine-2-phenyl indole (DAPI) using Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA). For fluorescence microscopy an Axioskop (Zeiss, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany) was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Histone extraction</title><p>Purification of whole histones from snap-frozen tissue samples was done using sulfuric acid. 100 mg tissue was homogenised in 1 ml PBS, containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) using an ultra turrax. Sulfuric acid was added (final concentration 0.2 M) to the homogenate, and histone extraction was done by incubation for one hour on ice. Samples were centrifuged (10 min, 4&#x000b0;C, 14,000 &#x000d7; g) and the acid-soluble proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with a final concentration of 20% TCA (w/v) for one hour.

The histones were dissolved in 30 mM HCl.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Histones were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Uniform blotting was checked by staining the nitrocellulose filter with Ponceau S (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). Blots were probed with polyclonal H1x-specific antiserum in a 1:5000 dilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], anti-H1.2 antibody (#ab17677, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in a 1:1000 dilution or a mouse monoclonal anti-H1.0 antibody (kindly provided by Prof. H.

Stripping of blotting membranes for reprobing was done by incubation of the membranes in stripping buffer (100 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) for 30 min at 50&#x000b0;C with occasional agitation. Bands on the ECL film were quantified with the 1Dscan Ex gel analysis software (Scanalytics, Rockville, USA). The ratios of H1x and H1.0 to H1.2 were calculated, and the mean values of the non-neoplastic tissues were set to 1 to show the fold-change difference of the protein amounts in the NETs.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen tissue material with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's manual and dissolved in RNase-free water.

Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies) was used to generate first strand cDNA from 5 &#x003bc;g RNA per sample according to the manual. 125 ng of random hexamer primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 40 U of RNasIn ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) were applied per sample. H1 subtype expression was analyzed with quantitative real-time RT-PCR using gene-specific primers (H1x, primer A, CCCAACGATGTAGCGTTTTT, primer B, AAGGCCGAGAGCCAATAGA, amplicon length, 80 bp; H1.2, primer A, GCCACTTGTACCCGAGTTTT, primer B, TTCTTCTTTACAGGGGCCTTC, amplicon length, 99 bp). Triplicate PCRs were run in an iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany) using the Eurogentec qPCR Core kit for SYBR Green I No ROX (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and gene-specific primers in a final concentration of 300 nmol/l. The temperature profile consisted of (i) an initial step at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min; (ii) 40 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 60 s; and (iii) a final melting curve analysis with a temperature ramp from 60 to 95&#x000b0;C and a heating rate of 3&#x000b0;C/min. PCR efficiencies were calculated with a relative standard curve derived from a cDNA mixture (a twofold dilution series with seven measuring points in triplicates) and gave regression coefficients &#x0003e;0.95 and reproducible primer-specific efficiencies of 84&#x02013;99%. Gene-specific amplification was confirmed by a single peak in melting curve analysis and a single band in agarose gel electrophoresis. No template controls (no cDNA in PCR) and genomic controls (no enzyme in reverse transcription) were run for each gene to detect unspecific and genomic amplification or primer dimerisation. Gene expression levels were determined by relative quantification using the expression of histone <italic>H1.2 </italic>for normalization.

In comparison, searches with the sequences of H1.0 and H1.2 showed no clustering of EST entries in any library (data not shown). As a consequence of this result we decided to investigate the occurrence of H1x in NETs from the lung and the gastrointestinal tract by immunohistochemistry. Sections of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas of lung and small intestine as well as of well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of pancreas were used (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Staining of these sections with affinity-purified H1x-antibody resulted in an intensive and uniform immunoreaction of the tumour cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Histones were extracted by acid extraction from snap-frozen tumour material of neuroendocrine tumours and of the corresponding normal tissue.

In tissues from lung and small intestine a strikingly higher protein level of H1x was observed in the tumour tissues compared to the non-neoplastic tissues (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A/B</xref>, lung, small intestine). Regarding the pancreas, one of the non-neoplastic tissues showed a relatively high protein level of H1x whereas in the second sample from normal tissue the amount of H1x was very low (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 15 and 16). Even in a liver metastasis of a pancreatic well-differentiated carcinoma, the level of H1x was higher than in non-neoplastic liver tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 22 and 23). In conclusion the H1x level was higher in the NET tissues than in the normal tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, no increase in H1.0 protein level in NETs compared to non-neoplastic tissues was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, H1.0). The amount of H1.0 in the NET tissues was partially lower (e.g. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3) and partially higher (e.g. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 5 and 14) than in the corresponding normal tissues. This observation fits the result of earlier studies which either found an increase or a decrease of H1.0 in tumour tissues in comparison to the paired normal tissues (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Relative protein amounts of the H1 histone subtypes H1x, H1.2 and H1.0 in non-neoplastic and neuroendocrine tumour tissues</bold>.

The ratios of H1x and H1.0 to the main-class subtype H1.2 were calculated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A significantly higher expression of H1x in the NETs of lung and small intestine compared to the non-neoplastic tissues was found. However, in the tissue samples of pancreas no difference in the H1x expression but a decrease of the H1.0 expression was observed. Since high protein amounts of H1x have been determined in the NETs of pancreas by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, this result may be explained by a differential protein turnover or varied kinetics of transcription and translation like is has been described for the subtype H1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Box plot presentation of the relative RNA levels of H1x and H1.0 determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR</bold>.

To answer this question, indirect immunofluorescence double-labelling of H1x and chromogranin A was performed. Chromogranin A, a marker protein for neuroendocrine cells, is a secretory granin protein that is co-stored and co-released with peptides and amines. It seems to be crucial for the formation of secretory granules and sequestration of hormones in neuroendocrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In pancreatic tissue, scattered chromogranin A-positive cells show a high protein amount of histone H1x compared to the surrounding chromogranin A-negative cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Interestingly, endocrine cells of islets of Langerhans also exhibit a relatively high expression of H1x (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Double-labelling of sections of small intestine revealed that the chromogranin A-positive neuroendocrine cells contain higher levels of H1x than the surrounding cells of the glandulae intestinales (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). However, an abundance of H1x was also observed in some cells of the stroma of the villi. Unfortunalely, analysis of lung tissue with immunofluorescence labelling was not possible, since lung sections display a very strong autofluorescence which is mainly caused by elastin fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Indirect immunofluorescence detection of H1x and chromogranin A in sections of paraffin wax-embedded samples from pancreas and small intestine</bold>. Chromogranin A (CgA) was used as a marker protein for neuroendocrine cells which show scattered location in these tissues.

Thus, the high expression of histone H1x in NETs is probably due to the high expression of this protein in the cells from which these tumours originated. Further research into molecular mechanisms by which H1x exerts its function is needed to find out whether this increased expression is linked to the endocrine function of these cells and/or whether this H1 subtype participates in the tumourigenesis of NETs.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JW performed the immunohistochemistry, designed the primers, carried out the quantitative real-time RT-PCR, participated in the Western blot analysis and corrected the manuscript.
