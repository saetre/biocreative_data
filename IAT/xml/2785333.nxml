Comparison of gene expression profiles of nonmodified human preadipocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 4) with the parallel TSHR* population revealed significant up-regulation of 27 genes including hyaluronan (HA) synthases (HAS) 1 and 2. The array data were confirmed by quantitative PCR of HAS1 and HAS2 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurement of HA; all values were significantly increased (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.03) in TSHR*-expressing preadipocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Preadipocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 8) treated with dibutyryl (db)-cAMP display significantly increased HAS1 and HAS2 transcripts, HAS2 protein, and HA production (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02). HAS1 or HAS2 small interfering RNA treatment of db-cAMP-stimulated preadipocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 4) produced 80% knockdown in HAS1 or 61% knockdown in HAS2 transcripts (compared with scrambled), respectively; the corresponding HA production was reduced by 49 or 38%. Reporter assays using A293 cells transfected with HAS1 promoter-driven plasmids containing or not containing the proximal CRE and treated with db-cAMP revealed that it is functional. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, using a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein antibody, of db-cAMP-treated preadipocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 4) yielded products for HAS1 and HAS2 with relative fold increases of 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.8 and 2.6 &#x000b1; 0.9, respectively. HA accumulates in adipose/connective tissues of patients with thyroid dysfunction. We investigated the contributions of TSH and thyroid-stimulating antibodies and obtained small (9&#x02013;24%) but significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) increases in preadipocyte HA production with both ligands. Similar results were obtained with a TSHR monoclonal antibody lacking biological activity (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). We conclude that TSHR activation is implicated in HA production in preadipocytes, which, along with thyroid hormone level variation, explains the HA overproduction in thyroid dysfunction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> is a G-protein-coupled receptor, which, in addition to its well characterized role in controlling thyrocyte function and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), has been shown to be up-regulated during lineage-specific differentiation of adult precursors found in bone marrow and adipose tissue, <italic>e.g.</italic> preadipocyte adipogenesis to mature fat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). To investigate a potential role in these tissues, we performed microarray analyses of human preadipocytes transduced with a gain-of-function mutant TSHR and the equivalent nonmodified populations. Hyaluronan synthases 1 and 2 (HAS1 and HAS2) are two of the three synthases that produce hyaluronan (HA) and were among a small number of genes whose expression was significantly increased in the mutant TSHR population.</p><p>HA is a ubiquitous linear polysaccharide component of the extracellular matrix, which influences cellular proliferation and migration following injury and plays an important biological role in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and the phenotypic transformation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). HA occupies a large hydrodynamic volume acting as a lubricant, support, and cushion in different tissues. It is synthesized on the inner surface of the plasma membrane and extruded to the extracellular matrix by three differentially regulated HAS enzymes about the control of which very little is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). HAS1 has a tissue-specific expression, being present, for example, in dermal fibroblasts but absent in oral mucosal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>); HAS2 is inducible, and HAS3 is constitutively expressed in most cell types.</p><p>The skin and adipose/connective tissue of individuals with thyroid dysfunction accumulate glycosaminoglycans (GAG), predominantly HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). HA is hydrophilic and thus generates the widespread build-up of mucopolysaccharide that produces edema in hypothyroidism. In contrast, the deposition of HA is assumed to be more localized in hyperthyroid conditions such as Graves disease (GD) in which the orbital and pretibial regions are the most affected and can result in Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) and pretibial myxoedema, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The major cause of thyroid dysfunction is autoimmunity, and several immunomodulators, <italic>e.g.</italic> interleukin-1 and transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (both macrophage products), can induce/enhance HA production <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Furthermore, serum IgG from patients with GD can induce hyaluronan production in cultured GD (but not normal) fibroblasts. The effect appears to be mediated by the receptor for IGF-1 and related activating antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Activation of the TSHR occurs in most patients with thyroid dysfunction through thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAB) in hyperthyroid GD or elevated TSH in hypothyroidism. In light of our array data, we hypothesize that TSAB or supraphysiological TSH target and activate the TSHR and stimulate the overproduction of HA. We report our findings on HA production in response to activation and/or cross-linking of the TSHR achieved using ligands and gain-of-function TSHR mutations naturally occurring in toxic adenoma and familial hyperthyroidism (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p>All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and tissue culture components were from Cambrex unless otherwise stated.</p><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Adipose Tissue Collection and Preparation</title><p>Adipose tissue was collected with informed consent and local research ethics committee approval from several depots: orbit (<italic>n</italic> = 12, 9 patients with GO all undergoing decompressive surgery and having inactive disease with a clinical activity score below 2) and nonorbit (<italic>n</italic> = 11, predominantly subcutaneous from patients undergoing elective open abdominal surgery for nonmetabolic conditions).</p><p>Orbital preadipocytes were obtained from adipose tissue explants,, and nonorbital preadipocytes were obtained by collagenase digest, both as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

This is clinically relevant, because patients across the spectrum of thyroid dysfunction demonstrate alterations in the quality and quantity of GAG present in their skin. In both hyper- and hypothyroidism, the predominant GAG is HA, leading to accumulation of mucin deposits in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The condition is generalized in hypothyroidism but localized, mainly to the pretibial region and orbit, in hyperthyroid GD. The histological changes are similar in the two conditions and in hypothyroidism respond swiftly to thyroxine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), leading to the suggestion that reduced thyroid hormone rather than TSH excess is responsible.</p><p>Smith <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) demonstrated that thyroid hormones exert a negative effect on GAG synthesis in human skin fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> and support earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

However, the absence of thyroid hormone inhibition of HAS expression cannot explain the skin changes in GD, and thyroxine replacement, in addition to raising circulating T4, will also lower TSH. Furthermore, one of us has previously reported the presence of TSHR transcripts and immunostaining in various adipose tissues and pretibial skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).

Preadipocytes from all sites induced to express constitutively active TSHR had higher levels of HAS1 and HAS2 TCN, leading to increased HA in the culture medium, when compared with their nonmodified counterparts. We are aware that the introduction of constitutively active TSHR mutants into the preadipocytes has the disadvantage that all cells will express the receptor and hence experience increased intracellular cAMP levels. Although it can indicate the likely impact of signaling via the TSHR on processes such as, for example, adipogenesis or production of extracellular matrix, it does not accurately replicate the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation in which far fewer preadipocyte fibroblasts express the receptor.</p><p>In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) we reported that 1&#x02013;5% of freshly isolated preadipocytes (orbital and subcutaneous) express the TSHR when assessed using immunocytochemistry. All of our current experiments were conducted using low passage cells, and we have confirmed the presence of TSHR transcripts in all of them using QPCR (data not shown). The increase in HA induced by TSHR ligands was more modest than that obtained in the activating TSHR-expressing cells (9&#x02013;24% <italic>versus</italic> 24&#x02013;42%). Given the expected difference in the proportion of cells expressing the TSHR in the two conditions, one might have expected a larger differential.</p><p>In previous studies examining the transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1-dependent differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts we have identified a central involvement of increases in extracellular and pericellular HA, whether this results from increased HA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) or decreased HA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This HA accumulation is essential but not sufficient on its own for differentiation to occur. It is not yet clear whether the same HA dependence will be a feature of phenotypic changes induced by the mechanisms described here, and this will be the subject of future studies.</p><p>The level of HA increase we obtained with bovine TSH is similar to that previously reported by one of us for dermal fibroblasts, although in the earlier study recombinant human TSH failed to elicit a response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Similarly Smith and Hoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) examined orbital fibroblasts from a single GO patient; TSH did not increase HA generation. A later study from the same group reported no increase in HA production by human thyrocytes in response to recombinant TSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), although their findings are at variance with those of several other authors who observed increased synthesis of HA in pig or rat thyroid cells in response to the hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). There are differences between the studies using nonthyroidal cells that merit comment. We have used preadipocyte fibroblasts of low passage number from adipose tissue, in contrast to dermal or orbital fibroblasts of unspecified passage number. Although we have not examined the effect of recombinant TSH, the similar level of HA increase induced by a second TSHR agonist, a monoclonal TSAB, adds significant weight to the finding. Although previous workers have found no effect of serum immunoglobulins from GD patients on fibroblast HA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), we are unaware of any studies that have examined the effect of a monoclonal TSAB.</p><p>We were surprised to observe that a TSHR monoclonal antibody devoid of bioactivity, 3G4 (recognizes a linear epitope in the N terminus of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), was also able to induce HA production. The result suggests an alternative signal transduction pathway consequent to TSHR cross-linking. A simple interaction between the Fc region of the monoclonal antibody with the Fc receptor was eliminated by the absence of HA increase when the cells were incubated with other nonagonist monoclonal antibodies such as BA8 (recognizes the TSHR three-dimensional conformation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and mAb 47 (binds a linear epitope in thyroid peroxidase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>The responses of normal and GO orbital preadipocyte fibroblasts differed. All GO patients will have received previous treatment with corticosteroids, and thus the most active components, <italic>e.g.</italic> TSHR-expressing cells, may already have been depleted. This could explain the difference in response to TSH and the monoclonal TSAB reported here and the absence of response reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Furthermore, orbital preadipocyte fibroblasts are distinct as illustrated by their reduced responsiveness to the T3-induced inhibition of GAG accumulation <italic>in vitro</italic> when compared with cells from the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>The relevance of the main TSHR signaling cascade to the process is illustrated by the robust increase in HA in the culture medium and in HAS1 and 2 TCN obtained when cells were treated with the cAMP mimetic, db-cAMP. Our results confirm two earlier studies; Tomida <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) reported that cAMP increases HA activity in rat fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> and in the rat thyroid cell line FRTL5 TSH stimulated GAG synthesis, with the effect being reproduced by db-cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). This led us to investigate the proximal promoters of the HAS1 and HAS2 genes. Both contain full site CREs, but only the former is predicted to be active, because it is located within the first 200 bp from the transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The first point of note was that the &#x02212;201 construct (which contains the CRE) appears to comprise a minimal promoter, because it produced an &#x0223c;10-fold increase in light output, compared with the empty vector, in all four cell types. In contrast, it was only in the A293 cells that we were able to observe a clear increase in light output in response to db-cAMP and forskolin. Both agents induced a 2&#x02013;4-fold increase in light output, and this was restricted to the construct containing the intact CRE. The HAS1 gene promoter lacks a tata box. Previous workers have identified HAS1 as a potential target for regulation by cAMP. They undertook functional measurements of several other target genes (excluding HAS1) described as tata-less and found that all responded to cAMP with a 2&#x02013;4-fold increase in transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The results we obtained are in keeping with this finding and suggest that HAS1 transcription is indeed regulated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, and the results of our ChIP assays illustrate that it has <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance. The same method indicates that the HAS2 promoter full site CRE is also functional.</p><p>In conclusion, in addition to the well documented negative effect of thyroid hormone, our results indicate that &#x0201c;pathological&#x0201d; TSHR activation plays a role in regulating production of the extracellular matrix component HA by preadipocyte fibroblasts isolated from various fat depots. By pathological we refer to the receptor activation occurring in GD patients in response to TSAB or in hypothyroid patients with compensatory elevated TSH. The mechanism is likely to be of less importance in healthy euthyroid individuals. The study may provide an explanation for the disordered production of HA occurring in patients with thyroid dysfunction that leads to widespread myxoedema or localized HA accumulation, features of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroid GD, respectively.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by a grant from the Wellcome Trust.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN2"><label>2</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">TSHR</term><def><p>thyrotropin receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">TSAB</term><def><p>thyroid-stimulating antibodies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">mAb</term><def><p>monoclonal antibody</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">HA</term><def><p>hyaluronan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">HAS</term><def><p>HA synthase(s)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">QPCR</term><def><p>quantitative PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">ELISA</term><def><p>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">siRNA</term><def><p>small interfering RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">db</term><def><p>dibutyryl cAMP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">CRE</term><def><p>cAMP-responsive element</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">CREB</term><def><p>CRE-binding protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">GAG</term><def><p>glycosaminoglycan(s)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">GD</term><def><p>Graves disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">GO</term><def><p>Graves ophthalmopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G15">CM</term><def><p>complete medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G16">ChIP</term><def><p>chromatin immunoprecipitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G17">TCN</term><def><p>transcript copy numbers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G18">APRT</term><def><p>adenosine phosphoribosyl transferase.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We greatly appreciate the gift of monoclonal antibodies (IRISAB2, BA8, and 3G4) from Dr. Sabine Costagliola (Institut de Recherche Interdisciplinaire en Biologie Humaine et Moleculaire, Brussels, Belgium) and of mAb 47 from Dr. Pierre Caryon (INSERM U555, Marseille, France).
