This shortened form possesses normal or somewhat enhanced polymerase activity and its significance is unknown. We report here that caspase-3 and calpain can form p140 from p261 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and that during early stages of apoptosis induced in Jurkat cells by staurosporine or anti-Fas-activating antibody, p261 is cleaved into p140 by caspase-3. At later stages, activated calpain might also contribute to this conversion. The sites of cleavage by caspase-3 have been identified, and mutations at these &#x02018;DEAD boxes&#x02019; resulted in cleavage-resistant enzyme. Cleavage at these sites separates the &#x02018;N-terminal catalytic core&#x02019; from the &#x02018;C-terminal&#x02019; regions described for p261. Cleavage does not occur during necrosis or following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or methanesulfonic acid methyl ester. p140 is unlikely to be able to functionally replace p261 <italic>in vivo</italic>, since it does not bind to PCNA or the other pol &#x0025b; subunits.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human DNA polymerase epsilon (pol &#x0025b;) is composed of a catalytic subunit of molecular weight 261 000 (p261) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c1">1</xref>), and three smaller subunits, p59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c2">2</xref>), p17 and p12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c3">3</xref>). Human p261 shares 39&#x00025; overall identity with the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> pol &#x0025b; catalytic subunit, Pol2p, with three distinctive homology regions: the &#x02018;N-terminal domain&#x02019;, amino acid residues 1&#x02013;267 with 26.8&#x00025; identity; the &#x02018;core catalytic domain&#x02019;, residues 268&#x02013;1166 (which include the conserved pol-&#x003b1; family motifs) with 63.0&#x00025; identity; the &#x02018;C-terminal domain&#x02019;, residues 1167&#x02013;2285 with 25.0&#x00025; identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c1">1</xref>).

Human pol &#x0025b; has been crosslinked to newly-synthesized, photolabeled chromosomal DNA in SV40-infected mammalian cells along with pol &#x003b1; and pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c13">13</xref>), indicating an involvement in DNA replication. In addition, pol &#x0025b; has been identified as a repair factor in human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c15">15</xref>), as well as the DNA polymerase component of the recombination complex, RC-1, from calf thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c16">16</xref>). Pol &#x0025b; can also function as a repair factor in an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted nucleotide excision repair complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c17">17</xref>).</p><p>Human pol &#x0025b; from HeLa cells was initially observed to contain the p261 catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c18">18</xref>); however, a smaller form, p140, is normally observed in enzyme from calf thymus, chicken thymus and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c20">20</xref>) and has also been observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c21">21</xref>). p140 is derived from p261 and contains catalytic activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> polymerase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c20">20</xref>). Trypsinization of purified HeLa p261 results in two polypeptide fragments with molecular masses of 122 and 136&#x000a0;kDa. p122 possessed polymerase activity and was resistant to further proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c20">20</xref>). Trypsin treatment of p140 purified from calf thymus also produces p122. Therefore, both p140 and p122 contain the catalytic core of p261 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c4">4</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that in Jurkat cells, p140 appears only during apoptosis. Both caspase-3 and calpain can mediate the cleavage of pol &#x0025b; p261 to produce p140, but the involvement of calpain occurs much later than that of caspase-3. Both caspase-3 and calpain cleavage occur at the junction between the previously proposed p261 catalytic domain and the C-terminal domains, and therefore effectively separate the catalytic core from the binding sites of the pol &#x0025b; accessory subunits and PCNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies, inhibitors and cell culture</title><p>Purified mouse monoclonal IgGs against DNA pol &#x0025b; p261 (3C5.1) and p59 (3A5.6) were used for immunoblotting as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c2">2</xref>).

Both products would be recognized by the 3C5.1 monoclonal antibody. Cleavage at either or both of these sites would separate the core catalytic domain of p261 (residues 268&#x02013;1166) from the C-terminal domain (residues 1167&#x02013;2285). Since the accessory subunits (p59, p17 and p12) as well as PCNA interact with the C-terminal domain of p261 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c7">7</xref>), calpain cleavage would also separate the catalytic region of pol &#x0025b; from the binding sites for its accessory subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>p261 can be cleaved by calpain <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>When Jurkat cells were treated with the calcium ionophore A23187 to activate calpain <italic>in vivo</italic>, pol &#x0025b; p261 was cleaved into a 140-kDa fragment that was recognized by antibody 3C5.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f3">3</xref>A). The treatment of Jurkat cells by A23187 did not induce apoptosis, as shown by the non-cleavage of 115-kDa PARP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f3">3</xref>B), a hallmark protein that is degraded by caspase-3 to produce a 86-kDa fragment during apoptosis (see below). The appearance of p140 correlated with the substantial activation of calpain, which was manifested by the autocleavage of calpain II from its 28-kDa proform to produce the 18-kDa activated form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f3">3</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>p261 is degraded into p140 during apoptosis</title><p>A p140 fragment of pol &#x0025b; was also observed by immunoblotting during staurosporine-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c37">37</xref>) of Jurkat cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f4">4</xref>A). This appearance started at about the same time as nucleosomal DNA ladder formation, i.e. &#x0223c;2 h after the addition of staurosporine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f4">4</xref>F). This time-course is similar to that reported for the proteolysis of the p140 subunit of the DNA replication factor C (DSEB&#x0002f;RF-C140) during apoptosis of Jurkat cells, which started at the same time as DNA ladder formation, but &#x0223c;1 h later than the onset of PARP cleavage (38). In our experiments p140 cleavage was detected about half an hour later than the detection of PARP cleavage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f4">4</xref>B). (This slight difference could be real or it could be apparent, due to differences in the relative abundances of the two antigens and&#x0002f;or their antibody affinities.)</p><p>The p59 subunit of pol &#x0025b; was not observed to be degraded in the first 3 h after apoptosis induction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f4">4</xref>C). The p59 pol &#x0025b; subunit was observed, however, to be degraded during the later stages of apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f4">4</xref>C). It has been predicted that degradation of p59 might occur due to its possession of an L2G box, which has been implicated in the E3-ubiquitin ligase&#x0002f;E6-AP mediated ubiquitination&#x0002f;degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c39">39</xref>).</p><p>After stripping and reprobing the same nitrocellulose membrane with a polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f4">4</xref>D), we also observed activation of caspase-3 that started 1.5 h after apoptosis induction, as shown by the appearance of the 17-kDa activated form of caspase-3. The fragmentation of both PARP (40,41) and DSEB&#x0002f;RF-C140 (38) in apoptotic Jurkat cells has been attributed to the activation of caspase-3.</p><p>Activation of calpain II, on the other hand, occurred at a much later stage of apoptosis, between 3 and 9 h after induction of apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f4">4</xref>E). Caspase-mediated calpain activation has also been observed only in later stages of drug 9-AC-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c42">42</xref>). In addition, the calpain-specific inhibitor, calpastatin, has been shown to be degraded by caspases in staurosporine or anti-Fas-reactive antibody activated apoptosis of Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c43">43</xref>). Degradation of calpastatin, which produced a &#x0003c;2-fold increase of calpain activity in the study, could provide another mechanism for activating calpain during apoptosis. Since substantial disappearance of p261 corresponded to the time of activation of calpain II, complete degradation of p261 might require the participation of calpain at later stages of apoptosis.</p><p>The p140 fragment could also be detected during apoptosis induced in Jurkat cells by treatment with 0.5 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml anti-Fas-activating antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c44">44</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f5">5</xref>, top panel). Calpain inhibitors ZLLY-CHN2, CI-I and CI-II did not prevent apoptosis, as indicated by the degradation of PARP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f5">5</xref>, bottom panel) and the appearance of p140, confirming that calpain is not the cleaving enzyme during early stages of apoptosis. On the other hand, the general caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk prevented the occurrence of apoptosis, as indicated by intact PARP, and it likewise prevented the degradation of pol &#x0025b; p261.</p><p>In control experiments (data not shown) the same levels of inhibitors as were used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f5">5</xref> were added to Jurkat cells and then after 30 min the cells were incubated with 4 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml of A23187 for 2 h in order to induce calpain activation in the absence of apoptosis as in the experiment of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f3">3</xref>. The cells were then harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting. These results verified that in this case p140 was observed only in the absence of calpain inhibitors. The general caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk, did not inhibit calpain II activation (autocleavage to generate the 18 kDa active form) and cleavage of p261 was also observed in its presence. On the other hand, no p140 was detected in the presence of any of the three calpain inhibitors, nor was there activation of calpain. These controls verify that at the levels used, the calpain inhibitors do inhibit the calpain-dependent cleavage of pol &#x0025b; and that the level of ZVAD-fmk used does not inhibit the calpains. Hence, the data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f5">5</xref>, along with these controls, suggest strongly that caspase(s) is(are) the p261-cleaving enzyme(s) during the early stages of apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage of p261 is not found during necrosis or following treatment with the DNA damaging agents, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or MMS</title><p>To investigate whether pol &#x0025b; p261 degradation occurred during necrosis of Jurkat cells, necrosis was induced by depleting cellular ATP with oligomycin followed by incubation with staurosporine for 3 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c22">22</xref>). Apoptosis was induced in the same experiment by treating with only staurosporine. p140 was not observed during necrosis, but was observed during the apoptosis induction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f6">6</xref>A, top panel). This is similar to the observation that nuclear replication factor MCM3 is cleaved during apoptosis but not necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c45">45</xref>). As observed for apoptosis induced by the anti-Fas-activating antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f5">5</xref>), the general caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk inhibited apoptosis, as shown by the intact PARP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f6">6</xref>A, bottom panel), and also prevented p261 cleavage. On the other hand, calpain inhibitor ZLLY-CHN2 failed to prevent the onset of apoptosis, as indicated by PARP cleavage and p261 cleavage, confirming again that caspase(s) is(are) the responsible protease(s).</p><p>We also did not observe p140 following substantial cellular DNA damage in normal diploid human fibroblast IMR-90 cells which was induced by exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f6">6</xref>B, top panel) or MMS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f6">6</xref>C, top panel). Under both conditions no PARP cleavage was detected even at the highest doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or MMS (bottom panels, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f6">6</xref>B and C), indicating that apoptosis was also not induced. Similar results were also obtained when Jurkat cells were subjected to DNA damage with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>p140 is not detected throughout the cell cycle initiated from G<sub>0</sub> or from early S phase</title><p>It has been speculated that p140 could play a role in DNA replication, as it has been isolated as the only form of pol &#x0025b; from chicken or calf thymus and <italic>X.laevis</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c20">20</xref>), and it has 2&#x02013;3 times more activity than the full-length p261 in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c4">4</xref>). However, we did not observe p140 during the S phase of the cell cycle in which DNA synthesis is abundant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f7">7</xref>A). Normal human fibroblast IMR-90 cells were utilized in this experiment, which were released into the cell cycle from synchronized G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase. We did observe, however, that the amount of the p261 changed with the cell cycle: a minimum or almost undetectable amount was present during the G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase and maximum amount during the S phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f7">7</xref>A), in agreement with previous findings that DNA pol &#x0025b; is expressed in a pattern that corresponds with cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c46">46</xref>). In addition, no p140 was detected when IMR-90 cells were released from early S phase of the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f7">7</xref>B). Therefore, combined with the observation that no p140 was detected following cellular DNA damage, the possibility that p140 is involved in either DNA replication or DNA damage repair <italic>in vivo</italic> appears remote.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage of p261 into p140 by caspase-3 <italic>in vitro</italic> and localization of the two sites of cleavage</title><p>When purified human DNA pol &#x0025b; was incubated with recombinant human caspase-3, cleavage occurred that produced a 140-kDa protein recognized by antibody 3C5.1 in an immunoblot. However, cleavage was not catalyzed by recombinant murine caspase-1. This is not surprising since caspase-3 has been regarded as the major &#x02018;executor&#x02019; enzyme for the cleavage of cellular proteins during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c49">49</xref>).</p><p>Three <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage products formed from p261 by caspase-3 were detected with the 3C5.1 monoclonal antibody recognizing the N-terminal portion of pol &#x0025b; p261 of apparent molecular weights of 240, 140 and 90 kDa, with p140 being the major product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f8">8</xref>). Given the substrate specificity of caspase-3, i.e. the DXXD sequence, we located six DXXD sequences in full-length p261: DKMD (residues 42&#x02013;45), DQLD (residues 213&#x02013;216), DIED (residues 316&#x02013;319), DFFD (residues 398&#x02013;401), DPED (residues 439&#x02013;442) and DMED (residues 1210&#x02013;1213).</p><p>Cleavage at the DMED site (residues 1210&#x02013;1213) after Asp-1213 would generate an N-terminal fragment of p261 of 139.4 kDa, corresponding to the estimated size of the p140 degradation product of p261 observed in apoptotic Jurkat cells. Therefore we cloned a cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 830&#x02013;1605 of the full-length p261 into the pET28(a) vector under the control of the T7 promoter. We also made an Asp&#x02192;Ala mutation on the second Asp residue (corresponding to Asp-1213 of the full-length p261) in the only DMED sequence of this cloned fragment. Both wild-type and mutant polypeptides were finally synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> using a coupled cell-free transcription and translation system and incubated with purified recombinant caspase-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f9">9</xref>A). Caspase-3 cleaved the wild-type polypeptide into fragments of 60, 50 and 37 kDa. However, no cleavage products corresponding to the 50- and 37-kDa sizes were present for the mutant polypeptide fragment, suggesting that a caspase-3 cleavage site was at residue Asp-1213 of the full-length p261. The appearance of the 60-kDa band is probably due to the non-specific cleavage at a non-&#x02018;dead box&#x02019; sequence, since the same extent of cleavage also occurred in the mutant substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f9">9</xref>A). Therefore, one caspase-3 cleavage site is at the Asp1213 of the full-length p261.</p><p>Using the same strategy, we have also determined that another cleavage site was located immediately after the first DXXD sequence, DQLD (residues 213&#x02013;216) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f9">9</xref>B). cDNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 1&#x02013;975 of the full-length p261 was cloned into the pBluescript vector pBSSK and the polypeptide was synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> using the coupled transcription and translation system. Caspase-3 cleavage resulted in two fragments of 28 and 104 kDa and a D216A mutation prevented such cleavage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f9">9</xref>B). Thus another cleavage site of caspase-3 is determined to be at Asp216 of p261. Cleavage at Asp-216 would generate two fragments of 25 and 237 kDa from the full-length p261.</p><p>For the remaining four DXXD sequences, D&#x02192;A mutations were also made at the second Asp residues to generate D45A, D319A, D401A and D442A mutations. Mutant substrates were then subjected to caspase-3 cleavage. However, these mutations did not prevent caspase-3 cleavages (data not shown). Therefore, the two caspase-3 cleavage sites of native p261 were determined to be at Asp-216 and Asp-1213. However, it is not definitively established whether the p140 observed during Jurkat cell apoptosis resulted from a single caspase-3 cleavage at Asp-1213, or two simultaneous cleavages at Asp-216 and Asp-1213 of p261. However, the presence of a small amount of a product, p240, could indicate cleavage at Asp-216 prior to cleavage at Asp-1213 to form p140.</p><p>Interestingly, these two cleavage sites are located at the junctions between the three putative proposed domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c1">1</xref>) of p261 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd619f9">9</xref>). Cleavage at both sites would separate the N-terminal domain (residues 1&#x02013;267) and the C-terminal domain (residues 1167&#x02013;2285) from the core catalytic domain (residues 268&#x02013;1166) of p261, while a single cleavage at Asp1213 would separate the core catalytic domain from the C-terminal domain as achieved with calpain cleavage. In either case, the cleavage dissociates the pol &#x0025b; catalytic core domain from the accessory subunits, which interact with the C-terminal domain of p261 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c7">7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The cleavage pattern of p261 resembles very closely that of other nuclear protein cleavages by caspase-3, i.e. cleavage between an anchoring domain (DNA, RNA or subunit binding domains) and a functional or catalytic domain. Cleavage of PARP separates its DNA binding from its automodification and catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c40">40</xref>); cleavage of DSEB&#x0002f;RF-C140 separates its DNA and nucleotide binding domain from the PCNA and RF-C association domain (38); cleavage of the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKc) separates its leucine zipper DNA binding domain from the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c50">50</xref>). Such cleavage of these nuclear proteins that are involved in DNA replication and repair might reflect redundant steps to assure the completion of the apoptotic process. In addition, cleavage of these DNA replication and repair enzymes occurs in parallel with the nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, indicating that DNA degradation and nuclear protein cleavage occur independently of one another and are not apparently causally linked. However, the exact implication of p261 cleavage (or any of these individual cleavages) in the apoptosis process still remains to be determined.</p><p>Much of the information regarding the biological function of pol &#x0025b; is from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, in which disruption of the <italic>POL2</italic> gene, which encodes the large subunit of pol &#x0025b; (Pol2p), is lethal and a temperature-sensitive allele triggers arrest with a terminal dumbbell morphology, indicating a failure to complete DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c7">7</xref>). The C-terminus of Pol2p, which has a conserved &#x02018;zinc finger&#x02019; motif, is involved in the S phase cell cycle checkpoint control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c10">10</xref>) by functioning as a sensor for DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c12">12</xref>). While the catalytic domain of Pol2p is not required for viability, the C-terminal domain is essential for DNA replication, DNA repair and the viability of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c51">51</xref>). (However, cells lacking the N-terminus of Pol2p have serious defects in DNA replication; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c52">52</xref>.) Since the C-terminal domain binds to PCNA and the other pol &#x0025b; subunits, including those with histone-fold motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c3">3</xref>), this domain might be required to maintain a replicative or repair complex.</p><p>The C-terminal domain of human pol &#x0025b; p261 is very sensitive to proteolytic degradation: upon trypsin treatment, it is completely degraded, leaving behind the more protease resistant p122 form of pol &#x0025b;, which retains the catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c4">4</xref>). (p122 can also be derived from the p140 form of pol &#x0025b; from calf thymus by trypsin treatment, but p122 has not been purified from cells, nor did we observe p122 in this study.) Assuming that after caspase-3 and&#x0002f;or calpain cleavage, the C-terminus can be degraded rapidly by other proteases in the cell, its loss would further assure cell death, if it were essential for the viability of mammalian cells like its yeast counterpart. Since the catalytic domain of p261 is protease-resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c4">4</xref>), it may resist cleavage during apoptosis and purification processes from various sources. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the p140 fragment, though it possesses polymerase activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> polymerase assays, could functionally substitute for p261 <italic>in vivo</italic> in any cell processes since it cannot assemble into the pol &#x0025b; holoenzyme. In this regard, we have highly over-expressed the N-terminal segments (1&#x02013;408 or 1&#x02013;1408) of p261 in transfected IMR-90 normal human fibroblasts and did not observe any changes in cell morphology, cell growth or passage through the cell cycle (data not shown).</p><p>The purification exclusively of p140 (i.e. no p261) from chicken or calf thymus is probably due to the fact that thymocytes are very susceptible to apoptosis. More immature T cells are produced than are needed, and cells that fail the selection process are continually being eliminated, presumably by the apoptotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c54">54</xref>). Furthermore, calpain has been shown to be activated during early stages of thymocyte apoptosis independent of caspase activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c56">56</xref>). Early involvement of calpain in apoptosis would facilitate the complete cleavage of p261 in apoptotic thymocytes. For the same reason, since apoptosis is an integral mechanism of embryonic development and differentiation, activation of caspase-3 or even calpain presumably contributes to the cleavage of p261 in some embryonic cells. Hence, it is not surprising that p140 was purified as the only form of the catalytic subunit of pol &#x0025b; from <italic>X.laevis</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c20">20</xref>). Recently a cysteine protease, similar in sequence to calpain, has been identified by examining the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c57">57</xref>). This protease could account for the purification of p140 with p261 from yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c21">21</xref>).</p><p>The cleavage of pol &#x0025b; catalytic subunit was not complete in the Jurkat cells induced for apoptosis. This incomplete cleavage might be a peculiarity of the Jurkat cell model systems. Alternatively, pol &#x0025b; has been implicated not only in DNA replication and repair, but recently also in chromosome maintenance involving interaction of maintenance factors with its two subunits (p17 and p12) with histone fold motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c3">3</xref>), and cell cycle control at the S phase checkpoint through its interaction with MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd619c58">58</xref>). Given this multiplicity of functions, we expect that pol &#x0025b; might exist in several different complexed states. Perhaps not all types of pol &#x0025b; complex are subject to the cleavage. On the other hand, for tissues from which only p140 was obtained, no protease inhibitors specific for caspase-3 and&#x0002f;or calpain were used to prevent p261 degradation during cell lysis or subsequent purification steps. Therefore, the presence of only p140 in the final purification products could be due partially to the degradation of p261 by caspase-3 and&#x0002f;or calpain <italic>in vivo</italic> in apoptotic cells, and partially to the degradation of the remaining p261 during the final purification process.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd619f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Pol &#x0025b; p261 interacts with the small subunit of calpain in a yeast two-hybrid screen.
