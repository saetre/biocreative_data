In both genomes, trnH1, the gene for tRNA-His(GUG) is located at the extremity of the large single copy region 3' to psbA, the gene for the 35 kd Photosystem 2 protein. Both psbA and trnH1 are transcribed towards the inverted repeat. In spinach, the first 48 codons of rps19, the gene for the chloroplast ribosomal protein S19, lie in the inverted repeat and the last 44 codons lie in the large single copy region at the end opposite to that carrying trnH1. The gene for a protein homologous to the E. coli ribosomal protein L2, rp12, is in the inverted repeat immediately 5' to rps19 and, like rps19, is transcribed towards the large single copy region. In N. debneyi, but not in spinach, rp12 is interrupted by a 666 bp insertion. The gene for tRNA-lle(CAT), trnl1, is located in the inverted repeats of spinach and N. debneyi, 5' to rp12 and is transcribed in the same direction as rp12.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6547"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6548"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6549"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6550"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6551"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6552"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6553"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6554"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6555"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6556"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6557"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00334-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6558"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
