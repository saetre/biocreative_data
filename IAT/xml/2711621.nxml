In this study, we demonstrate that CD44, once engaged, is internalized and translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to various promoters, including that of <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, leading to cell fate change through transcriptional reprogramming. In regulating <italic>cyclin D1</italic> expression, the internalized CD44 forms a complex with STAT3 and p300 (acetyltransferase), eliciting STAT3 acetylation at lysine 685 and dimer formation in a cytokine- and growth factor&#x02013;independent manner. A bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) was mapped to the cytoplasmic tail of CD44, which mediates its nuclear translocation. Expression of CD44(NLS) mutant sequesters STAT3 in cytosol. In the nucleus, the acetylated STAT3 dimer remains associated with CD44 and binds to the <italic>cyclin D1</italic> promoter, leading to increased <italic>cyclin D1</italic> expression and cell proliferation. This study describes a novel function for CD44 in transcriptional modulation through nuclear translocation of the internalized CD44 and complex formation with transcription factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD44 mediates the responses of cells to their microenvironment and participates in the regulation of growth, survival, differentiation, and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ponta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ponti et al., 2005</xref>). Several cell surface receptors, including EGF receptor family members, are known to migrate to the nucleus as an intact polypeptide or a proteolytic fragment with or without their corresponding ligands. These nuclear localized receptors have been shown to act as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ni et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang et al., 2004</xref>) for genes like <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lin et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>FGF2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Peng et al., 2001</xref>), and <italic>COX-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang et al., 2004</xref>) or modulators for induction of c-jun and cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reilly and Maher, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Although phosphorylation is a crucial posttranslational modification that regulates the activities of different proteins, there are many others, including acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yang and Seto, 2007</xref>), isgylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kim and Zhang, 2005</xref>), methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">D'Alessio et al., 2007</xref>), sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zhao, 2007</xref>), and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Giandomenico et al., 2003</xref>). Function-related posttranslational modifications of STAT3 in response to treatment with cytokine or growth factor include phosphorylation on tyrosine 705 and serine 727 residues. However, unphosphorylated or tyrosine-mutated STAT3 can still form dimers and induce transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braunstein et al., 2003</xref>). Others have found that STAT3 dimerization is regulated by reversible acetylation of lysine at residue 685 in the SH2 domain of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>). IL-6&#x02013;induced acetylation of the STAT3 N terminus is necessary for acute-phase induction of angiotensinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ray et al., 2002</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that site-specific acetylation of STAT3 is an important regulatory modification that influences protein&#x02013;protein interaction and transcriptional regulation.</p><p>The CD44 transmembrane glycoprotein family adds new aspects to these roles by participating in signal transduction processes. A previous study has shown that a fragment of CD44 can directly interact with the transcriptional machinery, resulting in the up-regulation of genes containing the TPA-responsive element, including <italic>CD44</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kajita et al., 2001</xref>). However, the mechanism of their nuclear import and the function of nuclear CD44 are virtually unknown. In this study, we show for the first time that full-length CD44 is internalized and translocated into the nucleus, where, in complex with STAT3 and p300, it binds to the <italic>cyclin D1</italic> promoter and enhances cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Nuclear localization of full-length CD44</title><p>The <italic>CD44</italic> gene contains 20 exons. 10 of the variant exons are alternatively spliced to encode a portion of the ectodomain, generating numerous CD44 spliced variant isoforms (CD44<sub>V</sub>) in some epithelial tissues and several cancers. The standard CD44 (CD44<sub>S</sub>), lacking all variant exons, is widely expressed in most cell types. We have previously shown that CD44<sub>V</sub> and its physiological ligand osteopontin (OPN) are frequently overexpressed in human gastric cancer and that OPN-engaged CD44<sub>V</sub> ligation confers cells an increased matrix-derived survival through inducing lipid raft coalescence to facilitate the CD44&#x02013;Src&#x02013;integrin signaling axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lee et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2008</xref>). In this study, we show that ligation of CD44 promotes its nuclear localization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> shows the expression pattern of CD44 in primary gastric cancer. Immunohistochemistry revealed focal signals of CD44 in cells located at crypt regions in normal gastric mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A, a</xref>). In contrast, CD44 was expressed abundantly in gastric tumor cells, with strong staining in the membrane and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A, b&#x02013;d</xref>). By Western blotting, CD44 was detected in the nuclear fractions of a variety of cell lines that expressed endogenous CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Internalization and nuclear translocation of CD44 were monitored in HT29 and H1299 cells. After biotinylation of cell surface proteins at 4&#x000b0;C, cells were removed to 37&#x000b0;C and incubated with OPN, a physiological ligand of CD44, or anti-CD44 mAb Hermes-3 (H-3). The nuclear fraction was immunoprecipitated with streptavidin and immunoblotted for CD44. As shown, ligation of CD44 by OPN or H-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 2008</xref>) promoted its nuclear translocation in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Confocal microscopic examination further revealed nuclear localization of a prominent proportion of the endogenous CD44 in H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, top) and ectopically expressed myc-tagged CD44 in AZ521/CD44 stable clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, bottom), respectively. Furthermore, H1299 cells were incubated with biotin-conjugated H-3 at 4&#x000b0;C. After removal to 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min, cellular uptake and nuclear translocation of CD44 were readily detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear localization of full-length CD44.</bold> (A) Immunohistochemistry of nuclear CD44 in human gastric mucosal (a) and cancerous (b&#x02013;d) tissues using anti-CD44<sub>v</sub>6 antibody, with nuclei counterstained in hematoxylin.

Two anti-CD44 mAbs, J173, which does not induce CD44 ligation, and H-3, which can induce CD44 ligation, were applied to cells separately. Cellular intake of J173-bound CD44 increased as a function of time, and a greater intake of CD44 was observed upon H-3 treatment, suggesting that ligation of CD44 accelerated its internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Consistent with this, increasing amounts of CD44 were recovered from the early endosome fraction isolated from H1299 cells after H-3 treatment, and pretreatment of cells with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or phenylarsine oxide or depletion of K<sup>+</sup> to block endocytosis significantly inhibited the internalization and uptake of CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). By biotin-labeled endocytosis assay, we showed that CD44 ligation enhanced not only the internalization of the biotin-labeled receptor but also its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). From the standard isoform of CD44, a CD44(NLS) mutant was generated by changing the putative NLS sequence <sup>292</sup>RRRCGQKKK<sup>300</sup> to <sup>292</sup>AAACGQAAA<sup>300</sup>, a CD44(Endo) mutant was generated by changing sequences flanking the C-terminal dihydrophobic motif (L<sup>331</sup>/V<sup>332</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sheikh and Isacke, 1996</xref>) from <sup>329</sup>VHLV<sup>332</sup> to <sup>329</sup>AHAA<sup>332</sup>, and a CD44&#x00394;C mutant was generated by removing most of the C-terminal sequences. By subcellular fractionation, wild-type (WT) CD44 ectopically expressed in AZ521 cells was readily detected in the endosomal and nuclear fractions. In contrast, CD44&#x00394;C failed to internalize, CD44(NLS) mutant internalized efficiently but failed to enter the nucleus, and CD44(Endo) mutant was internalized less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). To corroborate that endosomal sorting and the bipartite NLS are essential for the nuclear localization of CD44 protein, a dynamin mutant Dyn 2(K44A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 1998</xref>) and a Ran GTPase mutant Ran(Q69L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Macara, 2001</xref>) were ectopically expressed in H1299 cells, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> shows that overexpression of Dyn 2(K44A) significantly inhibited internalization of CD44, whereas overexpression of Ran(Q69L) has no effect on CD44 internalization but completely blocked its nuclear import. We conclude that CD44 is internalized through endosomal sorting and imported to the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear translocation of CD44 by endosomal sorting.</bold> (A) H1299 cells were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-CD44 mAb H-3 and J173 at 4&#x000b0;C separately followed by further incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 5, 15, and 30 min as indicated.

A total of 19 clones was obtained from the DNA fragments pulled down by anti-CD44 mAb. Through a National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) search, they contained sequences corresponding to the promoters of several genes, including <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812060/DC1">Tables S1 and S2</ext-link>). Among them, 15 clones contained binding elements for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and p300. We tested whether nuclear CD44 exerts its transcriptional regulatory function through interacting with STAT3 and p300. By immunofluorescence, we showed that ligation of CD44 promoted nuclear colocalization of CD44 and STAT3 in H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Co-IP revealed that STAT3 and p300 were in complex with CD44 in AZ521/CD44 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In-frame CD44 deletional mutants and STAT3 domain truncation mutants were generated for mapping the interacting domains in CD44 and STAT3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812060/DC1">Figs. S1 and S2</ext-link>). Co-IP showed that the N-terminal region encoded by constant exon 3 in CD44 and the N-terminal coiled-coil domain (aa 134&#x02013;317) of STAT3 were important for their interaction. Our experiments using in vitro&#x02013;translated CD44 and STAT3 suggested that additional factors, including posttranslational modification of CD44, were required for efficient interaction between CD44 and STAT3 (Figs. S1 and S2). Our data also suggested that p300 participates in the formation of the CD44&#x02013;STAT3&#x02013;p300 complex through its interaction with STAT3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812060/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). We noted that little p300 was associated with STAT3 in AZ521/mock cells, whereas elevated p300 was found in the CD44-expressing H1299 and AZ521/CD44 cells, and removal of the CD44 C-terminal region precluded its interaction with STAT3 and significantly suppressed the association of p300 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). To corroborate that CD44 facilitates the association of STAT3 and p300, we knocked down the expression of endogenous CD44 in H1299 and HT29 cells and showed that the association of p300 and STAT3 was severely prohibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). In the absence of cytokine- and growth factor&#x02013;mediated signals, ligation of CD44 by H-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>) or OPN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812060/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>) promoted nuclear localization of STAT3 in a time-dependent manner. When AZ521 cell clones were incubated with biotin-labeled H-3 in an endocytosis assay, the internalized CD44 formed a complex with STAT3 in both the cytosol and nucleus, whereas the CD44(NLS) mutant only formed a complex with STAT3 in the cytoplasm, and CD44&#x00394;C was not internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). STAT3 was sequestered from the nucleus in cells overexpressing the CD44(NLS) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). These data suggested that internalized CD44 formed a complex with STAT3 in the cytosol and that CD44&#x02013;STAT3 co-migrated to the nucleus in a CD44-dependent manner. In agreement, ChIP assays showed that STAT3 was bound weakly but mainly to the fragment of &#x02212;1138/&#x02212;841 bp in AZ521/CD44(NLS) cells, whereas a robust binding activity was observed for STAT3 as well as CD44 to the DNA fragment of &#x02212;765/&#x02212;562 bp in AZ521/CD44 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). These data suggest that, in the presence of CD44, STAT3-mediated transactivation of <italic>cyclin D1</italic> was up-regulated from basal activity to CD44-regulated activity via redirecting STAT3 to a preferred binding site. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we showed that CD44, STAT3, and p300 were associated in a complex and bound predominantly to the cis-element located within &#x02212;630/&#x02212;586 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>). Next, we examined whether CD44 acts as a transcription-related coactivator by GAL4-CD44 transactivation assays. In AZ521 cells, GAL4-CD44 induced a 3.5-fold expression of a reporter driven by a GAL4-dependent promoter. Overexpression of STAT3 and p300 greatly enhanced, whereas knockdown of the expression abolished, the reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear CD44 associates with STAT3 and functions to modulate transcription.</bold> (A) Confocal microscopy of H1299 cells cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h and treated with control IgG or H-3 for 1 h.

In our study, ligation of CD44 by H-3 did not induce phosphorylation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that unphosphorylated or tyrosine-mutated STAT proteins can form stable dimers through acetylation of lysine 685 and enhance transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braunstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>). We examined whether CD44 ligation promotes STAT3 acetylation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref> shows that ligation of CD44 enhanced the acetylation of STAT3(Y705F) in H1299 cells in a time-dependent manner, indicating that the status of phosphorylation was not a prerequisite for STAT3 acetylation. In agreement, ligation of CD44 facilitated acetylation of STAT3 in H1299 and HT29 cells but had much less effect in the p300-hemizygous HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). In AZ521 cells, ectopic expression of CD44 greatly enhanced STAT3 acetylation, which was further enhanced by coexpression of p300 and blocked by HDAC1 expression or knockdown of p300 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Co-IP showed that CD44 ligation greatly facilitated the association of HA-tagged and Flag-tagged STAT3(Y705F) but not STAT3(K685R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Nuclear extracts were prepared from AZ521/CD44 cells expressing both HA-STAT3 and Flag-STAT3 and subjected to tandem IP using anti-Flag mAb first followed by anti-HA mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Consistent with this, Western blotting showed dimer formation of STAT3(WT) and STAT3(Y705F) but not STAT3(K685R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>, middle). Most importantly, CD44 was found to be associated with these STAT3 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>, right). By tandem IP, we demonstrated that STAT3 in complex with CD44 and p300 was acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). In AZ521 cells, ectopic expression of the acetylation-proficient STAT3, WT and Y705F, but not the acetylation-defective STAT3, K685R and K685R/Y705F, enhanced <italic>cyclin D1</italic> expression in response to H-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>), suggesting that CD44-elicited cyclin D1 expression is mediated through acetylated STAT3.
