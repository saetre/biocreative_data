Recent data suggest an important role for the chromatin assembly machinery in this process. To analyze the role of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) during pre-implantation development, we generated a mouse line carrying a targeted mutation in the gene encoding its large subunit, p150CAF-1. Loss of p150CAF-1 in homozygous mutants leads to developmental arrest at the 16-cell stage. Absence of p150CAF-1 in these embryos results in severe alterations in the nuclear organization of constitutive heterochromatin. We provide evidence that in wild-type embryos, heterochromatin domains are extensively reorganized between the two-cell and blastocyst stages. In p150CAF-1 mutant 16-cell stage embryos, the altered organization of heterochromatin displays similarities to the structure of heterochromatin in two- to four-cell stage wild-type embryos, suggesting that CAF-1 is required for the maturation of heterochromatin during preimplantation development. In embryonic stem cells, depletion of p150CAF-1 using RNA interference results in the mislocalization, loss of clustering, and decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains. Furthermore, loss of CAF-1 in these cells results in the alteration of epigenetic histone methylation marks at the level of pericentric heterochromatin. These alterations of heterochromatin are not found in p150CAF-1-depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which are cells that are already lineage committed, suggesting that CAF-1 is specifically required for heterochromatin organization in pluripotent embryonic cells. Our findings underline the role of the chromatin assembly machinery in controlling the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of the genome in early embryos and embryonic stem cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Chromatin is the support of our genetic information. It is composed of numerous repeated units called nucleosomes, in which DNA wraps around a core of histone proteins. Modifications in the composition and biochemical properties of nucleosomes play major roles in the regulation of genome function. Such modifications are termed &#x0201c;epigenetic&#x0201d; when they are inherited across cell divisions and confer new information to chromatin, in addition to the genetic information provided by DNA. It is usually believed that during genome replication, the basic chromatin assembly machinery builds up &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; nucleosomes, and, in a subsequent step, nucleosomes are selectively modified by a series of enzymes to acquire epigenetic information. Here, the authors studied the role of a basic chromatin assembly factor (CAF-1) in mouse embryonic stem cells and early embryos. Surprisingly, they show that CAF-1 confers epigenetic information to specific genomic regions. In addition, this study revealed that CAF-1 is required for the proper spatial organization of chromosomes in the nucleus. This new knowledge may contribute to better understanding the role of chromatin in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity and plasticity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Houlard M, Berlivet S, Probst AV, Quivy JP, H&#x000e9;ry P, et al.

Among histone chaperones, chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is a three-subunit (p150, p60, and p48) complex which promotes histone H3 and H4 deposition onto newly synthesized DNA during replication or DNA repair &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Specifically, CAF-1 deposits the histone H3 variant H3.1 into chromatin, in a pathway coupled to DNA synthesis, whereas a second histone chaperone, HIRA, is involved in the deposition of the H3.3 variant in a DNA synthesis independent pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to this specific chromatin assembly activity, CAF-1 interacts with several proteins present in heterochromatin, including heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and MBD1, a methyl-CpG binding domain protein that recruits histone deacetylase and repressive histone methyltransferase activities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Taken together, these data suggest roles for CAF-1 in the formation of heterochromatin and in the heritability of epigenetic traits. While the function of this evolutionary conserved histone chaperone has been studied extensively biochemically, we still lack information concerning its importance during early development in mammals and in pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we have analyzed the importance of CAF-1 during early mouse development by genetic ablation and in ES cells by depletion using RNA interference (RNAi). We show that CAF-1 is essential for viability in early mouse embryos and ES cells. We provide evidence that CAF-1 is required for the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of heterochromatin domains in pluripotent embryonic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We used gene targeting in ES cells to delete exon 3 in the <italic>Chaf1a</italic> gene, which encodes p150CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice were born at a Mendelian frequency, were of normal size and weight, displayed no obvious abnormalities, and were fertile. Crossing heterozygous mice failed to generate viable newborn <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice. Furthermore, no homozygous <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> embryos were detected at any of the post-implantation stages. However, we could detect <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> embryos at embryonic day 4 (E4) using a PCR strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). They represent only 10&#x00025; of E4 embryos obtained from <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice intercrosses, suggesting that more than half of the homozygous mutant embryos had degenerated before this stage. Moreover, mutant embryos contained only eight to 16 cells at the E4 stage, instead of 32 cells observed for wild-type or heterozygous blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">1</xref>D). Further analysis by light microscopy using immunofluorescence (IF) allowed us to compare wild-type and p150CAF-1-depleted embryos. A loss of p150CAF-1 staining could not be detected before the eight-cell stage (unpublished data) suggesting that maternally contributed protein is present in the embryo up to the four-cell stage. Thus, depletion of p150CAF-1 protein from this stage allows a maximum of two additional cell divisions before developmental arrest.</p><p>Strikingly, we found that the nuclear organization of heterochromatin appeared abnormal in the nuclei of <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> embryos. Pericentric heterochromatin, the major component of constitutive heterochromatin, can easily be visualized in interphase nuclei by the fluorochrome DAPI and by immunostaining with HP1&#x003b1; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. In wild-type blastocysts and in mouse somatic cells, pericentric heterochromatin domains cluster together and form higher-order chromatin structures called chromocenters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, which are visualized as DAPI-dense foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). These structures were not detected in <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Since chromatin architecture and higher-order structures are important for genome function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, we decided to characterize this phenotype in more detail. For this purpose, we examined the status of heterochromatin organization between the two-cell and blastocyst stages. In two-cell stage wild-type embryos, DAPI staining is diffuse and fibrillar, with regions of higher density around the nucleolar precursor bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Heterochromatin domains are progressively assembled into DAPI-dense foci between the four-cell and 32-cell blastocyst stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). Localization of HP1&#x003b1; confirmed that the structures visualized by DAPI staining correspond to constitutive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Thus, the nuclear organization of heterochromatin is dramatically modified during pre-implantation development, between the two-cell and blastocyst stages. In <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> E4 embryos, which are arrested between the eight- and 16-cell stage, DAPI-dense foci were barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Instead, DAPI staining was diffuse within the nucleus, with regions of higher density around the nucleoli and at the periphery of the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Localization of HP1&#x003b1; showed a diffuse pattern similar to the DAPI, with some enrichment at the nuclear periphery, and around the nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). This abnormal organization of heterochromatin in <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> embryos is reminiscent of the heterochromatin organization found in two- to four-cell stage wild-type embryos (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g001">1</xref>F). These data evidence a key role for p150CAF-1 during pre-implantation development, and reveal that this protein is required for the proper 3-D organization of heterochromatin within embryonic cell nuclei.</p><p>Next, we wondered whether a similar requirement for CAF-1 could also be observed in ES cells, which are derived from the blastocyst inner cell mass. Given the early developmental arrest observed in <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> embryos, such cells could not be derived directly from null embryos, and we thus used an RNAi strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). p150CAF-1 knockdown in ES cells was quantified by Western blot analysis and IF. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020181-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). p150CAF-1 RNAi-depleted ES cells displayed a phenotype very similar to the cells of <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> E4 mice. DAPI-dense foci were lost, and we observed diffuse HP1&#x003b1; and DAPI staining around the nucleoli and at the periphery of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This result indicates that p150CAF-1 is essential for nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cells in a similar way to early pre-implantation embryos. Surprisingly, we did not observe this severe alteration in heterochromatin organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) following p150CAF-1 depletion by RNAi. p150CAF-1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation (unpublished data), but did not alter the clustering of heterochromatin domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g002">Figures 2</xref>C and S2). Similarly, p150CAF-1 depletion in 3T3 cells did not affect heterochromatin organization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. These observations reveal a specific function for CAF-1 in the early embryo and ES cells.</p><p>We also wondered whether loss of p150CAF-1 in ES cells specifically affects the heterochromatin nuclear subcompartment, or whether it might result in a more global loss of nuclear organization and architecture. We used a specific antibody against the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein to study the fate of the PML nuclear bodies, which are well-characterized subnuclear structures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We could not detect any significant difference in the distribution and aspect of PML nuclear bodies between control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). These data show that nuclear architecture is not globally altered following CAF-1 loss-of-function. In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that CAF-1 depletion did not result in altered levels of chromatin architectural proteins such as histone H3 and HP1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020181-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, CAF-1 is specifically required in early embryos and in ES cells for the proper organization of the heterochromatin subnuclear compartment.</p><p>Previous studies performed in mammalian cell lines showed that CAF-1 activity is required for S phase progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. We show here that 3 d after transfection of the RNAi vector, p150CAF-1-depleted cells (identified by a complete absence of CAF-1 IF signal) appear still active for replication, as revealed by incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), and flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Hence, in these cells, DNA replication persists despite the drastic changes in heterochromatin organization. However, 24 h later, ES cells cease to proliferate and die, revealing that p150CAF-1 is required for an essential cellular process, as in embryos. Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF-1 function in ES cells and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus and, in a subsequent step, cell cycle and viability.</p><p>In order to better characterize the defects in heterochromatin organization, we performed two-color DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments to reveal the spatial distribution of pericentric and centric chromosomal regions, which in mouse are mainly composed of large blocks of major and minor satellite repeats, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Pericentric domains from different chromosomes form clusters, which are revealed by FISH as large spots that coincide with DAPI-dense foci in the interphase nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). At the periphery of each pericentric domain, centric regions form individual entities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In p150CAF-1 RNAi-depleted cells, we observed a disruption of pericentric heterochromatin clusters that coincides with the disappearance of DAPI-dense foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Individual pericentric domains from single chromosomes are now found either isolated or aggregated in a pattern less dense than the regular clusters observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Such aggregates, which are often found at the nuclear periphery, are also revealed by DAPI staining as a typical signature of p150CAF-1 loss-of-function. Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the nucleus revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite hybridization signals in p150CAF-1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g004">4</xref>D), indicating decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin domains. In contrast, centric domains showed an intensity and shape similar to control cells, suggesting that they remain unaffected by p150CAF-1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g004">4</xref>D). In conclusion, these results show that p150CAF-1 is required for the proper condensation and clustering of pericentric heterochromatin domains.</p><p>Given the known role of CAF-1 in the deposition of histone H3.1 and H4 associated with DNA synthesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, we wondered whether this defect in higher-order chromatin organization could reflect an aberrant nucleosomal organization. Using DNase I and micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assays, we could not observe any significant difference between control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells at the level of bulk genome chromatin or at pericentric repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In a second series of experiments, we compared the association of histone H3 with chromatin in nuclei isolated from cells transfected with control and p150CAF-1 RNAi plasmid vectors. Nuclei were incubated in buffers with different salt concentrations ranging from 100 mM NaCl to 1 M NaCl. In all conditions, the amount of histone H3 remaining associated with chromatin was indistinguishable in control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells (unpublished data). Therefore, the loss of clustering and decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin are unlikely to be the consequence of severe defects in nucleosomal organization.</p><p>Our findings showed that the nuclear localization of HP1&#x003b1; is severely altered in <italic>Chaf1a</italic><sup>&#x02212;/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> embryos and p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells. We therefore examined the status of other epigenetic marks previously shown to characterize pericentric heterochromatin. We first tested DNA CpG methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; at major satellite repeats and found no significant difference between control and p150CAF-1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g006">Figure 6</xref>). As the LTM7 ES cell line that we used in our RNAi experiments is a female (XX) cell line, DNA methylation is globally reduced in these cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. To rule out the possibility that hypomethylation of pericentric repeats might contribute to the destabilization of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells, we tested our RNAi plasmid vector in a XY ES cell line, and confirmed that loss of p150CAF-1 leads to disruption of heterochromatin organization independently of the degree of DNA methylation at pericentric repeats (unpublished data). We next analyzed specific histone modifications &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using native chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. We found that pericentric DNA was immunoprecipitated with a 2-fold lower efficiency with H4K20me3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; antibodies following p150CAF-1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">7</xref>B). Immunoprecipitation of minor satellite repeats in the same experiment was less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), showing that loss of p150CAF-1 function mainly affects H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin. Moreover, no significant difference in immunoprecipitation efficiency was detected at intracisternal A particle (IAP) elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), which are noncentromeric repeated DNA elements also enriched in H4K20me3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. This result shows that p150CAF-1 contributes to normal levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin, but not necessarily at other loci. The H3K9me3 mark &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; was also significantly reduced in p150CAF-1-depleted cells, though to a lesser extent than H4K20me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">7</xref>B).</p><p>In wild-type cells, most of H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 signals are present at the level of DAPI-dense domains when visualized by IF &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">Figures 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">7</xref>D).

The H4K20me3 pattern was even more severely altered, showing both a loss of the typical dots revealed in control cells and a reduction in signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020181-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). Consistent with our ChIP experiments, residual H4K20me3 epitopes were detected at the level of relocated DAPI-dense material. Altogether, our results show that depletion of CAF-1 in ES cells leads to a simultaneous disruption of heterochromatin 3-D organization and an alteration in epigenetic marking.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we provide evidence that p150CAF-1 has a crucial function during mouse early embryogenesis and in ES cells. Previous studies showed that CAF-1 is essential for the progression of DNA replication in vertebrates. In <italic>Xenopus laevis,</italic> p150CAF-1 function is required for the rapid cell divisions that occur during early development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, CAF-1 is essential in mammalian cell lines for the progression of DNA replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Our findings reveal a role for CAF-1 in the nuclear organization of heterochromatin domains during early development and in ES cells. We show that in p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells, while DNA replication initially persists without significant perturbation in nucleosomal organization, severe heterochromatin organization defects can be observed. Loss of p150CAF-1 did not affect PML bodies in ES cell nuclei, showing that nuclear architecture is not generally altered. Ultimately, p150CAF-1 depletion results in the arrest of ES cell division and cell death. Given the major defects observed in heterochromatin organization, it is tempting to speculate that these defects cause the developmental arrest in the embryos and death in ES cells. The role of CAF-1 in the nuclear organization of heterochromatin includes spatial localization, condensation, and clustering of pericentric domains. This important function of CAF-1 was not revealed in primary MEFs, 3T3 cells, or human cell lines, suggesting that it is specific of pluripotent embryonic cells. Alternatively, early embryos and ES cells, whose genome is more plastic than somatic cells, might represent a particularly sensitive context in which the importance of CAF-1 in heterochromatin organization is exacerbated. In ES cells, major architectural chromatin proteins are hyperdynamic and bind relatively loosely to chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In this cellular context, our findings show that proper heterochromatin nuclear architecture relies on CAF-1 function. In contrast, in undifferentiated cells that are already lineage committed (such as MEFs) genome architecture might be more stable than in ES cells and thus cannot be disrupted by CAF-1 depletion. This important function of CAF-1 in pluripotent embryonic cells could be partially conserved during evolution. Indeed, in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> in which CAF-1 is not essential for viability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, loss of CAF-1 is associated with a mild alteration in chromocenter size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. This phenotype is somehow reminiscent of loss of CAF-1-mediated defects in heterochromatin organization in early mouse embryos. In mouse ES cells, we show that CAF-1 is also required for regular levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric repeats, but not at IAP elements, which are repeated sequences spread all over the mouse genome. These data suggest that proper nuclear organization and epigenetic marking of pericentric heterochromatin are coupled in ES cells. Alternatively, 3-D organization of heterochromatin and epigenetic marking might represent two independent functions of CAF-1.</p><p>The variable requirement for CAF-1 across species might reflect the acquisition of new properties affecting the function of histone H3 variants during evolution of eukaryotes. CAF-1 is essential in mammals but dispensable in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, the budding yeast genome does not contain heterochromatin regions equivalent to those of higher eukaryotes, and several hallmark features of heterochromatin such as di- and trimethylation at H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20 are not observed in the silent chromatin of <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> In mammals, H3K9 dimethylation is predominantly associated with H3.1, but not with H3.3, which carries modifications typically found in transcribed chromatin regions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Outside of the centromeric H3 variant, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> possesses only H3.3, which is expressed and incorporated into chromatin in a replication-independent fashion in higher eukaryotes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. These data suggest a specific role for H3.1 in heterochromatin regions. We show here that CAF-1, which is a H3.1 replication-dependent loading complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, is specifically required for the nuclear organization of pericentric heterochromatin in embryos and ES cells. One possibility would be a scenario in which incorporation of H3.1 into chromatin is required for the proper nuclear organization of constitutive heterochromatin in an embryonic context. While this has to be addressed experimentally, it is worthwhile to mention an alternate possible mechanism that might explain the disruption of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF-1 null embryos and ES cells. CAF-1 could be required for the loading, into heterochromatin, of an interacting partner required for the clustering of pericentric domains. Following one or two rounds of DNA replication in the absence of p150CAF-1, heterochromatin would become deprived of this molecule, which would cause the disruption of its 3-D organization. A potential candidate is the HP1 protein, which interacts with CAF-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In agreement with a recent report &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, our analysis of heterochromatin in pre-implantation embryos has revealed drastic changes in nuclear organization between the two-cell and blastocyst stages. Cloning experiments in mouse revealed that the nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cell nuclei was quickly reverted into the one-cell stage-specific form after nuclear transfer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Hence, remodeling of heterochromatin 3-D organization parallels nuclear reprogramming toward an early embryonic status in cloned embryos. This drastic reorganization of heterochromatin organization is similar to that observed in p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells, and in developmentally arrested 16-cell stage <italic>Chaf1a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos. These data show that CAF-1 is involved in setting up proper heterochromatin architecture during the first cell divisions of embryonic life. Given the importance of nuclear organization in the control of gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, this finding suggests that CAF-1 contributes to the coordinated programs of gene expression during early embryogenesis. Our findings open new perspectives in the understanding of chromatin dynamics during early development and in pluripotent embryonic cells. While most studies focused on the role of DNA methylation and histone modifying enzymes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020181-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, our data point to the importance of the chromatin assembly machinery.
