To date, no effective therapy exists to treat this associated vision loss. Lack of glucose control and the chronic nature of the disease are key risk factors, but DR also contains a hereditary component. The aldose reductase (ALR2) gene (allele z-4) has been linked to the occurrence of DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Wang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>] found that Chinese patients with type 2 DM exhibited phenotypic differences in terms of risk factors for DR, and that ALR2 was associated with microvascular complications. A study of Mexican Americans with DM revealed that retinopathy was linked to two chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], while Suzuki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>] reported that apolipoprotein was associated with the occurrence of DR. Other studies indicate that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), genetic polymorphisms, and mitochondrial rRNA genetic polymorphisms may contribute to DR pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>The onset of DR among DM patients is variable. Some patients acquire DR as soon as they develop DM, while others either do not exhibit symptoms, or have very mild symptoms even many years after the onset of DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. An epidemiologic study of American patients with a 20-year history of DM revealed that 80% had developed DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Evidently there is a distinct cohort of individuals with DM who are somehow &#x0201c;immune&#x0201d; to the onset of DR. These findings suggest the existence of a genetic polymorphism that protects retinal blood vessels from the damage associated with DM. Given this and the knowledge that no current medication can effectively control the occurrence and development of DR, it would seem pertinent to search for and try to identify genes that may be involved in conferring resistance to DR.</p><p>Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a small guanosine 5&#x02032;-diphosphate (GDP) Ran binding protein found in all human cell types. It is involved in regulating multiple processes, including cell cycle, immunoreactions, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. The main function of NTF2 is to facilitate transport of certain proteins into the nucleus via interaction with nucleoporin FxFG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. NTF2 also works as a GDP-dissociation inhibitor to mediate the GDP-Ran gradient, which is also involved nucleocytoplasmic transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. The importance of NTF2 is illustrated by the findings that deletion of this gene results in lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. With regards to the eye, it has been reported that partial deletion or mutation of the NTF2 gene may cause heteroplasia in the eyes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. It has been further suggested that partial loss of NTF2 function might alter the nuclear import of Ran proteins during the immune response and that the loss of functional alleles may be associated with the strong eye phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>].</p><p>In this study,we obtained blood samples from patients who suffered DM, but not proliferative DR (PDR), and from patients who suffered DM and PDR. RNA was extracted from these samples and subjected to microarray analysis to search for genes differentially expressed between the two patient groups and hence perhaps associated with DR. One of these was NTF2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="t1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of significant differential gene expression as determined by microarray analysis.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="81" span="1"/><col width="387" span="1"/><col width="55" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Gene</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Description</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>p-value</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">213726_x_at<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">nf66f09.s1 NCI_CGAP_Co3 Homo sapiens cDNA clone IMAGE:924905 3&#x02032;

Rats maintained in an cleaning environment for two weeks before experimentation. Rats were randomly divided into two groups, A and B, and containing 30 rats per group. Each rat in Group A received an intravitreal injection of purified rAAV2-NTF2 in either the left or right eye (determined randomly). Rats in Group B were injected with rAAV2 only.

Nondiabetic control mice received citrate buffer only. Fasting plasma glucose was examined after 3 days of STZ injection, and diabetes was confirmed by fasting plasma glucose value of 16.7 mmol/l or higher using Touch&#x02122; Glucometer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).

Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 50&#x000a0;mg/kg ketamine and 20&#x000a0;mg/kg chlorpromazine. Next, a 100&#x000a0;mg/kg solution of FITC-dextran solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO) or 45&#x000a0;mg/kg of 3% EB (Sigma) was injected via the tail vein. The chest was opened after 2 h and an infusion tube connected with a 14G blunt needle was inserted into the left ventricle. The right atrial appendage was cut open, and the heart was infused with fluid contained 0.05 M 1% paraformaldehyde citrate buffer, pH 3.5, at 250&#x000a0;ml/kg bodyweight. Infusion height was 160 cm, resulting in an equivalent infusion pressure of 120&#x000a0;mmHg. The infusion was maintained for 2 min to remove any remnant dye in the blood vessels. The eyes of rat were then removed, and the retina was dissected and mounted to determine retinal blood vessel leakage (FITC-dextran leakage) by microscopy.</p><p>To assess EB leakage, we dried dissected retinas under vacuum (45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5 h). The retinal dry weight was recorded. The difference in retinal weight between diabetic rats injected with rAAV2-NTF2 and controls was compared. Next, 120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l formamide was added and the solution placed in a 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C water bath for 18 h.

The net absorbance was calculated by subtracting the absorbance at 740 nm from that at 620 nm. The concentration of dye was calculated from a standard curve (determined for each measurement) of EB in formamide. Samples were analyzed in triplicate and the mean calculated.

Several lines of evidence support this assertion. We found <italic>NTF2</italic> mRNA expression to be lower in DM patients with PDR (P group) compared to those without PDR. Even though the difference in humans was not statistically significant, we also found overexpression of <italic>NTF2</italic> in diabetic rats was associated with decreased indices of retinal damage. Findings from our in vitro studies of RRCECs, in which <italic>NTF2</italic> expression was upregulated or downregulated, indicated that NTF2 modulates VEGF expression. This is an important observation given that NTF2 may play a role in mediating the progression of DR and suggests the need for further studies, particularly in humans.</p><p>DR is among the most prevalent complications associated with DM. Hence, it is closely related to DM. Several studies have suggested that there is a genetic component to PDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. It would appear that genes involved help maintain functionality of the retinal blood vessels and protects the surrounding tissue from DM-related damage.</p><p>At the beginning of study, we examined <italic>NTF2</italic> expression levels in patients, who had DM with or without PDR for 20&#x02013;25 year. Potential confounding factors (e.g., age, gender, types of illness, and living conditions) were eliminated due to a strict selection and exclusion criteria of patients. Hence the differentiating factor between the 2 groups of patients was the presence or absence of PDR. We found that NTF2 levels in patients with PDR were significantly lower than in normal healthy individuals (NO) While there was no significant difference detected between the patient groups, there was a strong trend for patients with PDR to have lower NTF2 levels (p=0.079). This lack of a difference between these groups may be a reflection of the relatively small sample size. Nevertheless, this finding encouraged us to further examine the importance of NTF2 with regards to the development of DR.</p><p>Findings from a study by Minakhina and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] have interesting parallels to our own. These researchers found that low <italic>NTF2</italic> gene expression resulted in abnormal eye growth in Drosophila. Higher <italic>NTF2</italic> gene expression was required to maintain normal eye growth. The number of compound eyes was significantly decreased in Drosophila with reduced as compared to normal <italic>NTF2</italic> expression. The decreased frequency of compound eyes in low <italic>NTF2</italic> expression Drosophila may have been due to dysplasia of blood vessels in the eye.</p><p>Given that lower <italic>VEGF</italic> expression is thought to be associated with DR resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], it is plausible that NTF2 may offer protection from DR by depressing <italic>VEGF</italic> expression. Indeed our findings suggest that this may be the case (at least in part). We found that expression of NTF2 in RRCECs was inversely related to VEGF expression (both mRNA and protein). Precisely how NTF2 might influence VEGF expression is unclear. Further studies examining the effects of NTF2 on downstream inflammatory and vascular factors are warranted to clarify this point. Certainly, NTF2 may influence other mediators of DR aside from VEGF.</p><p>In summary, the findings from our study implicate NTF2 as a potential mediator of retinal vasculature protection and suggest that expression levels of this gene may dictate, at least to some extent, development of PDR in patients with DM. Our findings also suggest that NTF2 may exert such effects by altering VEGF expression. Further studies are warranted to examine potentials pathways through which NTF2 may be exerting such effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Nature Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 30872823, 30471849, and 30672278).
