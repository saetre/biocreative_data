Here we show that exposure of cultured macrophages and mice to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to up-regulation of miR-155 and that the transcription factor c/ebp Beta is a direct target of miR-155. Interestingly, expression profiling of LPS-stimulated macrophages combined with overexpression and silencing of miR-155 in murine macrophages and human monocytic cells uncovered marked changes in the expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a central regulator of granulopoiesis during inflammatory responses. Consistent with these data, we show that silencing of miR-155 in LPS-treated mice by systemically administered LNA-antimiR results in derepression of the c/ebp Beta isoforms and down-regulation of G-CSF expression in mouse splenocytes. Finally, we report for the first time on miR-155 silencing <italic>in vivo</italic> in a mouse inflammation model, which underscores the potential of miR-155 antagonists in the development of novel therapeutics for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small endogenous noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by base-pairing to imperfect complementary target sites in the 3&#x02032; UTR of their target mRNAs, thereby mediating mRNA cleavage or translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of diverse biological processes, including differentiation of hematopoeitic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and activation of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). miR-155 is expressed in activated mature B and T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and in activated monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), while studies using miR-155 knockout mice have directly linked this miRNA to the functions of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition, miR-155 has been shown to regulate the production of cytokines, chemokines and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and to be induced by endotoxins, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Recently, miR-155 was shown to direct the generation of immunoglobulin class-switched plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and to directly regulate the AID enzyme (activation-induced cytidine deaminase), which is responsible for the generation of functionally diverse antibody repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Altogether, these observations strongly imply miR-155 as a central regulator of the immune system.</p><p>With the goal of gaining further insights into the biological function of miR-155 during acute inflammatory response, we have undertaken stimulation of cultured murine macrophage Raw264.7 and human THP-1 monocytic cells as well as treatment of mice by bacterial LPS. Previous studies have shown that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein Beta (c/ebp Beta) is induced in monocytes and macrophages by LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and that c/ebp Beta is involved in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines as well as other genes associated with macrophage activation and the acute phase response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We report here that LPS treatment induces miR-155 expression in cultured mouse macrophages and in mouse splenocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> and that silencing of miR-155 leads to derepression of its direct target c/ebp Beta <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, we find that antagonism of miR-155 leads to down-regulation of G-CSF, a regulator of granulopoiesis, produced by activated macrophages during acute inflammatory responses. G-CSF belongs to the class of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), which comprise granulocyte/macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), macrophage CSF (M-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF). During progression of inflammatory diseases the CSFs have been suggested to constitute a pro-inflammatory CSF network, which at the site of inflammation involves CSF-mediated communication between stimulated macrophages and neighboring cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This positive-feedback loop model predicts that CSF blocking agents could be efficient anti-inflammatory drugs. Indeed, data from animal models indicate that depletion of CSFs has therapeutic value in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. While early-phase clinical trials targeting GM-CSF and M-CSF have been initiated, no clinical trials on depletion of G-CSF have yet been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Our data show for the first time that c/ebp Beta is regulated by miR-155 <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse splenocytes during inflammatory responses. Moreover, we report that miR-155 mediates regulation of G-CSF expression, thereby underscoring the role of miR-155 in fine-tuning important regulatory networks during inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Design and synthesis of LNA oligonucleotides</title><p>The LNA-antimiR oligonucleotides were synthesized as unconjugated and fully phosphorothiolated oligonucleotides.

Treatment of cultured mouse macrophages with LPS showed dose-dependent induction of miR-155 with more than 10-fold increase in miR-155 expression levels at a concentration of 100 ng/ml LPS after 18 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Consistent with these data, a luciferase reporter construct harbouring a perfect match miR-155 target site in the 3&#x02032; UTR of the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene showed a concentration-dependent repression of the luciferase reporter, which correlated with the increased expression of miR-155 in LPS-treated mouse Raw264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). We have recently reported on effective miRNA silencing using complementary LNA-antimiR oligonucleotides in combination with transcriptome analysis as a useful approach to dissect the biological roles of individual miRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Hence, to enable further studies on miR-155 targets and miR-155 associated gene networks, we designed an LNA-antimiR complementary to mature miR-155 alongside an LNA control oligonucleotide having four mismatches in the miR-155 recognition sequence. The LNA-antimiR-155 showed concentration-dependent silencing of miR-155 in LPS-treated mouse Raw264.7 macrophages as shown by efficient derepression of the miR-155 sensor, whereas the LNA control oligonucleotide had no effect on the luciferase reporter activity at the same concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Since the LNA-antimiR resulted in potent and specific antagonism of miR-155 in cultured Raw264.7 cells at 5-nM concentration, we chose these experimental conditions for further studies in mouse macrophages. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>LPS-mediated induction of miR-155 in cultured mouse Raw264.7 macrophages.

Interestingly, the c/ebp Beta transcript is predicted by several computer algorithms (PicTar, miRanda, TargetScan) to be a miR-155 target due to the presence of a miR-155 target site in its 3&#x02032; UTR, which is highly conserved among five vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A).

Transient transfection of a precursor miR-155 (pre-miR-155) at 5-nM concentration into mouse Raw264.7 macrophages resulted in significant repression of the c/ebp Beta isoforms LIP and LAP, whereas concomitant transfection with equimolar LNA-antimiR into the cells effectively antagonized the miR-155-mediated c/ebp Beta repression compared to the LNA control transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We also observed repression of another direct miR-155 target, the Ets family transcription factor Pu.1 in Raw264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), implying that both c/ebp Beta and Pu.1 are targeted by miR-155 in the Raw264.7 macrophage model system. We obtained similar results with undifferentiated human monocytic THP-1 cells, in which transfection with pre-miR-155 resulted in repression of the c/ebp Beta isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Taken together, our data suggest that the levels of individual c/ebp Beta isoforms are regulated by ectopically expressed miR-155.</p></sec><sec><title>miR-155 regulates c/ebp Beta in Raw264.7 cells during LPS stimulation</title><p>We next investigated the effect of endogenous miR-155 on c/ebp Beta expression during LPS stimulation by treating mouse macrophage Raw264.7 cells with LNA-antimiR followed by exposure of the cells to LPS.

Since spleen contains populations of monocytes and macrophages together with B and T cells, we investigated miR-155-mediated regulation of c/ebp Beta in the splenocytes of LPS-treated mice in combination with LNA-antimiR based miR-155 silencing. We first asked whether these cells could be targeted by systemically administered LNA oligonucleotides <italic>in vivo</italic> by isolating B cells and monocytic cell populations from murine spleen after intravenous dosing with a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled LNA oligonucleotide. Confocal microscopy of the murine B cells and monocytes/macrophages showed that the FAM-labeled LNA was readily taken up by these cells, indicating that miR-155 could be targeted in both cell types by an LNA-antimiR compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Intraperitoneal administration of LPS significantly induced the expression of miR-155 in splenocytes 2 h post-treatment, thereby corroborating our results obtained with LPS-stimulated murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The splenocytes of untreated mice showed low levels of c/ebp Beta proteins, whereas the levels of both the LAP and LIP isoform of c/ebp Beta were significantly increased 24 h after treatment with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), in accordance with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Systemic administration of the LNA-antimiR in LPS-treated mice effectively antagonized miR-155 compared to the vehicle and LNA-mismatch-control-treated mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This resulted in significant derepression of both the LAP and LIP isoforms in comparison to the vehicle-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), which is consistent with the notion that miR-155 negatively regulates c/ebp Beta proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse splenocytes during acute inflammatory response. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>miR-155 regulates c/ebp Beta in the splenocytes of LPS-treated mice.

These inflammatory mediators help recruit effector cells to the site of infection and induce endothelial cell activation to increase vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Several transcription factors are important for differentiation and activation of myeloid lineages, including the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein Beta (c/ebp Beta), which has been implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines during macrophage activation and the acute phase response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In this study, we show that c/ebp Beta is a <italic>bona fide</italic> target of miR-155 and that LPS treatment of murine macrophages strongly induces miR-155 expression, leading to translational repression of c/ebp Beta. Our observations are in good agreement with recent reports, showing that ectopically expressed miR-155 can target c/ebp Beta <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Moreover we report here that functional inhibition of endogenous miR-155 <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to derepression of c/ebp Beta. Notably, we show for the first time that silencing of miR-155 by intravenously injected LNA-antimiR in LPS-treated mice results in marked derepression of the LAP and LIP isoforms of c/ebp Beta in mouse splenocytes, indicating that miR-155 acts as an important negative regulator of c/ebp Beta <italic>in vivo</italic> during acute inflammatory response.</p><p>A new discovery of this study is the finding that antagonism of miR-155 by LNA-antimiR leads to down-regulation of the G-CSF mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. G-CSF is a master regulator of granulopoiesis produced by activated macrophages during acute inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that G-CSF is involved in inflammation and that it aggravates inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). G-CSF appears to play a central role in arthritis, where administration of G-CSF to mice has been shown to enhance collagen-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), while blocking of G-CSF, on the other hand, markedly reduced disease manifestation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Furthermore, G-CSF-deficient mice are protected from acute and chronic arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, G-CSF is elevated in the serum and synovial fluid and correlates with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Hence, G-CSF is considered as a potential therapeutic target for intervention of inflammatory joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, therapies that antagonize G-CSF may lead to neutropenia. Thus, partial antagonism of endogenous G-CSF, as described in this study for LNA-antimiR-mediated G-CSF down-regulation, might provide a positive outcome for arthritis patients without increased risk of severe neutropenia. Indeed, our findings warrant further investigations of the potential anti-inflammatory effect of miR-155 antagonism in relevant animal models of inflammatory disease, such as collagen-induced arthritis.</p><p>Previous studies have reported on impaired induction of G-CSF in LPS-stimulated macrophages derived from mice expressing only the dominant-negative LIP form of c/ebp Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Interestingly, we find that overexpression of the LIP isoform of c/ebp Beta in mouse macrophages results in down-regulation of the G-CSF transcript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp577/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). Thus, it is possible that c/ebp Beta, which is modulated by miR-155, acts in part by fine-tuning G-CSF expression levels, consistent with a c/ebp Beta binding motif in the promoter of G-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, since a single vertebrate miRNA may target up to &#x0223c;100&#x02013;200 mRNAs, it is highly likely that functional antagonism of miR-155 <italic>in vivo</italic> results in more complex downstream effects that are associated with miR-155-mediated gene regulatory networks. Indeed, miR-155 was recently shown to regulate the PI3K&#x02013;AKT signaling pathway during LPS stimulation of macrophages by targeting the inositol phosphatase SHIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Nevertheless, given the importance of c/ebp Beta during macrophage activation and the role of G-CSF in stimulating granulopoiesis in the bone marrow, our data emphasize the potential of antagonizing miR-155 for modulating activation of macrophages and the number of circulating granulocytic cells with possible implications for treatment of inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp577/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp577_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkp577_nar-02483-r-2008-File007.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkp577_nar-02483-r-2008-File008.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkp577_nar-02483-r-2008-File009.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation, Danish Medical Research Council and the Lundbeck Foundation (to S.K.); Wilhelm Johannsen Centre for Functional Genome Research is established by the Danish National Research Foundation.
