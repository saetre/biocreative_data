Despite vigorous research efforts, current treatments do little to reverse the course of visual loss.</p><p>Within the human ONH, the lamina cribrosa (LC) region physically protects nerve axon fibers from structural distortion under stress. The LC region is composed of glial cell columns and connective tissue plates that form channels to guide and support retinal ganglion cell axons as they exit the eye. The glial and support cells in this region normally express trophic factors including neurotrophins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>], suggesting that growth factors and cytokines may provide nerve protection at the molecular level. We set out to study the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor and its receptor complex in the cells of the LC region.</p><p>Among various neurotrophic factors, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is an injury-induced trophic factor that provides protection for multiple types of neurons (e.g. sensory, sympathetic, motor neurons) and glial cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], possibly through STAT3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. CNTF is a member of the &#x003b1;-helical neuropoietic cytokine family that also includes leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-11 (IL-11), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), cardiotrophin-like cytokine/cytokine-like factor-1 (CLC/CLF, or CNTF-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], and neuropoietin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Originally identified as a survival factor for chick ciliary ganglion neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], exogenous CNTF both enhances expansion of the number of stem cells in the adult forebrain in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] and stimulates cell differentiation in cultures of retinas and sympathetic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. In the eye, CNTF promotes axonal genesis in dissociated retinal ganglion cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], and axotomized retinal ganglion cells in adult hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>] and rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Many pathologic conditions including ischemia can induce the levels of CNTF in vivo. Under those circumstances, CNTF may be a regulator of gliogenesis or gliosis, a reactive process of the glial cells following different types of insults such as ischemia, infection or malformation in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. In mouse retina, intravitreal injection of CNTF can increase GFAP promoter activity in M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], which is consistent with the presence of a CNTF-responsive element in the GFAP promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Altogether, CNTF appears to be a pleiotropic cytokine that provides support against neuronal degeneration following insult as well as trauma.</p><p>CNTF signals through its tripartite receptor complex consisting of a &#x003b1;-receptor (CNTFR-&#x003b1;), a &#x003b2;-receptor (Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, LIFR-&#x003b2;) and a glycoprotein (gp130). CNTFR-&#x003b1; is distinct from other neurotrophic or neurotrophin receptors in that it is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphophatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. Upon binding to CNTF, CNTFR-&#x003b1; triggers the formation of a heterodimer between LIFR-&#x003b2; complex, and gp130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], which activates downstream signaling molecules. In this study, we demonstrated that two ONH cell types (i.e. ONH astrocytes and LC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]) express mRNA and protein for CNTF and its tripartite receptor complex (CNTFR-&#x003b1;, gp130, LIFR&#x003b2;).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human optic nerve head astrocytes (ONHA) and LC cells were isolated and characterized as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].

Cellular protein was collected in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris). A protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to each sample upon collection.

The presence of the CNTF receptor complex enables both LC cells and ONHA to respond to CNTF. The ONH harbors LC cells and ONHA, which can be potential sources of CNTF during stressful events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Therefore, CNTF can signal ONH cells in a paracrine as well as autocrine fashion.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports in the brain, CNTF is expressed at low levels in these ONH cell types under normal conditions. As a member of the IL-6 growth factor family, CNTF shares some of the receptor components with the family members in forming a multi-component signal-transducing receptor complex. Presumably, there are overlapping biological activities and a degree of functional redundancy between CNTF and other family members. Conceivably, IL-6 family members other than CNTF may maintain the physiological function of the ONH through the receptors under normal conditions. Our study raises the possibility of a neuroprotective role of CNTF in human optic nerve head via a paracrine/autocrine mechanism.</p><p>Since CNTF does not contain a classical signal sequence for secretion, it has long been postulated that CNTF are released by cytolysis due to injury. A recent study of bovine corneal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>] suggested that CNTF may be externalized while binding to CNTFR-&#x003b1;. As a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored coreceptor, CNTFR-&#x003b1; can carry CNTF to the outer leaflets of the cell membrane and be released to the extracellular space upon phospholipase cleavage. This theory is not completely novel, as cardiotropin-like cytokine (CLC), a member of the CNTF neurotrophic factor family, generates a similar functional composite cytokine with CNTFR-&#x003b1; (CLC-CNTFR-&#x003b1; complex) in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Our results support this type of mechanism. First of all, the immunoprecipitation study demonstrated that CNTF-CNTFR-&#x003b1; complex is present extracellularly, indicating that CNTF and its &#x003b1; receptor are released as a complex. Secondly, under normal conditions, there is minimal cytolysis, and the CNTF released by disintegration of cells is below the threshold of detection. Therefore, the presence of CNTF in the cell culture medium is more than likely due to externalization and release of the CNTF-CNTFR complex instead of cytolysis.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential for a significant signaling system using CNTF family neurotrophic factors in glial cells of the optic nerve head. In addition to the current study, we have also reported that neurotrophin signaling systems in LC cells, ONHA, and ONH tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. We have also reported the presence of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the receptor complex in the same cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Neurotrophic factors and neurotrophins may play a critical role in restoring the normal function of lamina cribrosa, especially during the time of injury. This implies that neurotrophin and neurotrophic factors may have therapeutic applications for neuroprotection in glaucoma patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Donald J.
