Diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar (glucose) levels. It arises when the pancreas does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or when the body responds poorly to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Insulin, which is released in response to high blood glucose levels, instructs muscle, fat, and liver cells to take glucose (a product of food digestion) out of the bloodstream; cells use glucose as a fuel. Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 90&#x00025; of all cases of diabetes, is characterized by impaired glucose uptake by target tissues in response to insulin (this &#x0201c;insulin resistance&#x0201d; is one of the first signs of type 2 diabetes) and inappropriate glucose release from liver cells. Over time, the pancreas may also make less insulin. These changes result in poor glucose homeostasis (inadequate control of blood sugar levels), which can cause life-threatening complications such as kidney failure and heart attacks.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>If the world diabetes epidemic is to be halted, researchers need a better understanding of glucose homeostasis and need to identify which parts of this complex control system go awry in type 2 diabetes. This information might suggest ways to prevent type 2 diabetes developing in the first place and might reveal targets for drugs that could slow or reverse the disease process. In this study, the researchers have used multiple approaches to identify a new mediator of glucose homeostasis and to investigate whether this mediator is causally involved in the development of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers took small muscle samples from people who did not have diabetes before and after increasing their blood insulin levels and used a technique called &#x0201c;microarray expression profiling&#x0201d; to identify genes whose expression was induced or suppressed by insulin. One of the latter genes was <italic>thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP),</italic> a gene whose expression is strongly induced by glucose yet suppressed by insulin. They next used previously published microarray expression data to show that <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression was consistently higher in the muscles of patients with diabetes or prediabetes (a condition in which blood glucose levels are slightly raised) than in normal individuals. The researchers then examined whether <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression was correlated with glucose uptake, again using previously published data. In people with no diabetes and those with prediabetes, as glucose uptake rates increased, <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression decreased but this inverse correlation was missing in people with diabetes. Finally, by manipulating <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression levels in insulin-responsive cells grown in the laboratory, the researchers found that <italic>TXNIP</italic> overexpression reduced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake but that reduced <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression had the opposite effect.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These results provide strong evidence that <italic>TXNIP</italic> is a regulator of glucose homeostasis in people. Specifically, the researchers propose that <italic>TXNIP</italic> regulates glucose uptake in the periphery of the human body by acting as a glucose- and insulin-sensitive switch. They also suggest how it might be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes. Early in the disease process, a small insulin deficiency or slightly raised blood sugar levels would increase <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression in muscles and suppress glucose uptake by these cells. Initially, the pancreas would compensate for this by producing more insulin, but this compensation would eventually fail, allowing blood sugar levels to rise sufficiently to increase <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression in the pancreas. Previously published results suggest that this would induce the loss of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, thus further reducing insulin production and glucose uptake in the periphery and, ultimately, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Although there are many unanswered questions about the exact role of <italic>TXNIP</italic> in glucose homeostasis, these results help to explain many of the changes in glucose control that occur early in the development of diabetes. Furthermore, they suggest that interventions designed to modulate the activity of <italic>TXNIP</italic> might break the vicious cycle that eventually leads to type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040158">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040158</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001214.htm">MedlinePlus</ext-link> encyclopedia has pages on diabetes</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/">US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</ext-link> has information for patients on diabetes</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information on diabetes is available for patients and professionals from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diabetes.org/about-diabetes.jsp">American Diabetes Association</ext-link> provides information on diabetes for patients</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.idf.org/">International Diabetes Federation</ext-link> has information on diabetes and a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.idf.org/home/index.cfm?unode=7F22F450-B1ED-43BB-A57C-B975D16A812D">recent press release on the global diabetes epidemic</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Parikh H, Carlsson E, Chutkow WA, Johansson LE, Storgaard H, et al.

These data are consistent with the notion that <italic>TXNIP</italic> is an independent determinant of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title><italic>TXNIP</italic> Expression Governs Glucose Uptake in Insulin-Responsive Cells</title><p>To directly test if <italic>TXNIP</italic> may regulate glucose uptake, we used genetic manipulations to alter the gene's expression in mouse and human cell lines. First we performed in vitro studies on an insulin-sensitive cell line, the adipocyte differentiated 3T3-L1. Incubation of the adipocytes with high glucose results in a potent induction of TXNIP protein (unpublished data). A 2-fold forced overexpression of <italic>TXNIP</italic> using lentiviral transduction resulted in both diminished basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (59&#x00025; and 28&#x00025; reduction, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040158-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In agreement with this result, forced reduction of <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression by siRNA gene silencing achieved the opposite effect and enhanced both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (157&#x00025; and 61&#x00025;, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040158-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). In addition, we examined the effects of <italic>TXNIP</italic> reduction in primary human skeletal muscle myocytes by siRNA gene silencing. Again, we observed a significant increase in both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040158-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Together, these in vitro studies indicate that changes in <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression can directly influence glucose uptake in insulin-responsive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Do Genetic Variants in the <italic>TXNIP</italic> Gene Increase Susceptibility to T2DM?</title><p>While the above studies demonstrate that TXNIP is a physiologic regulator of peripheral glucose homeostasis in humans, we were next interested in determining whether genetic variation in this gene may be associated with measures of insulin resistance or T2DM in humans. We assessed the pattern of common genetic variation encompassing the <italic>TXNIP</italic> gene using data from the HapMap project and by resequencing the gene (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0040158-st002">Table S2</xref>). Then we performed a genetic association study of nine &#x0201c;tag&#x0201d; SNPs that capture the most common variation observed within the vicinity of this gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040158-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This study was in part motivated by the observation that <italic>TXNIP</italic> is located on Chromosome 1q21.1, a region that has shown perhaps the most consistent linkage to T2DM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. In a clinical sample of 4,450 Scandinavian individuals, no significant association was detected between SNPs in <italic>TXNIP</italic> and T2DM (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040158-t003">Table 3</xref>). Also, no significant association was observed between the genotypes and four quantitative phenotypes: fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR as a measure of insulin resistance, and HOMA-&#x003b2; as a measure of insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0040158-st003">Table S3</xref>). Although we did not detect polymorphisms in <italic>TXNIP</italic> that are associated with T2DM, it is still formally possible that inherited variation in other genes in the <italic>TNXIP</italic> pathway may predispose to the risk of developing T2DM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have combined human physiology, genome-wide expression profiling, genetic association testing, and cellular studies to spotlight TXNIP as a physiologic regulator of peripheral glucose uptake in humans. Our results build on murine studies that have established a role for this protein in the liver in the regulation of fasting:feeding transitions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; and in &#x003b2;-cell glucose toxicity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. While genetic variation in <italic>TXNIP</italic> does not predispose one's inherited risk for developing T2DM, TXNIP nonetheless appears to play a physiologic role in glucose homeostasis in muscle and in fat. Key novel results from the current study include the finding that <italic>TXNIP</italic> gene expression is reciprocally regulated by insulin and by glucose, that elevations in <italic>TXNIP</italic> can inhibit glucose uptake, and that <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression levels are consistently elevated in humans with T2DM and prediabetes.</p><p>Our study shows that TXNIP is part of a negative feedback mechanism that regulates glucose uptake into cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040158-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Such a mechanism may serve to prevent excess glucose uptake or metabolism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. At present, it is not clear whether TXNIP influences the metabolic fate of glucose&#x02014;future studies will be required to address this important issue. Because <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression is suppressed by insulin signaling, it appears that TXNIP influences both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent arms of glucose uptake into cells. Of note, epidemiological studies have suggested roles for both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent pathways in the development of T2DM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Recent genomic studies have pointed to mitochondrial dysfunction and to ROS as possible culprits in the etiology of insulin resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. At present, we do not know how mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS are related to each other in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The current study, in combination with other recent studies, suggests that TXNIP may lie upstream of both of these processes. First, <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression is induced by glucocorticoids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d; and by glucose, and TXNIP elevations can stimulate ROS production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Hence TXNIP represents a candidate intermediate linking diabetogenic stimuli to ROS production. Second, we have observed an inverse correlation in the expression of <italic>TXNIP</italic> and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (unpublished data), and previous studies have shown that TXNIP can serve as a transcriptional repressor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, these data raise the hypothesis that TXNIP may lie upstream of the elevations in ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction that accompany insulin resistance.</p><p>Importantly, our findings, in combination with recent studies focused on the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, provide molecular insights into the pathogenesis of impaired insulin secretion and action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040158-g007">Figure 7</xref>B) that characterize the prediabetic state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;.

At present the molecular basis for glucose toxicity is not known, although ROS represent a candidate mediator &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. A recent study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; reported that <italic>TXNIP</italic> is glucose inducible in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells and may mediate &#x003b2;-cell death through apoptosis. Our present study has led to the novel finding that <italic>TXNIP</italic> also plays a role in controlling peripheral glucose uptake in humans and may be an important target mediating effects of insulin. Together, these studies suggest that <italic>TXNIP</italic> may be involved in glucose toxicity both in &#x003b2;-cells and in the periphery, helping to reconcile the dynamic relationship between insulin deficiency and impaired glucose uptake that is observed in the prediabetic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040158-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Interventions aimed at modulating <italic>TXNIP</italic> activity may therefore help curtail this vicious cycle that eventually leads to overt T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040158-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Design of the Hyperinsulinemic, Euglycemic Clamp Protocols for Studies A, B, and C</title><p>(352 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040158.sg001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040158-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>The Promoter of <italic>TXNIP</italic> Contains a Conserved Binding Site for the Tandem E-Boxes and for the Forkhead Family of Transcription Factors in Four Species (Human, Mouse, Rat, and Dog)</title><p>Positions are relative to translation start site of TXNIP gene.

In this study we show that insulin suppresses the expression of <italic>TXNIP</italic>. Moreover, we have found that forced expression of <italic>TXNIP</italic> results in reduced glucose uptake, while inhibition of <italic>TXNIP</italic> enhances glucose uptake. These results suggest that <italic>TXNIP</italic> serves as a glucose- and insulin-sensitive homeostatic switch that regulates glucose uptake in the periphery.</p><p>(B) Role of <italic>TXNIP</italic> in glucose toxicity in the &#x003b2;-cell and in impaired glucose uptake in the periphery. Insulin deficiency or hyperglycemia can increase <italic>TXNIP</italic> levels in muscle, resulting in impaired peripheral glucose uptake. The pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell is initially able to compensate by secreting more insulin, but eventually the &#x003b2;-cell compensation fails. The resulting hyperglycemia may then elevate pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression, which can induce apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040158-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. The loss of &#x003b2;-cells, in turn, results in decreased insulin production that further exacerbates peripheral IGT.
