The molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. We report here that STAT3-inducible up-regulation of the myeloid-related protein S100A9 enhances MDSC production in cancer. Mice lacking this protein mounted potent antitumor immune responses and rejected implanted tumors. This effect was reversed by administration of wild-type MDSCs from tumor-bearing mice to S100A9-null mice. Overexpression of S100A9 in cultured embryonic stem cells or transgenic mice inhibited the differentiation of DCs and macrophages and induced accumulation of MDSCs. This study demonstrates that tumor-induced up-regulation of S100A9 protein is critically important for accumulation of MDSCs and reveals a novel molecular mechanism of immunological abnormalities in cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; EB, embryoid body; ES, embryonic stem; FCM, fibroblast-conditioned medium; HPC, hematopoietic progenitor cell; IMC, immature myeloid cell; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SCF, stem cell factor; TCM, tumor cell&#x02013;conditioned medium; TLR, Toll-like receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Defective myeloid cell differentiation is one of the major factors underlying the immune nonresponsiveness of both solid tumors and hematological malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Consequences of defective myeloid cell differentiation include decreased production of mature, functionally competent DCs and accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). MDSCs are a mixed group of myeloid cells including immature granulocytes, macrophages, DCs, and myeloid progenitors. In mice, MDSCs with the phenotype of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were detected in practically all tested tumor models. Significant accumulation of these cells was found in patients with various types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Numerous studies have demonstrated a critical role of MDSCs in the suppression of T cell responses and induction of T cell tolerance in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). MDSCs may account in large part for the limited effectiveness of cancer vaccines and other therapies such as anti&#x02013;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Recent studies have also demonstrated an important function of these cells in infection, inflammation, and prevention of graft rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>Despite the wealth of information regarding the functional importance of MDSCs, the mechanism responsible for their accumulation remains unknown. Various tumor-derived factors (VEGF, IL-6, IL-10, M-CSF, and GM-CSF) can inhibit DC differentiation from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). In search of specific genes responsible for abnormal myeloid cell differentiation in cancer, we evaluated the effect of VEGF on HPC gene expression by differential display analysis and consistently found up-regulation of the mouse <italic>S100A9</italic> gene. S100A9, also referred to as myeloid-related protein 14 (MRP14) or calgranulin B, is a member of the large family of S100 proteins. It is expressed together with its dimerization partner S100A8 (MRP8 or calgranulin A) in circulating neutrophils and monocytes, but not in resting tissue macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). S100A9 protein contains two helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix motifs (EF-hand), which have high affinity for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Upon elevation of intracellular calcium, S100A8 and S100A9 translocate from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane of myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) and are released as a heterodimer to recruit leukocytes to sites of inflammation or tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Until now, their role in myeloid cell differentiation remained unknown. We report here that up-regulation of S100A9 in myeloid precursors in cancer inhibits DC and macrophage differentiation and induces accumulation of MDSCs. This may represent a universal molecular mechanism of tumor-induced abnormalities in myeloid cells in cancer, directly linking inflammation and immune suppression.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>S100A9 expression is associated with accumulation of MDSCs in cancer</title><p><italic>S100A9</italic> and <italic>S100A8</italic> mRNAs and proteins were readily detectable in enriched bone marrow HPCs, but gradually decreased during culture with GM-CSF and IL-4 and were almost undetectable by day 7, when &#x0003e;70% of cells in culture were DCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080132/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080132/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, under physiological conditions, DC differentiation was associated with marked down-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9. To evaluate the effect of tumor-derived factors on S100A9 expression, HPCs were cultured for 7 d with GM-CSF and IL-4 in CT-26 tumor cell&#x02013;conditioned medium (TCM) or 3T3 fibroblast-conditioned medium (FCM). TCM prevented the down-regulation of <italic>S100A9</italic> mRNA expression during differentiation in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Previous studies have shown that in contrast to FCM, TCM inhibits the differentiation of DCs from HPCs and induces the accumulation of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MDSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). To verify the suppressive activity of these MDSCs, HPCs were cultured for 5 d with GM-CSF, IL-4, and TCM. Consistent with previous results, TCM substantially decreased the proportion of CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and increased the proportion of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MDSCs (Fig. S2). Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were then sorted and added to splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody or to OT-1 splenocytes (CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from these mice have a TCR that recognizes the OVA-derived peptide SIINFEKL) stimulated with control or specific peptide. Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells generated in TCM significantly suppressed T cell responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of S100A9 and A8 in myeloid cells in tumor-bearing mice.</bold> (A) HPCs from bone marrow of naive mice were cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 7 d in the presence of 25% (vol/vol) conditioned media from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (3T3) or CT26 colon cancer cells (CT26).

Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), the proportion of MDSCs in the spleens of these mice increased gradually during tumor growth, and by 3 wk after inoculation was more than fivefold higher than in the spleens of control mice (unpublished data). Amounts of S100A8 and S100A9 increased in spleens of tumor-bearing mice in parallel with MDSC accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Similar to the in vitro experiments, S100A8/A9 proteins were detected in the Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, but not the Gr-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population, and no differences in protein levels were noted between Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from naive and tumor-bearing mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Thus, the increased expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in spleens of tumor-bearing mice and the TCM-inducible up-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 in vitro are associated exclusively with the accumulation of MDSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>S100A9 is essential for MDSC accumulation in cancer</title><p>To determine whether MDSC accumulation requires S100A9, we examined S100A9-deficient (S100A9KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). No differences were found in the proportions of the populations of myeloid cells in spleens (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080132/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080132/DC1</ext-link>), blood, and bone marrow (not depicted) between wild-type and S100A9KO mice.

Consistent with previous observations (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>]), tumor-derived factors significantly reduced the differentiation of DCs and macrophages and substantially increased the production of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MDSCs in wild-type populations. In contrast, TCM did not appreciably inhibit the differentiation of myeloid cells from S100A9KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Thus, loss of S100A9 prevents the defective differentiation of TCM-treated myeloid cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Lack of S100A9 affects generation of MDSCs under pathological conditions.</bold> (A) Enriched HPCs were isolated from bone marrow of S100A9 KO mice (KO) and their wild-type littermates (WT).

Similar results were obtained in the C3 sarcoma tumor model (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080132/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080132/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>To investigate whether immunological mechanisms were involved in tumor rejection, S100A9KO mice were injected i.p. with 200 &#x003bc;g of anti-CD8 antibody 3 d and 1 d before tumor injection. This treatment reduced the level of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in peripheral blood by more than fivefold (unpublished data). None of the S100A9KO mice treated with anti-CD8 antibody rejected their tumors. Tumor growth in these mice was similar to that in S100A9 wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Splenocytes were obtained from S100A9KO and wild-type littermates 12&#x02013;13 d after injection of EL-4 cells and restimulated for 6 d with irradiated EL-4 tumor cells. T cells were collected and used as effectors in cytotoxicity assays against either EL-4 cells, unrelated B16 melanoma cells, or peritoneal macrophages obtained from naive C57BL/6 mice. T cells from S100A9KO mice showed substantially higher cytotoxicity against EL-4 cells than did T cells from wild-type mice. However, no differences were found in cytotoxicity against macrophages or B16 cells (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080132/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080132/DC1</ext-link>). Tumors removed from wild-type mice 12 d after tumor cell injection had clearly visible infiltration of S100A9<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, whereas these cells were absent from tumors from S100A9KO mice (Fig. S6, A and B). Tumors from S100A9 KO mice had visible infiltration of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which was absent in tumor from S100A9 wild-type mice (Fig. S6, C and D) Tumors from S100A9 wild-type mice had viable cells and infiltrated adjacent adipose tissue. In contrast, tumors from S100A9KO mice had extensive necrosis and apoptosis at the periphery (Fig. S6 E). By day 15 after tumor cell injection, tumor-bearing wild-type mice expressed substantially more Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MDSCs than did tumor-free mice (11% in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> vs. 4% in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, the proportion of these cells in tumor-bearing S100A9KO mice was the same as in tumor-free S100A9KO mice and significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.05) lower than in tumor-bearing wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Thus, MDSCs do not accumulate in tumors in the absence of S100A9.</p><p>To address the need for S100A9 for MDSC generation in a tumor-independent model, we injected mice with CFA to mimic the conditions of infection and inflammation, which are known to stimulate production of MDSCs. The level of MDSCs was monitored in peripheral blood by flow cytometry. CFA induced a more than fivefold increase in the proportion of circulating MDSCs in wild-type mice, which peaked on days 6&#x02013;9 after injection and returned to control level by day 13. In contrast, the number of circulating MDSCs did not increase in S100A9KO mice at any time point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in spleens on day 13 after CFA injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Thus, the absence of S100A9 protein prevents accumulation of MDSCs in response to CFA, as well as to tumor challenge.</p><p>To address the potential contribution of MDSC accumulation to tumor rejection, we performed adoptive transfers of MDSCs. S100A9KO mice were injected with EL-4 lymphoma cells, and then split into two groups of five mice each. One group was untreated and the other group was injected with MDSCs isolated from EL-4 tumor-bearing wild-type mice. 4 out of 5 untreated S100A9KO mice rejected their tumors by day 17, whereas all 5 S100A9KO mice injected with MDSCs developed rapidly growing tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the absence of MDSC accumulation in S100A9 KO mice is responsible for their ability to reject tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>S100A9 overexpression impairs differentiation of DCs and induces accumulation of MDSCs</title><p>We asked whether overexpression of S100A9 and A8 could directly regulate the differentiation of DCs and other myeloid cells.

EL-4 tumors were established in wild-type and gp91<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which lack a critical component of the NADPH complex and produce very little ROS. MDSCs (90&#x02013;95% pure) were isolated from spleens 3 wk after tumor inoculation and cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and TCM for 7 d. MDSCs from tumor-bearing wild-type and gp91<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice expressed S100A9 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, inset). However, the lack of ROS in gp91<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice dramatically enhanced MDSC differentiation. Despite the presence of S100A9, &#x0003c;5% of gp91<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells retained an immature phenotype (Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) after 7 d in culture, compared with &#x0003e;30% of wild-type cells. Less than 10% of wild-type cells were F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Gr-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> macrophages or CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs. In sharp contrast, the majority of cells generated from gp91<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MDSCs were macrophages and DCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). These findings suggest that ROS mediate the inhibitory effects of S100A9 on myeloid cell differentiation.</p><p>To further explore this premise, F1 mice were generated by crossing S100A9Tg and gp91<sup>phox</sup> KO mice.

Collectively, these diverse data suggest that S100A9 may suppress myeloid cell differentiation via persistent up-regulation of ROS in progenitor cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study demonstrates a novel role for the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding myeloid-related proteins S100A8 and S100A9 in myeloid cell differentiation. It suggests that up-regulation of these proteins in HPCs is primarily responsible for defective myeloid cell differentiation in cancer. S100A8 and S100A9 were previously implicated in trafficking of granulocytes and monocytes, especially during inflammation and metabolism of arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Here, we show that up-regulation of these proteins results in inhibition of DC differentiation and accumulation of MDSCs. The STAT3 transcription factor up-regulates the expression of <italic>S100A8</italic> and <italic>S100A9</italic>, which is consistent with the previous observation that different tumor-derived factors mediate their immunosuppressive effects via hyperactivation of Jak2&#x02013;STAT3 signaling in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Two of the cytokines (IL-10 and M-CSF) that were directly implicated in tumor-induced abnormalities of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>) were previously found to up-regulate S100A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Consistent with these results, a direct connection between STAT3 activity and S100A9 expression in breast cancer cells was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence presented here support the conclusion that up-regulation of S100A9 causes inhibition of DC and macrophage differentiation and accumulation of MDSCs.</p><p>First, S100A9 was crucial for the in vivo increase in the number of MDSCs in response to inoculation of mice with tumor cells or CFA. S100A9 was also critical for the inhibitory effects of tumor-derived factors on myeloid cell differentiation in vitro. Our data showing normal myeloid cell differentiation in naive S100A9KO mice are consistent with previous studies in which abnormalities in myeloid cells of S100A9KO mice were not detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Apparently, under physiological conditions, S100A9 is not essential for myeloid cell differentiation. However, in the pathological response to challenge with tumor-derived factors or infection, S100A9 is required for both hyperproduction of MDSCs and blockade of DC differentiation.</p><p>Second, overexpression of S100A9 in ES cells dramatically compromised their ability to differentiate into mature myeloid cells, particularly DCs and macrophages. The model of DC generation from ES cells has now been validated in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>), and it was chosen for our studies because precursors of granulocytes and monocytes normally express high levels of S100A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that if S100A9 is important for myeloid differentiation, it would most likely affect the differentiation of early progenitor cells. Our data, indeed, demonstrate that S100A9 overexpression blocks normal DC differentiation. This is consistent with the observation that mature DCs have very low or undetectable levels of this protein. Our results concur with those of Hashimoto et al., who performed serial analysis of gene expression in human DCs and found that, in contrast to monocytes, DCs did not express transcripts for S100A8 or S100A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Apparently, to progress toward macrophage and DC differentiation, myeloid cells must down-regulate S100A9 expression. If such down-regulation is prevented, DC and macrophage differentiation is halted. Instead, ES cells overexpressing S100A8/A9 produced Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and myeloid progenitors able to form myeloid colonies, which is reminiscent of the phenomenon observed in tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Because S100A8 and S100A9 form heterodimers, our initial hypothesis was that overexpression of both proteins would have a stronger effect on DC differentiation than would S100A9 alone. However, although double-transfected ES cells formed myeloid colonies more readily than did S100A9 single transfectants, they affected myeloid cell differentiation equally. This may suggest that up-regulation of S100A9 homodimers is sufficient to block DC differentiation. In line with these findings was the observation that the effect of S100A8 overexpression on DC differentiation was less pronounced than that of S100A9. In addition, S100A8 failed to induce the accumulation of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. Although different functions of S100A9 and S100A8 have been described in several experimental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), more studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of this phenomenon.</p><p>Third, overexpression of S100A9 in myeloid cells of transgenic mice inhibited differentiation of macrophages and DCs and induced the accumulation of IMCs. Cells overexpressing S100A9 had a potent suppressive effect on T cell activity similar to that seen in tumor-associated MDSCs. Moreover, S100A9Tg mice were more susceptible to challenge with immunogenic tumors than wild-type mice. It is important to point out that this effect may not necessarily be caused entirely by accumulation of MDSCs or loss of DCs. Although our preliminary experiments indicate that T cells from S100A9Tg mice do not express S100A9 and exhibit normal function, we cannot yet exclude a possible contribution of lymphoid cells to immune suppression in this mouse model.</p><p>Use of the S100A9 expression vector containing the GFP reporter allowed us to isolate GFP-positive cells with S100A9 overexpression and to compare them to GFP-negative cells from the same mouse as an internal control to rule out contributions of systemic or microenvironment effects. Our data strongly suggest that S100A9 exerts its effect on myeloid cell differentiation via intracellular mechanisms rather than through extracellular secretion of protein. GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> myeloid cells in S100A9Tg mice displayed a normal phenotype despite the fact that they were located in close proximity to GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells that were dramatically affected. In addition, splenocytes from control and Tg mice secreted similar levels of S100A9, as well as S100A8. Finally, soluble factors from S100A9Tg splenocytes, as well as recombinant proteins, did not affect the differentiation of wild-type myeloid cells.</p><p>The molecular mechanism of S100A8/A9 effects on myeloid cell differentiation is currently not clear and requires further investigation. Several potential mechanisms could be explored.</p><p>These proteins may affect DC differentiation via their Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding activity or by inhibiting casein kinase I and II activity, which may be associated with myeloid cell maturation and function. Up-regulation of S100A9 may sensitize myeloid cells to the effects of tumor-derived factors. For instance, we have shown that overexpression of S100A9 results in up-regulation of c-kit on the surface of myeloid cells. Tumor-derived SCF, the c-kit ligand, has been implicated in the accumulation of MDSCs in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). However, the fact that S100A8 overexpression induced up-regulation of c-kit, but did not affect production of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells argues against a c-kit&#x02013;dependent mechanism. Recently, a novel role of S100A9 as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that MDSC expansion requires signaling through the downstream target TLR MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). It is possible that hyperactivation of TLR signaling may interfere with the normal process of myeloid cell differentiation, and S100A9 may be a major mediator of this effect.</p><p>Another possible mechanism by which S100A8/A9 might inhibit myeloid cell differentiation is linked to the ability of these proteins to facilitate ROS production by myeloid cells. S100A8/A9 is actively involved in the regulation of ROS generation by NAPDH oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Studies demonstrated that S100A8 and S100A9 directly bind to p67<sup>phox</sup> and p47<sup>phox</sup>, critical components of the NADPH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). This binding potentiates NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophils. Furthermore, S100A9 inhibits the expression of a substantial number of genes in myeloid cells, including gp91<sup>phox</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>), suggesting that differences in ROS production in the absence of S100A9 may reflect a general role of this protein during myeloid differentiation. ROS, in turn, are the major factors inhibiting differentiation of DCs in tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Our data ROS play an important role in S100A9-mediated effects on myeloid cell differentiation.</p><p>In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that inflammation plays a critical role in tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). This study not only demonstrates a novel molecular mechanism responsible for the suppression of immune responses in cancer via accumulation of MDSCs but also provides a potential direct molecular link between immune suppression, MDSCs, and proinflammatory factors. Together with present and previous observations that lack of S100A9 or STAT3 function promotes tumor rejection via immunological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), these cumulative findings reveal a pathway that negatively regulates the immune response in cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Reagents.</title><p>The following antibody-producing hybridomas were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used as supernatants: anti-CD4 (L3T4, TIB-207), anti-CD8 (Lyt-2.2, TIB-210), and anti-MHC II (TIB-120).
