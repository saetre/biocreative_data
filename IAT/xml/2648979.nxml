Using computational predictions combined with traditional quantitative experiments, we have identified 100 proteins whose deficiency alters mitochondrial biogenesis and inheritance in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In addition, we used computational predictions to perform targeted double-mutant analysis detecting another nine genes with synthetic defects in mitochondrial biogenesis. This represents an increase of about 25&#x00025; over previously known participants. Nearly half of these newly characterized proteins are conserved in mammals, including several orthologs known to be involved in human disease. Mutations in many of these genes demonstrate statistically significant mitochondrial transmission phenotypes more subtle than could be detected by traditional genetic screens or high-throughput techniques, and 47 have not been previously localized to mitochondria. We further characterized a subset of these genes using growth profiling and dual immunofluorescence, which identified genes specifically required for aerobic respiration and an uncharacterized cytoplasmic protein required for normal mitochondrial motility. Our results demonstrate that by leveraging computational analysis to direct quantitative experimental assays, we have characterized mutants with subtle mitochondrial defects whose phenotypes were undetected by high-throughput methods.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Mitochondria are the proverbial powerhouses of the cell, running the fundamental biochemical processes that produce energy from nutrients using oxygen. These processes are conserved in all eukaryotes, from humans to model organisms such as baker's yeast. In humans, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in a variety of diseases, including diabetes, neuromuscular disorders, and aging. In order to better understand fundamental mitochondrial biology, we studied genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, discovering over 100 proteins with novel roles in this process. These experiments assigned function to 5&#x00025; of the genes whose function was not known. In order to achieve this rapid rate of discovery, we developed a system incorporating highly quantitative experimental assays and an integrated, iterative process of computational protein function prediction. Beginning from relatively little prior knowledge, we found that computational predictions achieved about 60&#x00025; accuracy and rapidly guided our laboratory work towards hundreds of promising candidate genes. Thus, in addition to providing a more thorough understanding of mitochondrial biology, this study establishes a framework for successfully integrating computation and experimentation to drive biological discovery.

While protein sequence and structural analyses can provide valuable insights into the biochemical roles of proteins, it has proven much more difficult to associate proteins with the pathways where they perform these roles. Recently, high-throughput and whole-genome screens have been used to form basic hypotheses of protein participation in biological processes. However, the results of these studies are not individually reliable enough to functionally associate proteins with pathways. Many computational approaches have been developed to integrate data from such high-throughput assays and to generate more reliable predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Sharan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, but protein function cannot be confidently assigned without rigorous experimental validation targeted specifically to the predicted pathway or process. Surprisingly few follow-up laboratory efforts have been performed on the basis of computational predictions of protein function, and as such, these computational approaches remain largely unproven, and consequently underutilized by the scientific community <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-PeaCastillo1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Murali1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Yeast is a particularly attractive model system for studying mitochondrial biology due to its ability to survive without respiration, permitting the characterization of mutants that impair mitochondrial function. The process of mitochondrial biogenesis and inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Dimmer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> (hereafter, mitochondrial biogenesis) comprises a number of sub-processes that together ensure that new mitochondria are generated and segregated to a daughter cell. Mitochondrial biogenesis begins with the nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins being transcribed, translated, and targeted to the mitochondria for import <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Contamine1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Pfanner1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The mitochondria must also replicate its own genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Myers1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and assemble the numerous membrane-bound complexes necessary for proper function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Model1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. During mitochondrial transmission, the mitochondria are actively transported along actin cables to the bud neck, where they are then segregated between the mother and daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Boldogh1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to the experimental utility of yeast, it is well suited for the application of computational prediction approaches due to the availability of manually-curated annotations of yeast biology and the available wealth of genome-scale data.</p><p>Previous efforts have focused on identifying mitochondria-localized proteins through laboratory techniques such as mass spectrometry and 2D-PAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Sickmann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Reinders1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and through computational predictions of cellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Perocchi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Calvo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These approaches have resulted in the identification of over 1,000 mitochondria-localized proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Westermann1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, despite yeast's convenience as a model system, mitochondrial phenotypes of &#x0223c;370 of these 1,000 localized proteins have not been characterized, so the mitochondrial role of these predictions is unknown (over half of these 370 have no known function in any cellular process). Previous computational efforts have attempted to address this problem by predicting putative mitochondrial protein modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Perocchi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and examining expression neighborhoods around mitochondrial proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Mootha1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. While valuable, these predictions of protein function have not been confirmed through laboratory efforts. Rather, these studies have performed assays for protein localization to the mitochondria, which is not sufficient to convert these predictions to concrete knowledge of protein roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Shutt1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we describe a strategy that combines computational prediction methods with quantitative experimental validation in an iterative framework. Using this approach, we identify new genes with roles in the specific process of mitochondrial biogenesis by directly measuring the ability of cells carrying deletions of candidate genes to propagate functioning mitochondria to daughter cells. We assayed our 193 strongest predictions with no previous experimental literature evidence of phenotypes and interactions establishing a function in mitochondrial biogenesis. By these assays we experimentally discovered an additional 109 proteins required for proper mitochondrial biogenesis at a level of rigor acceptable for function annotation. Further, we identified more specific roles in mitochondrial biogenesis for several predicted genes through mitochondrial motility assays and measurements of respiratory growth rates. We also discovered genes with redundant mitochondrial biogenesis roles through targeted examination of double knockout phenotypes. This demonstrates that using an ensemble of computational function prediction methods to target definitive, time-consuming experiments to a tractably sized set of candidate proteins can result in the rapid discovery of new functional roles for proteins. Our results also show that most mutants resulting in severe respiratory defects have already been discovered. This is likely to be the case for mutant screens in many fundamental biological processes, because saturating screens have discovered mutations with strong phenotypes. However, even in a well-studied eukaryote like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, there are many processes that have not yet been fully characterized by identifying all proteins required for its normal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-PeaCastillo2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, most of the remaining undiscovered protein functions are only identifiable by rigorous, quantitative assays that can detect subtle phenotypes, such as those used by our study.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We utilized an ensemble of computational gene function prediction approaches to systematically identify candidates for involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis.

The ensemble was used to rank all genes in the genome from most likely to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis to least likely. We selected the top 183 most confident genes that were not included in the training set for experimental validation. Of these, we found existing experimental literature evidence of involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis for 42 proteins, and as such we included these in our set of positive controls (along with 6 genes from the training set). The remaining 141 proteins comprised our set of first iteration predictions, as none of these proteins appeared in published experiments that demonstrated their requirement for proper mitochondrial biogenesis. We assayed these predicted genes experimentally as described below. We then augmented our training set of genes known to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis with the experimentally verified predictions (using both our experiments and the uncurated published literature, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>) and repeated this process to generate a second iteration of predictions.

Individual deletion strains were grown in media requiring aerobic respiration for growth (glycerol), and strains completely unable to grow were deemed respiratory deficient and did not continue in the assay. The remaining mutants were then assayed by measuring the ratio of petite cells to total cells in a colony founded from a single cell. At least twelve matched wild-type sporulation isolates were assayed on each day of experiments in order to establish baseline frequencies. For each gene tested, petite frequencies were measured for at least eight colonies and compared to the distribution of wild-type frequencies measured in parallel on each day of experiments, which allowed us to quantitatively detect subtle phenotypes with statistical rigor.

In particular, examining single gene deletion strains prohibits characterization of the roles of redundant proteins or genes that only exhibit synthetic phenotypes. In fact, all four of our 48 positive controls that did not exhibit a significant petite frequency phenotype are known to synthetically interact with at least one other gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Mozdy1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Sesaki1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Following the second round of computational prediction, 26 of the 58 initially unconfirmed predictions persisted as highly ranked candidate genes while the remainder decreased in confidence. Of these, 22 (85&#x00025;, hypergeometric p-value &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>) candidates are known to localize to the mitochondria, while only 1 of the remaining 32 unconfirmed candidates (3&#x00025;) is similarly localized.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that these 26 high-confidence unconfirmed predictions represented genes that had redundant mitochondrial function, we performed targeted double mutant analysis looking for synthetic interactions.

Choosing mutants with modest phenotypes was necessary to allow for a strong synthetic interaction to be observed. We tested 99 double mutant strains and observed 11 significant synthetic phenotypes (FDR corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum p-value &#x0003c;0.05) spanning 9 of 26 mutants that did not display a single mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000407-g004">Figure 4</xref>). While some of our double mutants exhibit suppression, we did not focus on these interactions because of the modest nature of the single mutant phenotypes. Instead we focused on synthetic defects which we could rigorously define as the double mutant petite frequency being significantly different from both single mutants and the wild-type petite frequency. Of the genes exhibiting significant double mutant phenotypes, 1 was synthetic respiratory deficient and 8 demonstrated altered petite frequency. The 9 genes showed a specific pattern of synthetic phenotypes, as 7 interacted with only 1 of the 4 known mitochondrial biogenesis genes used to generate double mutants.

When investigating well-studied processes (such as mitochondrial biology), most genes for which loss of function completely disrupts the process have already been discovered, since such extreme phenotypes are relatively easy to detect. This is evidenced by the strong enrichment for severe phenotypes among our positive control set. Many important biological functions also tend to be redundant, such that disruption of a single gene results in only a mild (but quantifiable) perturbation of the process rather than loss of function. This is likely to be even more prevalent in higher organisms, which employ far more redundancy than does <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and it is also key to understanding the molecular mechanisms of many diseases.

First, computational data integration has the capacity to take advantage of large collections of existing publicly available experimental data; this can reveal information on a process of interest (e.g. mitochondrial function) by simultaneously examining many previous results. Additionally, computational predictions can often be generated in days or weeks, in contrast to the months or years required to conduct many traditional experimental assays. Computational integration of multiple data sources can also be less biased to any one biological feature of the candidate genes.

Several lines of evidence argue against this possibility. First, we expect that many of these 51 proteins will localize to specific cellular structures controlling biogenesis outside of the mitochondria. For example, 13 of the 51 are known to localize to actin cytoskeleton and/or the bud neck, both structures that play intimate roles in mitochondrial transmission. Of the remaining 38 proteins, 3 were computationally predicted to localize to the mitochondria by another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-Prokisch1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, 11 have no known localization, and 7 have only been localized to the cytoplasm by high-throughput microscopy (which does not exclude mitochondrial localization). Further study of these 38 proteins may identify as-yet-undiscovered mitochondrial localization or highlight the importance of other cellular processes necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. transcriptional regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Decreased Petite Frequency Identifies Petite Negative Mutants</title><p>Among our deletion strains exhibiting the subtle phenotype of altered petite frequency, we observed mutants with both statistically significant increases and decreases in frequency. Increased petite formation clearly indicates a failure in normal mitochondrial biogenesis or transmission.

Mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory growth are partially overlapping processes that intersect in the translation and assembly of respiration complexes. As such, 55 of the 67 assayed mutants (82&#x00025;) that exhibited an altered petite formation frequency had only weak or unaffected phenotypes in the respiratory growth assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000407-t002">Table 2</xref>).

When the colony is fully formed it is a mixture cells with functional mitochondrial DNA and cells without functional mitochondrial DNA. We measured this ratio by re-suspending a colony and plating a dilution of this re-suspension such that 100&#x02013;300 colonies are formed on a YPD plate.

Cells were then imaged using a Perkin Elmer RS3 spinning disk confocal microscope with a 100&#x000d7; objective. Images of mitochondrial GFP fusions were taken using a laser emitting at 488 nm at 100&#x00025; power with an exposure of 1 sec. Phase contrast images were taken using an exposure of 3 ms. For all images, 2&#x000d7;2 binning was used and gain was set to 255. For each field of view, both an initial z-stack of images and a time course were taken. Each z-stack was taken at intervals of 0.2 &#x000b5;m through the entire depth of the cells. The time course was taken in a single focal plane for two minutes at 1 frame per second.

Image files were randomly coded with numbers so that the identity of each imaged strain was not known to the investigator performing image tracking. Mitochondria tips for tracking were identified using the Z-stacks (which avoids selection of tubules that appear to be tips because other sections are out of plane). These Z-stacks were assembled into a Z-projection and merged with the phase contrast image using ImageJ to permit identification of budded cells. The selection criteria for mitochondrial tips were that the tip is initially present in the mother cell of a budded cell. In cases where both termini of a mitochondrion were available for tracking, the tip closer to the daughter cell was selected. The position of the bud neck was set as a reference and the position of a mitochondrial tip in the mother cell was plotted for each of 120 frames. The distance from the mitochondrial tip to the bud neck was calculated at each frame (in our imaging hardware, each pixel corresponded to 0.15 &#x000b5;m). Mitochondrial movement in each frame was then calculated by subtracting the distances to the bud neck in two consecutive frames and dividing by the time interval of 1 second. The tracking data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000407.s011">Table S8</xref>. Sustained mitochondrial movement events consisting of 3 consecutive frames of motion towards (anterograde) or 3 consecutive frames of motion away (retrograde) from the bud were identified using a custom Perl script <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000407-GarcaRodrguez1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

We first took the union of these databases as applied to a core set of diverse organisms (yeast, human, mouse, fly, and worm), considering a gene pair to be orthologous if declared so by any of the three databases. This resulted in a set of unified orthologous clusters, from which we eliminated any cluster containing more than 50 genes.

Strong correlation is not observed between the petite frequency phenotypes and the glycerol growth phenotypes. We compared the petite frequency phenotypes to both the glycerol doubling time and the saturation density (plots A and B). We also compared subsets of the petite frequency data to the glycerol growth phenotypes. In plots C and D, mutants with a decreased petite frequency phenotype were compared to the glycerol growth phenotypes. In plots E and F, mutants with an increased petite frequency phenotype were compared to the glycerol growth phenotypes. As we note in the discussion section of the main paper, the processes of respiration and of mitochondrial transmission are overlapping but distinct biological functions. While they are clearly related in that both require operational mitochondria, the ability of the cell to cope with a partial defect in transmission often leaves that cell with enough functional mitochondria to perform respiration. Thus, particularly in a quantitative setting, these two phenotypes are not necessarily correlated.</p><p>(0.23 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s004"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Strains used in this study.</p><p>(0.04 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s004.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s005"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Summary list of genes tested in this study.</p><p>(0.14 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s005.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s006"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Gold Standards used for 1st and 2nd iteration computational predictions.</p><p>(0.04 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s006.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s007"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>Computational prediction lists from the 1st iteration for genes with mitochondrial function.</p><p>(4.27 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s007.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s008"><label>Table S5</label><caption><p>Computational prediction lists from the 2nd iteration for genes with mitochondrial function.</p><p>(4.35 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s008.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s009"><label>Table S6</label><caption><p>Raw petite frequency single mutant data.</p><p>(0.15 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s009.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s010"><label>Table S7</label><caption><p>Raw petite frequency double mutant data.</p><p>(0.06 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s010.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s011"><label>Table S8</label><caption><p>Raw data for mitochondrial motility assays.</p><p>(0.04 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000407.s011.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000407.s012"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><p>Raw respiratory growth data.
