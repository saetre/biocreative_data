TOP1 has been shown to interact with many proteins including components of the holo TFIIIC complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], SV-40 large T antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], nucleolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the RING finger protein topors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the RNA splicing factors PSF/p54<sup>nrb</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and SF2/ASF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the cell cycle regulatory protein ARF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], RNA pol II complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and HTLV type 1 tax oncoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TOP1 also interacts with a variety of unidentified proteins involved in its phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>We used the core domain of TOP1 lacking the N-terminal highly charged region, the coiled-coil linker domain and the C-terminal active site domain as bait in two hybrid screens for TOP1 interacting proteins. We obtained multiple independent cDNA clones coding for BTBD1 and BTBD2, two uncharacterized, BTB domain-containing, kelch-like proteins. The interactions of HeLa cell TOP1 with the BTBD proteins was confirmed using GST-pulldown and was further suggested by their intracellular co-localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of TOP1-interacting proteins using two-hybrid assays</title><p>The core domain of human TOP1 from residue 198 to 651 was used as the bait in two-hybrid screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This region of TOP1 lacks the N-terminal ~25% of the protein that is highly charged and the C-terminal domain containing the active site and the coiled-coil linker. The resulting polypeptide comprises 60% of the TOP1 sequence. A screen of a HeLa cell library yielded 56 colonies that tested positive in the two hybrid assays (growth on plates lacking histidine or uracil, lack of growth on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid; and induction of <italic>lacZ</italic> resulting in blue color when assayed with X-gal). Nucleotide sequence analysis of 34 of these clones revealed two cDNA contigs of 15 and 19 that predict proteins whose sequences are 80% identical. The proteins were named BTBD1 and BTBD2 according to a recent analysis of their genomic sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The clones of each contig differed in the amount of 5' sequence present: 11/15 and 15/19 of BTBD1 and BTBD2, respectively, had different 5' ends. In the two-hybrid growth assays and &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays, each of the clones tested as positive as the control for strongly interacting proteins (the interaction of c-Fos with c-Jun, ProQuest, Life Technologies). Another two-hybrid screen using a different two-hybrid system (Matchmaker, Clontech) also yielded 2 clones identical to the contig of 15 clones (BTBD1).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of BTBD1 and BTBD2 mRNA</title><p>The longest BTBD1 cDNA clone obtained from two-hybrid screening (3196 bp) contains an ORF that encodes a 482 aa protein starting with an ATG that is preceded by an in-frame stop codon. Sequences in GenBank confirmed our sequence. One was obtained by the oligo-capping method (FLJ20724), and another assembled from partial cDNA and RACE fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The longest BTBD2 cDNA obtained from two-hybrid screening (2413 bp) contained an ORF starting at the 5' end. To obtain the missing 5' cDNA, a nested PCR strategy was used to amplify the sequence from four independent cDNA libraries, but no extended sequences were obtained. 5'-RACE (Life Technologies) also failed to produce longer clones. This difficulty to obtain longer cDNA clones was seen by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The GC richness at the 5' end (85 nucleotides are 79% GC) may form secondary structures that block reverse transcriptase. Analysis of the BTBD2 gene immediately upstream of the 5' end of our cDNA predicts an ORF that begins with an ATG and encodes 85 amino acids in-frame with the ORF of our longest BTBD2 clone; however, the 255 nucleotides encoding these in-frame amino acids sequence are 89% GC rich. To determine if this sequence might be part of the BTBD2 mRNA, RT-PCR followed by nested PCR was used. Two antisense primers complementary to exon 2 were used to prime reverse transcription. Sense primers for PCR amplification were located within predicted exon 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Amplified products of 460 and 306 bp that are predicted from the mRNA template resulted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). If genomic DNA had been the template, products greater than 18 kb would have been obtained. Furthermore, sequencing of the 460 bp-amplification product confirmed it to be the predicted mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The cDNA starting at the predicted start codon was deposited in GenBank (AF355797).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>RT-PCR identifies a highly GC-rich sequence predicted to encode the ammo terminal region of BTBD2. <bold>A.</bold> RT-PCR strategy and the sequence of the amplified region are shown: BTBD2 coding region (open arrow), 3'-UTR (narrow open bar) and exons (wide open bar, 1 &#x02013; 9), sense primers (UO and UI), antisense primers (LI and LO), GC-rich region (solid bar and sequence). <bold>B.</bold> Products of the RT-PCR are shown on an ethidium bromide gel.

In contrast, C-terminal deletions of 112 and 33 aa of BTBD1 and BTBD2, respectively, eliminated binding to TOP1 in the two-hybrid assays. Thus sequences very close to the C-terminus are required for the interaction with TOP1 by this analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Deletion mapping of the interacting regions of TOP1 and BTBD1 and BTBD2 using two-hybrid assays.<bold>A.</bold> Deletions of BTBD1 and their interaction with cTOP 1 (residues 198&#x02013;651). <bold>B.</bold> Deletions of BTBD2 and their interaction with cTOP1. <bold>C.</bold> Deletions of cTOP1 and their interaction with BTBD2.

The fragment of TOP1 from amino acid 215 to 331 was capable of binding to BTBD2. This region includes 18 aa of core subdomain I, all of core subdomain II and 10 amino acids of the second section of core subdomain I.</p></sec><sec><title>GST-pulldown assays confirm two-hybrid deletion mapping</title><p>Truncated fragments of BTBD1 and BTBD2 were tested in GST-pull down assays for their ability to bind TOP1 in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. The GST-pulldown assay confirmed the positive interactions seen in the two-hybrid deletion mapping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In addition, we found that two N-terminal truncated BTBD1 and BTBD2 were able to co-precipitate TOP1 from nuclear extracts (BTBD1, 213&#x02013;482 &#x00026; 303&#x02013;482; BTBD2, 249&#x02013;525 &#x00026; 289&#x02013;525) although they were negative in the two-hybrid assay. Since truncated fragments may be unstable in yeast and may not accumulate to levels sufficient to produce a positive result, we used roughly equal amounts of each truncated protein to test for binding to TOP1 in nuclear extracts. Taken together, the results of the two-hybrid and GST-pulldown assays narrow the interacting region of BTBD1 and BTBD2 to roughly the C-terminal half of each protein with critical residues within the last 50 residues.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>TOP1 from HeLa cells interacts with GST-BTBD1 and GST-BTBD2.<bold>A.</bold><italic>TOP1 Western blot.</italic> HeLa cell nuclear extracts were incubated with GST or GST-BTBD2 beads.

GST-BTBD2 slightly inhibited the supercoil relaxation activity of TOP1, increasing the time required to completely relax the supercoiled DNA by about two-fold as compared with GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The DNA cleavage assay was also used to determine if BTBD2 affected TOP1 activity. This assay measures the ability of TOP1 to cleave end-labeled DNA substrates in the presence of the anticancer drug camptothecin, which blocks the ligation step of the cleavage /religation reaction of TOP1. A 36 bp DNA containing a single strong TOP1 cleavage site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or a 161 bp restriction fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] was used as the substrate.

The full length BTBD2 localized entirely to cytoplasmic bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, m-BTBD2F).

Because TOP1 and BTBD2 are not predominantly found in the same compartments, they may interact transiently, or they may interact only under specific conditions when they may be in the same compartment. We therefore analyzed mitotic cells, but did not observe co-localization of TOP1 and the BTBDs (not shown). We then tested for co-localization in transfected cells. Though the truncated m-BTBD2T localized to distinct nuclear bodies, its co-localization with endogenous TOP1 could not be determined against the background of endogenous TOP1 diffuse nuclear staining. However, in cells co-transfected with GFP-TOP1 and m-BTBD2T, the m-BTBD2T staining was nuclear diffuse as well as in nuclear bodies, indicating that m-BTBD2T interacts with GFP-TOP1, which localizes throughout the nucleus (not shown).</p><p>To determine if TOP1 co-localizes with BTBD2 in the cytoplasm, GFP-TOP1 lacking an NLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] was co-transfected with full length BTBD2 (m-BTBD2F) or truncated BTBD2 (m-BTBD2T).

BTBD1 and BTBD2 were isolated as 15 and 19 independent clones, respectively, and in two-hybrid assays they interacted as strongly as the control for strongly interacting proteins (c-Fos with c-Jun). BTBD1 and BTBD2 also bound HeLa cell TOP1 (100 kDa) in nuclear extracts by GST-pulldown assays. N-terminal truncation studies showed the C-terminal 37% to 45% of the BTBD proteins are sufficient for binding TOP1. C-terminal deletions of either protein eliminated binding to TOP1 (C-terminal truncation of 112 aa of BTBD1 or 33 aa of BTBD2 in the two-hybrid assay; or a C-terminal truncation of 40 aa of BTBD2 in GST-pulldown). Truncation of the BTB domains demonstrated that they were not required for interaction with TOP1. The region of TOP1 sufficient for binding BTBD2 was narrowed to residues 215 &#x02013; 329 in the "cap" region (core subdomain II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

RT-PCR and sequencing of the RT-PCR product demonstrated that this 255 nucleotide, 89% GC-rich sequence is present on the BTBD2 mRNA and that it shares predicted polypeptide sequence with BTBD homologues and orthologs.</p><p>The BTBD proteins contain an amino terminal BTB/POZ domain as well as a C-terminal region that is related to proteins that contain the kelch domain. Neither of these regions yields unequivocal information for functional classification. The BTB domain is a highly conserved 120 amino acid, hydrophobic-rich, protein-protein interaction domain that mediates homodimerization and heterodimerization of a large number of proteins with diverse functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The three dimensional structure of one BTB domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] has been characterized through structure-function studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Proteins containing BTB domains are currently categorized into three groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]: 1) DNA-binding proteins often containing zinc fingers in the C-terminal region, 2) actin binding proteins that contain a kelch repeat of ~50 residues that terminate in a pair of glycine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and 3) proteins that have neither an actin-binding domain nor a DNA-binding domain. The BTBD proteins belong to the last category, although they are distantly related to kelch proteins (~25% identical over ~250 aa), they lack the residues that are characteristic of kelch repeats, a double glycine sequence and a tyrosine separated from a tryptophan by precisely 6 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>BTBD1 and BTBD2 are closely related sharing 80% identical amino acid sequence. They are one of eleven genes in 19p13.3 &#x02192; p12 with close homology to genes in 15q24 &#x02192; q26 that have apparently resulted from duplications of a common ancestral gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Both BTBD1 and BTBD2 are widely if not ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. The predicted promoter regions are highly GC-rich and lack canonical TATA boxes, suggesting that they may be housekeeping genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Close mammalian relatives of BTBD1 and BTBD2 include the mouse orthologs that are 98% and 95% identical respectively, as well as highly similar rat and bovine partial sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Sequence relatives in lower organisms include a <italic>C. elegans</italic> sequence with 58% identities with BTBD2 (429 residues; 2% gaps, F38H4.7), and a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sequence with 46% identities (437 residues, 3% gaps, CG5319). The human genome encodes two proteins with 46% (436 residues, 3% gaps, CAC22147) and 45% (497 residues, 5% gaps, AF353674) identities compared with BTBD2. These proteins comprise a small family whose members have not been functionally characterized and are evidently specific to animals because putative orthologs are not present in available fungi and plant sequence databases.</p><p>We have demonstrated an interaction between BTBD2 and TOP1 by two-hybrid, GST-pull down and intracellular co-localization analyses. Studies are underway to functionally characterize BTBD1 and BTBD2 and understand their interaction with TOP1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>&#x02022; Fifteen and nineteen independent cDNA clones of BTBD1 and BTBD2, respectively, were isolated from two-hybrid screens and found to interact as strongly as c-Fos interacted with c-Jun in the two-hybrid assays.</p><p>&#x02022; The interactions of TOP 1 with BTBD1 and BTBD2 were confirmed by deletion mapping using two-hybrid and GST-pulldown assays.</p><p>&#x02022; Less than the C-terminal half of each BTBD protein lacking the BTB domain is sufficient for binding to TOP1.

BTBD1 mRNA was highly expressed in testes, heart and skeletal muscle. BTBD2 was more highly expressed in skeletal muscle.

These primer sequences can be found below under the <italic>Two Hybrid Screens</italic> section. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing using pGEX sequencing primers (Pharmacia Cat# 27-1410-01 and 27-1411-01).</p><p>To construct the expression plasmid encoding C-terminal-myc-tagged, full length BTBD2 (m-BTBD2F), the entire coding region of BTBD2 (1&#x02013;1575 bp) was amplified with primers (Upper primer: 5' ATGGCGGCGGGTGGGAGCGGCGGGCGTGCGTCGTG-3', Lower primer: 5'-GGTGTAGAAGATGACCTCGGGGATCTGGCCGTCCTCCAC-3') containing BamH I and Hind III cleavage sites and inserted into pCMV-Tag 5 vector (Stratagene) cut with BamH I and Hind III. To construct the expression plasmid encoding C-terminal-myc-tagged truncated BTBD2 having the N-terminal half the BTB domain deleted (m-BTBD2T), the coding region of BTBD2 from the second ATG to almost the end of the 3'-UTR (445&#x02013;2542 bp) was amplified with primers (Upper primer: 5'-ATGTTCAACGGGGGAATGGCCACAACATC-3', Lower primer: 5'-GGGGAGGACGCAGGTTCCAGGAGT-3') containing BamH I and Hind III cleavage sites and inserted into pCMV-Tag 3 vector (Stratagene) cut with BamH I and Hind III.</p></sec><sec><title>Two hybrid screens</title><p>pGBD-cTOP1 was co-transfected with the HeLa cell library (Clontech, Cat. no.

Strong expression of full length GALDB-TOP1 in PJ69-4A was verified by Western blotting with antibodies to both TOP1 and GALDB (not shown). Additionally, the ProQuest two-hybrid system was used because the low copy CEN plasmids may decrease the probability of obtaining weakly interacting false positives that could result from high concentrations of the two-hybrid proteins. In the ProQuest screens, pDBleu-TOP1c was co-transfected with a HeLa cell cDNA library (Life Technologies Cat. No. 11287-018) according the manufacturer protocols. Clones that tested positive in the two-hybrid assays were sequenced across the GAL4AD-prey junction into the coding regions of the prey inserts. Sequences were grouped into cDNA contigs using the SeqMan II program of DNASTAR (LASERGENE).</p><p>C-terminal deletions for mapping the interactions using two-hybrid assays were constructed using the exonuclease III/mung bean nuclease method (C-terminal deletions, Exonuclease III/Mung Bean Nuclease Deletion kit, Cat#460, NEW ENGLAND BioLabs company). N-terminal deletions, in addition to the series obtained through two-hybrid screening, were constructed by amplifying the two-hybrid cDNA clones using primers containing Sma I and EcoR I at the N- and C-terminus, respectively, and inserting them into both pPC86 and pGEX-2TK vectors. The sense primer sequences are as follows: BTBD1: U1 (395-482aa) 5'-GACCCCGGGGAATGATACCGGCTTTAGTTGTGA-3', U2 (342-482aa) 5'-GACCCCGGGCTGGGGTTACAGTGGGACGAGT-3', U3 (213-482aa) 5'-GACCCCGGGAAGTGCAGAAGGGTTTACT-3', U4 (303-482aa) 5'-GACCCCGGGAAACCTCTTTCTTCATTTTACTGT-3', The same antisense primer was used for all amplifications: 5'-CGGAATTCTTTGTGGCCATTTATGTTTTTGAC-3'.

To obtain the full coding region, four independent cDNA libraries were screened using a nested PCR strategy with upper primers complementary to the vectors and two nested lower primers complementary to BTBD2 (5'-TCGTCCGAGTAGAGAAAC-3' and 5'-TCCACGTCGGGCAGCTCAATCTCC-3'). 5'-RACE (Life Technologies) was also used to try to identify longer clones using several different lower primers. Reverse transcription was also performed at 70&#x000b0;C using the thermophilic <italic>Tth</italic> polymerase with magnesium as the cofactor to enable it to use mRNA as a template. None of these strategies was successful.</p><p>To determine whether the mRNA contained the BTBD2 gene sequences directly upstream of the longest cDNA clone, RT-PCR was used with a sense primer complementary to the predicted start codon. The primers for reverse transcription were complementary to exon 2 (LO and LI, see below). PolyA+ RNA was reverse transcribed using <italic>Tth</italic> polymerase (Promega) at 70&#x000b0;C for 20 min. The resulting products were amplified using nested PCR with the Advantage-GC 2 PCR kit (CLONTECH, Cat# K-1913-Y) and two 30 cycle rounds with each cycle having two steps (denaturation 94&#x000b0;C, 30 sec.; annealing and extension 68&#x000b0;C, 3 min; UO: 5'-ATGGCGGCGGGTGGGAGCGGCGGGCGTGCGTCGTG-3'; UI: 5'-CGGGCCCCGGGACAGACG-3'; LO: 5'-CGGGCAGCTCAATCTCCGTGGATG-3'; LI: 5'-TTGTGGCCATTCCCCCGTTGAACA-3'). To amplify the 306 bp fragment, two rounds of PCR were used: the first round used the LO and UO primers, and the second round used the LO and UI.
