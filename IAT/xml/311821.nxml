Alternative RNA splicing results in the synthesis of two types of mouse IGF-I precursor that differ in the size and sequence of the COOH-terminal peptide. The sequences of the signal peptides, IGF-I moieties and the first 16 amino acids of the COOH-terminal peptides or E-domains of the two precursors are identical. The sequence difference results from the presence in preproIGF-IB mRNA of a 52 base insertion which introduces a 17 amino acid segment into the COOH-terminal peptide of preproIGF-IB and also causes a shift in the reading frame of the mRNA. As a consequence of this insertion, the COOH-terminal 19 and 25 amino acids of mouse preproIGF-IA and -IB, respectively, are different. The sequences of mouse and human preproIGF-IA are highly conserved and possess 94% identity. In contrast, the sequences of mouse and human preproIGF-IB are quite different in the region of the COOH-terminal peptide. A comparison of the sequences of mouse and human preproIGF-IB mRNA indicates that they are generated by different molecular mechanisms.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0068-a" xlink:role="7879"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7873"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7874"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7875"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7876"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7877"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7878"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7879"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7880"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7881"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00289-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7882"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
