The enhancement of GTPase activity was inhibited by several aminoglycosides bound at the A site of the small subunit, but not by a P site-specific antibiotic. RsgA stably bound the small subunit in the presence of GDPNP, but not in the presence of GTP or GDP, to dissociate ribosome into subunits. Disruption of the gene for RsgA from the genome affected the growth of the cells, which predominantly contained the dissociated subunits having only a weak activation activity of RsgA. We also found that 17S RNA, a putative precursor of 16S rRNA, was contained in the small subunit of the ribosome from the RsgA-deletion strain. RsgA is a novel GTPase that might provide a new insight into the function of ribosome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Translation is accomplished by an elaborate coordination of two subunits of the ribosome, each comprised from one or two RNAs and several dozens of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c1">1</xref>). The large subunit has a GTPase-associated center as well as a peptidyl transferase center and three classical tRNA binding sites. Several GTPases are involved in the processes of translation, and their GTP hydrolysis activities are all activated at the GTPase-associated center on the large subunit to introduce a conformational change to themselves and&#x0002f;or ribosome to facilitate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c2">2</xref>).</p><p>Recent progress of genome sequencing has revealed the existence of various GTPases with unknown functions in eubacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c3">3</xref>). <italic>yjeQ</italic> is an open reading frame encoding a putative GTPase with an unknown function. It can be divided into three domains, the N-terminal domain having a putative OB fold, the central domain having a unique circularly permuted GTPase motif and the C-terminal domain having a unique CxxxxCxHxxxxxC motif that is involved in zinc binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c4">4</xref>). This protein (RsgA) is believed to be essential in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c5">5</xref>), and it has recently been shown to have a weak GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c6">6</xref>) that is significantly enhanced by the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c7">7</xref>). Unlike other GTPases associated with the ribosome, RsgA was enhanced not by the large subunit but by the small subunit of a ribosome. RsgA is the first factor showing that GTPase activity is activated by the small subunit of a ribosome. In the present study, we show that the activation of RsgA was inhibited by several antibiotics bound around the A site. We further succeeded in disrupting the gene for RsgA from the genome, which significantly affected the growth of the cells and the subunit assembly of ribosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of <italic>E.coli</italic> RsgA</title><p><italic>E.coli yjeQ</italic> had been cloned into the plasmid pGEMEX2 under the T7 promoter sequence.

Purified YjeQ had a very weak GTPase activity as already detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c6">6</xref>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh861tb1">1</xref>). When the <italic>E.coli</italic> ribosome fraction was added to the reaction mixture, the GTPase activity was significantly enhanced. Intriguingly, the GTPase activity was enhanced not only by the 70S ribosome but also by the small (30S) subunit, but it was not enhanced by the large (50S) subunit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f1">1</xref>a). This result is consistent with a recent finding by Daigle and Brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c7">7</xref>). Thus, YjeQ was named here RsgA (ribosome small subunit-dependent GTPase <underline>A</underline>). The level of GTPase activity of RsgA increased depending on the ribosome concentration, and the addition of a 5-fold molar excess of ribosomes (500 nM) was not sufficient to saturate the GTPase activity (100 nM) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f1">1</xref>b).</p><p>We measured the kinetic parameters in the presence and absence of 54 nM 70S ribosome or the small subunit. Both of them increased the GTPase activity of RsgA in terms of <italic>k</italic>cat&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic>m by two orders of magnitude (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh861tb1">1</xref>). The enhancement of GTPase activity was largely due to the increased <italic>k</italic>cat. Enhancement of GTPase activity was not observed when 16S or 23S rRNA was used instead of the ribosome or when the ribosome was treated with RNase A, indicating that enhancement of GTPase activity requires both RNA and protein components of the ribosome.</p></sec><sec><title>The ribosome-dependent GTPase activity was affected by the A site-specific antibiotics</title><p>The effects of several antibiotics on the enhancement of GTPase activity of RsgA by the ribosome were examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f2">2</xref>). As expected, chloramphenicol, which binds to the peptidyl-transferase center of the large subunit, did not inhibit the enhancement of GTPase activity. In contrast, aminoglycoside antibiotics such as neomycin, paromomycin, kanamycin and gentamycin, which bind specifically to the helix 44 at the A site of the decoding region of the small subunit to induce miscoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c10">10</xref>), significantly affected the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity. The addition of 5&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;M of these aminoglycosides resulted in a 50% decrease in the level of the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity. Inhibition of the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity was also observed when a higher concentration (5 mM) of streptomycin or tetracyclin, which also binds around the A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c12">12</xref>), was added. These findings suggest that RsgA is in close contact with the A site of the decoding region of the small subunit. On the other hand, neither kasugamycin, a P site-specific antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c13">13</xref>), nor spectinomycin, which binds helix 34 in the head of the small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c10">10</xref>), had effect on the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of RsgA.</p></sec><sec><title>RsgA stably bound the small subunit in the presence of GDPNP, but not in the presence of GTP or GDP, to dissociate ribosome into subunits</title><p>To examine the association between RsgA and the ribosome <italic>in vitro</italic>, a mixture of RsgA and ribosomes was fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the complex formation was evaluated using an antibody raised against RsgA. Almost no or only a small population of RsgA co-sedimented with 70S ribosome or its subunits in the absence of any guanine nucleotides. This was also the case in the presence of GTP or GDP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f3">3</xref>a and b). The ratio of the levels of 70S, 50S and 30S fractions was not changed regardless of the presence or absence of GTP or GDP. In contrast, RsgA predominantly co-sedimented with the small subunit in the presence of GDPNP, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f3">3</xref>c). In addition, almost all of the ribosomes were dissociated into subunits in the presence of GDPNP. These results strongly suggest that the GTP form of RsgA binds the 30S subunit, probably around the subunit interface, and induces a conformational change in the small subunit or the 70S ribosome to transiently loosen the association between the two subunits. Subsequent GTP hydrolysis may result in a conformational change in RsgA so that it immediately dissociates from the ribosome to restore the stable association between the two subunits of the ribosome. Daigle and Brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c7">7</xref>) have shown that RsgA binds the 30S subunit in the presence of not only GDPNP but also GDP, and that the interaction in the presence of GDP depends on the salt concentration. This is consistent with the result of the present study that was performed at 300 mM KCl.</p><p>We also examined the effect of neomycin on the association between RsgA and the ribosome. When 500 &#x003bc;M neomycin, which is sufficient to inhibit the enhancement of GTPase activity of the ribosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f2">2</xref>), was added to the reaction mixture, neither dissociation into subunits nor binding of RsgA to the small subunit was observed in the presence of GDPNP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f3">3</xref>d). This indicates that aminoglycosides inhibit the step of binding of the GTP form of RsgA to the ribosome rather than GTPase activation after binding to the ribosome or the dissociation of the GDP form of RsgA from the ribosome.</p></sec><sec><title>The majority of 70S ribosomes were dissociated into subunits in RsgA-deficient cells</title><p>To determine the role of RsgA in cells, we tried to disrupt the gene for RsgA from the genome. Since <italic>E.coli yjeQ</italic> has been reported to be an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c5">5</xref>), we initially attempted to make a cell in which <italic>yjeQ</italic> has been put on a plasmid derived from pKO3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c8">8</xref>) and <italic>yjeQ</italic> on the genome has been replaced by a kanamycin-resistant gene. This plasmid, having a temperature-sensitive replication origin, could be removed from the cell by incubation at 42&#x000b0;C if <italic>yjeQ</italic> is not essential for the cell. Unexpectedly, the cells were viable at 42&#x000b0;C. We have no idea about the reason for a failure in disruption of <italic>yjeQ</italic> in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c5">5</xref>). The complete loss of RsgA in the cells was confirmed both by PCR with several sets of primers and by western blotting analysis with anti-RsgA antibody.</p><p>The doubling time of the RsgA-deletion strain was 2.34 &#x000b1; 0.05-fold longer than that of the wild type at incubation temperatures of 42, 37 and 30&#x000b0;C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh861tb2">2</xref>). The ratio did not change within the range of these temperatures. The prolonged doubling time was restored by the introduction of plasmid-encoded RsgA.</p><p>We then compared the pattern of ribosomes from RsgA-deficient cells with that from wild-type cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Intriguingly, the majority of 70S ribosomes were dissociated into subunits in RsgA-deficient cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f4">4</xref>a and b). The introduction of RsgA into RsgA-deficient cells using a plasmid restored the normal pattern of ribosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f4">4</xref>c). Similar patterns were observed when cells were grown at 30 or 42&#x000b0;C. These findings indicate that the deficiency of RsgA resulted in a reduction in the level of translation activity in the cell, probably leading to the phenotype of slow cell growth.</p></sec><sec><title>The 30S fraction from RsgA-deficient cells had only a weak GTPase activity of RsgA</title><p>We prepared a 30S fraction from RsgA-deficient cells under the condition of a low magnesium concentration (1 mM magnesium acetate) in which 70S ribosomes were completely dissociated into subunits and found that it enhanced the GTPase activity of RsgA less efficiently than that from wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>a). Then, we examined a 30S fraction prepared under the condition of a high magnesium concentration (6 mM magnesium acetate) and the 30S fraction prepared from 70S ribosomes under low magnesium concentration. Both 30S fractions prepared via 70S ribosomes from wild-type and RsgA-deficient cells were highly active in the enhancement of the GTPase activity of RsgA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>a). The 30S fraction prepared from wild-type cells under the condition of a high magnesium concentration had slightly less ability to enhance GTPase activity of RsgA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>a, left). The 30S fraction prepared from RsgA-deficient cells under the condition of a high magnesium concentration had much less ability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>a, right). These results indicate that some population of small subunits that do not participate in 70S ribosome particles have no capacity to enhance the GTPase activity of RsgA even in wild-type cells, and that deprivation of RsgA significantly increases the size of such a population. It is possible that such a population is an immature form of small subunits.</p><p>To identify the difference in the small subunit between wild-type and RsgA-deficient cells, we prepared RNA components from the 30S fractions prepared under various conditions, and compared them by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>b). Both 30S fractions via 70S ribosomes from wild-type and RsgA-deficient cells, as well as that prepared from wild-type cells under high magnesium condition, almost exclusively contain apparently normal size of 16S rRNA. On the other hand, the 30S fraction prepared under high magnesium condition from RsgA-deficient cells contained a band of slower mobility than 16S rRNA in addition to the band of apparently normal 16S rRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>b, lane 9). It has been shown that 17S rRNA, a precursor of 16S rRNA, is accumulated when the protein synthesis is inhibited by chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c14">14</xref>). We confirmed that the mobility of this extra band is almost the same as that of 17S rRNA prepared from wild-type cells cultured with chloramphenicol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>b). An unidentified band below the band of 16S rRNA was observed in the 30S fraction prepared from RsgA-deficient cells under the condition of a high magnesium concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>b, lane 9). It may be a degradation product from 16S or 17S rRNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Various GTPases are involved in the processes of eubacterial translation, and their GTP hydrolysis activities are all activated at the GTPase-associated center on the large subunit. In the present study, we demonstrated that the GTPase activity of RsgA is significantly enhanced by the small subunit of the ribosome. Several other GTPases with unidentified functions have been shown to interact with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c3">3</xref>), although very few have been shown to interact with the small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c15">15</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, RsgA is the first molecule showing that GTPase activity is activated by the small subunit of a ribosome. It was also suggested that RsgA transiently binds around the subunit interface on the small subunit just during GTP hydrolysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f3">3</xref>). RsgA can be characterized by three highly conserved motifs, the N-terminal OB fold, the central GTPase motif that is circularly permuted and the C-terminal CxxxxCxHxxxxxC motif that is involved in zinc binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c4">4</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of such a unique structure in GTPase activation by the small subunit is yet to be clarified.</p><p>The ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of RsgA as well as its binding to the small subunit was found to be inhibited by several A site-specific antibiotics, suggesting that RsgA has a role around the A site of the decoding region. It is thus possible that RsgA plays a role in the processes of translation. The finding of predominant dissociation of ribosomes by deprivation of RsgA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f4">4</xref>) reinforces the notion that RsgA is involved not only in translation of some special mRNA.</p><p>GTP hydrolysis has the potential to facilitate conformational change in the molecule and&#x0002f;or its contact molecule to modulate their interaction. The present results suggest that binding the GTP form of RsgA around the A site of the subunit interface on the small subunit induces a conformational change in the small subunit or the 70S ribosome to transiently loosen the association between the two subunits, and subsequent GTP hydrolysis results in a conformational change in RsgA so that it immediately dissociates from the ribosome to restore the stable association between the two subunits of the ribosome. Apparently, the ribosome preferentially binds the GTP form of RsgA, indicating that it acts as a GTPase-activating protein. During the translation processes, the small subunit of ribosome undergoes conformational change to ensure the fidelity of decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c16">16</xref>). Conformational change in the ribosome might also be required in other situations, such as in the mRNA landing on the small subunit to start the initiation step of translation or in the unwinding of the mRNA secondary structure to properly position mRNA in a single-stranded form at the decoding region. Messenger RNA must pass through the narrow downstream tunnel to accomplish the initiation and elongation processes even if it is highly structured, and thereby the requirement of an as-yet-unidentified mechanism has been postulated to overcome such difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c17">17</xref>).</p><p>A recent study has shown that the truncation of the N-terminal OB fold of RsgA affects the interaction with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c7">7</xref>). RsgA has a unique zinc-binding motif that is potentially involved in the second RNA binding. We have found that RsgA has the capacity to bind RNA with broad specificity, although the binding evenly occurs regardless of the presence or absence of GTP or GDP (unpublished results). Like the activation of RsgA, the initiation process of translation occurs not only on the small subunit but also on 70S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c18">18</xref>). In the classical initiation process, the A site of the small subunit is believed to be occupied by IF-1 in which the OB fold is the site of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c20">20</xref>). The functional relationship between RsgA and classical initiation factors, especially IF-1, has yet to be determined.</p><p>Some proteins having a putative GTP binding motif have been shown to be involved in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c24">24</xref>). Era, a eubacterial GTPase that can bind the <italic>E.coli</italic> 30S subunit or 16S rRNA, is also likely to be involved in ribosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c15">15</xref>). In the present study, a depletion of RsgA caused accumulation of a fraction of immature small subunits in the cells, raising the possibility that RsgA functions in a step of maturation of the ribosome. If this is the case, the precursor of the 30S subunit accumulated in RsgA-deficient cells should be a substrate for RsgA. However, RsgA preferred apparently mature small subunits from 70S ribosomes to the small subunits that do not participate in the 70S ribosome particles in the RsgA-deficient cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f5">5</xref>). Furthermore, not only the small subunit but also 70S ribosome was a good substrate for RsgA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh861f1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh861tb1">1</xref>). Note that the accumulation of immature rRNA (17S rRNA) can be a result of a defect in the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of ribosomal proteins by the addition of chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh861c14">14</xref>). Further studies will be required to conclude whether RsgA is involved in maturation of the small subunit or translation processes.</p><p>RsgA is widely distributed among the prokaryotic kingdom. Its homologue is also present in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> but not in yeast or animals. It could be categorized into a new type of GTPase that would provide a new insight into the function of ribosome.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh861f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Activation of GTPase activity by the ribosome.
