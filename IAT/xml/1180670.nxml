It also binds, with lesser affinities, other single-stranded G-rich DNA and RNA sequences. TRAX is a human protein that bears a homology to Translin and interacts with it. Translin and TRAX have been proposed to be involved in DNA recombination, chromosomal translocation and mRNA transport and translation. Both proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes, including the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which is amenable to genetic analysis. Here, we report the first study of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin and TRAX homologs. We have deleted the genes encoding Translin and TRAX in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and found that the proliferation of the mutant cells was slightly stimulated, suggesting that these genes are not essential for the fission yeast. We have also shown that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin and TRAX interact. Biochemical analysis of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin, which was cloned and expressed <italic>in Escherichia coli</italic>, revealed that it is octameric and that it selectively binds d(GT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and d(GTT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> microsatellite repeats. However, unlike the human protein, it has much higher affinities for the homologous RNA sequences (GU)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and (GUU)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>. These data suggest that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin is primarily involved in functions related to RNA metabolism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human protein Translin has been identified in cell extracts by virtue of its ability to bind single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides consisting of consensus sequences adjacent to chromosomal translocations in leukemia and lymphoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The Translin gene (designated <italic>tsn</italic>) has been cloned and found to encode a polypeptide consisting of 228 amino acids. The gene was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and eight molecules of the recombinant polypeptide were found to assemble into an octamer, which forms a ring structure. It was this structure that was shown to bind single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>We have previously discovered in nuclear extracts of human fibroblasts a protein that specifically binds the single-stranded microsatellite repeats, d(GT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>, and with lower affinities, other G-rich DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). This protein was later shown to be identical, or closely related, to Translin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Recent studies carried out in our laboratory revealed that recombinant Translin binds single-stranded d(GT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> microsatellites and G-strand telomeric repeats, d(TTAGGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>, with higher affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> &#x02245; 2 nM and <italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> &#x02245; 12.5 nM, respectively) than the affinity with which it binds a prototypical sequence flanking translocation sites (<italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> &#x02245; 23 nM). However, it does not bind the corresponding double-stranded DNAs [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>); E. Jacob, N. Baran and H. Manor, unpublished data).</p><p>Translin has been highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Of the 228 amino acids in the mouse Translin (also designated TB-RBP), 225 amino acids are identical to corresponding amino acids in the human protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Translin-like proteins in chicken, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> share 86, 81, 53 and 36% identities, respectively, with the human Translin and also have similar lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). However, the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> does not contain a Translin ortholog.</p><p>The 3D structures of the mouse and the human Translins have been determined by X-ray crystallography and found to be virtually identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The monomer has a highly helical secondary structure with seven &#x003b1; helices, which constitute &#x0003e;70% of the amino acid residues. Both crystal structures reported had tetramers as asymmetric units, which by using crystal symmetry operations show that the actual crystallized complex is that of an octamer. However, the octamers visualized in the crystal structures are neither consistent with the assembly of the subunits into octameric rings as seen in electron microscopic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), nor do they have a pore large enough to encompass single-stranded DNA or RNA.</p><p>A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human cDNA library led to the discovery of a 33 kDa protein that forms a specific complex with Translin. This protein, whose sequence has 28% identity with that of Translin, was designated Translin-associated factor X (TRAX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). There are homologous TRAX-like proteins in the various species that also contain Translin orthologs. The human and the mouse TRAX proteins, which share 90% amino acids identities, contain identical bipartite nuclear targeting sequence near their N-terminus, and the mouse protein targeting sequence was shown to be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). TRAX does not bind DNA or RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>The data about the strong affinity of the human Translin to the d(GT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and d(TTAGGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats indicated that it might play a role in the metabolism of d(GT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>.d(AC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> microsatellites and telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). It could also be involved in chromosomal translocations, as implied previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Other studies, which were carried out with the mouse Translin, indicated that the mouse protein binds specific RNA sequences in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions of mRNAs purified from testis and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Based on these and subsequent studies, it has been suggested that complexes including Translin and TRAX might be involved in the control of mRNA translation and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Thus, it appears likely that Translin and TRAX are multifunctional proteins that could play various roles in both DNA and RNA metabolism. However, a definition of their functions in precise molecular terms is lacking. We reasoned that the use of <italic>S.pombe</italic> as a model organism would be advantageous for such functional analysis, because <italic>S.pombe</italic> can be genetically manipulated by techniques that cannot be easily adopted in research performed on higher eukaryotic systems.</p><p>Hence, we have undertaken a study of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin and TRAX homologs and present here the first report on their properties. We have deleted the genes encoding Translin and TRAX in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and found that the proliferation of the mutant cells was slightly stimulated, suggesting that these genes are not essential for the fission yeast. We have also shown that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin and TRAX interact. Biochemical analysis of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin, which was cloned and expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, revealed that it is octameric and that it selectively binds single-stranded DNA microsatellite repeats and the corresponding RNA sequences, but that it does not bind double-stranded DNA. However, it differs from the human Translin in having a much higher affinity for the RNA repeats. These data suggest that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin is primarily involved in functions related to RNA metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Oligodeoxynucleotides, oligoribonucleotides and [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP were purchased from Sigma, Dharmacon and New England Nuclear, respectively.

The strain SP1124f, a ura4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivate of SP1124, was selected by growth of the latter strain on YES plates (plates of YE solid medium) containing 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5FOA).

The tubes were centrifuged for 24 h in a Sorvall ultracentrifuge in the TH-641 rotor at 38&#x02009;000 r.p.m. at 8&#x000b0;C. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected from the bottom of the gradient. The position attained by the protein was determined by SDS&#x02013;PAGE of aliquots withdrawn from each fraction, followed by Coomassie blue staining of the gel. The positions of the RNA- and the DNA-binding activities were determined by gel mobility shift assays of other aliquots withdrawn from the same gradient fractions, using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled (GU)<sub>12</sub> and d(GT)<sub>12</sub> as probes and phosphorimaging of the gels.

The mouse Translin, which also consists of 228 amino acids, differs from the human Translin by three amino acids, whose positions are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> by asterisks. None of these amino acids is found within the regions assigned to functional domains (see below). It is evident that, while the overall sequences of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> and the human Translins share 36% identity and 54% similarity, the degrees of identity and similarity are higher in the C-terminal half of the proteins than in their N-terminal half. In the human Translin, the C-terminal region contains a putative nuclear export signal and a putative GTP binding site. Evidently, the nuclear export signal is highly conserved in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin. The N-terminal half of the human and the mouse Translins include two basic regions. One basic region (amino acids 56&#x02013;64), particularly the basic amino acids K60, R62 and H64, was shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be required for RNA-binding by the mouse Translin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Evidently, these basic amino acids have not been conserved in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin. The second region (amino acids 86&#x02013;97) also includes basic amino acids (R86, H88 and H90) that were found to be required for binding single-stranded DNA and RNA by the human and the mouse Translins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, this region has been only partially conserved in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin.</p><p>The program ClustalW was used to align the amino acid sequences of the human, mouse and <italic>S.pombe</italic> TRAX proteins (data not shown). This alignment revealed that the sequence of 34 amino acids at the N-terminus of the human and the mouse TRAX proteins, which includes the bipartite nuclear targeting signal (amino acids 11&#x02013;27, <bold>RK</bold>rkhdnfphnq<bold>RR</bold>eg<bold>K)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), is missing in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> TRAX protein (the two clusters of basic amino acids that constitute the signal are shown in boldface). However, we observed that the C-terminus of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> TRAX contains a putative bipartite nuclear targeting signal (amino acids 210&#x02013;229, <bold>KR</bold>ylnlevdtatppee<bold>KR</bold>i<bold>R)</bold>.</p><p>As noted in the Introduction, the structures of the human and the mouse Translins have been determined by X-ray crystallography and found to be very similar. We, therefore, built a sequence-dependent homology-based model of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin, using the 3D-JIGSAW comparative modeling server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and the human Translin (PDB code 1J1J) as the structural template. A similar model based on the mouse Translin (PDB code 1KEY) using the 3D-PSSM protein fold recognition server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) resulted in a highly similar structure (data not shown). The <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin monomer model, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, predicts that the structure of this monomer is very similar to the structure of the human monomer, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, with an overall root-mean-square deviation of 0.91 &#x0212b; over all superimposable &#x003b1;-carbons. The approximate positions of the Translin functional subdomains, based on the positions of these subdomains in the human and the mouse Translins, are also indicated on the <italic>S.pombe</italic> model. However, it should be noted that local structural differences within the putative RNA- and DNA-binding subdomains would not have been detected by this approach. Such changes may account for differences that we observed in the nucleic acids binding characteristics between the <italic>S.pombe</italic> and the human Translins (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence that the endogeneous tsn and trax genes are expressed in <italic>S.pombe</italic></title><p>The <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin and TRAX have been identified by the <italic>S.pombe</italic> genome sequencing project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). This finding did not reveal whether the endogeneous genes encoding these proteins are actually expressed in <italic>S.pombe</italic> cells. To examine this question, we performed a western analysis of cell extracts prepared from wild-type <italic>S.pombe</italic> and from <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>trax</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>S.pombe</italic> strains (see below). The western blots were probed with a polyclonal anti-Translin antibody that we have prepared against recombinant <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin, as described in Materials and Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows these blots. It can be seen (lanes 1 and 2) that a band containing a protein of an apparent molecular weight of 23 kDa, which specifically interacted with the antibody, was found in the extracts prepared from a <italic>tsn</italic><sup>+</sup> wild-type haploid and from a <italic>tsn</italic><sup>+</sup> haploid member of a tetrad, which also contained a <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivate (see below). A similar band was observed in an extract prepared from <italic>trax</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (lane 4), but was absent from extracts of <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>,<italic>trax</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> haploids (lanes 3 and 5). These data indicated that this band contains Translin. Lane 6 shows a band containing recombinant Translin synthesized in <italic>E.coli</italic>, which was run in the same gel. As described below, the apparent molecular weight of the recombinant protein was 29 kDa. The discrepancy between the masses of the recombinant and the endogeneous Translins could be due to the presence of a histidine tag in the recombinant protein.</p><p>The authenticity of the endogenous Translin was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays performed with the anti-Translin antibody, followed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE of the immunoprecipitates and mass-spectrometry of the bands.

Since it was not known originally whether Translin was essential for <italic>S.pombe</italic> viability, we initially replaced one of the two Translin alleles in diploid <italic>S.pombe</italic> cells with the ura4 gene. This was carried out by homologous recombination with sequences flanking the tsn gene, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Next, we performed a tetrad analysis of haploid derivatives of the tsn<sup>+</sup>/tsn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> heterozygotes. The results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. It can be seen that in all the tetrads the four haploid descendents were viable. To examine the genotypes of these haploids and of the parental strains, we performed a PCR analysis of DNA extracted from the cells, using the primers depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> shows an agarose gel profile of the PCR amplification products of DNA obtained from wild-type haploid tsn<sup>+</sup> cells (lane 1), cells of a <italic>tsn</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> heterozygote (lane 2) and haploid tsn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (lane 3). Clearly, the lengths of the amplified segments matched the lengths predicted by the diagram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Additional PCR assays revealed that the larger colonies among the tetrads shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> contained tsn<sup>&#x02212;</sup>ura4<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>In a pilot gene deletion project carried out in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, Decottignies <italic>et al</italic>.

Using the primers depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, we have carried out a PCR analysis of DNA extracted from these cells and from wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). It can be seen that the PCR assays yielded fragments of the expected lengths from the wild-type trax<sup>+</sup> DNA (lane 1) and trax<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DNA (lane 2). Next, we crossed our tsn<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant with the trax<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant and carried out a tetrad analysis of the haploid derivatives of this cross (data not shown). These haploids were also viable and included cells in which both the <italic>tsn</italic> and the <italic>trax</italic> genes have been deleted, as indicated by the PCR analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (lane 4) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> (lane 3). The <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>,<italic>trax</italic><sup>+</sup> and the <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>,<italic>trax</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> genotypes were subsequently verified in the haploid strains described above by Southern blotting and direct sequencing. Detailed cell proliferation assays shown in the Supplementary Material confirmed that the deletions did not cause a reduction in the proliferation rates of the cells; rather, the growth of the <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>,<italic>trax</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> double mutant was slightly stimulated, while a lesser stimulation observed in the proliferation of the <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant was within the experimental error. Thus, both <italic>tsn</italic> and <italic>trax</italic> are non-essential genes in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-binding specificity of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin</title><p>The <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin ORF was cloned into an <italic>E.coli</italic> expression plasmid, such that it was fused in-frame downstream to a sequence encoding a histidine tag. The recombinant protein was expressed and purified, as described in the Supplementary Material, and used for biochemical studies described below.</p><p>Preliminary studies indicated that, like the human Translin, the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin binds single-stranded d(GT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats. Therefore, we carried out more detailed studies, in which we used the gel mobility shift technique to titrate the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GT)<sub>15</sub> with the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin. In these assays, we incubated the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide d(GT)<sub>15</sub> with increasing concentrations of the protein under conditions found to be optimal for binding of the DNA to the protein and ran the mixtures in a native polyacrylamide gel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (upper panel) shows a phosphorimage of this gel. A single retarded band containing the DNA&#x02013;Translin complex is clearly visible, in addition to the band containing the unbound DNA. The intensity of the retarded band increased, and the intensity of the band containing the unbound DNA decreased, as the input concentration of the protein was increased. The lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows a plot of these data. It can be seen that an apparent plateau level was reached in this experiment, in which the maximal fraction of bound DNA was &#x0223c;0.70. The failure to completely saturate the DNA could be due to aggregation of the protein at the rather high concentrations required for reaching the apparent plateau level. The aggregation could effectively reduce the concentration of protein available for binding, such that a true plateau level could not be attained. Nevertheless, an apparent dissociation constant of 18 nM was estimated from these data, which is indicative of specific recognition and binding of single-stranded d(GT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats by the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> presents a series of competition assays that lent support to this conclusion. In these assays, the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin was incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled d(GT)<sub>15</sub> in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotides, and the mixtures were resolved by PAGE. It can be seen that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin bound the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GTT)<sub>10</sub> with an affinity that was comparable with the affinity with which it bound the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GT)<sub>15</sub>. Also, the affinity of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin for the oligodeoxynucleotide d(T)<sub>30</sub> was relatively high, while the affinity of the protein for the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GGTTACA)<sub>4</sub>, which contains four repeats of <italic>S.pombe</italic> telomeric DNA, was much lower. Evidently, the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin had an even lower affinity for the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GA)<sub>15</sub> and did not bind the oligodeoxynucleotide d(A)<sub>30</sub> at all. These results were corroborated by direct titration assays of the type shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> that were carried out with other samples of the same oligodeoxynucleotides, which had been labeled with <sup>32</sup>P. Finally, similar gel shift assays revealed that, like the human Translin, the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin did not bind d(GT)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>&#x000b7;d(AC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats and other double-stranded DNA molecules (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of RNA binding by the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin with RNA binding by the human Translin</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows a titration of the oligoribonucleotide (GU)<sub>15</sub> with the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin. This experiment was carried out by the same procedure used for titrating the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GT)<sub>15</sub>. It can be seen that the <italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> value for binding the oligoribonucleotide, 3 nM, was 6-fold lower than the <italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> value for binding the oligodeoxynucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). It is also evident that at the relatively low concentrations required for reaching the plateau level in this experiment, the fraction of (GU)<sub>15</sub> molecules that could be bound by Translin was close to 1.0. The very small dissociation constant of the complex <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin&#x02013;(GU)<sub>15</sub> is an indication of specific binding of the protein to the GU repeats. The specificity of the binding to these GU repeats was also underscored by a much lower affinity that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin was found to have for the oligoribonucleotide (U)<sub>24</sub> (data not shown).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref> shows gel shift competition assays, which confirmed the conclusion that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin has a much higher affinity for the oligoribonucleotide (GU)<sub>15</sub> than for the corresponding oligodeoxynucleotide d(GT)<sub>15</sub>. In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <sup>32</sup>P-labeled d(GT)<sub>15</sub> was incubated in the presence of various concentrations of either unlabeled d(GT)<sub>15</sub> or unlabeled (GU)<sub>15</sub>.

The reciprocal experiment, in which <sup>32</sup>P-labeled (GU)<sub>15</sub> was used as a probe, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>.

It can be seen that, unlike the assays performed with the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin, in the assays of the human Translin, the unlabeled oligonucleotides d(GT)<sub>15</sub> and (GU)<sub>15</sub> competed with the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled d(GT)<sub>15</sub> and (GU)<sub>15</sub> probes with approximately equal efficiencies. Other experiments, in which direct titration assays of the binding of the human Translin to <sup>32</sup>P-labeled (GU)<sub>15</sub> and d(GT)<sub>15</sub> were carried out, revealed that the <italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> value for binding the oligoribonucleotide was only twice smaller than the <italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> value for binding the oligodeoxynucleotide (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin is an octamer</title><p>To determine the molecular weight of the native form of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin, we centrifuged the protein in a glycerol gradient, as described in Materials and Methods. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, (i), shows the sedimentation profile of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin determined by SDS&#x02013;PAGE of aliquots withdrawn from fractions collected from the gradient, followed by Coomassie blue staining of the gel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, (ii) and (iii), shows the sedimentation profiles of the RNA- and the DNA-binding forms of Translin.

Using the sedimentation constants and molecular masses of the marker proteins shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we estimated the sedimentation constant and the molecular mass of the native <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin to be 9.9S and 217 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).

Specific interactions also occurred between individual Translin subunits (C), but did not occur between individual TRAX molecules (F). The specific association of Translin and TRAX has also been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins from <italic>S.pombe</italic> cell extracts, using the polyclonal antibodies that we have prepared against the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin and TRAX, as described in Materials and Methods (O. Laufman and H. Manor, unpublished data).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The <italic>S.pombe</italic> genes <italic>tsn</italic> and <italic>trax</italic>, encoding the Translin and TRAX homologs, have been identified by the whole genome sequencing project of the fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). In this paper, we presented the first demonstration that the two genes are actually expressed in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but are non-essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It should be noted, in this connection, that the mouse, as well as the human, Translin and TRAX have been recently reported to be involved in the control of cell proliferation. Translin-null mice were generated and found to develop into mature fertile animals. However, at birth they were 10&#x02013;30% smaller than their wild-type littermates and remained so until the age of 6&#x02013;9 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from the <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice also showed decreased proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In line with these observations, overexpression of Translin in human embryo kidney cells accelerated the proliferation of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). TRAX was also reported to be essential for normal proliferation of human HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). In view of these data on the mammalian Translin and TRAX, we have carefully measured the rates of proliferation of cells of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> deletion mutants. We have detected a slight stimulation in the rate of proliferation of cells of the double mutant <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>,<italic>trax</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> versus the wild-type cells and a lesser stimulation in the proliferation of <italic>tsn</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells that was within the experimental error (see Supplementary Material). Additional studies will be required to find out the reason for these apparent differences between the <italic>S.pombe</italic> and the mammalian Translin and TRAX proteins.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin shares only 36% identity and 54% similarity with the human and the mouse Translins. However, the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> indicates that its 3D structure most likely resembles the structure of the human and the mouse Translins. This is indeed quite apparent when compared with the monomer human Translin structure visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In particular, the model predicts that, like the two mammalian Translins, the predominant secondary structure features in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin are &#x003b1; helices. In addition, the sedimentation analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> showed that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin subunits, similar to the human Translin subunits, assemble into octamers, and that only the octamers bind DNA or RNA. Furthermore, the sedimentation analysis of complexes formed between the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin and the oligoribonucleotide (GU)<sub>12</sub> revealed that the octameric configuration of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin was preserved after binding the nucleic acid, as previously observed in studies of the human Translin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). However, it has been reported that preformed mouse Translin&#x02013;DNA complexes contain dimers of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p><p>The conservation of the overall structure of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin versus the human Translin could account for the similarity in their modes of binding to nucleic acids, namely their ability to bind single-stranded DNA and RNA, and their inability to bind double-stranded DNA. On the other hand, the low degree of conservation of the putative single-stranded DNA and RNA-binding motifs in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) suggests that the local 3D structures of the nucleic acid binding subdomains were altered in the yeast protein. Such differences could account for the alteration of the DNA recognition profile of the fission yeast Translin versus the human Translin. In particular, we have shown that even though the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin specifically binds the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GT)<sub>15</sub>, it has a 9-fold larger <italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> value for this oligodeoxynucleotide than the <italic>K</italic><sub>dis</sub> value found for the human Translin. Second, unlike the human Translin, the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin has a relatively high affinity for d(T)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats. Third, although the human Translin has a high affinity for single-stranded human telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin very poorly binds single-stranded <italic>S.pombe</italic> telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>As described in the Results, we compared the binding of the human Translin to the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GT)<sub>15</sub> versus the oligoribonucleotide (GU)<sub>15</sub>. We found that it had approximately equal affinities for these DNA and RNA repeats. In contrast, a similar comparison made with the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin revealed that the yeast protein had a much higher affinity for the oligoribonucleotide (GU)<sub>15</sub> than for the oligodeoxynucleotide d(GT)<sub>15</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This difference between the human and the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translins is also indicative of local alterations in the 3D structures of the nucleic acid binding subdomains in the yeast Translin octamer. Since the human Translin has approximately equal affinities for homologous single-stranded DNA and RNA sequences, it might perform functions that depend on its sequence-specific association with either DNA or RNA. Furthermore, the virtual identity of the human and the mouse Translins indicates that they are engaged in similar activities in human and mouse cells, respectively. On the other hand, our observation that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin has much higher affinities for RNA sequences than for homologous DNA sequences suggests that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin could be primarily involved in functions related to its RNA-binding characteristics.</p><p>Among the functions proposed for the human and the mouse Translins on account of their RNA-binding capability are control of translation of specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and regulation of mRNA sorting and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). In particular, it has been suggested that complexes consisting of Translin and associated proteins carry specific mRNAs and proteins from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and that proteins associated with the Translin nuclear export signal are involved in this intracellular traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) [The latter suggestion appears plausible in view of experiments, which indicated that the mouse Translin nuclear export signal is functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>)]. Interestingly, these functions were proposed to be mediated through binding of Translin to regions including GU clusters and other G-rich sequences in mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Our demonstration that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin strongly binds (GU)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), and the observation that the nuclear export signal has been highly conserved in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggests that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin may perform similar functions in the fission yeast cells.</p><p>As noted earlier, there are homologous trax genes in the various species that also contain tsn orthologs. This co-evolution of the two genes suggests that Translin and TRAX are functionally related. We have shown in this study that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin specifically interacts with the <italic>S.pombe</italic> TRAX, as was previously observed in studies of the human and the mouse Translins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). This observation supports the notion that in <italic>S.pombe</italic> cells, as well as in human and mouse cells, the two proteins are engaged as a complex in a common metabolic pathway.</p><p>It is also possible that either TRAX or Translin has additional functions, which they perform independently in association with other proteins. One possibility was indicated by a report that the mouse TRAX (but not Translin) interacts with two centrosomal proteins and a Golgi-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). These findings suggested that complexes including TRAX and these proteins might be engaged in biochemical activities related to the activities that these proteins are known to perform.</p><p>Our observation that neither the tsn gene nor the trax gene is essential for <italic>S.pombe</italic> cell growth and division suggests that <italic>S.pombe</italic> cells might contain a backup system that can efficiently replace Translin and TRAX in providing the functions required for cell proliferation. Such a backup system may also exist in mammalian cells, and in cells of the budding yeast <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> that do not contain Translin and TRAX orthologs. We are currently using the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Translin- and TRAX-null strains for further genetic and biochemical studies. The combined genetic and biochemical approach, which was initiated by the work reported here, should further clarify the biological functions of Translin and TRAX.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_13_4128__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_13_4128__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr A.
