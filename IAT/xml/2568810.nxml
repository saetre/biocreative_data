The normal function of GSK-3&#x003b2; in adult brain is not well understood. Here, we analyzed the ability of heterozygote GSK-3&#x003b2; knockout (GSK&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) mice to form memories. In the Morris water maze (MWM), learning and memory performance of GSK&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice was no different from that of wild-type (WT) mice for the first 3 days of training. With continued learning on subsequent days, however, retrograde amnesia was induced in GSK&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice, suggesting that GSK&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice might be impaired in their ability to form long-term memories. In contextual fear conditioning (CFC), context memory was normally consolidated in GSK&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice, but once the original memory was reactivated, they showed reduced freezing, suggesting that GSK&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice had impaired memory reconsolidation. Biochemical analysis showed that GSK-3&#x003b2; was activated after memory reactivation in WT mice. Intraperitoneal injection of a GSK-3 inhibitor before memory reactivation impaired memory reconsolidation in WT mice. These results suggest that memory reconsolidation requires activation of GSK-3&#x003b2; in the adult brain.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two GSK-3 isoforms (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;) are encoded by different genes in mammalian tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Woodgett1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

This accumulating evidence suggests that activation of GSK-3&#x003b2; may be involved in NFT formation and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p><p>One hypothesis explaining the role of GSK-3&#x003b2; in the adult brain posits that under normal conditions, GSK-3&#x003b2; is inhibited and does not affect brain function. However, in disease states, GSK-3&#x003b2; becomes activated through the elimination of inactivation signals, leading to neurodegeneration. This hypothesis provides the basis for the development of GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitors as potential therapeutic drugs for treating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is inconceivable that a constitutively active kinase such as GSK-3&#x003b2; exists for the purpose of neurodegeneration.</p><p>Recently, Peineau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Peineau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> reported the importance of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity during the induction of long term depression (LTD), suggesting that GSK-3&#x003b2; activity may contribute to the control of synaptic plasticity and memory function. If GSK-3&#x003b2; is involved only in neurodegeneration, then a genetic reduction of GSK-3&#x003b2; would not be expected to affect cognitive function. On the other hand, if GSK-3&#x003b2; is involved in normal brain function, a genetic reduction of GSK-3&#x003b2; would be expected to affect cognitive function. To test this hypothesis, we compared memory formation and maintenance of heterozygous GSK-3&#x003b2; gene-deficient mice (GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>) and their wild-type (WT) littermates using the Morris water maze (MWM) test and a contextual fear-conditioning (CFC) test.

The total amount of GSK-3&#x003b2; in GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was approximately 50&#x00025; of that in WT littermate mice, whereas the relative activity of GSK-3&#x003b2; in GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was about 70&#x00025; of that in WT littermates (see Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003540.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).

Memory performance was measured in terms of an error score, which represents the cumulative distance a mouse traveled in each trial as it searched to find the hidden platform. The error score more accurately and sensitively reflects a mouse's place preference in a trial than other parameters (Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003540.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref> show the average error scores of the mice during the training.

However, with more than 3 days of continuous training (9 days of training), GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice took longer than WT mice to locate the hidden platform. Their error scores increased, while the error scores of WT mice decreased steadily, indicating that the WT mice had effectively learned the location of the platform during the additional training days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). To evaluate the spatial memory of GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we conducted a probe test 24 h after the last session on the ninth training day.

Therefore, these results were due to genetic differences between the mice, and suggest that, although they retained the ability to learn, GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited retrograde amnesia with repeated training. Thus, GSK-3&#x003b2; reduction does not affect the learning process but does affect the memory maintenance system, such as memory consolidation and/or reconsolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> impairs memory reconsolidation</title><p>A new memory is initially labile and becomes stabilized over time through the process of consolidation.

To understand in which process GSK-3&#x003b2; is involved, we examined GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in a CFC paradigm. GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT littermate mice showed similar freezing times in response to the unconditioning stimulus (US). Twenty-four hours after exposure to the US, mice in the reconsolidation test group were placed in the same context (conditioning stimulus; CS) again without the US to reactivate their memory by recall. Mice in the consolidation group did not receive memory reactivation until the test phase. On day 7, memory performance of both the consolidation and reconsolidation test groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) was examined by measuring freezing time. In the consolidation test, GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT littermate mice showed the same level of freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are not impaired in the ability to form and consolidate memory. Furthermore, the consolidated memory is maintained for at least 7 days. In contrast, GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed significantly less freezing in the reconsolidation test on day 7 compared to WT littermate mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Comparison of day 1 and day 7 freezing times in the reconsolidation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) revealed that the freezing times of GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice decreased significantly from day 1 to day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), while those of WT littermate mice remained more or less unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results indicate that GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice learned and that their memory stabilized over 7 days if memory was not reactivated.

Four groups of C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with either GSK-3 inhibitor (AR-A014418; 30 mg/kg) or vehicle solution (approximately 100 &#x000b5;l of 10&#x00025; DMSO/40&#x00025; PEG solution for each animal) 1 h before consolidation (vehicle, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8; inhibitor, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8) or reconsolidation (vehicle, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8; inhibitor, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9). On day 7, memory performance was assessed by measuring freezing times under CS conditions.

Thus, we next investigated the effect of GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition on memory maintenance by intraperitoneal injection of the GSK-3 inhibitor AR-A014418 (30 mg/kg), followed by training on the CFC paradigm. To confirm inhibition of GSK-3, C57BL/6J mice were treated with the GSK-3 inhibitor before the consolidation step or before the reconsolidation step (1 h before CS&#x0002b;US presentation in the consolidation test, or 1 h before CS presentation in the reconsolidation test, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The GSK-3 inhibitor reduced tau phosphorylation by 70&#x00025; compared to the vehicle control, suggesting that the treatment inhibited GSK-3 activity (see Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003540.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Inhibiting GSK-3 before the consolidation step did not impair memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>), but GSK-3 inhibition applied before the reconsolidation step significantly impaired memory reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Thus, the memory reconsolidation step is more sensitive to GSK-3&#x003b2; activity than the memory consolidation step, and these results indicate that activation of GSK-3&#x003b2; might be required for memory reconsolidation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The genetic reduction of GSK-3&#x003b2; and the pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3 impaired reconsolidation of hippocampus-dependent place memory, as demonstrated in the CFC test, a test that assesses hippocampus-mediated memory consolidation and reconsolidation. Hence, GSK-3&#x003b2; may be involved in memory reconsolidation in the hippocampus. The mechanism of memory formation and maintenance in the hippocampus, however, may also involve coordinated activity in other brain regions. Clearly, more work is needed to clarify the role of GSK-3&#x003b2; in cortex and other brain regions.</p><p>Although mice expressing the dominant negative form of GSK-3 display neuronal damage in striatum and cortex accompanied by impaired limb mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-GmezSintes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not display these phenomena. This discrepancy may due to GSK-3&#x003b1; activity. Although GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> reduces GSK-3&#x003b2; activity without affecting GSK-3&#x003b1;, dominant negative GSK-3 reduces both GSK-3&#x003b1; and GSK-3&#x003b2; activity in striatum and cortex. This reduction may cause neuronal vulnerability.</p><p>Both place learning in the MWM and context learning in the CFC paradigm reflect mainly hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed retrograde amnesia in the MWM and CFC paradigms. Using the CFC paradigm, we demonstrated that GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>, or pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3, impaired memory reconsolidation without affecting memory consolidation. Therefore, GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice&#x02014;in which GSK-3&#x003b2; is genetically reduced&#x02014;and WT mice treated with a GSK-3 inhibitor lose their ability to reconsolidate memory. Injecting a protein synthesis inhibitor (anisomycin) into dorsal hippocampus inhibits memory consolidation and reconsolidation in both place and context learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Artinian1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Rossato1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, if GSK-3&#x003b2; is involved in a common mechanism of memory reconsolidation shared by both tasks, we would expect that the genetic reduction of GSK-3&#x003b2; to also impair memory reconsolidation of affected mice. Indeed, GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did display impaired memory reconsolidation in both MWM and CFC tests.</p><p>During the first 3 days of training, GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not exhibit memory impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). However, after 9 days of repetitive training, GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited retrograde amnesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003540-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Artinian and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Artinian1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> found that injecting anisomycin into CA3 after a single reactivation, inhibited memory reconsolidation following 4 sessions of three trials in one day in a place-learning version of the MWM paradigm. In our MWM training protocol, mice were repeatedly trained three trials everyday. The strength of memory in each day in our MWM protocol seems to be weaker than that in Artinians' protocol. The temporal dynamics of memory reconsolidation depend on the strength and age of the memory, such that younger and weaker memories are more easily reconsolidated than older and stronger ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, more than three days of repetitive training may be required for inhibiting memory reconsolidation by genetic reduction of GSK-3&#x003b2; (GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>) under our MWM protocol.</p><p>One caveat in interpreting a retrograde amnesia effect in the CFC paradigm is the possibility of extinction of the conditioned response, because retrograde amnesia in repeated exposure to the same context without reinforcement can produce extinction. Therefore, it is possible that GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition-induced retrograde amnesia may be due to facilitation of extinction or impairment of reconsolidation. However, the facilitation-of-extinction notion cannot explain the result showing that GSK<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed retrograde amnesia upon repetitive training in the MWM. Since maintenance of spatial memory in the MWM requires memory consolidation and reconsolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Morris1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and since MWM training is performed under the existence of a reinforcer, spatial memory may not be affected by memory extinction. Therefore, retrograde amnesia related to GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition could be due to an impairment of memory reconsolidation, not to facilitation of extinction.</p><p>NMDA-induced bidirectional synaptic plasticity (long term potentiation, LTP; long term depression, LTD) is believed to underlie memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Morris2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. During LTP, neurons store relevant information by synaptic tagging, which is thought to underlie a stable memory trace <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Frey1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, GSK-3&#x003b2; activation has been reported to be required for NMDA-dependent LTD induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Peineau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, overexpression of GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibits LTP induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Hooper1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, GSK-3&#x003b2; could modulate the balancing of LTP and LTD in an activity-dependent manner. Overexpression of GSK-3&#x003b2; impairs acquisition of reference memory in a novel object recognition task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Engel3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. As we have shown in this report, the inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; blocks memory reconsolidation but not memory acquisition or consolidation. These observations suggest that activated GSK-3&#x003b2; may contribute to memory reconsolidation by controlling LTP/LTD balance.</p><p>If LTP and LTD contribute to the formation and maintenance of memory traces, memory acquisition and consolidation processes may preferentially depend on LTP. In the case of memory reconsolidation, LTD may be more important for maintaining a prior potentiated circuit by competitive synaptic maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Diamond1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. GSK-3&#x003b2; activation may help protect a stable memory trace from corruption through additional synaptic connections or changes during recall and reconsolidation. Although this idea may be supported by the observation that greater activation of GSK-3&#x003b2; is required in the reconsolidation process rather than in the consolidation process, more precise mechanisms need to be clarified.</p><p>GSK-3&#x003b2; is involved in NFT formation in AD. During normal aging, NFTs are observed in the entorhinal cortex. This may represent a very early pathological change of sporadic AD. Because memory reconsolidation is required for GSK-3&#x003b2; activation, tau might be hyperphosphorylated when memory is reconsolidated. As we recently reported, the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau impairs learning and memory during old age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003540-Kimura1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, frequent activation of memory reconsolidation in older brains may damage learning and memory through the hyperphosphorylation of tau. Thus, GSK-3&#x003b2; does have an important role in memory maintenance in the adult brain, but it may also cause NFT formation in the aged brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57/BL6J mice aged &#x0223c;7 months were used for all experiments.
