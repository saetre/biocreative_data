All piglets showing the trait are descendants of a specific boar and the trait shows autosomal co-dominant inheritance. At the age of six months hair growth is increased but not fully restored. A similar phenotype has been described in knock-out mice deficient of the <italic>ITGB6 </italic>gene (<italic>ITGB6</italic>-/-) encoding the integrin &#x003b2;<sub>6</sub>-subunit. These mice display juvenile hairlessness mainly on their neck, head and inner thighs, macrophage infiltration of the dermis and lymphocyte infiltration of the conductive airways of the lung. At the age of puberty, hair growth is resumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and later, age dependent lung emphysema appears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Integrins are a family of cell surface heterodimers, each consisting of an &#x003b1;- and a &#x003b2;-subunit. The integrin molecules are anchored in the cell membrane where they mediate a wide range of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The &#x003b2;<sub>6</sub>-subunit pairs only with the &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>-subunit constituting integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>-subunit, however, pairs with five different &#x003b2;-subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and plays a central role with respect to normal embryonic development and survival. Ablation of <italic>ITGAV </italic>in mice causes malformations and embryonic or postnatal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The expression of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>is restricted to epithelia and seems predominant in various developing organs of the embryo/fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Besides, various patho-biological events induce a neo-expression of this integrin, e.g. tumor genesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and general cases of clinical or subclinical inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The resemblance between the phenotype detected in the pigs and the phenotype of the <italic>ITGB6</italic>-/- mice suggests <italic>ITGB6 </italic>as a candidate gene for the mutated pig phenotype. However, since the ITGB6 polypeptide dimerizes with ITGAV the gene encoding ITGAV is also considered a possible candidate.</p><p>In this paper the mutated pig phenotype is characterized macroscopically and histologically. Furthermore, taking the outset in linkage studies, sequencing and functional studies, <italic>ITGAV </italic>and <italic>ITGB6 </italic>are evaluated as candidates for the phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Phenotype 0&#x02013;6 months</title><p>Based on the founder boar and his offspring an experimental population (n = 113) was established. A clear difference in amount of hair was observed in the pedigree, i.e. animals could be scored as normal (hh), heterozygous (Hh) and homozygous (HH) according to these observations. Hh pigs displayed hairless areas primarily on the back and rear, whereas HH pigs were almost entirely hairless. The degree of hairlessness varied somewhat within each genotype group. The skin appeared thin and reddish, mainly in the HH pigs but also in the Hh pigs (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Juvenile hairlessness in pigs</bold>.

The thickness of the dermis was measured and the hair follicles were counted. No lesions were observed apart from a few small areas with erosions and mild hyperkeratosis, which are normally present in the skin of piglets. However, in skin sections from both shoulder and thigh the dermis was significantly thinner in the HH and Hh groups compared to the hh group (p = 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the HH and Hh groups. The HH group had significantly fewer hairs/hair follicles than the Hh group (p = 0.0001), and the Hh group had significantly fewer hairs/hair follicles than the hh group (p = 0.01).</p><p><italic>Musculi arrectores pili </italic>were totally absent in skin from HH animals and only rarely detected in skin from Hh animals. Another morphologic difference was the tissue surrounding the sweat glands in the skin. In all skin sections these glands were found within the dermis close to the subcutis, but in HH skin they were embedded in connective tissue and in hh skin they were surrounded by fat tissue (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>HH and hh skin sections</bold>.

It is most probably caused by a spontaneous mutation in the founder boar and the corresponding phenotype has resemblance to that of the <italic>ITGB6</italic>-/- knockout mice. The only not coinciding features are the distribution of the hairlessness and the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltrations observed in the skin and lungs respectively of the knock-out mice. The interstitial pneumonia detected in the lungs of both young and adult pigs is most likely due to infection with porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) which is widespread within the Danish population of pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] including our experimental population.</p><p>The fact that the hairlessness of the heterozygous pigs is intermediate indicates, that one functional copy of the gene in question is not enough to maintain a normal skin phenotype (or one dysfunctional copy can impair the "normal" pathway). The mutation seems to affect secondary structures of the skin in general. We have observed aplasia not only of hair follicles but also of <italic>musculi arrectores pili</italic>. Furthermore, the sweat glands are embedded directly in the connective tissue without any surrounding fat tissue. Also, the thickness of the dermis is affected.</p><p>Both heterozygous and homozygous pigs develop age dependent lung emphysema. Our animal material has not been sufficient to provide an "age of onset" of emphysema within the two genotype groups but our data suggest that emphysema appears around the age of puberty in homozygous animals and that the heterozygous pigs maintain a normal lung phenotype longer than the homozygous pigs.</p><p>Although the candidate region on SSC15 was confirmed, our results so far have not supported <italic>ITGB6 </italic>as a candidate gene. First, we did not detect any non-synonymous mutations in the coding region of the <italic>ITGB6 </italic>gene in the HH animals. A difference in the expression level of <italic>ITGB6 </italic>in the two genotype groups could have pointed towards a mutation in the regulatory region of this gene. Even if the <italic>ITGB6 </italic>expression was upregulated in the HH group, the difference was not significant. A reason for the upregulation could be the interstitial pneumonia observed in the HH group, as <italic>ITGB6 </italic>is known to be upregulated in response to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the hh group we observed interstitial pneumonia in only one pig. The western blot showed an apparently equal expression of the ITGB6 protein in the three groups.</p><p>The porcine gene encoding the integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v </sub>subunit (<italic>ITGAV</italic>) was mapped to a position on SSC15 within the candidate region. A mutation in <italic>ITGAV </italic>would be expected to have far more severe consequences, as the &#x003b1;<sub>v </sub>subunit pairs with five different &#x003b2; subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In mice, for instance, the ablation of <italic>ITGAV </italic>causes embryonic or postnatal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Still, a mutation in <italic>ITGAV </italic>could not be entirely excluded as such a mutation might reside in a region interacting specifically with the &#x003b2;6 subunit. Sequencing of the <italic>ITGAV </italic>HH and hh coding sequences, however, did not reveal any potential causative mutation, and also, quantitative PCR results revealed an equal <italic>ITGAV </italic>expression in HH and hh pigs.</p><p>These observations were supported by the flow cytometric demonstration of high levels of the &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>receptor on kidney cells from HH animals and immunohistochemical detection of the receptor in HH lung sections. The presence of the receptor in HH pigs was furthermore confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of monolayer HH pig kidney cells (data not shown).</p><p>The pathogenesis underlying the hairlessness in the knockout mice is so far unknown. Huang <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] observe fewer hair follicles and numerous degenerating hair follicles surrounded by mononuclear cells in the hairless dermis of the <italic>ITGB6</italic>-/- mice, indicating an inflammatory response. It has been demonstrated that the expression of <italic>ITGB6 </italic>is upregulated in response to injury and/or inflammation and that integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>exerts a modulating effect on the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Huang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] argue that the lack of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>in <italic>ITGB6</italic>-/- mice allows for minor skin irritations to cause an escalated inflammatory response resulting in hairlessness, for instance in the neck skin where the mother lifts her pups. Hair loss due to skin irritation can however, be excluded in the pig since the phenotype is inborn and without any sign of inflammatory response. Interestingly, our more detailed histological characterization of the skin show that hair follicles are present at a low frequency, however, without presence of <italic>musculi arrectores pili</italic>. This indicates that the mechanism underlying the phenotype has a subtle influence on cell migration/cellular development during embryonal development.</p><p>In contrast to the hairlessness the pathogenesis regarding the lung emphysema is well described in the <italic>ITGB6</italic>-/- mice. The condition is caused by an elevated expression of matrix metalloproteinase 12 (Mmp12), a macrophage expressed protease that degrades elastin causing a loss of lung elasticity and enlargement of alveolar airspaces. The elevated Mmp12 level, again, is caused by a lack of active transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1), which has a regulatory effect on the expression of <italic>MMP12 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has been shown that integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>is central in activating TGF-&#x003b2;1. TGF-&#x003b2;1 is secreted in an inactive form bound to a latency associated peptide (LAP), but binding of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>to the LAP part of the LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 complex, allows TGF-&#x003b2;1 to interact with its receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Morris <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] report a 200-fold increase in the <italic>MMP12 </italic>expression in <italic>ITGB6 </italic>knockout mice compared to wild-type mice.</p><p>Our results have supported neither <italic>ITGB6 </italic>nor <italic>ITGAV </italic>as candidate genes for juvenile hairlessness and age dependent emphysema in pigs. However, the resemblance with the <italic>ITGB6</italic>-/- knockout phenotype in mice is striking and it is obvious to expect the causative mutation in the pig to affect a pathway analogous to the murine integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>&#x02013; TGF-&#x003b2;1 &#x02013; Mmp12 &#x02013; pathway. This pathway is, however, complex and elaborately regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and involves several indispensable key elements in terms of maintaining full functionality. According to the database PigQTLdb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] the region between S0149 and KS155 on pig chromosome 15 is syntenic to human chromosome 2 in the region from approximately 170 Mb to 220 Mb. According to Ensembl release 49, March 2008, this region comprises 350 protein coding genes many of which are poorly annotated. Thus, it will be necessary to narrow down the candidate region further, before good predictions of candidate genes possibly involved in the biochemical pathway leading to the phenotype in question can be made. It is, however, also important to keep in mind that we can not yet completely rule out that the integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6 </sub>is implicated in the phenotype since for instance a mutation in the promoter region or in a transcription factor/transcription factor target site could influence expression of either of the genes temporally or spatially.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A mutated phenotype has been detected in the pig. The phenotype is characterized by hairlessness until puberty, thin skin with few hair follicles and absence of <italic>musculi arrectores pili </italic>and development of localized areas of emphysema in the lungs from the age of puberty. Linkage studies have unequivocally pointed out the region harbouring the mutation responsible for the phenotype. However, sequencing and functional studies of the most obvious candidate genes, <italic>ITGB6 </italic>and <italic>ITGAV </italic>have so far not supported either of them as the causative gene behind juvenile hairlessness and age dependent lung emphysema in pigs. Future work will therefore be directed at narrowing down the candidate region through linkage analysis in an extended experimental family. We are in the process of breeding additional animals for this purpose. Once the candidate region spans only a few megabases, re-sequencing will be performed in HH and hh animals with the purpose of identifying the mutation explaining the phenotype in question. Further characterization of the mutated gene or locus and the effect of the mutation will provide novel information about the biochemical pathway involved in the development of lung emphysema.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental population and DNA</title><p>Based on the founder boar an experimental population of 113 pigs was established and an EDTA stabilized blood sample was collected from each animal.

Besides, 13 mature pigs (ages from eight to 42 months) were euthanized. Tissue samples from all lung lobes as well as skin samples from two locations on the lateral part of the left shoulder and thigh, respectively, were collected for histological evaluation. Following fixation for 24 hours in 10% neutral buffered formalin, the tissues were transformed to 70% ethanol for 48 hours. Tissues were processed through graded concentrations of ethanol and xylene, and embedded in paraffin blocks. The procedure of paraffin-embedment ensured that the 4&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;m thick tissue sections, which were stained with haematoxylin and eosin or trichrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], were cut perpendicular to the tissue surface.</p><p>All tissue sections were examined histologically using an Olympus BX60 microscope. Besides, the thickness of the dermis and epidermis was measured (mm) (18 observations pr. animal) and the number of hairs (encompassing hair roots and hair follicles) was counted (4 counts pr. animal) from randomly obtained standard microphotos of each skin section. A Leica DC500 camera was used for this purpose and for all histological pictures presented.

PCR products were sequenced using BigDye<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, (Applied Biosystems).</p><p>HH and hh sequences were assembled as described for the <italic>ITGB6 </italic>sequences and the assembly was scrutinized for sequence differences between the two genotype groups.</p></sec><sec><title>RH mapping of <italic>ITGB6 </italic>and <italic>ITGAV</italic></title><p>The porcine <italic>ITGB6 </italic>and <italic>ITGAV </italic>were mapped in the IMpRH panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. For <italic>ITGB6 </italic>a standard PCR reaction was applied with the primers: Exon15L (annealing in exon 15) and Exon15_R2 (annealing in the 3'UTR, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). For mapping of <italic>ITGAV</italic>, intron 11 was first PCR amplified and sequenced as described previously using the primers IN11F and IN11R (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) annealing in exon 11 and 12 respectively. RH mapping was performed with the primers MINF and MINR (both annealing in intron 11, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). PCR amplification in the 118 hybrids was evaluated after electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>Lung RNA samples from each of four HH pigs (from eight to 22 months old) and four hh pigs from another farm (eight months old) were generated using TRI REAGENT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Molecular Research Center (Ohio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were DNAse treated using RNeasy<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNAs were synthesized as described earlier.</p><p>For <italic>ITGB6 </italic>the cDNA was diluted five fold. Two primer sets were used: one within exon 3 (Exon3+4_seqL and Ex2R, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and one spanning the exon 9/exon 10 boundary (Exon9_11_L and Exon10_R, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).<italic>Ribosomal protein L4 </italic>(<italic>RPL4</italic>), <italic>hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase </italic>(<italic>HPRT</italic>) and <italic>tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta-polypeptide </italic>(<italic>YWHAZ</italic>) were included in the study as reference genes.</p><p>For <italic>ITGAV </italic>the cDNA was undiluted and the primers AVex2F (annealing at the exon1-exon2 boundary) and AVex3R (annealing in exon 3) (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) were used. The reference genes were <italic>Ribosomal protein L4 </italic>(<italic>RPL4</italic>), <italic>hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase </italic>(<italic>HPRT</italic>) and <italic>TATA binding protein </italic>(<italic>TBP</italic>).</p><p>An MX3000p&#x02122; thermocycler (Stratagene, USA) was used for the real time quantitative PCR. For each primer set a standard curve was constructed using a dilution series of known concentrations of purified PCR products (QIAquick<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>PCR Purification Kit (250), Qiagen). The standard curves represented a plot of CP (crossing point, defined as the cycle at which the fluorescence signal crosses the threshold) vs. the relative concentration of PCR product. Single PCR reactions were performed for each cDNA sample, a genomic DNA sample and a non-template negative control using Brilliant<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green Master Mix (Stratagene). SYBR green fluorescence was automatically detected during each PCR reaction. The MX3000p&#x02122; software (Stratagene) was used for baseline adjustment and accordingly for setting the fluorescence threshold value. CP values for the HH group obtained from all three target sequences was compared to CP values for the hh "control" group using REST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] with 2000 randomisations. A significance level of p &#x0003c; 0.05 was chosen.</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blot</title><p>Protein was isolated from lung tissue samples from mouse, one hh pig, one Hh pig and one HH pig using TRI REAGENT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Molecular Research Center (Ohio) following the manufacturers instructions.

After another washing, the cells were incubated with 25 &#x003bc;l (1:50 dilution) R-phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated streptavidin (R0438, DAKO, Denmark) for 10 min. After washing, the cells were finally resuspended in 200 &#x003bc;l BD FACSFlow&#x02122; (Becton Dickinson) for flow cytometric examination. All incubations were performed at room temperature in the dark and centrifugations were carried out at 490 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>at 24&#x000b0;C. Controls without any reagents and with secondary antibody, only, were included for each pig.
