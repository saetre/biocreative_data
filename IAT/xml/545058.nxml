MAGUKs are thought to be critical for postsynaptic assembly at glutamatergic synapses. However, glutamate receptor cluster formation has never been examined in <italic>Drosophila </italic>DLG mutants. The fly neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a genetically-malleable model glutamatergic synapse widely used to address questions regarding the molecular mechanisms of synapse formation and growth. Here, we use immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and electrophysiology to examine whether fly NMJ glutamate receptor clusters form normally in DLG mutants. We also address the question of how DLG itself is localized to the synapse by testing whether presynaptic innervation is required for postsynaptic DLG clustering, and whether DLG localization requires the presence of postsynaptic glutamate receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There are thought to be two classes of glutamate receptors in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ: 1) receptors that contain the subunit GluRIIA, and 2) receptors that contain the subunit GluRIIB. In DLG mutants, antibody staining for the glutamate receptor subunit GluRIIA is normal, but antibody staining for the glutamate receptor subunit GluRIIB is significantly reduced. Electrophysiological analysis shows an overall loss of functional postsynaptic glutamate receptors, along with changes in receptor biophysical properties that are consistent with a selective loss of GluRIIB from the synapse. In uninnervated postsynaptic muscles, neither glutamate receptors nor DLG cluster at synapses. DLG clusters normally in the complete absence of glutamate receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that DLG controls glutamate receptor subunit composition by selectively stabilizing GluRIIB-containing receptors at the synapse. We also show that DLG, like glutamate receptors, is localized only after the presynaptic neuron contacts the postsynaptic cell. We hypothesize that glutamate receptors and DLG cluster in response to parallel signals from the presynaptic neuron, after which DLG regulates subunit composition by stabilizing (probably indirectly) receptors that contain the GluRIIB subunit. The mechanism(s) stabilizing GluRIIA-containing receptors remains unknown.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The molecular mechanisms that target postsynaptic glutamate receptors to the postsynaptic membrane, and keep receptors clustered there, remain unknown. Membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins (MAGUKs) are cell-cell junction proteins with multiple protein-interaction domains (PDZ, SH3, 4.1/Hook, and a catalytically inactive guanylate kinase/GUK domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Synaptic MAGUKs are widely believed to be required for recruitment and/or stabilization of a variety of synaptic proteins, including glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic density (PSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although genetic evidence for MAGUK-dependent clustering of NMDA receptors is strongest, and consistent with a model wherein MAGUKs traffick NMDARs to the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the evidence for scaffolding or trafficking of non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors by MAGUKs is largely based on biochemical interactions and overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is little evidence showing that glutamate receptors fail to cluster appropriately in the absence of MAGUKs &#x02013; a critical prediction of the 'MAGUK scaffold' model.</p><p><italic>Drosophila </italic>DLG is a prototypical MAGUK, containing three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, a hook/4.1-binding domain, and a GUK domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. DLG is the sole fly representative of a large group of mammalian MAGUKs, including SAP-90/PSD-95, SAP-102/NE-dlg, Chapsyn-110/PSD-93, and SAP97/human DLG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. DLG was originally isolated as a tumor suppressor due to loss of apicobasal polarity in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants and consequent tumorous overgrowth in imaginal disc epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Since then, DLG has been shown to be present at several types of cell junction, including the glutamatergic larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ is a widely-used model glutamatergic synapse that is molecularly and developmentally similar to glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian CNS. <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJs in DLG mutants show a variety of changes, including disrupted organization of synaptic shaker potassium channels and fasciclin II, plus subtle alterations in larval synaptic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is clear from previous studies that DLG is not absolutely required for glutamate receptor expression and localization in the NMJ. In fact, DLG mutant larvae display larger excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, this phenotype depends specifically on presynaptic, but not postsynaptic loss of DLG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; presynaptic loss of DLG has subsequently been shown to increase synaptic vesicle diameter and quantal size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, based on measures of NMJ transmission, it is difficult to determine,, whether subtle changes in glutamate receptor cluster formation have occurred. Another complication is that DLG mutant larvae show dramatic underdevelopment of the subsynaptic reticulum (SSR), a dense infolding of postsynaptic membrane that appears during larval NMJ growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This loss of postsynaptic membrane in DLG mutant larvae makes it difficult to evaluate changes in postsynaptic transmembrane proteins, such as receptors.</p><p>Thus, there has so far been no answer to the question of whether DLG is involved in the formation of postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, the aforementioned phenotypic and technical obstructions can be completely avoided in two ways. First, we can examine glutamate receptors in DLG mutant embryos rather than larvae. In embryos, the SSR has not yet formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; therefore there are not yet any differences in postsynaptic membrane abundance between DLG mutant and control NMJs. Second, we can assay postsynaptic glutamate receptors directly, by immunohistochemistry and pressure ejection of glutamate onto voltage-clamped postsynaptic muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This circumvents any presynaptic alterations. Immunocytochemical techniques are particularly valuable, because antibodies that recognize different receptor subunits can show whether DLG differentially regulates subpopulations of receptors that differ in subunit composition. Mammalian studies have made it increasingly apparent that many aspects of receptor assembly and trafficking depend on the presence of specific subunits. Evidence for molecularly distinct subpopulations of glutamate receptors in <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJs has only recently been presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Differential regulation of these receptors has never before been demonstrated.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ contains five different ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits, each encoded by a different gene: GluRIIA, GluRIIB, GluRIIC (also referred to as 'GluRIII'), GluRIID, and GluRIIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. By sequence, fly NMJ subunits are most similar to mammalian kainate receptors. Mutations in GluRIIC, GluRIID, or GluRIIE are lethal, show loss of functional NMJ glutamate receptors, and eliminate immunoreactivity for other subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, GluRIIC, GluRIID, and GluRIIE are thought to be essential subunits contained by each glutamate receptor at the NMJ. In contrast, null mutations in either GluRIIA or GluRIIB individually are viable, but deletion of both GluRIIA and GluRIIB simultaneously is lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Evidence from ligand binding studies and partial crystal structures strongly suggests that ionotropic glutamate receptors are tetramers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, it is thought that <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ glutamate receptors are heterotetramers composed of one GluRIIC subunit, one GluRIID subunit, and one GluRIIE subunit, plus either one subunit of GluRIIA or one subunit of GluRIIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This model is consistent with immunocytochemical results: immunoreactivity for GluRIIA only partially overlaps that of GluRIIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], suggesting that at least some receptors contain either GluRIIA or GluRIIB, but not both. In other words, the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ contains two subclasses of ionotropic glutamate receptor: 1) GluRIIA-containing receptors and 2) GluRIIB-containing receptors.</p><p>Here, we use electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry to demonstrate selective loss of GluRIIB, but not GluRIIA, in DLG mutant <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos. This is the first demonstration that DLG regulates synaptic glutamate receptor abundance in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the first evidence that fly NMJ receptors can be differentially regulated, based on subunit composition. We also explored the mechanisms by which DLG itself is localized at the NMJ. Neither GluRIIA nor GluRIIB are localized unless a presynaptic neuron first contacts the postsynaptic cell. DLG is also not clustered in the absence of presynaptic innervation. This neuronal contact-dependent clustering of DLG does not depend on the clustering or expression of glutamate receptors, because DLG is clustered properly in the absence of all postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Our results are consistent with a model in which an unknown signal from the presynaptic neuron triggers parallel clustering of both DLG and glutamate receptors, after which DLG promotes the synaptic stability of receptors containing GluRIIB, but not GluRIIA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>DLG, GluRIIA, and GluRIIB are localized postsynaptically at the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ</title><p>As previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], DLG is abundantly expressed throughout the postsynaptic membrane surrounding presynaptic motor axon terminals (aka 'boutons') (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;B</xref>). DLG appears distributed throughout the postsynaptic membrane; there are no discernible DLG-positive domains smaller than the size of a bouton. In contrast, immunoreactivity for NMJ glutamate receptors has been shown to be restricted to specific postsynaptic domains directly opposite presynaptic active zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This restricted immunoreactivity is visible as distinct clusters within the bouton-wide area delimited by DLG staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;D</xref>). Thus, not all postsynaptic DLG appears associated with glutamate receptors. We cannot determine by light microscopy whether all glutamate receptors colocalize with DLG, although our staining is consistent with that conclusion.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>DLG, GluRIIA, and GluRIIB are localized postsynaptically at the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ </bold>A: Confocal projection of two boutons in a <italic>Drosophila </italic>third instar neuromuscular junction, visualized using the neuronal membrane marker anti-HRP (red) and anti-DLG antibodies (green).

To manipulate DLG levels, we used embryos homozygous for the mutation <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>X</italic>1&#x02013;2</sup>. In <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>X</italic>1&#x02013;2 </sup>mutants, the S97N isoform of DLG, which is predominantly expressed in neurons and muscle, is reduced to undetectable levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

In <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryonic NMJs, the cluster area is directly proportional to the number of functional postsynaptic receptors measured using patch-clamp electrophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. GluRIIA cluster area does not differ significantly between control and <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>X</italic>1&#x02013;2 </sup>mutants (control cluster area = 0.68 &#x000b1; 0.03 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, N = 103 clusters from 10 embryos; <italic>dlg </italic>= 0.75 &#x000b1; 0.03 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, N = 99 clusters from 16 embryos; P = 0.15).

However, the smallest clusters approach the resolution limit of light microscopy, where reductions in object size are no longer detectable. Thus, the reduction in small cluster size is probably underestimated, and the average decrease of GluRIIB in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants may be larger than is measurable by immunocytochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Postsynaptic glutamate receptor current properties change in DLG mutants</title><p>The immunocytochemistry in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> suggests that <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>X</italic>1&#x02013;2 </sup>mutants specifically lose receptors that contain GluRIIB, but do not lose receptors containing GluRIIA. GluRIIA null mutants are viable, but mEJP amplitudes are smaller, glutamate receptor channel open times are reduced, and receptors show decreased sensitivity to the GluR antagonist argiotoxin 636 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. GluRIIB null mutants are also viable, but show no significant change in receptor function, suggesting that either the GluRIIB subunit plays a lesser role in channel function, or that the majority of native receptors lack GluRIIB.</p><p>To confirm our immunocytochemical results, and explore the functional changes resulting from loss of GluRIIB-containing receptors, we used electrophysiology. First, we compared single glutamate receptor channel properties in control and <italic>dlg </italic>mutant embryonic muscle 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;B</xref>). Because <italic>Drosophila </italic>glutamate receptor conductance is relatively large and embryonic muscle input resistance is relatively high, single glutamate receptor channel currents are visible during the falling phase of some spontaneous synaptic events (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). DiAntonio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] showed that extrasynaptic larval muscle glutamate receptors in GluRIIB null mutants have slightly larger single channel currents (8.8 pA and 9.2 pA at -60 mV, for wild-type larvae and GluRIIB null mutants, respectively). We saw a similar, but larger increase in synaptic receptor single channel amplitudes in <italic>dlg </italic>mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; control = 9.3 &#x000b1; 0.7 pA at -60 mV, N = 17; <italic>dlg </italic>= 14.1 &#x000b1; 0.06 pA at -60 mV, N = 42; P &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Postsynaptic glutamate receptor current properties change in DLG mutants </bold>A: Single glutamate receptor channel current amplitudes from synaptic glutamate receptors are significantly larger in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants, compared to controls.

If <italic>dlg </italic>mutants selectively lose GluRIIB, but not GluRIIA, then there should correspondingly be no change in single glutamate receptor channel kinetics in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants. Consistent with this, we observed no change in average duration of single channel currents visible during the falling phase of spontaneous synaptic currents (control channel open time = 14.3 &#x000b1; 1.5 ms, N = 17; <italic>dlg </italic>mutant channel open time= 12.1 &#x000b1; 0.7 ms, N = 42; P = 0.13).</p><p>All evidence strongly suggests that there are two subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors at the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ: 1) receptors that are made up of the subunits GluRIIA+IIC+IID+IIE, and 2) receptors that consist of GluRIIB+IIC+IID+IIE. Our immunocytochemical results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) suggest that in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants, GluRIIB-containing receptors are selectively lost without any compensatory increase in GluRIIA-containing receptors. If this is true, the total number of glutamate receptors measurable electrophysiologically should decrease. To test this prediction, we measured the amplitude of glutamate-gated currents triggered by pressure ejection of 1 mM glutamate onto postsynaptic muscles. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;D</xref> shows that, glutamate-gated currents were significantly smaller in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants, compared to controls (control = 1842 &#x000b1; 255 pA at -60 mV, N = 10; <italic>dlg </italic>= 1044 &#x000b1; 173 pA at -60 mV, N = 10; P = 0.018). Dividing by the single channel current amplitudes allows us to calculate the number of individual receptors opened. Control currents represent the opening of approximately 198 (1842/9.3) receptors. Currents in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants represent the opening of approximately 74 (1044/14.1) receptors. Since pressure ejection of glutamate onto embryonic muscles activates extrasynaptic as well as synaptic receptors, this decrease in electrophysiologically detectable glutamate receptors also demonstrates that the loss of immunocytochemically visible receptors shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> is not due to dispersal of GluRIIB-containing receptors away from postsynaptic sites.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ glutamate receptors are specifically localized opposite active zones, and that GluRIIA-containing receptors and GluRIIB-containing receptors are segregated from each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In other words, it is thought that individual postsynaptic densities (PSDs) contain either GluRIIA or GluRIIB, but not both. If this is true, then loss of one receptor subtype should cause some active zones to be without apposing receptor fields, while other active zones have relatively normal receptor fields. Our electrophysiological results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;D</xref>) show that 63% (&#x000b1;12%) of all receptors are missing in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants. If GluRIIA and GluRIIB are segregated into different PSDs, and GluRIIB-containing receptors are selectively lost in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants, then 63% (&#x000b1;12%) of the individual synapses (active zone-PSD pairs) should be silent in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants. This should show up as a decrease in spontaneous excitatory synaptic current (sEJC) frequency, without a corresponding decrease in sEJC amplitude. sEJC frequency drops to 54% (&#x000b1;14%) of normal in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>; control = 9.3 &#x000b1; 1.6 Hz, N = 13; <italic>dlg </italic>= 5.0 &#x000b1; 1.0 pA, N = 13; P = 0.03). sEJC amplitude in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants, however, is not significantly different compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>; control = 79 &#x000b1; 7 pA, N = 13; <italic>dlg </italic>= 69 &#x000b1; 9 pA, N = 13; P = 0.41). These results are consistent with selective loss of GluRIIB-containing receptors in NMJs where individual postsynaptic densities are composed exclusively of receptors containing GluRIIA or GluRIIB.</p></sec><sec><title>DLG mutants have fewer postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters per presynaptic active zone</title><p>If postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters are composed of receptors containing either GluRIIA or GluRIIB, and GluRIIB-containing receptors are selectively lost in DLG mutants, then there should be fewer postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters per presynaptic active zone in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants. We tested this by triple staining the first instar NMJs with anti-HRP antibodies to visualize the presynaptic nerve, NC82, an antibody that marks presynaptic active zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and anti-GluRIID antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which label all postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. NC82 and GluRIID immunoreactivity appear as distinct puncta where motor neurons contact postsynaptic muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In control larvae, each NC82 punctum is associated with a GluRIID punctum. Not every GluR cluster is associated with NC82 or HRP immunoreactivity, however, consistent with the previously-described presence of extrasynaptic glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, the ratio of postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters to presynaptic active zones is greater than one (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Specifically, control larvae show an average glutamate receptor cluster to active zone ratio of 1.33. In dlg mutants, however, this ratio is reduced to approximately one-half normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>; control = 1.326 &#x000b1; 0.15 GluR clusters/active zone, N = 312 GluR clusters from 5 animals; <italic>dlg </italic>= 0.64 &#x000b1; 0.11 GluR clusters/active zone, N = 231 GluR clusters from 5 animals; P = 0.006). These results are consistent with a model in which: 1) GluRIIB-containing receptors are clustered independently of GluRIIA-containing receptors, 2) GluRIIB-containing receptor clusters are selectively lost in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants, and 3) selective loss of GluRIIB-containing receptors causes some presynaptic active zones to no longer be associated with postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>DLG mutants have fewer postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters per presynaptic active zone.

Similar results were obtained for GluRIIB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results support the conclusion that postsynaptic glutamate receptors (containing either GluRIIA or GluRIIB) are clustered and upregulated only after contact by the presynaptic neuron.

Note, however, that some extrasynaptic DLG remains.

Our results show that DLG is indeed required, but only for a subset of receptors, those that contain the subunit GluRIIB. The molecules required for similar assembly and/or stabilization of GluRIIA-containing receptors remain unidentified. The molecular mechanism by which DLG regulates GluRIIB stability remains unclear. There is currently no evidence for a direct interaction between DLG and any <italic>Drosophila </italic>glutamate receptor subunit. Genome-wide yeast two-hybrid assays failed to identify any interactions between DLG and any <italic>Drosophila </italic>glutamate receptor subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Similar results were obtained in two other independent and otherwise successful yeast two-hybrid screens: One, using the C-termini of GluRIIA, GluRIIB, and GluRIIC as baits failed to identify any interaction with DLG (S Sigrist, personal communication). Another screen independently used the SAP97-like N-terminus, the PDZ1-2 domains and the GUK domain of DLG as baits, but failed to identify any glutamate receptor subunits (U Thomas, personal communication).</p><p>Despite the fact that DLG clearly regulates the number of GluRIIB-containing receptors in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ, we do not believe that DLG specifies the location of GluRIIB-containing glutamate receptors. First, glutamate receptors are clearly not localized based on DLG alone, because DLG is present extrasynaptically in uninnervated muscle (cf. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and abundant throughout the postsynaptic membrane (c.f. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), but glutamate receptors are tightly localized to discrete puncta that are mostly (but not exclusively) found opposite presynaptic active zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, DLG is not sufficient for glutamate receptor clustering or stability. Second, as described above, there is no evidence for a direct interaction between DLG and glutamate receptors. Our data are most compatible with a model wherein DLG participates in the stability of receptors (possibly by regulating the assembly of a 'stability-promoting complex'), but does not 'scaffold' receptors. This conclusion derives from the observations that immunoreactive GluRIIB-containing receptor clusters are largely absent in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants, and glutamate-gated currents are smaller in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants. If receptors were dispersed, clusters would disappear but glutamate-gated currents should remain normal. However, some declustering of receptors was observed in <italic>dlg </italic>mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), and it is possible that unclustered receptors are endocytosed and/or rendered nonfunctional.</p><p>If DLG does not determine where receptors go, then something else must. We do not know the identity of this protein. We show that localization of postsynaptic DLG, like localization of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, depends on contact by the presynaptic neuron. We do not know the mechanism by which presynaptic contact triggers localization of either glutamate receptors or DLG. However, the identification of DLG as a target for this process should help identify the molecules involved in this critical initial trans-synaptic signal.</p><p>Our results are the first evidence that glutamate receptors in <italic>Drosophila </italic>can be differentially regulated based on subunit composition. Mammalian ionotropic glutamate receptors also undergo subunit-dependent assembly and trafficking, suggesting that receptor subunit-dependent interactions are a conserved method for 'tuning' postsynaptic properties. In the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ, the most critical role for DLG may therefore be as part of the machinery for regulating subunit composition. One possible mechanism for this process could be as follows. In the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ, active CamKII phosphorylates DLG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Constitutively active CamKII increases extrasynaptic DLG and phenocopies <italic>dlg </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results therefore predict that synaptic activity, via activation of CamKII, would decrease the number of GluRIIB-containing receptors and silence some synapses (active zone-PSD pairs). Sigrist et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] showed that NMJ activity leads to enhanced translation and insertion of GluRIIA-containing receptors (they did not assay GluRIIB). Thus, the overall result of increased NMJ activity is probably replacement of GluRIIB-containing receptors with GluRIIA-containing receptors &#x02013; a 'switch' in postsynaptic receptor subunit composition.</p><p>DiAntonio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] studied the effects of selectively expressing GluRIIA or GluRIIB transgenes in <italic>Df(2L)SP22 </italic>mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where endogenous GluRIIA and GluRIIB were eliminated. The most dramatic changes in receptor properties resulted from overexpression of GluRIIA in the absence of GluRIIB: mEJP amplitudes increased several-fold, receptor channel open times increased, and sensitivity to the antagonist argiotoxin decreased. Thus, their results show that switching from 'B-type' receptors (e.g. those containing GluRIIB) to 'A-type' receptors (e.g. those containing GluRIIA) at the NMJ leads to changes in postsynaptic properties. Overexpression of GluRIIA increases presynaptic growth in larval NMJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], suggesting that postsynaptic subunit switching might also play a role in presynaptic development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results demonstrate that mutation of DLG causes loss of glutamate receptors containing GluRIIB, but not GluRIIA. We also show that, like glutamate receptors, DLG localization requires contact between pre and postsynaptic cells. DLG localization does not depend on the presence of glutamate receptors, since DLG is localized normally in the complete absence of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Since glutamate receptor localization does not entirely depend on DLG, and DLG localization does not depend on glutamate receptors, we hypothesize that presynaptic nerve contact triggers localization of receptors and DLG in parallel, after which DLG promotes the stability of GluRIIB-containing receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Genetics</title><p>'Control' genotypes were either Oregon R (OR) or non-homozygous mutant siblings of the appropriate genotype.
