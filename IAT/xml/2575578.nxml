The endothelial-specific angiopoietin&#x02013;Tie ligand&#x02013;receptor system has recently emerged as a nonredundant regulator of endothelial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) are antagonistic ligands that bind to the extracellular domain of the Tie2 receptor, which is almost exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. Binding of Ang-1 to Tie2 promotes vessel integrity, inhibits vascular leakage and suppresses inflammatory gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Ang-2 is stored in Weibel&#x02013;Palade bodies and is rapidly secreted and induced upon stimulation, whereas Ang-1 is constitutively expressed by pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Binding of antagonistic Ang-2 completely disrupts protective Tie2 signaling in the majority of experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Ang-2 has also been identified as a Tie2 agonist, however, especially when administered in a supramaximal dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Several pilot studies suggest that measuring circulating Ang-1 and Ang-2 in critically ill patients might provide valuable information on vascular barrier properties. A marked imbalance of the angiopoietin&#x02013;Tie system in favor of Ang-2 was detected consistently in critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Elevated Ang-2 concentrations correlate with severity of illness as assessed by the injury severity score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the organ failure index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Circulating Ang-2 predicted outcome in two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Circulating Ang-2 and the respective Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio therefore constitute potential new biomarkers for endothelial activation in critical illness.</p><p>Preanalytic performance, detailed assay characteristics, and clinical applicability of Ang-1 and Ang-2 immunoassays have not been reported.

Inclusion criteria were age &#x02265;18 years, the need for extended daily dialysis (EDD), and the need for antibiotic treatment. The approach was chosen to study circadian variations of Ang-1 and Ang-2 in the ICU setting, to study interference with antibiotic treatment, and to study absorption/clearance via EDD in the same patient while avoiding interpatient variability.</p><p>Moxifloxacin (400 mg) and ertapenem (1 g) were infused intravenously during a period of 60 minutes.

Although biomarkers such C-reactive protein, IL-6, and procalcitonin have been linked to disease severity and outcome, specific biomarkers that indicate endothelial activation/integrity are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Assessment of circulating angiopoietins, especially Ang-2, has gained much attention since Ang-2 and the Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio presumably reflect the extent of endothelial activation in sepsis and related syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Only one assay system for human Ang-1 and for Ang-2 has so far been described in the literature. These sandwich ELISAs were invariably used for all of the above-mentioned pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Unfortunately, the preanalytic performances of these angiopoietin assays have not so far been reported. For this reason we have developed, characterized, and validated two new immunosandwich assays for the measurement of circulating human Ang-1 (IRMA/ILMA) and Ang-2 (ELISA). The decisive results are as follows.</p><p>First, both assay systems achieved good detection limits of 0.12 ng/ml (Ang-1) and 0.2 ng/ml (Ang-2), allowing for reliable analyte quantification over a wide concentration range.</p><p>The second decisive result is that both assays show adequate intra-assay and inter-assay imprecision across the range of values measured in apparently healthy individuals and in critically ill patients in the ICU. Imprecision of our Ang-1 IRMA was comparable with that of the only other ELISA system for the detection of Ang-1 (R&#x00026;D Systems). Of note, the intra-assay and inter-assay imprecision of our Ang-2 ELISA was even better (~4% versus ~9%) compared with the commercially available ELISA system for the detection of Ang-2.</p><p>Third, the assays are not appreciably influenced by unrelated biological substances, such as albumin or heparin, and show no cross-reactivity between Ang-1 and Ang-2.</p><p>Fourth, Ang-1 and Ang-2 are stable in serum at room temperature for at least 24 hours and are resistant to at least four freeze&#x02013;thaw cycles.</p><p>Importantly, another result is that the choice of anticoagulant matrix has a marked influence on Ang-1 measurement. Compared with the commercially available Ang-1 ELISA, therefore, our Ang-1 IRMA failed to detect Ang-1 in EDTA-treated or citrated plasma samples.</p><p>Finally, dilution studies proved excellent assay linearity as well as adequate parallelism between standard references and serially diluted serum sample curves for Ang-1 and for Ang-2 assays.</p><p>To our knowledge, confounding variables that might influence angiopoietin concentrations have not been evaluated previously. In our cohort of 30 apparently healthy individuals, Ang-1 and Ang-2 concentrations were not associated with age, with body mass index, or with renal function. Interestingly, Ang-1 concentrations were slightly higher in women. This gender difference did not persist, however, in critically ill patients.</p><p>In a clinical setting, angiopoietin concentrations correlated well with SOFA scores from 94 medical ICU patients (Ang-2 &#x0003e; Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio &#x0003e; Ang-1). This marked imbalance of the Ang/Tie machinery in favor of excessive Ang-2 underscores the concept of Ang-2 being the dynamic component. In contrast, decreased Ang-1 concentrations might reflect impaired maintenance signaling by pericytes. The present study is the first to report a (negative) correlation between severity of illness and Ang-1.</p><p>We have to mention that the present study aimed at preanalytic and clinical validation of two novel angiopoietin immunoassays. We did not focus on the diagnostic or prognostic value of circulating Ang-1 and Ang-2 in this cohort of critically ill patients. In an ongoing prospective trial we shall try to delineate the prognostic value of Ang-1 and Ang-2 in combination with established inflammatory markers.</p><p>Animal models of endotoxemia have shown that bacterial lipopolysaccharide triggers functional inhibition of the Ang-1/Tie-2 receptor pathway by reducing Ang-1 and Tie-2 expression and inducing Ang-2 concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrated that biologically active bacteria-derived cell wall components might occur after antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the present study, no antibiotic-mediated alterations in Ang-1 and Ang-2 serum concentrations were detectable.</p><p>EDD not only corrects acid&#x02013;base/electrolyte homeostasis and extracellular fluid volume, but has also been shown to exert various direct and indirect immunomodulatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Adsorption of cytokines to the synthetic high-flux dialyzer membrane has been recognized as a major mechanism of pyrogen removal in septic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Indeed, measurement of predialyzer and postdialyzer angiopoietin concentrations showed a decrease in Ang-1 (36.2%) and Ang-2 (23.1%) concentrations. A molecular weight &#x0003e;55 kDa makes angiopoietins unlikely participants for dialytic clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. EDD-associated angiopoietin removal therefore most probably occurs due to nonlinear adsorption to the dialyzer membrane. In spite of partial removal from the plasma, the Ang-1 and Ang-2 concentrations remained unchanged. We conclude that angiopoietin concentrations can be safely measured in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy.</p><p>Beside their deleterious effect in sepsis and related syndromes, elevated concentrations of circulating angiopoietins may be present in conditions of abnormal angiogenesis (for example, cardiovascular disease, neoplasia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In the present cohort, angiopoietin concentrations were not different in critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease or with malignant diseases compared with matched control individuals. A pre-existent Ang-1 or Ang-2 elevation, however, might be a confounder in patients with lower SOFA scores. Angiopoietin concentrations in the present study were comparable with those of previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ang-1 and Ang-2 might serve as a novel class of biomarkers in critically ill patients.
