Ku86 is constitutively transcribed at high levels and, although it plays a seminal role in DNA double-strand break repair, its expression is not induced by DNA damage. KARP-1, in contrast, is expressed constitutively only at low levels and its expression is induced by DNA damage in a p53-dependent fashion. The regulatory elements promoting KARP-1 gene expression and p53 responsiveness, however, were unknown. Here, we report that a strong DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) resides <bold>&#x0223c;</bold>25 kb upstream from the Ku86 promoter. This DHS is encompassed by a hypomethylated CpG island. Reporter assays demonstrated that this region corresponded to a promoter(s), which promoted transcription of peroxisomal <italic>trans</italic>-2-enoyl CoA reductase in the centromeric direction and KARP-1 in the telomeric direction. KARP-1 primer extension products were mapped to this CpG island in the correct transcriptional orientation confirming that KARP-1 transcription initiates from this site. Moreover, a p53 response element within the first intron of the KARP-1 transcriptional unit was identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation and antibodies specific to activated forms of p53. These data expand our understanding of this important DNA repair locus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Among the many forms of damage that can cause genomic instability, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) appear to be the most insidious (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c2">2</xref>). DSBs can occur spontaneously during DNA replication, are formed transiently during meiosis and lymphoid V(D)J recombination and can arise in patients exposed to chemo- or radiotherapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c1">1</xref>). Improper repair of DSBs results in gross chromosomal rearrangements involving translocations, inversions and fusions, which invariably lead to oncogenic transformation or cell death (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c3">3</xref>). Mammalian cells have evolved at least two independent pathways for repairing DSBs: homologous recombination and non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c4">4</xref>). Homologous recombination ensures relatively error-free repair by using an undamaged sister chromatid or homologous chromosome as a template. NHEJ, on the other hand, uses limited sequence homology to rejoin ends in a manner that is often error prone. In mammalian cells, NHEJ is the preferred mechanism of DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c4">4</xref>). The gene products involved in this pathway minimally include Ku70, Ku86, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>), XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Ku is a heterodimeric DNA end-binding complex composed of 70 and 86 kDa subunits (Ku70 and Ku86, respectively; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c6">6</xref>) that binds in a sequence non-specific fashion to virtually all double-stranded DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c8">8</xref>). The binding of Ku to broken DNA ends is required to prevent unnecessary DNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c9">9</xref>) and juxtapose the DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c12">12</xref>). One other unequivocal role for Ku is as a DNA-binding subunit of the DNA-PK complex (DNA-PK), a serine&#x02013;threonine protein kinase that is composed of the Ku heterodimer and DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c13">13</xref>). Extensive genetic and molecular studies have identified the DNA-PK complex as an integral component of mammalian DNA DSB repair and the fundamental mediator of NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c5">5</xref>). The binding of Ku to free DNA ends recruits and activates DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c15">15</xref>), DNA ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c17">17</xref>) and XRCC4, a DNA ligase IV accessory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c19">19</xref>), which are required for the rejoining of DNA DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c23">23</xref>).</p><p>Murine knockouts for each of the components of the DNA-PK complex have been generated. Mice deficient for Ku70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c25">25</xref>), Ku86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c27">27</xref>) or DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c31">31</xref>) are viable and exhibit the expected immune deficiencies and ionizing radiation (IR) hypersensitivity. In addition, inactivation of the Ku86 gene results in murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c26">26</xref>) cells with a severe growth retardation, premature senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c32">32</xref>), a marked increase in chromosomal aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c35">35</xref>) and elevated telomeric fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c38">38</xref>). Some of these phenotypes are also observed in human somatic cells lacking Ku86 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c39">39</xref>).</p><p>In primates in general, the situation is a bit more complex as the Ku86 locus is bifunctional and, through the use of an unidentified upstream promoter, encodes a Ku86 isoform, KARP-1 (Ku86 autoantigen related protein-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>). The KARP-1 message is &#x0223c;0.4 kb longer than Ku86 and the KARP-1 protein contains a 9 kDa N-terminal extension not found on Ku86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>). Overexpression of the KARP-1-specific domain conferred a dominant negative IR sensitive phenotype to human cells and a KARP-1 polyclonal antibody inhibited DNA-PK activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting a role for KARP-1 in the regulation of the DNA-PK complex and in human DNA DSB repair. Subsequently, it was shown that KARP-1 expression was strongly induced following DNA damage and that the up-regulation of KARP-1 mRNA and protein was dependent upon functional p53 and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, Ku86 is not induced by IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c43">43</xref>). Specifically, Ku86 appears to be a constitutively transcribed &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; gene, which is expressed from a TATA-less, CpG-rich promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c44">44</xref>). Primer extension analysis of the Ku86 gene coupled with standard promoter bashing experiments mapped the putative &#x0002b;1 transcription start site to a CpG-rich region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c44">44</xref>). In addition, a putative transcription start site for KARP-1 was identified in the nearby, flanking upstream sequences based upon 5&#x02032;-RACE reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>). We demonstrate here, however, that these cDNAs represented incomplete extension products. Instead, through the use of a thermostable reverse transcriptase at elevated temperatures, which resulted in the successful elimination of significant secondary structures, complete extension of the KARP-1 message was obtained resulting in the identification of &#x0223c;150 bp of additional cDNA sequence. Importantly, the 5&#x02032;-most terminal 17 nt of this additional sequence mapped to a second CpG-rich region that resided &#x0223c;25 kb upstream of the Ku86 promoter. This second CpG-rich region was hypomethylated, coincident with a strong, constitutive DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) and was ultimately shown to promote transcription for KARP-1 and the biochemically unrelated gene, TERP (<italic>trans</italic>-2-enoyl-co- enzymeA reductase, peroxisomal). Interestingly, this promoter configuration is similar to that observed for breast cancer allele-1 (BRCA-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c47">47</xref>), DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c48">48</xref>) and ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c50">50</xref>), all of which are divergently transcribed from bidirectional promoters, which also promote transcription of biologically unrelated genes. Lastly, we identified two consensus putative p53 responsive elements (REs) that potentially could have been responsible for inducing KARP-1 gene expression following DNA damage, and demonstrate, using chromatin immunoprecipitation and antibodies specific for activated forms of p53, that one of these REs is biologically responsive whereas the other is not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>The human corectal carcinoma HCT116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c52">52</xref>) and HCT116&#x0002b;Chr3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c53">53</xref>) cell lines were generously provided to us by Drs Bert Vogelstein and Kyungjae Myung, respectively.

Briefly, 1.5&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> trypsinized cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 r.p.m. (Beckman Allegra 6R) for 10 min. The cells were washed twice by resuspension in 25 mM Mg&#x0002f;Ca-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and centrifugation at 1500 r.p.m. for 10 min. The cells were then resuspended in freshly made 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.4, 3&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.3&#x00025; NP-40 and transferred to a dounce homogenizer. Following incubation on ice for 10 min and removal of an aliquot to quantitate cellular breakage, cells were dounced by approximately six hard strokes and checked by visual observation under a microscope. Following quantitative breakage, nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 900 r.p.m. for 7 min. Nuclei were washed twice in 25 ml of resuspension buffer (RSB) (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH&#x000a0;7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) followed by centrifugation at 900 r.p.m. for 7 min. Nuclei were then resuspended in 1 ml of RSB and a 25 &#x000b5;l aliquot was diluted into 475 &#x000b5;l of 1&#x00025; SDS for an OD<sub>260</sub> measurement. The nuclear stock was diluted with RSB until the OD<sub>260</sub> of a 1:20 dilution equaled 0.5. A &#x02018;quenched&#x02019;, i.e. control, nuclei sample was removed and added directly to cell lysis solution (CLS) (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The purified, diluted nuclei were divided into untreated and treated aliquots and warmed to 37&#x000b0;C. For the untreated aliquot, an &#x02018;endogenous&#x02019; DNase I activity sample was collected at 5 min and added to CLS. For the treated aliquot, RQDNase I (&#x0223c;1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;5 &#x000b5;l; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was added to a final concentration of 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml of nuclei. Aliquots of the treated nuclei were removed at 30 s, 2&#x000a0;min and 5 min and added to CLS and mixed well. Genomic DNA was isolated from each sample as described in the DNA Isolation Kit protocol (Gentra Systems; scaled up based on cell number) and then resuspended in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0 at 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g&#x0002f;&#x000b5;l. Genomic DNA was then analyzed by Southern blotting to detect DHSs at particular loci.</p></sec><sec><title>Southern blots</title><p>All blots were performed with 10 &#x000b5;g of genomic DNA&#x0002f;lane in agarose gels (0.6&#x02013;2.0&#x00025; agarose) following treatment with the appropriate restriction enzyme(s) as shown in each figure legend. Double digestions were performed simultaneously. Ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels were photographed and subjected to capillary transfer to nitrocellulose membranes by deaminating with 0.25 N HCl for 20 min, followed by two 20 min treatments with 1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH and two 20 min treatments with 1.0 M Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 1.5 M NaCl. Capillary transfer was carried out in 20&#x000d7; SSC (3.0 M NaCl, 0.3 M Na citrate) overnight. DNA was UV crosslinked to the nitrocellulose with a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and washed with 5&#x000d7;&#x000a0;SSC for 5 min at room temperature before pre-hybridization. Hybridizations were performed according to the PerfectHyb Plus protocol (Sigma, St Louis, MO) with a 5 min prehybridization at 64&#x000b0;C with sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by the addition of <sup>32</sup>P-radiolabeled probe prepared via the random hexamer Klenow synthesis Prime-It II protocol (Stratagene) and subsequently purified over a G-50 Sephadex column. Following overnight hybridizations, the blots were washed twice at room temperature with 2&#x000d7; SSC for 5 min, twice (once at room temperature, once at 64&#x000b0;C) with 1&#x000d7; SSC for 10&#x02013;20 min and two to four times at 64&#x000b0;C with 0.1&#x000d7; SSC. The exposure of the blots to Kodak autoradiographic film at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C in the presence of an intensifying screen varied from 1 h to 3 days.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation</title><p>Messenger RNA isolation from tissue culture cells was performed with Invitrogen&#x02019;s FastTrack mRNA isolation kit utilizing poly(A) binding resin as described by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcriptase&#x02013;PCR (RT&#x02013;PCR) and 5&#x02032;-RACE</title><p>RT&#x02013;PCR was performed essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c56">56</xref>). 5&#x02032;-RACE reactions utilized an mRNA template for a single round of hybridization and reverse transcription with a message-specific primer using Gibco&#x0002f;BRL&#x02019;s Thermoscript&#x02122; reverse transcriptase at 55&#x000b0;C to remove secondary structures. The resulting single-stranded cDNA was then extended with terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase and dATP to create a poly(A) tail. Reiterative PCR cycles were subsequently performed using nested message-specific primers and a poly(T) &#x0002b; adaptor primer (5&#x02032;-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT). Secondary PCR was performed, as needed, with an additional message-specific primer and an adaptor-specific primer (5&#x02032;-GACTCGAGTCGACATCG). PCR products were gel purified using Qiagen gel elution columns and were subcloned into pCR2.1, a TA-overhang PCR cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Ampicillin-resistant bacterial colonies were expanded in liquid culture and plasmid DNAs were isolated using miniprep columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the DNAs were subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion to assay for presence of adaptor-specific and message-specific restriction enzyme sites. Appropriate DNAs were subjected to automated DNA sequencing (Davis- Sequencing, Davis, CA) with the vector-specific primers, Rev and T3 (Operon, Alameda, CA).</p><p>Additional confirmatory 5&#x02032;-RACE was performed with the FirstChoice&#x02122; RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as recommended by the supplier with the exception that Thermoscript&#x02122; reverse transcriptase was utilized. Briefly, preparations of mRNA were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove 5&#x02032;-terminal phosphates from degraded mRNA, rRNA, tRNA and DNA. Subsequent tobacco alkaline phosphatase treatment removed the guanine caps from full-length mRNA and adapters were ligated onto the decapped mRNA. Reverse transcription reactions were then performed with a message-specific primer and reiterative PCR was performed with nested message-specific primers and an adaptor-specific primer. PCR products were subcloned and characterized as described above.</p><p>For the DNA damage inducibility studies, cDNA was made from mRNA harvested 2 h post mock or IR (10 Gy) treatment of HCT116 cells. The cDNA was used as template in RT&#x02013;PCR reactions with primers specific to different exons within actin (to control for quantification of cDNA pools), TERP or KARP-1 messages. Serial 3-fold dilutions were prepared to allow visual quantitation of message level differences. Twenty-four PCR cycles were utilized for the actin control, 26 for TERP and 33 for KARP-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitations</title><p>Modifications of this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c57">57</xref>) included harvesting in PBS solution pH 7.6 and crosslinking with 2&#x00025; formaldehyde. Crosslinking was quenched by the addition of 125 mM glycine for 5 min followed by two ice-cold washes with PBS. Cells were then permeablized in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES&#x02013;KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 0.1&#x00025; Na-deoxycholate&#x0002f;protease inhibitors) and kept on ice. Chromatin was sheared by sonication until the DNA was an average length of 600&#x02013;1000 bp as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 5&#x000a0;min at 13 000 r.p.m. (Beckman centrifuge Model 5415C) and then the supernatant was centrifuged again for 15 min. A one-twentieth aliquot of the cleared extract was reserved as an input control for PCR and the remaining extract was incubated overnight with antibodies at 4&#x000b0;C on a rotator. A protein A sepharose slurry (50 &#x000b5;l) was added, incubated for 1.5 h at 4&#x000b0;C while rotating and then the sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation. The beads were washed twice at room temperature with lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, once with 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5&#x00025; NP-40, 0.5&#x00025; Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and once with 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. The beads were then resuspended in 200 &#x000b5;l of 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA and the precipitated protein:DNA complexes were eluted from the antibodies:beads by incubation at 65&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. The resulting supernatants, along with input aliquots, were subjected to crosslink reversal by heating to 65&#x000b0;C overnight followed by treatment with 100 &#x000b5;g of proteinase K for 2&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000b0;C. DNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction followed by EtOH precipitation after the addition of 2 &#x000b5;g of glycogen carrier and a one-tenth volume of 3 M NaOAc. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;l of water and one-fiftieth of the immunoprecipitates or 1&#x0002f;10 000 of the input were used as templates in PCR. For the KARP-1 10(1)10 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)&#x02013;PCR, which generated a 278 bp product, annealing was carried out at 53&#x000b0;C. PCR was performed for 35 cycles for Ab421 and the phospho-specific mAb and for 30 cycles for the polyclonal Ab and the acetyl-specific mAb.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies, primer sequences and Southern blot probes</title><p>Antibodies used in the chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis included a p53 polyclonal (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody, anti-acetyllysine373-p53 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-phosphoserine15-p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and epitope-specific p53 (Ab421, CalBioChem, Palo Alto, CA) antibodies and a p21&#x0002f;WAF1 (CalBioChem) antibody.

The primer pairs utilized for the DNA damage inducibility studies were for actin, ACTIN5&#x02032; (5&#x02032;-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3&#x02032;) and ACTIN3&#x02032; (5&#x02032;-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3&#x02032;); for TERP, TERP-2 (5&#x02032;-CGGAAAAGCCATCGTGAAG-3&#x02032;) and TERP-3 (5&#x02032;-CGGATGTTGCATTGTATGGG-3&#x02032;); for KARP-1, ASPEK12 (5&#x02032;-CGTACAAGAAGGGAGACAAGGACCACTGAC-3&#x02032;) and PHYGW01 (5&#x02032;-CTTATTCCCCGACCGCACCATGTTGCCGGT-3&#x02032;).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Characterization of the Ku86 upstream region as the potential start of KARP-1 transcription</title><p>Extensive 5&#x02032;-RACE analyses were used to map the 5&#x02032;-end of KARP-1 transcription to a region &#x0223c;3 kb upstream from the start of Ku86 transcription (exon 2, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>). Since no longer 5&#x02032;-RACE products could be obtained initially, we investigated whether this area corresponded to the start of KARP-1 transcription even though there were no obvious signature promoter motifs. To test this hypothesis, a variety of upstream sequences were subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector. These vectors were then transfected into human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c52">52</xref>) and assayed for promoter activity with and without prior X-irradiation. None of the constructs showed detectable promoter activity (data not shown). To confirm this negative data we carried out DNase I hypersensitivity assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c58">58</xref>). These assays, which measure chromatin accessibility, have the ability to scan for changes in chromatin structure between normal and induced states and have been extensively utilized to identify promoter regions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c59">59</xref>). In particular, RNA polymerase II is an extraordinarily large complex that must be able to interact physically with sequences directly upstream of transcriptional start sites. Access of such a large complex to chromatin usually requires the complete disruption or shifting of nucleosomes in the immediate vicinity, generating a region that invariably becomes accessible to DNA cleaving enzymes, such as DNase I. Active transcriptional initiation regions therefore are associated with hyperaccessibility of DNase I to the chromatin in that immediate area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c59">59</xref>). Thus, nuclei from unirradiated and X-irradiated HCT116 cells were treated with DNase I at various times post-irradiation. Genomic DNA was isolated from these cells, treated with an appropriate restriction enzyme and analyzed by Southern blotting with a probe from the Ku86 upstream region to reveal preferred sites of DNase I cutting. The region analyzed, which encompassed the Ku86 promoter and two additional upstream non-coding exons (exons 2 and 3, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref>A and B) of KARP-1 revealed that the Ku86 promoter was hypersensitive to DNase I in an X-irradiation independent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref>C). Comparison of molecular sizes of hybridizing bands within genomic DNA digested with multiple restriction enzymes permitted the accurate placement of two closely spaced, constitutive DHSs to just upstream of the Ku86 transcriptional start site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref>C). The location of the DHSs was virtually coincident with the &#x0002b;1 of Ku86 transcription determined by primer extension studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c44">44</xref>, C. D. Braastad, unpublished data). Similarly, the constitutive presence of the DHSs was consistent with the constitutive, high level, non-inducible nature of Ku86 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c43">43</xref>). Importantly, however, no DHSs were detected in the vicinity of exon 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref>C and data not shown). The lack of a detectable open chromatin structure, especially following X-irradiation, coupled with the negative data from the reporter constructs strongly indicated that the region directly upstream of exon 2 was not likely to be the KARP-1 promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a DHS upstream of the Ku86 promoter by DNase I hypersensitivity walking</title><p>The experiments described above suggested that the authentic KARP-1 promoter must lie further upstream of exon 2. To identify the promoter, a series of DHS assays were carried out over the upstream 50 kb in overlapping steps of 6&#x02013;10 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f2">2</xref>A and B and data not shown). A single, strong DHS was identified &#x0223c;25 kb upstream of exon 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f2">2</xref>B and C). This DHS, like those observed at the Ku86 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref>), was also constitutive and not X-irradiation inducible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f2">2</xref>C). To confirm this result, nuclei isolated at various intervals following X-irradiation up to 1.5 h post-irradiation were also analyzed. Although KARP-1 transcription is known to be greatly induced during this time interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>), no salient differences were detected in the DHS profile nor were any novel DHS sites identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f2">2</xref>D). Thus, a constitutive, non-DNA damage inducible DHS site exists &#x0223c;25 kb upstream of the last known KARP-1 exon.</p></sec><sec><title>The upstream DHS corresponds to a hypomethylated CpG island</title><p>Sequence analysis of the region encompassing the upstream DHS revealed that it was coincident with a potential strong CpG island (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f3">3</xref>B). The CpG dinucleotide is under-represented in the human genome and it has a tendency to cluster in regions known as &#x02018;CpG islands&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c61">61</xref>). These islands often correspond to the promoters of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c61">61</xref>) and indeed the only other CpG island within 100 kb is the one associated with the Ku86 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f3">3</xref>A and data not shown). Importantly, however, in order for a CpG island to actively promote transcription, the cytosine residues need to be hypomethylated, since random CpG dinucleotides and inactive promoters are often hypermethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c63">63</xref>). Thus, a series of Southern blot analyses were performed using a variety of methyl-sensitive and methyl-insensitive restriction enzyme pairs (<italic>Ava</italic>I and <italic>Bso</italic>BI, <italic>Hpa</italic>II and <italic>Msp</italic>I, <italic>Kas</italic>I and <italic>Sfo</italic>I, <italic>Sma</italic>I and <italic>Xma</italic>I; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f3">3</xref>D&#x02013;F, lanes 3 and 4, 7 and 8, 9 and 10, 13 and 14, respectively) as well as restriction enzymes whose recognition sequences were enriched in the CpG dinucleotide (e.g. <italic>Eag</italic>I and <italic>Sac</italic>II; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f3">3</xref>D&#x02013;F, lanes 5 and 12, respectively). These experiments showed that an &#x0223c;1 kb region (corresponding precisely to the middle of the CpG island and the location of the DHS; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f3">3</xref>C) was completely hypomethylated, whereas upstream and downstream CpGs were semi or fully methylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f3">3</xref>E and data not shown). To control for the efficiency of cutting and to ascertain if all of the restriction enzymes were functioning as expected, genomic DNA, which had been treated with the <italic>Sss</italic>I CpG-specific cytosine methylase, was also digested. This DNA was refractory to cleavage by methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes and cleaved to completion by restriction enzymes that were methyl-insensitive with the exception of <italic>Sfo</italic>I, which only partially cleaved the DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f3">3</xref>F). From these experiments we concluded that this CpG island was extensively hypomethylated and that this was consistent with it being a putative promoter region.</p></sec><sec><title>The CpG island promotes divergent transcription of TERP and KARP-1</title><p>When the 1.7 kb putative promoter region was subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector it exhibited low, albeit reproducible, promoter activity, although, confusingly, it appeared to be active in either orientation (data not shown). The explanation for this became clear with the publication of the sequence of the human genome which showed that this CpG island corresponded to a promoter(s) which directs transcription in the centromeric direction of TERP &#x0005b;an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis that is expressed primarily in the kidney and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c64">64</xref>)&#x0005d; and transcription in the telomeric direction of an unknown gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f4">4</xref>A). To confirm that this unknown gene corresponded to KARP-1, additional 5&#x02032;-RACE experiments using primers to KARP-1 exons 2, 3 and 4 were performed. Importantly, unlike our earlier 5&#x02032;-RACE attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>), these experiments utilized a thermostable reverse transcriptase at high temperature in order to penetrate the now known CpG-rich region (see Materials and Methods). Four of the resulting cDNAs contained &#x0223c;150 nt of additional novel sequence that extended exon 2 in the 5&#x02032; direction &#x0223c;130 nt. More importantly, these cDNAs contained at their 5&#x02032;-ends a 14&#x02013;17 nt sequence identical to a sequence within the CpG island (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f4">4</xref>B and C). Thus, this &#x0223c;17 bp sequence defines exon 1 for KARP-1 and it is contained within, though in the opposite transcriptional orientation of, the first exon of TERP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f4">4</xref>A and B). There are no obvious TATA- or CCAAT-like sequences in the region immediately upstream of KARP-1 exon 1. There is, however a five out of seven match and a six out of seven match for a consensus initiator (Inr) sequence &#x0005b;5&#x02032;-YYAN(T&#x0002f;A)YY-3&#x02032;; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c65">65</xref>)&#x0005d; from &#x02013;57 to &#x02013;51, TCACGAT and &#x02013;13 to &#x02013;7, CCACTTG, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f4">4</xref>C). These sequences contain the C at &#x0002b;2 (counting the 5&#x02032; position of the consensus sequence as &#x0002b;1) and the invariant A residue at &#x0002b;3 that most functional Inr elements possess, whereas only the latter element contains the T at &#x0002b;5 that the most active Inr elements contain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c66">66</xref>). A similar Inr sequence exists at &#x02013;54 to &#x02013;48 in the DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c48">48</xref>). All of the KARP-1 exon&#x0002f;intron boundaries are flanked by canonical splice donor and acceptor sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f4">4</xref>C). From these experiments we concluded that the KARP-1 gene is transcribed from a CpG-rich promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the p53 response element needed for p53-dependent KARP-1 expression</title><p>KARP-1 is induced by DNA damage in a completely p53-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>). Wild-type p53 binds, albeit with varying affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c67">67</xref>), to consensus response elements (p53 REs) within genetic regulatory loci. p53 REs consist of tandem palindromic decamers of 5&#x02032;-PuPuPuC(A&#x0002f;T)(A&#x0002f;T)GPyPyPy-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c69">69</xref>), which <italic>in vivo</italic> are invariably separated from each other by no more than a single nucleotide. We had previously identified a putative p53 binding site within intron 3 of the KARP-1 transcriptional locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>A). Although p53 bound well to this site <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>), the fact that the decamers are separated from each other by 9 nt made it unlikely that this site corresponded to an <italic>in vivo</italic> p53 RE. DNA sequence analysis of the genomic DNA flanking the CpG island for 25 kb in either direction identified only two additional potential p53 REs, both of which lay within the KARP-1 first intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>A and B). These REs consisted of a site in which the two decamers were immediately adjacent to one another and contained 9 out of 10 nt that matched the consensus sequence &#x0005b;9(0)9&#x0005d; and a site in which the decamers were separated by a single nucleotide and each decamer was a perfect match with the consensus &#x0005b;10(1)10&#x0005d; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>B). ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c70">70</xref>) was then used to analyze the <italic>in vivo</italic> occupancy of these putative p53 REs in HCT116&#x0002b;Chr3 cells exposed to IR. HCT116&#x0002b;Chr3 cells are a daughter cell line of &#x02018;wild-type&#x02019; HCT116 cells that have been complemented for the parental MLH1 mismatch repair deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c72">72</xref>) by the stable inclusion of a wild-type copy of human chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c53">53</xref>). A polyclonal p53 antibody was able to co-immunoprecipitate the 10(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c1">1</xref>)10 p53 RE from HCT116&#x0002b;Chr3 cells that had been X-irradiated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>C). In addition, antibodies specific to DNA-damage inducible forms of p53, including phosphoserine15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c74">74</xref>), acetyllysine373 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c77">77</xref>) and mAb421 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c78">78</xref>), which recognizes an epitope specific to the active binding form of p53, were also able to immunoprecipitate the putative 10(1)10 p53 RE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>C). The 10(1)10 element was not immunoprecipitated from non-damaged cells, when an irrelevant antibody (to p21) was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>C) or when the same experiment was carried out in p53-null cells (data not shown). Lastly, the ChIP pattern for the putative 10(1)10 p53 RE at the KARP-1 locus was identical to the ChIP patterns for other well-characterized p53 REs located in the promoter regions of the p53 target genes, p21 and 14-3-3&#x003c3; (C. D. Braastad, Z. Han and E. A. Hendrickson, manuscript submitted). In contrast, the distal 9(0)9 element could not be immunoprecipitated under any condition nor in any cell line (data not shown; &#x02018;non-responsive&#x02019;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>B).

To experimentally address this issue, HCT116 cells, which are wild-type for p53 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c52">52</xref>) were either mock irradiated or exposed to 10 Gy of IR. Two hours later, the cells were harvested, RNA was prepared and first-strand cDNA synthesized. The mRNA levels of TERP, KARP-1 or &#x003b2;-actin, the latter of which was utilized as a negative control, were then determined by RT&#x02013;PCR reactions using serial 3-fold dilutions of the cDNA preparation to ensure that the PCR responses were within the linear range. As we have described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>), IR exposure resulted in a &#x0223c;4-fold elevation of KARP-1 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f6">6</xref>). In contrast, no increase in TERP or &#x003b2;-actin expression was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f6">6</xref>). From this experiment, we concluded that KARP-1 gene expression is preferentially induced by IR, whereas TERP expression is not.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified a CpG island that directs the transcription, in opposite orientations, of two independent messenger RNAs, TERP and KARP-1. This CpG island was originally identified based upon its hypersensitivity to DNase I and was consistent with an open chromatin region that normally surrounds promoter elements. The subsequent demonstration that virtually all of the CpG dinucleotides in a &#x0223c;1 kb stretch internal to the CpG island were hypomethylated was again consistent with this region acting as a promoter. RT&#x02013;PCR was then utilized to demonstrate that the first &#x0223c;17 nt of the KARP-1 mRNA transcript originated from this CpG island, proving that KARP-1 transcription is initiated from this site. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments identified a p53 RE within the first intron of the KARP-1 locus which was bound by p53 in a completely DNA damage-inducible fashion. These experiments expand our knowledge about how the human Ku86&#x0002f;KARP-1 locus is regulated.</p><p>The Ku86 promoter region is constitutively DNase I hypersensitive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref>). This is consistent with the known constitutive, non-DNA damage-inducible, high level of expression of Ku86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c43">43</xref>). The transcriptional machinery that actively utilizes this site for Ku86 gene expression is almost certainly responsible for maintaining it in an open chromatin conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c59">59</xref>). In the upstream 50 kb only a single other DHS was identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f2">2</xref>). This site corresponded to the TERP&#x0002f;KARP-1 promoter(s). Again, this DHS was constitutive and not DNA damage inducible, which is consistent with the constitutive, albeit very low, levels of KARP-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>) and with the presumptive constitutive levels of expression of the metabolic housekeeping gene TERP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c64">64</xref>). The only reproducible alteration observed following X-irradiation was an increased resistance to DNase I immediately after irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f2">2</xref>D, compare lane 0&#x02032; with 15&#x02032;). The mechanistic basis for this increased resistance is unknown. One possibility is that the exposure of cells to IR and general radioresistance has been correlated with the phosphorylation of the histones H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c79">79</xref>) and H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c80">80</xref>), respectively. Histone phosphorylation, in turn, has long been associated with chromatin condensation, which would be consistent with the observed reduction in nuclease accessibility. Importantly, however, no other significant alterations in the DHS profile at the promoter were observed following X-irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f2">2</xref>) even over a time interval when KARP-1 transcription is known to be induced at least 5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c40">40</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f6">6</xref>). Presumably the pre-existing transcriptional machinery was activated without a concomitant alteration of the surrounding chromatin. While it could be argued that the constitutive nature of the DHS at the KARP-1 promoter might be due solely to the expression of the TERP gene, it should be noted that an identical profile of hypersensitivity was recently observed for the IR-inducible genes p21 and 14-3-3&#x003c3; (C. D. Braastad, Z. Han and E. A. Hendrickson, manuscript submitted), both of which have canonical, unidirectional promoters. Thus, the DHS patterns at these loci imply that p53- and IR-inducible promoters are generally occupied by an engaged transcriptional apparatus even in the absence of DNA damage. The mechanism by which this occurs is not known, but it is intriguingly similar to the &#x02018;stalled&#x02019; or &#x02018;paused&#x02019; RNA polymerase II complexes that are observed at the promoters of heat shock responsive genes in the absence of heat shock (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c81">81</xref>). Importantly, no DHS was observed at the KARP-1 p53 RE either before or after X-irradiation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f2">2</xref> and data not shown). Since we subsequently demonstrated that p53 is indeed binding to this site following DNA damage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>C) these data together imply that p53 binding does not cause a detectable alteration of the chromatin structure at its cognate RE. This conclusion is consistent with the very recent demonstration that p53, in distinct contrast to most transcription factors, actually prefers to bind to nucleosomal DNA rather than naked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c82">82</xref>).</p><p>KARP-1 is transcribed from a CpG island (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>A). There is ample precedence for CpG islands serving as the <italic>cis</italic>-acting initiation core for bidirectional or divergent transcription. Indeed, some of the earliest observations linking CpG islands to promoters noted that these sites often induced the expression of divergent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c83">83</xref>). Like bacterial operons, the genes involved occasionally may share a common biological function such as the histone H2A and H2B genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c84">84</xref>) or the avian GPAT and AIRC genes, which are both involved in purine nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c86">86</xref>). Much more frequently, however, the genes share no obvious biological function and the transcripts may or may not be coordinately controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c88">88</xref>). Within the family of DNA DSB repair proteins, this regulatory strategy&#x0002f;genomic configuration seems to have been utilized extensively. Thus, the DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> and MCM4 genes are separated by 700 bp within a TATA-less CpG island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c48">48</xref>). Likewise, the ATM and E14(NPAT) genes are separated by only 513 bp and orientated oppositely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c50">50</xref>). A mere 218 bp separates the BRCA1 and NBR2 genes and they too are orientated in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c46">46</xref>). To this list, we can now add the KARP-1 and TERP genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>A).</p><p>The evolutionary forces that have led to this common genomic configuration are unclear. One possibility is that these important DNA repair genes (DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, ATM, BRCA-1 and KARP-1), which, when mutated, can often lead to cancer predisposition syndromes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c1">1</xref>) have evolved to be physically connected to essential metabolic genes to limit mutational processes. Thus, while still vulnerable to small genetic alterations, any large chromosomal alteration would likely be selected against by the concomitant loss of the linked essential gene. However, it should be pointed out that BRCA-1 is by itself an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c89">89</xref>) as are the human KARP-1&#x0002f;Ku86 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c39">39</xref>). Correspondingly, it is more likely that these genomic configurations evolved as the result of molecular scavenging of the promoters. Alternative usage of a promoter resulting in transcription in the opposite direction might have occasionally resulted in the production of a functional message that was subsequently selected for during evolution. This hypothesis makes the prediction that the non-DNA repair half of a transcriptional pair will be evolutionarily older than its divergently transcribed DNA repair partner. This is consistent with the fact that genes like MCM4, NPAT, NBR2 and TERP are found in almost all eukaryotes whereas homologs of DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, BRCA-1 and KARP-1 are recently evolved genes that appear to exist only in higher eukaryotes.</p><p>KARP-1 transcription is induced by DNA damage and is dependent upon functional p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>). We had previously identified a putative p53 RE in the third intron of the KARP-1 transcriptional locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f1">1</xref>) based largely upon its proximity to the putative assignment of the KARP-1 promoter (here shown to be incorrect) and its ability to bind p53 protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Given that the two decamers that constitute the RE were, however, separated by 9 nt&#x02014;a configuration not found at any other authentic p53 RE&#x02014;it seemed unlikely that this site would be used <italic>in vivo</italic>. Once the authentic KARP-1 promoter was identified, a sequence analysis revealed two additional putative p53 REs which resided within the first intron of the KARP-1 transcriptional unit and which conformed more closely to an <italic>in vivo</italic> consensus site, with the decamers being separated by 0 and 1 nt, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>B). Subsequent ChIP analysis demonstrated that the 10(1)10 site was biologically responsive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f5">5</xref>C). This conclusion was confirmed by the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against p53 epitopes (mAB421, phosphoserine-15, acetyllysine-373) that were specific for the activated form of p53. The existence of this p53 RE is consistent with and explains the previously demonstrated dependence on ATM and p53 for KARP-1 induction following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf281c41">41</xref>). There was no a priori reason to suspect that TERP expression would be DNA damage inducible and a lack of induction was indeed observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf281f6">6</xref>). Thus, while these two transcriptional units physically overlap, at least a portion of their regulation does not. This latter observation implies, although certainly does not prove, that KARP-1 and TERP gene expression may be regulated from separate, closely spaced promoters, rather than regulated through a common, bidirectional promoter. Ultimately, it will be important to identify the upstream regulatory sequences in the KARP-1 promoter and determine how the transcription factors that bind to these sites interact with p53 and the RNA polymerase II machinery as well as how they establish a constitutively open chromatin structure around the promoter.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf281f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> A DHS(s) resides at the Ku86 promoter.
