Moreover, DNA replication occurs in a complex environment. The template is an inherently unstable polymer subject to a constant barrage of chemical insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c1">1</xref>), whilst conflicts between replication and other essential processes such as transcription are unavoidable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c4">4</xref>). As a result, replication forks may stall frequently and require some form of repair to allow completion of chromosomal duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c6">6</xref>). Failure to solve these replicative problems comes at a high price, with the consequences being genome instability, cell death and, in higher organisms, cancer.</p><p>Prokaryotic studies have highlighted the central role played by recombination enzymes in fork repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c7">7</xref>). Damaged replication forks appear to have two fates in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. First, they may be processed so that the original blocking lesion is removed or bypassed, and replication resumed once the replicative machinery has been reloaded back onto the DNA fork structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c9">9</xref>). Second, stalled replication forks may break to leave one intact duplex and a free duplex DNA end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c11">11</xref>). Recombination of the free duplex end with the intact sister duplex creates a D-loop onto which the replication machinery can be reloaded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c12">12</xref>).</p><p>In both proposed replication repair pathways, the final stage of repair requires the restart of DNA replication. The key to initiation of DNA replication is loading of the replicative helicase DnaB onto ssDNA. DnaB catalyses unwinding of the parental DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c13">13</xref>) and facilitates assembly of the remaining components of the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c14">14</xref>). Loading of DnaB during initiation of chromosomal duplication in <italic>E.coli</italic> is catalysed by DnaA in a tightly regulated manner at the start of the cell cycle and at a specific locus within the chromosome, <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c15">15</xref>). In contrast, replication fork repair and hence reloading of DnaB may be needed away from <italic>oriC</italic> at any point within the chromosome and at any stage during chromosomal duplication. The potentially catastrophic effects of uncontrolled initiation of chromosomal duplication on genome stability suggests that replication restart must be regulated as tightly as DnaA-directed replication initiation at <italic>oriC</italic>. This implies reloading of DnaB must occur only on ssDNA at repaired forks or D-loops rather than onto other regions of ssDNA, such as those created by blocks to lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c17">17</xref>). Thus an alternative replication initiator protein, PriA helicase, is utilized during replication restart to reload DnaB back onto the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c18">18</xref>).</p><p>The requirement to reload DnaB only onto repaired forks and D-loops is thought to be reflected in the preferential binding of PriA to branched DNA structures <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c20">20</xref>). At such structures, PriA displays two activities. PriA facilitates loading of DnaB onto the lagging strand template via a complex series of protein&#x02013;protein interactions involving PriB, PriC and DnaT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c24">24</xref>). However, DnaB can bind only to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c13">13</xref>). Thus the second enzymatic function of PriA, a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c25">25</xref>), acts to unwind any lagging strand DNA present at the fork to generate a ssDNA binding site for DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c26">26</xref>). The importance of PriA-directed replication restart is underlined by the decrease in viability, defective homologous recombination and extreme sensitivity to exposure to DNA damaging agents exhibited by <italic>priA</italic> null strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c29">29</xref>). There exists also an alternative pathway of replication restart that is not dependent on PriA but on Rep helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c24">24</xref>). Although <italic>rep</italic> mutants do not show the extreme phenotypes displayed by <italic>priA</italic> defective cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c30">30</xref>), <italic>rep</italic> and <italic>priA</italic> mutations are synthetically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c24">24</xref>). This suggests that Rep helicase may provide an accessory replication repair function. However, molecular details of the interplay between PriA- and Rep-dependent replication repair pathways remain unknown.</p><p>Here we show that SSB stimulates PriA-catalysed unwinding of branched DNA substrates. This stimulation requires binding of SSB to the initial DNA substrate and contact between PriA and the C-terminus of SSB. In contrast, neither a physical nor a functional interaction was detected between SSB and Rep helicase. A mutation within the C-terminus of SSB impairs interaction with PriA <italic>in vitro</italic>, and correlates with the DNA repair and recombination defects seen in strains carrying this <italic>ssb</italic> mutation. Contact between SSB and PriA may therefore play a critical role in coordinating reloading of the replisome at repaired forks and D-loops.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA substrates</title><p>DNA substrates were constructed using oligonucleotides, one of which in each structure was labelled with [&#x003b3;32-P]ATP at the 5&#x02032; end, and purified by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c31">31</xref>).

Plasmids for the overexpression of wild-type and mutant SSB proteins and wild-type Rep helicase were constructed by PCR amplification of the relevant gene from strain MG1655 and cloning into pET22b. All clones derived from PCR products were checked by DNA sequencing to ensure no unwanted mutations had arisen.</p><p>Wild-type SSB was overexpressed by IPTG induction of <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21(DE3) harbouring the above pET22b construct at 37&#x000b0;C. Purification was by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by passage through Q-sepharose anion exchange, S200HR Sephacryl gel filtration (both Amersham) and heparin agarose (Sigma) columns. Purified protein was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl and 50% (w&#x0002f;v) glycerol. SSB&#x00394;C10 and SSB113 were expressed and purified as for wild-type SSB, except that induction of <italic>ssb113</italic> expression was performed at 30&#x000b0;C. The presence of a wild-type <italic>ssb</italic> allele in BL21(DE3) meant that wild-type SSB would co-purify with each mutant protein. However, the difference in mobility between wild-type SSB and SSB&#x00394;C10 in SDS gels allowed us to estimate that &#x0003e;95% of the purified sample contained mutant SSB, reflecting the extreme overproduction of plasmid-encoded SSB. Rep helicase was overexpressed as for wild-type SSB and purified through heparin agarose, ssDNA cellulose (both Sigma) and Mono-Q anion exchange (Amersham) columns. Storage was at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 200 mM NaCl and 50% (w&#x0002f;v) glycerol. <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> SSB was a gift from Malcolm White.

All <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB concentrations quoted are those of the tetramer.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA unwinding and binding assays</title><p>Assays for junction dissociation were performed at 37&#x000b0;C in 40 mM HEPES&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP and 0.1 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BSA; 0.2 nM junction DNA was used together with the indicated concentrations of proteins. Unwinding reactions were preincubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 min, together with SSB if present, prior to addition of PriA to a final volume of 10 &#x003bc;l and incubation continued at 37&#x000b0;C for a further 10 min.

The rate of junction dissociation was measured as above except that the final reaction volume was 80 &#x003bc;l, and 10 &#x003bc;l samples were removed and mixed with 2.5 &#x003bc;l stop buffer at the appropriate time interval after addition of PriA. The amount of junction dissociation was analysed by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide&#x0002f;TBE gels, and quantified using a phosphorimager. DNA binding assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c34">34</xref>) except that 0.2 nM junction DNA was used and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was included in binding and running buffers. All assays were performed between two and four times, and the means of data used for graphical presentation. SD values from the mean were typically between 5% and 15%.</p></sec><sec><title>Surface plasmon resonance</title><p>Biotinylated peptides derived from the last 15 amino acids of wild-type SSB (biotin-PSNEPPMDFDDDIPF-COOH) and SSB113 (biotin-PSNEPPMDFDDDISF-COOH) were passed over a Biacore sensor chip SA in SPR buffer [10 mM HEPES&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl and 0.005% Tween-20] using a Biacore 2000 instrument. Approximately 100 response units of peptide were bound to each flow cell. PriA, dialysed into SPR buffer, was passed over each peptide at a flow rate of 5 &#x003bc;l min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 4 min at 12 different concentrations ranging from 50 to 5000 nM at 25&#x000b0;C. After each experiment, flow cells were regenerated using 0.5% SDS in SPR buffer for 1 min at 5 &#x003bc;l min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Ligands retained &#x0003e;95% of PriA binding capacity after this treatment. The response obtained from a flow cell without peptide bound to its surface was subtracted from all measurements. Stoichiometries of binding and <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values were estimated as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c35">35</xref>) from two independent experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>SSB stimulates PriA helicase at branched DNA substrates</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> SSB is required for PriA-catalysed unwinding of duplex DNA &#x0003e;40 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c36">36</xref>). This requirement for SSB could be due to the need for SSB to bind to displaced ssDNA, and prevent reannealing of intermediates of the unwinding reaction. However, previous data had suggested PriA could interact specifically with ssDNA coated with SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c37">37</xref>). Thus, a second explanation for SSB-dependent PriA helicase activity is that efficient translocation of PriA along DNA may be dependent on protein&#x02013;protein interactions between PriA and SSB.</p><p>To determine whether an SSB&#x02013;PriA interaction might play a role in replication restart, we analysed the effects of <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB on PriA helicase function at forked DNA structures <italic>in vitro</italic>. PriA-catalysed unwinding of the oligonucleotide corresponding to the lagging strand within a fork possessing both leading and lagging strand duplexes was stimulated to a limited extent by increasing amounts of SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>A and B, fork 1). However, when the leading strand was omitted, so that the leading strand template was single-stranded, increasing amounts of SSB stimulated PriA-catalysed unwinding of the lagging strand duplex so that the majority of the substrate was unwound (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>A and B, fork 2). This was reflected in the 4-fold increase in the initial rate of PriA-directed unwinding of fork 2 by addition of SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>C).</p><p>PriA may target DNA substrates such as fork 2 in one of two ways. PriA displays high affinity binding to the branch point of DNA forks and can translocate along the lagging strand template arm to unwind any lagging strand DNA present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c26">26</xref>). PriA can also bind with lower affinity to 3&#x02032; single-stranded extensions from duplex DNA to translocate in a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction along ssDNA regardless of the presence of a branch within the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c20">20</xref>). Thus PriA may target the ssDNA arm of fork 2 and translocate along the leading strand template arm unwinding the parental duplex as it goes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c38">38</xref>). Since SSB stimulated PriA to unwind the lagging strand of fork 2, and of fork 1, rather than the parental duplex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>A), SSB stimulated PriA when PriA was acting as a branched DNA helicase.</p><p>PriA bound to both forks 1 and 2 with equal affinity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>D). SSB bound to fork 2 but not fork 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>E) as expected from the presence and absence of ssDNA, respectively. However, although SSB-stimulated levels of PriA-catalysed unwinding were maximal with fork 2, SSB also stimulated PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>B). Thus stimulation of PriA on fork 1 did not require binding of SSB to the initial substrate. Stimulation might therefore be achieved by SSB binding to the displaced 70mer lagging strand and prevention of reannealing rather than a direct SSB&#x02013;PriA interaction. Although addition of SSB failed to stimulate unwinding by PriA of a 70mer unbranched duplex bearing a 3&#x02032; ssDNA tail (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>A and B, duplex 1), arguing that stimulation was not due solely to prevention of reannealing by SSB, SSB binding to ssDNA extensions of duplex DNA substrates is known to inhibit PriA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c38">38</xref>). Any stimulation of PriA-catalysed unwinding of duplex 1 by SSB might be masked therefore by inhibition of PriA binding to the ssDNA arm of duplex 1 by SSB. Other approaches were required therefore to determine whether SSB stimulated PriA helicase at branched DNA substrates via specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>SSB stimulation of PriA helicase is specific</title><p>If stimulation of PriA by <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB occurred solely by prevention of reannealing of the displaced DNA strand, then SSB proteins from other organisms should also stimulate <italic>E.coli</italic> PriA helicase. However, SSB from the archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c40">40</xref>) had no significant stimulatory effect on PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f2">2</xref>A and B). Bacteriophage T4 gp32 SSB also failed to stimulate PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 2 (data not shown). We conclude that the ability of an SSB to bind ssDNA is not sufficient to effect stimulation of PriA.</p><p>The specificity of PriA stimulation by <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB was investigated further. Rep helicase is postulated to provide an alternative replication restart pathway to those dependent on PriA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c24">24</xref>). The 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase activity of Rep unwound fork 2 by translocation along the 50mer single-stranded leading strand template to effect unwinding of the parental duplex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f2">2</xref>C, lane 2). Increasing concentrations of <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB failed to stimulate unwinding by Rep of the 70mer lagging strand duplex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f2">2</xref>C, lanes 3&#x02013;8). Moreover, SSB inhibited unwinding by Rep of the 30mer parental duplex. These data suggest that the stimulatory function of SSB in replication restart is specific for PriA helicase.</p></sec><sec><title>The C-terminus of SSB effects stimulation of PriA helicase</title><p>The specific stimulation of PriA by <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB but not SSBs from other organisms supported the existence of a direct PriA&#x02013;SSB interaction. However, interaction of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> SSB and T4 gp32 with ssDNA differs from the binding of <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c42">42</xref>). Therefore, an alternative explanation for the specific stimulation of PriA by <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB is that the manner in which <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB binds DNA, as compared to other SSBs, leads to the generation of a preferred substrate for PriA helicase. To distinguish between these possibilities, a mutant SSB was generated lacking the final ten C-terminal residues (SSB&#x00394;C10). The acidic C-terminus of <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB has been shown to interact directly with three proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, but is not required for ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c46">46</xref>).</p><p>SSB&#x00394;C10 bound fork 2 with an affinity similar to wild-type SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>E). When the effects of SSB&#x00394;C10 upon PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 2 were compared with those of wild-type SSB, no stimulation of unwinding by SSB&#x00394;C10 was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>A, B and D). Indeed, the low level of unwinding of the lagging strand of fork 2 by PriA was inhibited rather than stimulated by SSB&#x00394;C10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>B, compare lanes 2 and 4). The SSB C-terminus appears therefore to be required for the stimulation of PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 2.</p><p>However, SSB&#x00394;C10 may possess elevated affinity for ssDNA as compared with wild-type SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c43">43</xref>). To exclude the possibility that altered binding of fork 2 by SSB&#x00394;C10 might be the cause of the lack of PriA stimulation, we used an SSB bearing a single amino acid alteration within the C-terminus. The <italic>ssb113</italic> allele encodes a proline to serine mutation at the penultimate amino acid of SSB, and SSB113 protein binds ssDNA with similar affinity, cooperativity and binding modes as wild-type SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c42">42</xref>). However, <italic>ssb113</italic> confers temperature-sensitive growth and defects in DNA repair and recombination in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c47">47</xref>). Furthermore, this mutation abrogates direct interactions between SSB and the &#x003c7; subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c46">46</xref>), and between SSB and exonuclease I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c45">45</xref>).</p><p>SSB113 carrying this P176S mutation bound fork 2 with an affinity similar to wild-type SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>E). However, SSB113, like SSB&#x00394;C10, inhibited rather than stimulated PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>C and D). The unwinding assays in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref> were performed at 37&#x000b0;C. Assays performed at 30&#x000b0;C also failed to reveal stimulation by SSB113 or SSB&#x00394;C10 (data not shown) which excludes heat inactivation of the mutant SSBs as the reason for lack of stimulation at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>These data indicate that stimulation of PriA on fork 2 requires a wild-type SSB C-terminus and that stimulation is not dependent solely upon the induction of a specific conformation within the DNA upon binding by SSB. These data also provide further evidence that trapping of unwinding intermediates by binding of SSB cannot explain SSB-dependent stimulation of PriA on fork 2. Instead, the data indicate that a direct interaction between the C-terminus of SSB and PriA stimulates PriA helicase. Therefore, we tested the ability of the SSB C-terminus to bind directly to PriA.</p></sec><sec><title>PriA binds specifically to the 15 C-terminal amino acids of SSB</title><p>We used surface plasmon resonance to test for a direct interaction between PriA and a peptide corresponding to the last fifteen amino acids of the wild-type SSB C-terminus. The wild-type SSB peptide, conjugated to an N-terminal biotin group, was bound to a streptavidin-coated chip, and PriA was passed over the chip surface. PriA bound to the peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>F). Unfortunately the rise and fall in response units was too rapid to obtain accurate measurements of <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>. Therefore, the responses 225 s after injection of PriA were plotted as a function of the concentration of PriA, and the data fitted to a single site Langmuir model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c35">35</xref>). This yielded estimates of 0.98 (&#x000b1;0.01) PriA molecules bound per wild-type SSB peptide at saturation and a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 2.4 &#x000b1; 1.3 &#x003bc;M.</p><p>We also assayed for interaction between PriA and a 15mer peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of SSB113 carrying the P176S mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>G).

However, binding of PriA to the SSB113 peptide was reduced compared with binding to the wild-type peptide. This was reflected in the estimated stoichiometry of 0.20 (&#x000b1;0.02) PriA molecules bound per SSB113 peptide at saturation and a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 6.9 &#x000b1; 2.0 &#x003bc;M.</p><p>The correlation between stimulation of PriA helicase by wild-type SSB but not SSB113, and the relative levels of binding of PriA to wild-type SSB and SSB113 C-terminal peptides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>) indicate that stimulation of PriA helicase is dependent on a physical interaction between PriA and the SSB C-terminus. The specific nature of this interaction was underlined by the failure to detect any interaction between Rep helicase and either the wild-type or SSB113 peptides using surface plasmon resonance (data not shown). Furthermore, no binding to either wild-type or SSB113 peptides was detected with PriB, PriC or DnaT (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Stimulation of PriA by the SSB C-terminus requires binding of SSB to ssDNA within the substrate</title><p>The observed functional and physical interactions between the SSB C-terminus and PriA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>) suggest that stimulation of PriA helicase at branched DNA can occur via binding of SSB to ssDNA present within the substrate followed by interaction between the SSB C-terminus and PriA. To test this, we used a simplified branched DNA substrate possessing two ssDNA arms of 50 and 70 bases and a corresponding unbranched DNA substrate lacking the 70mer ssDNA arm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>A and B). Binding of PriA to the branch point of fork 3 and translocation in a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction along the 70mer ssDNA arm would not effect unwinding of the 30 bp duplex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>Ci). However, binding of PriA to the 50mer ssDNA arm would allow the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase activity of PriA to unwind the 30 bp duplex within both fork 3 and duplex 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>Cii and iii). The unwinding of fork 3 and duplex 2 might therefore be viewed as the same reaction with the 70mer ssDNA arm of fork 3 playing no part in the mechanism of unwinding.</p><p>SSB had opposing effects on PriA-catalysed unwinding of the two substrates. Unwinding of fork 3 was stimulated 3- to 5-fold by SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>A) although at higher SSB concentrations stimulation was reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>D). In contrast, unwinding of duplex 2 by PriA was inihibited by SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>B and D). Stimulation of PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 3 by SSB was dependent therefore on the presence of the 70mer ssDNA arm.</p><p>The affinity of SSB for duplex 2 was &#x0223c;2-fold less than for fork 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>F). However, the most striking feature of SSB binding was the formation of two SSB&#x02013;DNA complexes with fork 3 but only one with duplex 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>G and H). An SSB tetramer has a binding site size of 50&#x02013;60 nt under the ionic conditions used in both the helicase and bandshift assays in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c48">48</xref>). The pattern of SSB&#x02013;DNA complexes formed with fork 3 and duplex 2 can be explained therefore by a single SSB tetramer binding to each ssDNA arm. When compared to fork 3, absence of the 70mer ssDNA arm in duplex 2 had no effect either on the binding of PriA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>E) or on the efficiency of unwinding by PriA of the 30 bp duplex in the absence of SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>D). We conclude that dependence of SSB-directed stimulation of PriA upon the 70mer ssDNA arm in fork 3 reflects a requirement for SSB binding to this arm.</p><p>To test whether the C-terminus of SSB was required for stimulation of PriA on fork 3, we analysed the effects of SSB&#x00394;C10 and SSB113 on unwinding by PriA. Neither SSB&#x00394;C10 nor SSB113 stimulated PriA helicase to any significant extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f5">5</xref>) even though both mutants bound fork 3 with similar affinities to wild-type SSB (data not shown). Instead both mutant SSBs inhibited PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f5">5</xref>B and C). Thus stimulation of PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 3 by translocation along the 50mer ssDNA arm required both the binding of SSB to the opposing ssDNA arm and a wild-type SSB C-terminus. Consistent with this conclusion, <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> SSB also failed to stimulate PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 3 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>SSB also stimulates PriA by prevention of reannealing of unwound ssDNA</title><p>The data in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f5">5</xref> demonstrate that SSB binding to ssDNA within branched DNA substrates leads to contact between the SSB C-termimus and PriA, and consequent stimulation of PriA helicase. However, one observation contradicts this conclusion. Stimulation of PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 1 by SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>A and B) suggests that stimulation can also be effected in the absence of SSB binding to the initial DNA substrate. This implies that unwinding of fork 1 by PriA may be stimulated by SSB binding to and preventing the reannealing of ssDNA intermediates of unwinding rather than direct contact between the SSB C-terminus and PriA. We tested this possibility by comparing the effects of wild-type SSB and SSB113 on PriA-catalysed unwinding of fork 1. Both SSBs stimulated unwinding of the 70mer lagging strand of fork 1 to the same extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f6">6</xref>). Stimulation of PriA by SSB can occur therefore in the absence of a wild-type SSB C-terminus, suggesting that the ssDNA binding function of SSB can also promote unwinding by PriA.</p><p>We conclude that SSB can stimulate PriA via two mechanisms. SSB binding to the substrate DNA effects stimulation by contact between the SSB C-terminus and PriA. However, SSB binding to ssDNA intermediates of unwinding can also stimulate PriA helicase via a mechanism that does not require direct contact between PriA and the SSB C-terminus.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have discovered a physical and functional interaction between the major replication restart initiator in <italic>E.coli</italic>, PriA helicase and SSB. This interaction stimulated PriA helicase activity specifically at branched DNA substrates and required both binding of SSB to ssDNA within the substrate and a wild-type SSB C-terminus. SSB and PriA might act in concert therefore to promote reloading of DnaB during replication fork repair. Moreover, this interaction was specific to PriA. SSB failed to stimulate Rep, the alternative replication restart helicase in <italic>E.coli</italic>, and no interaction was detected between the C-terminus of SSB and Rep. SSB also stimulated PriA helicase by a second mechanism that required neither a wild-type SSB C-terminus nor SSB binding to the initial DNA substrate, suggesting that PriA helicase was stimulated additionally by prevention of reannealing of unwound ssDNA intermediates.</p><p>Enhancement of PriA helicase by SSB occurs therefore by a novel dual mechanism. Stimulation of helicase activity by SSB binding to and effectively trapping ssDNA intermediates of unwinding acts to increase the apparent processivity of more distributive helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c49">49</xref>). In contrast, how contact between the SSB C-terminus and PriA might elevate the rate of DNA unwinding is not known. One possibility is that this interaction may enhance the effective local concentration of PriA near ssDNA. However, the estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 2.4 &#x003bc;M for the PriA&#x02013;SSB C-terminus interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f3">3</xref>) as compared with the nanomolar estimates of the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for PriA&#x02013;DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c19">19</xref>) suggests that contact between the SSB C-terminus and PriA likely occurs only when both proteins are already bound to the substrate DNA. Thus a more likely stimulatory mechanism is that contact with the SSB C-terminus subsequent to binding of PriA to the DNA induces a conformational change in PriA to enhance the processivity of unwinding. Indeed, reduction of the length of the lagging strand duplex to be unwound by PriA from 70 to 30 bp leads to a reduction in the degree of stimulation by wild-type SSB (data not shown).</p><p>There are two major domains in PriA, the C-terminal helicase domain containing the conserved helicase motifs and an N-terminal DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c50">50</xref>). It is tempting therefore to suggest that SSB might enhance the processivity of PriA by interaction with the helicase domain of PriA. However, work on PcrA helicase has demonstrated that both the helicase domain and the DNA binding domain responsible for distortion of duplex DNA ahead of the helicase domain are critical for helicase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c51">51</xref>). Thus induced conformational changes in either the helicase or DNA binding domains of PriA by SSB could conceivably alter the processivity of PriA.</p><p>Stimulation of PriA via contact with the SSB C-terminus or prevention of reannealing by SSB was specific to branched DNA structures. However, the observed stimulation of PriA by SSB lead to enhancement of unwinding of the lagging strand of fork 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f1">1</xref>) and the parental strands of fork 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>). The unwinding of different features of branched DNA structures suggests that the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of SSB-directed stimulation of PriA might not be to enhance unwinding of the lagging strand by PriA for loading of DnaB. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by the eventual inhibition of PriA on fork 3 at higher concentrations of SSB whereas stimulation of PriA by SSB on fork 2 remained unaffected (data not shown). SSB is known to inhibit PriA helicase on duplex substrates possessing a 3&#x02032; ssDNA tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c38">38</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f4">4</xref>B). Thus at higher SSB concentrations, binding of SSB to the 50mer ssDNA arm of fork 3 might occlude low affinity binding of PriA to this arm and abrogate the stimulatory effect of SSB binding to the 70mer ssDNA arm. Stimulation of PriA helicase by the SSB C-terminus <italic>in vivo</italic> might therefore be restricted to high affinity branched DNA binding sites for PriA, enhancing PriA translocation along the lagging strand template of repaired forks and D-loops. Put another way, stimulation of PriA by the SSB C-terminus occurs only when binding of PriA and SSB to DNA substrates is not mutually exclusive, limiting this stimulation to repaired forks and D-loops.</p><p>SSB inhibited Rep-catalysed unwinding of fork 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh980f2">2</xref>C). This observation suggests that SSB may inhibit Rep function in a proposed alternative replication restart mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c24">24</xref>). However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA substrate for Rep remains unclear. Moreover, Rep may also function in concert with PriC <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c24">24</xref>). Thus the functional significance of SSB-dependent inhibition of Rep helicase is currently unknown.</p><p>What role might a PriA&#x02013;SSB interaction play <italic>in vivo</italic>? SSB stimulation of PriA helicase might ensure that sufficient lagging strand duplex DNA is unwound to facilitate loading of DnaB onto the lagging strand template. Moreover, even in the absence of lagging strand DNA at a fork or D-loop, stimulation of PriA helicase may be important. DnaB cannot be loaded onto SSB-bound ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c13">13</xref>), but PriA may be able to displace SSB from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c52">52</xref>). Stimulation of PriA by SSB bound to a single-stranded lagging strand arm might lead therefore to enhanced removal of SSB and facilitate loading of DnaB. Thus, paradoxically, SSB might stimulate its own removal from the lagging strand template. Either way, promotion of loading of DnaB by a PriA&#x02013;SSB interaction may play a critical role in replication fork restart. Moreover, SSB-dependent stimulation of PriA at branched DNA substrates may effectively enhance the DNA structure specificity of PriA. This enhancement might act to ensure that PriA-directed loading of DnaB occurs at branched DNA substrates only and not at other, adventitious, sites throughout the genome.</p><p>These data imply that impairment <italic>in vivo</italic> of an interaction between PriA and the SSB C-terminus should hinder PriA function. <italic>ssb113</italic> strains display temperature-sensitive growth, sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and defects in recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c47">47</xref>). Temperature-sensitive growth of <italic>ssb113</italic> strains has been attributed to reduced interaction between the &#x003c7; subunit of the clamp loader complex and the C-terminus of SSB113 at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c53">53</xref>). This reduced interaction may lead to an inability of the clamp loader to displace primase from the newly synthesized primer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c53">53</xref>). However, the defects in DNA repair and recombination of <italic>ssb113</italic> are evident even at permissive temperatures. <italic>priA</italic> null strains also confer extreme sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and defects in recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c54">54</xref>). Thus the repair and recombination defects of <italic>ssb113</italic> might be explained, at least in part, by abrogation of a PriA&#x02013;SSB interaction. However, given the pleiotropic effects of <italic>ssb113</italic>, specific inhibition of the PriA&#x02013;SSB interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> will be required to establish the importance of SSB for PriA function.</p><p>The mutually exclusive interactions of primase and of the &#x003c7; subunit of the clamp loader complex with SSB are thought to facilitate hand-off of the RNA primer from primase to DNA polymerase III, ensuring ordered assembly of the lagging strand polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c53">53</xref>). The PriA&#x02013;SSB interaction detailed in this study suggests that SSB plays an extensive role in coordinating replication restart at every stage of the reaction, from initial loading of DnaB by PriA to recruitment of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme complex. Coordination of replication restart by interactions between SSB and partner proteins might extend even further. A direct SSB&#x02013;RecO interaction may modulate activity of the RecF, O and R proteins in directing loading of RecA onto SSB-coated ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c57">57</xref>). Furthermore, RecO and RecR stimulate recombination-directed DNA replication catalysed by PriA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c12">12</xref>). Interactions between SSB and components of the recombination and replication machineries might act therefore to direct the repair of damaged replication forks from start to finish.</p><p>Our studies suggest that coordination of replication fork repair may be accomplished, at least in part, by SSB in prokaryotes. Is this a universal strategy? Loading of the bacteriophage T4 replicative helicase gp41 onto D-loops formed by recombination requires a physical and functional interaction between the single-stranded DNA binding protein gp32 and the helicase loader gp59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c58">58</xref>). A physical interaction between UL9 helicase and ICP8 single-stranded DNA binding protein of Herpes simplex virus 1 may play a role in the unwinding of HSV 1 origins of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c59">59</xref>). Although eukaryotic enzymes responsible for initiation of replication at structures such as D-loops have yet to be identified, the eukaryotic single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA interacts with RecQ-type helicases required for maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c60">60</xref>) and with subunits of the MCM complex thought to constitute the eukaryotic replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c61">61</xref>). Moreover, SSB interacts physically and functionally with MCM DNA helicase in <italic>S.solfataricus</italic>, a homologue of the eukaryotic MCM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh980c62">62</xref>). Orchestration of helicase function by contact with single-stranded DNA binding proteins is emerging as a crucial factor in the maintenance of genome stability throughout all domains of life.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh980f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Effect of wild-type SSB on PriA helicase function.
