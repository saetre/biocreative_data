In this article, we demonstrate by primer-extension experiments, PAGE, chemical footprinting, CD, UV and FRET experiments that the G-rich strand of NHE (32R) folds into intra-molecular G-quadruplex structures. Fluorescence data show that 32R in 100 mM KCl melts with a biphasic profile, showing the formation of two distinct G-quadruplexes with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of <bold>&#x0223c;</bold>55<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>C (Q<sub>1</sub>) and <bold>&#x0223c;</bold>72<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>C (Q<sub>2</sub>). DMS-footprinting and CD suggest that Q<sub>1</sub> can be a parallel and Q<sub>2</sub> a mixed parallel/antiparallel G-quadruplex. When dsNHE (32R hybridized to its complementary) is incubated with a nuclear extract from Panc-1 cells, three DNA&#x02013;protein complexes are observed by EMSA. The complex of slower mobility is competed by quadruplex 32R, but not by mutant oligonucleotides, which cannot form a quadruplex structure. Using paramagnetic beads coupled with 32R, we pulled down from the Panc-1 extract proteins with affinity for quadruplex 32R. One of these is the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, which was previously reported to unfold quadruplex DNA. Our study suggests a role of quadruplex DNA in <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription and provides the basis for the rationale design of molecular strategies to inhibit the expression of <italic>KRAS</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>KRAS</italic> is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes detected in human cancer. It encodes for a guanine nucleotide (GTP/GDP)-binding protein acting as a signal transducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The normal (wild-type) RAS protein is transiently activated by signals from cell receptors that promote the exchange of bound GDP with GTP. The protein returns to its inactivated state through the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. It has been shown that the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene may harbour a number of point mutations resulting in aminoacid substitutions (in particular, at codons 12, 13 and less frequently at codons 59, 61 and 63) that yield a protein with a reduced capacity to hydrolyze GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). As a result, the mutated RAS protein remains locked in the activated state, transmitting constitutively signals for cell proliferation to the nucleus, via the MAP-kinase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Activating <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations are most prevalent in pancreatic (60%), biliary tract (33%), colorectal (32%) and lung (19%) carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Due to its role in the pathogenesis of cancer, <italic>KRAS</italic> is an ideal target for anticancer drugs. Several anti-<italic>KRAS</italic> molecular strategies have been proposed: (i) inhibition of <italic>KRAS</italic> expression by antisense, ribozyme and antigene oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">7&#x02013;11</xref>); (ii) blockade of RAS protein to anchor to the plasma membrane by farnesyl transferase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>); (iii) inhibition of downstream effectors of the RAS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The human <italic>KRAS</italic> gene is located in chromosome 12, at the 12p12.1 locus, and its promoter contains a polypurine nuclease hypersensitive element (NHE) that plays an essential role in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Nuclease-hypersensitive sites rich in guanines are commonly found in the regulatory regions of eukaryotic genes and have been associated with non-B-DNA conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The most investigated nuclease-hypersensitive sequence is the one located in <italic>CMYC</italic>, upstream of the P1 promoter that controls 80&#x02013;90% of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). Hurley and co-workers have demonstrated that the <italic>CMYC</italic> hypersensitive site adopts stable G-quadruplex (or G4-DNA) structures that seem to behave as a transcription repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These data strongly support the notion that certain nuclease hypersensitive sites can assume two possible conformations: a double-stranded, transcription-active form or a folded, transcription-inactive form. A similar picture was recently proposed for the murine <italic>KRAS</italic> gene that also contains a G-rich NHE in its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Other promoter/enhancer sequences composed by multiple runs of guanines are structurally polymorphic. For instance, three overlapping G-rich sequences within the promoter of <italic>BCL-2</italic> form distinct G-quadruplex structures, each characterized by a different loop topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>); a polypurine tract of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-&#x003b1; promoter forms a parallel quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>); G-rich regions forming G4-DNA are present in promoter/enhancer sequences of <italic>VEGF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>); the <italic>PDGF</italic>-A gene is regulated by multiple promoter and silencer elements that are CG-rich and exhibit a single-stranded folded character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>); C<italic>KIT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and muscle-specific human sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) contain sequences that form quadruplex structures. This leads to the suggestion that G4-DNA in the control region of the genes may contribute to the regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we demonstrate that the G-rich strand of NHE, located in the human <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter, can fold into a dynamic intra-molecular G-quadruplex that can assume two distinct conformations for which we propose, on the basis of circular dichroism (CD) and DMS-footprinting data, folding topologies with three and four loops. Pull-down assays were used to isolate from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma nuclear extract proteins that have affinity for the G-quadruplex of 32R. LC-MS/MS of in-gel tryptic digests of these proteins allowed the identification of poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase I (PARP-1), ATP-dependent DNA helicase 2 subunit 1 (Ku70) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). PARP-1 and the dimer Ku70&#x02013;Ku83 bind also duplex NHE (dsNHE). The proteins of the hnRNP family are of particular interest, as some of them show unfolding properties against G4-DNA [for a comprehensive review see ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>)]. The observation that <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription in Panc-1 cells is reduced by TMPyP4 (but not by TMPyP2), a cationic G4-DNA stabilizing ligand, confirm the notion that folded G-quadruplex structures within critical promoter region behaves, indeed, as a transcription repressor. The implications of these findings in the regulation of <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription as well as in the development of new molecular approaches to specifically inhibit oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides and porphyrins</title><p>The oligonucleotides (sequences in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were obtained from Sigma-Proligo (Paris, France).

When the concentration of 32R is increased from 20 nm to 1 &#x003bc;M and the sample incubated for 24 h, it still migrates as an intra-molecular G-quadruplex. The addition of five equivalents of TMPyP4 to the samples containing 32R in 50 or 140 mM KCl, gives rise to a new fast-moving species (band Q<sub>2</sub>). This suggests that the porphyrin stabilizes a new G-quadruplex conformation that migrates faster than Q<sub>1</sub>. The transformation of Q<sub>1</sub> into Q<sub>2</sub> is likely to require an intra-molecular rearrangement. That's why Q<sub>2</sub> is observed after a pre-incubation of 12 h at 37&#x000b0;C, but not at 4&#x000b0;C. As expected, when the PAGE experiment was carried out in 50 or 140 mM LiCl, with and without TMPyP4, 32R migrates as 32Y and 32deg. This indicates that 32R does not form G4-DNA structures in the lithium buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>d).</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence melting experiments show that two quadruplexes are formed by the G-rich strand of NHE</title><p>Tandem repeats of guanines can adopt a variety of intra-molecular G-quadruplex structures, each characterized by a definite folding topology. To investigate the folding of the G-rich strand of NHE we used fluorescence spectroscopy and labelled the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of 32R with FAM and TAMRA, respectively. In LiCl (up to 100 mM), upon excitation at the FAM absorption band (475 nm), a fluorescence emission band is observed at 525 nm due to FAM. As fluorescence emission is not observed at 585 nm (TAMRA), there is no fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from FAM to TAMRA, in keeping with the fact that in lithium 32R does not form any structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>a). When 32R is in the random-coiled conformation, the two fluorophores are expected to be at a distance of about 130 &#x000c5;, which is higher than the F&#x000f6;ster radius (<italic>R</italic><sub>o</sub> = 45&#x02013;60 &#x000c5;) for efficient FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The quenching effect on FAM observed upon addition of lithium is probably due to the guanines nearby to the fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Replacing lithium with potassium, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the dual-labelled 32R sequence shows bands at both 525 and 585 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). This indicates that potassium induces the folding of 32R into a G-quadruplex structure in which the two dyes come within the F&#x000f6;ster distance. Two observations can be made. First, the fluorescence intensity of FAM decreases when potassium is increased, because of the energy transfer from FAM to TAMRA, due to quadruplex formation. Second, TAMRA emission increases with potassium. This is evident if one measures the intensity ratio <italic>F</italic><sub>585</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>525</sub>: it increases from 0.24 to 0.58 in 0&#x02013;100 mM KCl, while it remains constant at &#x0223c;0.24 in 0&#x02013;100 mM LiCl. It has been suggested that the modest increase of TAMRA, which is generally observed, might be due to a decrease in molar absorptivity of the molecule and/or to a static quenching caused by interactions with the FAM moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Excitation spectra monitored at wavelength of TAMRA emission (585 nm) showed two bands that corresponded to TAMRA and FAM absorption maxima, supporting the presence of FRET when 32R is exposed to potassium (data not shown). To determine the stability of the G-quadruplex we performed fluorescence melting experiments as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Basically, upon fluorescein excitation at 475 nm one observes an increase in the emission at 525 nm between the low-temperature (folded/quenched) and high-temperature (unfolded/bright fluorescent) form. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c shows the first derivative of the fluorescence (dF/dT) versus T for dual-labelled 32R, after incubation in the buffer added with increasing amounts of KCl. Two clear transitions are observed in the KCl concentration range of 20&#x02013;100 mM (at 10 mM KCl only one transition is observed). The <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of these transitions are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The first transition occurs in the temperature range of 44&#x02013;55&#x000b0;C, while the second occurs in the range of 67&#x02013;72&#x000b0;C. As these transitions are only observed in the presence of potassium ions, they are due to the melting of two distinct G-quadruplex structures. On the other hand, the existence of two-folded conformations for 32R is not only suggested by the melting experiments but also by gel electrophoresis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>c showed that in the presence of five equivalents of TMPyP4, 32R migrates, after incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, with two-folded fast-running compact conformations (Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>). As TMPyP4 promotes the transformation of Q<sub>1</sub> into Q<sub>2</sub>, we investigated the melting of 32R in the presence of TMPyP4. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a shows the melting curves of 32R in Tris-buffer containing 100 mM KCl and different amounts of TMPyP4 (TMPyP4/32R ratios of 0, 1, 3 and 5). In 100 mM KCl, 32R shows the typical biphasic profile due to the melting of quadruplexes Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>, as previously observed. The addition of TMPyP4 induces the transformation of Q<sub>1</sub> into Q<sub>2</sub>. At the TMPyP4/32R ratios of 3 or 5, 32R shows a monophasic denaturing curve with a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> &#x0223c;72&#x000b0;C (Q<sub>2</sub>). In conclusion, FRET data shows that the polypurine strand of NHE can potentially adopt one of the two possible G-quadruplex conformations, which are inter-convertible by increasing the temperature and/or adding TMPyP4. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Fluorescence emission spectra (500&#x02013;650 nm) of 300 nm dual-labelled 32R incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4, at different LiCl (<bold>a</bold>) or KCl (<bold>b</bold>) concentrations (10, 20, 40, 60 and 100 mM, the arrow indicates the KCl(or LiCl)-increment direction).

After overnight incubation in 100 mM LiCl, 37&#x000b0;C, 32R does not show any footprinting (lane 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a), suggesting that the sequence does not form any secondary structure, in accordance with FRET and PAGE data. However, in 100 mM KCl, 37&#x000b0;C, 32R shows a clear and reproducible footprinting where 11 guanines out of 21 appear protected from DMS/piperidine cleavage (G2 is not seen in the gel). Although 32R contains four runs of guanines that could allow a straightforward fold into a parallel quadruplex with two external loops of 4 bases and one of 6 bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b, Q<sub>0</sub>), the footprinting data indicate that 32R folds into a G-quadruplex with a different folding topology. This is indicated by the fact that the central run of guanines G18&#x02013;G20 is cleaved and the couple of guanines G6&#x02013;G7 is protected from cleavage under a variety of conditions: 37&#x000b0;C or 50&#x000b0;C, 50 or 140 mM KCl, with or without 5 eq. of TMPyP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a and lanes 3&#x02013;8). Since 32R does not fold into a hairpin (this structure should have also been observed in Li-buffer), its DMS-footprinting, which is highly reproducible, is consistent with the formation of a parallel G-quadruplex with external loops of 1, 2 and 11 bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b, quadruplex Q<sub>1</sub>). Quadruplex Q<sub>1</sub> is likely to have thymidine T8 directly involved in the formation of the G-tetrad core. On the other hand, mixed guanine/thymine tetrads have been previously observed by NMR and the structure of the putative GGGT tetrad is derived from that reported for GTGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a). It is worth noting that thymidine has been reported to also form TTTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) and ATAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) tetrads. Compared to a canonical G-tetrad that is stabilized by eight hydrogen bonds, GGGT has one less H-bond. Alternatively, one cannot exclude that guanine G9 is involved in the formation of the G-tetrad. In this case, the run of guanines G6&#x02013;G9 should contain T8 as a flipped-out base and the resulting G-quadruplex should have two one-base double-chain reversal loops. This possibility, however, is not supported by the fact that G9 is reactive to DMS. One could argue that T8, being an intervening base between G7 and G9, might cause a backbone distortion in the neighbourhood of G9, which weakens the hydrogen bond involving N7 of G9. Another aspect that is worth noting is that a close inspection of the autoradiographies showed that G25 and G28 appear always partially protected (lane 10). This may result from the fact that two loop isomers of Q<sub>1</sub> may exist in solution: one involving the run of guanines G25-G26-G27, the other the run G26-G27-G28. The preference of forming Q<sub>1</sub> with 1/1/11 or 1/2/11 loops instead of Q<sub>0</sub> with 4/4/6 loops can be rationalized by the finding that single-nucleotide loops stabilize quadruplex DNA more than larger loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>, left) DMS-footprinting of 32R at 37&#x000b0;C in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA 1 &#x003bc;g sonicated salmon sperm DNA (buffer B). 32R incubated overnight in water (lane 1); 32R incubated overnight in buffer B plus 100 mM LiCl (lane 2); 32R incubated in buffer B plus 50 or 140 mM KCl, 37&#x000b0;C, (lanes 3 and 4); 32R incubated in buffer B plus 50 or 140 mM KCl + 5 eq.

The CD of 32R obtained in the presence of TMPyP4 suggests that Q<sub>2</sub> should have a structure with both parallel (260 nm ellipticity) and anti-parallel (295 nm ellipticity) characters. We propose for Q<sub>2</sub> a mixed parallel/anti-parallel topology with one-base double-chain reversal loop and two lateral loops of 2 and 11 bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). Since TMPyP4 is a porphyrin that upon irradiation generates reactive oxygen species that cleave DNA in the neighbourhood of the binding site, we performed photocleavage experiments with 32R. We observed that the bases that are strongly photocleaved are located in the lateral 11-base (G18, G19 and G23) and 2-base (G9) loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a, lanes 11&#x02013;13). This is consistent with the finding that the porphyrin preferentially binds to the loops of intra-molecular quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). But, the fact that G25 and slightly also G11 and G6 are photocleaved supports the notion that TMPyP4 binds also to the external G-tetrads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).

When dsNHE is incubated with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Panc-1) nuclear extract, three DNA&#x02013;protein complexes, namely C1, C2 and C3, are observed by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a, lane 1). In order to see if the proteins that bind to dsNHE also recognize the G-rich strand (32R), folded in its G-quadruplex conformation, we performed competition experiments. We found that 32R competed efficiently the DNA&#x02013;protein complex C1. The addition of 50-fold excess of 32R inhibits the formation of complex C1 by &#x0003e;50%, 100-fold excess practically abrogates complex C1. In contrast, mutant sequences 32R-4C, 32R-8C and 32R-12C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which do not fold into a quadruplex structure (according to CD), did not affect the formation of C1 at all, suggesting that 32R competes with dsNHE for protein binding through its secondary structure. It is interesting to note that the competition of C1 results in an increase of C3, suggesting that C3 is probably a partially assembled form of the DNA&#x02013;protein complex C1. We also observed that complex C1 is competed, though less efficiently than 32R, by the <italic>CMYC</italic> quadruplex-forming sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which is known to form a parallel quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), but it is not competed by the pyrimidine strand of NHE (32Y)(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn120/DC1">Supplementary Data S1</ext-link>). Direct evidence that the G-quadruplex formed by 32R binds to proteins from Panc-1 nuclear extract was obtained by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>b). Radiolabelled 32R, pre-equilibrated in 100 mM KCl and successively incubated with the nuclear extract for 30 min, formed three distinct DNA&#x02013;protein complexes (B1, B2 and B3). As complex B1 is partially competed by mutants 32R-4T, 32R-8C, 32R-12C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and dsNHE, it is due to a protein binding non-specifically to DNA. Complexes B2 and B3 are not competed by the mutant sequences, but are strongly competed by dsNHE. This suggests that B1 and B2 contain proteins that recognize both quadruplex and double-stranded conformations of NHE. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Competition binding experiments.

After binding, the proteins were eluted from the beads in three steps with Tris-buffers containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 M). The fractions obtained were desalted and analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE/silver staining. Three polypeptides co-eluted in the high salt fraction: p114, p86 and p70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a, lanes 5&#x02013;7). In parallel, the nuclear extract was applied to magnetic beads coupled to 32R in the G-quadruplex conformation. Again, the bound proteins were eluted in three steps and the fractions analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (lanes 2&#x02013;4). In this case, the polypeptides co-eluting in the high salt fraction are p114, p70 and p34. When the pulled down experiment was performed with the beads coupled with a scramble oligonucleotide (B-scram, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), these specific bands in SDS&#x02013;PAGE were not obtained (data not shown). The bands were excised from the gel and the proteins identified by mass spectrometry were poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), ATP-dependent DNA helicase 2, subunit 1 (Ku70) and subunit 2 (Ku86) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn120/DC1">Supplementary Data S2</ext-link>). The band of p34 contained in addition to hnRNP A1, some isoforms of histone H1. Histone proteins (&#x0223c;20 kDa) are highly basic (pI&#x0003e;10) and they probably interact with NHE by unspecific electrostatic interactions. The predicted molecular masses of proteins identified (113, 86, 70 and 34 kDa) are in nice accord with apparent molecular masses observed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn120/DC1">Supplementary Data, S2</ext-link>). The data indicate that two proteins associated with NHE of <italic>KRAS</italic> (PARP-1 and Ku70) have affinity for both the folded and duplex conformation of regulatory NHE and may provide a rationale for the competition experiments illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>. It is worth noting that the three proteins binding to quadruplex 32R have been previously found to recognize unusual DNA structures (see Discussion section). The protein that is likely to have an important function in the regulation of <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription is hnRNP A1, as it possesses unfolding capacity against G4-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). The binding of these proteins to quadruplex 32R was also observed by Southwestern blots. The nuclear extract was run on SDS&#x02013;PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and the proteins renatured in HEPES buffer (see Materials and methods section). The membrane was treated with radiolabelled 32R or 32R-4C (separate experiments). As expected, 32R but not mutant 32R-4C recognized bands at &#x0223c;34 and 70 kDa (hnRNP A1, Ku70). As for PARP-1, its binding to 32R was difficult to detect, probably because this large protein did not completely renature after SDS&#x02013;PAGE. However, when the 0.75 M NaCl fraction of the pull-down was electroblotted (lane 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a) a clear band around 113 kDa was obtained, as expected.

As a control molecule of interest, we used TMPyP2, a positional isomer (ortho) of TMPyP4 that has very low affinity for G4-DNA (see the structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). The cells (50 000/well, 24-well plate) were treated with 50 &#x003bc;M TMPyP4, total RNA was extracted after 12 and 24 h of incubation.

The levels of <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNA compared to <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA in untreated and treated Panc-1 cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>. It can be seen that TMPyP4 induces a significant reduction of <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNA of about 30 &#x000b1; 4%, at either 12 or 24 h of incubation of the cells with the porphyrin. TMPyP3 slightly inhibits transcription only after 24 h of treatment, while TMPyP2 did not show any effect on the levels of mRNA at both 12 and 24 h, as it is to be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>).

Finally, the fact that TMPyP2, the porphyrin that cannot stabilize G4-DNA, does not reduce <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNA, suggests that the bioactivity of TMPyP4 is due to specific binding to the G-quadruplex extruded by the regulatory element and not to a non-specific strand breakage. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Real-time PCR determination of the level of endogenous <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNA in Panc-1 cells untreated or treated for 12 and 24 h with 50 &#x003bc;M of TMPyP2, TMPyP3 and TMPyP4.

The G-quadruplex formed by the human <italic>KRAS</italic> sequence has been characterized by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, CD, UV and FRET spectroscopic data as well as chemical probing with DMS and TMPyP4. We used FRET to analyse the melting of the G-rich strand of NHE (32R), under a variety of ionic strength conditions. In 100 mM KCl, 32R exhibits two transitions with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of &#x0223c;55&#x000b0;C and &#x0223c;72&#x000b0;C. Since these transitions are not observed in 100 mM LiCl, they have been associated with the melting of two distinct G-quadruplex structures, namely Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>. When TMPyP4, a cationic porphyrin that stabilizes quadruplex DNA, is added to the K<sup>+</sup>-buffer, the transition at 55&#x000b0;C is abrogated, indicating that the ligand induces the transformation of Q<sub>1</sub> into Q<sub>2</sub>. Taken together, PAGE and melting data suggest that the G-rich strand of NHE is characterized by the following equilibria:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkn120i1.jpg"/></p><p>At 37&#x000b0;C, 100 mM KCl, 32R folds into Q<sub>1</sub>: a parallel intra-molecular G-quadruplex with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> &#x0223c;55&#x000b0;C. Increasing the temperature, Q<sub>1</sub> is disrupted and 32R folds into a new quadruplex (Q<sub>2</sub>) with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of &#x0223c;72&#x000b0;C. If TMPyP4 is added to K<sup>+</sup>-buffer, 32R can fold into Q<sub>2</sub> even at 37&#x000b0;C, as demonstrated by native electrophoresis, which shows that 32R, after incubation at 37&#x000b0;C in 100 mM KCl + 5 eq. of TMPyP4, migrates with two compact fast running quadruplexes. To propose a structure for Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> we performed DMS-footprinting experiments. In the presence of KCl or KCl+TMPyP4, the run of guanines G18&#x02013;G20 is found to be reactive to DMS, suggesting that the expected quadruplex Q<sub>0</sub> with loops of 4 and 6 bases is not formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). One could argue that the cleavage pattern reflects the formation of a hairpin, but this can be ruled out because 32R, after incubation in Li<sup>+</sup>-buffer, does not show any footprinting and migrates as an unstructured 32-mer oligonucleotide. On the basis of CD and footprinting data we propose for Q<sub>1</sub> a parallel quadruplex with three G-tetrads, three external loops of 1, 2 and 11 bases as well as a G-tetrad involving one thymidine (T8). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b shows that in this putative G-tetrad NH(3) and O(4) of thymine form hydrogen bonds with O(6), NH(1) and NH2(2) of adjacent guanines, as indicated by NMR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Q<sub>1</sub> fits to the DMS-footprinting data much better than a previous structure that we tentatively assigned to 32R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). For quadruplex Q<sub>2</sub> we propose a mixed parallel/anti-parallel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The conformation showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b has two lateral and one double-chain reversal loops; but for Q<sub>2</sub> we can also hypothesize a folding topology with one lateral, one diagonal and one double-chain reversal loop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn120/DC1">Supplementary Data S4</ext-link>). However, although these structures are in keeping with the experimental DMS-cleavage patterns, they are only hypothetical and need to be confirmed by NMR data.</p><p>The formation of G-quadruplexes within a regulatory element of <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>), suggests that they are likely to play a functional role in transcription. To support this hypothesis, we searched for proteins binding to NHE. To pull-down from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma nuclear extract proteins with affinity to quadruplex DNA, we used streptavidin paramagnetic beads coupled to 32R in the quadruplex form. Three proteins were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry: PARP-1, Ku70 and hnRNPA1. Two of these proteins, PARP-1 and Ku70 (as a dimer with the Ku83 subunit), were found to bind to dsNHE. It is interesting to note that the proteins that bind NHE had been previously implicated in transcription regulation. PARP-1 is known to be part of the excision repair process, but growing evidence indicates that it is also an important component of promoter/enhancer regulatory complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). For instance, PARP-1 specifically binds to a G-rich element of the <italic>REG</italic> gene promoter, forming with other proteins the active transcriptional DNA&#x02013;protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). As PARP-1 was reported to recognize DNA hairpins and cruciforms, it could recognize the loop bases of quadruplex 32R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Ku proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and involved in DNA repair, maintenance of telomere length and transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Ku proteins have the capacity to interact with circular DNA with bubbles and any structure containing a double-to-single strand transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> data indicate that Ku70 binds to and stabilize the tetrahelical form of the Fragile X syndrome d(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> expanded sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). However, the protein associated with NHE, which is particularly interesting in the context of <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription is hnRNP A1, as its N-terminus proteolitic portion (residues 1&#x02013;195), referred to UP1, shows the ability to resolve G4-DNA. Recombinant UP1 has been demonstrated to have G-tetrad destabilizing activity against intra-molecular G-quadruplexes formed by the minisatellite (MN)Pc-1 tandem repeat d(GGCAG)<sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) and by the telomeric d(TAGGGT)<sub>4</sub> repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). It is not yet known how hnRNP A1 and UP1 resolve G4 DNA, but like the proteins active at the telomeres, UP1 should trap single-stranded DNA and shift the single-stranded &#x021d4; quadruplex equilibrium away from the quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). As hnRNP A1 and PARP-1 have been reported to interact with each other, it could be that PARP-1 rybosylates hnRNP A1 and modifies the functional properties of the protein in the context of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>).</p><p>In the light of these data, we asked how a folded secondary structure formed within NHE might be involved in transcription regulation. The <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter at NHE may undergo, in the presence of superhelical stress, a duplex-to-quadruplex equilibrium. When NHE is in the folded G-quadruplex form, transcription should be inhibited, in accordance with the fact that the stabilization of this structure by TMPyP4 results in a transcription repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It is possible that the G-quadruplex of NHE is stabilized by Ku70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). The complementary unpaired pyrimidine strand of NHE should be bound by single-stranded binding protein hnRNP K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). To activate transcription, the G-quadruplex of NHE should be unfolded and this could involve hnRNP A1, because of its capacity to resolve intra-molecular G4-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Once the promoter assumes a double-stranded conformation, a transcriptional active DNA&#x02013;protein complex is rapidly assembled. In this scenario, G-quadruplex DNA behaves as a transcription repressor. The model proposed for the control of <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription suggests several strategies to down-regulate <italic>KRAS</italic> in tumour tissues: (i) use of planar macrocycles capable to stabilize G4-DNA and lock the promoter into the folded non-active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>); (ii) use of triplex-forming oligonucleotides to block the formation of DNA&#x02013;protein complexes at NHE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>); (iii) use of decoy oligonucleotides against proteins binding to NHE (hnRNP A1/Ku70/PARP-1 and others).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn120/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn120_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkn120_nar-00121-f-2008-File014.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study has been carried out with the financial support of the Italian Ministry of Education (PRIN 2005) and the Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC 2007).
