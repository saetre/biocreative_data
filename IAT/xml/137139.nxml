Telomerase, the enzyme responsible for telomere maintenance, is composed of a reverse transcriptase protein subunit and an integral RNA component which contains the templating domain. In human telomerase, the template region consists of 11 nt (3&#x02032;-r<italic>CAAUC</italic>CCAAUC-5&#x02032;) and comprises an alignment domain (italicised) plus a template sequence encoding the telomeric repeat d(GGT TAG). In this study, the alignment domain of human telomerase was systematically reduced from the 3&#x02032; end and the resultant recombinant enzyme activity was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic>. Deletion or substitution of one or two residues from the 3&#x02032; end of the alignment domain caused only a slight reduction in overall catalytic activity and did not alter the processivity of the enzyme. Deletion or substitution of three or more residues from the 3&#x02032; end of the alignment domain resulted in total loss of catalytic activity. These results suggest that the two most 3&#x02032; terminal RNA residues are relevant but not essential for overall activity and that the minimal length requirement of the alignment domain is 3 nt. Furthermore, base pairing between the 3&#x02032; end of the primer substrate and the first two residues of the alignment domain is also not an absolute requirement for processive synthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are found at the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c2">2</xref>) and consist of dGT-rich DNA sequences and their associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c4">4</xref>). Telomerase is the cellular reverse transcriptase responsible for the synthesis and maintenance of the chromosomal ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c1">1</xref>). Telomerase compensates for the loss of telomeric DNA that occurs through incomplete replication, thereby protecting the chromosome ends against recombination, chromosome fusion or exonuclease degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c6">6</xref>). Telomerase has also been implicated in the control of cellular lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c8">8</xref>). In particular, a number of studies have indicated that telomerase expression is associated with cell immortalisation and tumourigenesis, highlighting the enzyme as a potentially promising target for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein minimally composed of an RNA component (TR) and a catalytic subunit (TERT), which has been identified as a reverse transcriptase in <italic>Euplotes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c12">12</xref>), <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c13">13</xref>), <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c14">14</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c14">14</xref>). Using biochemical and genetic tools, several telomerase-associated proteins have also been identified to be part of the holoenzyme complex in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c17">17</xref>). Their function remains to be unambiguously determined, but various studies indicate they may participate in telomerase assembly, function or regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c16">16</xref>).</p><p>Telomerase elongation and substrate specificity have been characterised <italic>in vitro</italic> for a wide range of organisms, including protozoa, yeasts and human, by use of a single-stranded DNA primer extension assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c19">19</xref>). The likely mechanism for telomerase, first proposed by Blackburn and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c20">20</xref>), is distinct from other classes of DNA polymerases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c21">21</xref>). Telomerase uses a small region of its integral RNA component, called the template domain, to direct the synthesis of the dGT-rich strand of the telomeres whilst reverse transcription is mediated by the catalytic protein subunit of telomerase (TERT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c22">22</xref>). The proposed mechanism involves several defined events which include a primer recognition step (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f1">1</xref>B) and an extension step (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f1">1</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c20">20</xref>). A distinct feature of telomerase is the ability to reiteratively add telomeric repeats to a DNA primer without dissociation of enzyme and substrate. According to the current model, processive repeat addition requires the newly synthesised 3&#x02032; end of the primer to re-align on the RNA template after each round of addition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f1">1</xref>D). Studies on telomerase from different species strongly suggest that telomerase can interact with oligonucleotide primers in a bipartite manner. It has been proposed that the 3&#x02032; end of the DNA primer is aligned by hybridisation with the RNA template, whilst the 5&#x02032; region of the primer is bound to a second site (the anchor site) which contributes to high affinity substrate binding and processive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c25">25</xref>). Following a repeat addition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f1">1</xref>C), the 5&#x02032; region of the primer remains bound to the anchor site allowing the newly synthesised 3&#x02032; end of the DNA to translocate back to the beginning of the template, without dissociation from the enzyme, for additional repeat synthe sis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f1">1</xref>D). Alternatively, if both sites are released simultaneously the DNA substrate dissociates from the enzyme with termination of synthesis.</p><p>Vertebrate telomerase RNA, including those of mammals, birds, fish, reptile and amphibians, vary significantly in length and sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c26">26</xref>). However, phylogenetic analysis of these RNA sequences from distantly related telomerases show highly conserved structural domains and a remarkably similar core structure despite low primary sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c26">26</xref>). In particular, 8 nt in the catalytically important template domain are universally conserved throughout the vertebrate kingdom with the consensus sequence 3&#x02032;-<italic>UC</italic>CCAAUC-5&#x02032; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>A). The template region of telomerase may be functionally divided into two distinct domains known as the alignment (italicised) and elongation domains. The elongation domain is invariant for all vertebrates and consists of the 6 nt sequence 3&#x02032;-CCAAUC-5&#x02032;, which encodes the telomeric repeat d(GGTTAG) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>A). The alignment domain of vertebrates is less conserved and has evolved to have lengths ranging from 2 to 5 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>A). The sequence conservation of these residues is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>B.</p><p>The template sequence of human telomerase is 11 residues long (3&#x02032;-<italic>CAAUC</italic>CCAAUC-5&#x02032;), nearly twice the length of a telomeric repeat. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a minimum of 8 nt may be sufficient for function in vertebrates. It has been postulated that the alignment domain functions to re-position the primer substrate by base pairing during processive synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f1">1</xref>D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c27">27</xref>). This translocation step is unique to telomerase amongst the polymerases and represents one of the most intriguing features to understand at the molecular level. However, there is much to be elucidated about factors that influence translocation efficiency and enzyme processivity. Based on the current model, re-alignment of DNA at the alignment domain may be the key for efficient repeat addition. Interestingly, rodent telomerases which can only allow up to 2 bp to form during re-alignment are typically non-processive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c29">29</xref>) whilst human telomerase which potentially uses 5 bp is significantly more processive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c18">18</xref>). Does the shorter alignment domain account for the synthesis of shorter products? The functionally important determinants within the telomerase RNA template have been characterised in ciliates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c33">33</xref>) but little has been reported for human telomerase. In this paper, we report studies on the effect of systematic reduction in the length of the alignment domain of human telomerase on activity with a particular emphasis on processivity. These studies also define a minimal requirement in the alignment domain for the processive catalytic activity of human telomerase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>hTERT and hTR plasmid constructs</title><p>The hTERT expression plasmid was generated by sub-cloning the wild-type hTERT coding region from the pCl-Neo-hTERT plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c34">34</xref>) (obtained from Dr R.

Deletion of residue <sup>56</sup>C does not significantly impair telomerase activity, suggesting that this residue makes a minor contribution to overall activity. Similarly, the dinucleotide sequence <sup>56</sup>CA<sup>55</sup> is required but not essential for overall activity. The progressive decrease in overall activity with reduced alignment domain reaches a critical cut-off point at 3 nt, corresponding to the remaining sequence 3&#x02032;-<sup>54</sup>AUC<sup>52</sup>-5&#x02032;, where further length reduction leads to complete loss of activity.</p><p>Analysis of the elongation products provides information on telomerase processivity. The TRAP assay conditions include a large excess of primer, such that repeats added to any given primer will result from a single primer-binding event, with synthesis effectively terminating for a given primer upon dissociation from the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c39">39</xref>). Although the original distribution of DNA products from the telomerase extension is subject to scrambling (owing to multiple reverse primer-binding sites during the PCR amplification), the overall method occurs without further lengthening of the telomerase products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c39">39</xref>). The TRAP may therefore provide a qualitative measure of processivity by counting the longest repeats on the ladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c39">39</xref>). Gel electrophoresis analysis of the telomerase ladder from wild-type telomerase and the &#x00394;1 and &#x00394;2 mutant enzymes revealed a comparable pattern of product elongation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;7, respectively). In particular, the longest products generated by the &#x00394;1 and &#x00394;2 mutants are comparable in size to those generated by the wild-type enzyme (approximately 20 added repeats), indicative of similar processivity. Therefore, deletion of residue <sup>56</sup>C or of the dinucleotide <sup>56</sup>CA<sup>55</sup> does not significantly alter the processivity of human telomerase. Further confirmation of these results was obtained using a modified version of the TRAP specially developed by Szatmari and Aradi to analyse telomerase processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c35">35</xref>). The assay includes a step which caps the 3&#x02032; ends of the telomerase extension products prior to PCR amplification. The PCR amplification uses a reverse primer complementary to the unique capping sequence and thus preserves both the initial size and length distribution of the telomerase extension products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c35">35</xref>). Using this method, qualitative analysis of the products ladder indicated that the longest products generated by the &#x00394;1 and &#x00394;2 mutants were comparable to those generated by the wild-type enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>A, lanes 3, 4 and 6, respectively), consistent with the data obtained with the conventional TRAP assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f3">3</xref>).</p><p>A quantitative analysis of processivity was also carried out (as described in Materials and Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c35">35</xref>). The first and second visible repeat of a given ladder were chosen as representative of the short products and repeats 9 and 10 were chosen as the long products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>A, arrows). The data are summarised in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f5">5</xref>B, where <italic>P</italic><sub>i</sub> designates the processivity of telomerase at a particular repeat <italic>i</italic> of the ladder. The processivity values <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>9</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>10</sub> for the mutant enzymes &#x00394;1 and &#x00394;2 and wild-type recombinant telomerase were identical within experimental error (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>B). Taken together, these results further confirm that shortening of the alignment domain from the 3&#x02032; end by one (<sup>56</sup>C) or two (<sup>56</sup>CA<sup>55</sup>) residues does not alter the processivity of human telomerase.</p><p>PCR amplification of the telomerase products by the standard TRAP assay is restricted to detecting extension products that contain at least four telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c39">39</xref>). Therefore, a poorly processive enzyme activity cannot be precluded for mutants &#x00394;3&#x02013;&#x00394;5. In an attempt to detect low levels of poor processive activity for mutant enzymes &#x00394;3, &#x00394;4 and &#x00394;5, we have either used 10-fold more enzyme in the assay to enhance detection sensitivity (data not shown) or employed the modified TRAP capable of amplifying a primer extended by as few as two telomeric repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>A, lanes 8, 10 and 12, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c35">35</xref>). Neither attempt resulted in detectable level of telomerase product for &#x00394;3, &#x00394;4 and &#x00394;5 variants, thus reflecting a serious impairment of activity and&#x0002f;or processive synthesis for these mutant enzymes. In addition, wild-type and mutant telomerases (&#x00394;1&#x02013;&#x00394;5) were also assayed with alternative primers (TS-GGT and TS-GGG) identical in sequence to the original TS except that the terminal 3&#x02032; nucleotides dGTT were substituted by the trinucleotides dGGT and dGGG, respectively. These primers are designed to base pair with the elongation domain only, which remained unchanged, and thus normalise the first round synthesis in all mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c25">25</xref>). The levels and patterns of reconstituted catalytic activity observed were comparable to those described for the TS primer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f5">5</xref>), indicating that the effects of mutations are general to all three DNA substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>3&#x02032;-Terminal substitutions of residues in the alignment domain of human telomerase</title><p>It is possible that the deletion of residues from the alignment domain of hTR may inadvertently disrupt telomerase activity by possibly frame-shifting the RNA template with respect to the active site of telomerase protein. To rule out this possibility, we generated and studied a series of RNA variants in which residues in the alignment domain have been substituted from the 3&#x02032; end by analogy with the deletions. For the substitution mutants, purines were replaced by pyrimidines and pyrimidines by purines (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf575tb1">1</xref>). The activity of reconstituted telomerase mutants was measured as described previously. Substitution of residue <sup>56</sup>C by G (Sub1) decreased activity to 77 &#x000b1; 3&#x00025; (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf575tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f6">6</xref>, lane 6). Substitution of <sup>56</sup>CA<sup>55</sup> by GT (Sub2) resulted in 37 &#x000b1; 7&#x00025; activity compared to wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f6">6</xref>, lane 7). Further substitutions of the sequences <sup>56</sup>CAA<sup>54</sup> by GTT (Sub3), <sup>56</sup>CAAU<sup>53</sup> by GTTA (Sub4) and <sup>56</sup>CAAUC<sup>52</sup> by GTTAG (Sub5) in the alignment domain resulted in no telomerase activity detectable above background levels (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf575tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f6">6</xref>, lanes 8&#x02013;10). These results are identical, within experimental error, to those obtained for the corresponding deletion mutants and support the hypothesis that observed changes in activity result from shortening of the alignment sequence <italic>per se</italic> rather than non-specific effects due a change in register between the template and the active site of hTERT.</p><p>We also assayed the mutant enzymes Sub3, Sub4 and Sub5 with the modified version of the TRAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>A, lanes 9, 11 and 13, respectively). In good agreement with the deletion experiments, we found that the Sub3, Sub4 and Sub5 mutants did not generate any detectable level of products above background, further indicating that the trinucleotide sequence <sup>54</sup>AUC<sup>52</sup> is apparently absolutely critical and represents the minimum length requirement of the alignment domain of human telomerase for efficient extension. Qualitative analysis of the telomerase ladder generated by the mutants Sub1 and Sub2 confirmed that these mutants and wild-type telomerase generated identical product profiles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>A, lanes 3, 5 and 7). This was further supported by our quantitation data of processivity, whereby <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>9</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>10</sub> of both mutants Sub1 and Sub2 were identical within experimental error to wild-type telomerase, further demonstrating that the processivity of telomerase is not sensitive to modifications of the most 3&#x02032; residues <sup>56</sup>C and <sup>56</sup>CA<sup>55</sup> of the alignment domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Specific inhibition of human telomerase ribonucleoprotein formation</title><p>To preclude the possibility that changes in activity may result from a failure of mutant hTR to bind hTERT protein, we carried out a competition assay to determine the ability of the RNA variants to interact with hTERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c42">42</xref>). Specifically, we investigated whether the most drastically altered RNA variant &#x00394;5 could compete with wild-type hTR for the formation of the RNA&#x02013;hTERT complex, by testing the level of activity reconstituted in the absence and presence of competitor RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f7">7</xref>). Standard competition assays were performed with a fixed amount of total RNA (0.1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;&#x000b5;l lysate) in the presence of increasing amounts of the competitor RNA &#x00394;5 (1-, 10-, 20- and 50-fold molar excess). Both RNAs were added simultaneously to the RRL prior to hTERT translation and the reconstituted telomerase activity measured by TRAP as described above. Telomerase activity reconstituted in the presence of &#x00394;5 was significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating a specific competition with wild-type hTR for protein binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f7">7</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;6). In particular, telomerase reconstituted in the presence of a 20-fold molar excess of competitor &#x00394;5 was very weakly active relative to telomerase reconstituted with wild-type hTR alone at the corresponding concentration (0.005 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;&#x000b5;l lysate) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f7">7</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 8, respectively). The variant RNA &#x00394;4 was equally able to specifically compete with wild-type hTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f7">7</xref>, lanes 9 and 10), whilst human tRNA (20-fold molar excess) had no effect on the telomerase RNA&#x02013;protein complex formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f7">7</xref>, lane 11). These results indicate that the deletion of four or five residues from the alignment sequence <sup>56</sup>CAAUC<sup>52</sup> does not preclude the ability of the RNA mutants to associate with hTERT. Therefore, the observation that certain hTR variants do not support catalytic activity in RRL are unlikely to be simply due to the inability of the RNA to bind the protein component of human telomerase.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Telomerase shares significant structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c43">43</xref>) and mechanistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c44">44</xref>) traits with retroviral reverse transcriptases (RT) such as HIV-1 RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c45">45</xref>), but there are features that clearly distinguish it from conventional RTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c46">46</xref>). Most notably, telomerase carries an intrinsic RNA component which, in addition to structural functions, contains the template sequence that directs telomere repeat synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c40">40</xref>). The template region of human telomerase consists of an 11 nt sequence 3&#x02032;-<italic>CAAUC</italic>CCAAUC-5&#x02032; complementary to nearly two telomeric repeats d(GGTTAG). The template sequences of other vertebrates vary in length, ranging from 11 to 8 nt, suggesting that 8 nt maybe sufficient for telomerase function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c47">47</xref>). Of these eight residues, six form a universally conserved (100&#x00025; sequence identity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c26">26</xref>) elongation domain (3&#x02032;-CCAAUC-5&#x02032;) which codes for a single telomeric repeat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>A). The alignment domain, contiguous to the 3&#x02032; end of the elongation domain, consists of additional nucleotides complementary to the telomeric sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>A). Unlike the elongation domain, the alignment domain of telomerase is not completely conserved throughout vertebrates and varies in length from 2 nt (3&#x02032;-<italic>UC</italic>-5&#x02032;) for rodents to a maximum of 5 nt (3&#x02032;-<italic>CAAUC</italic>-5&#x02032;) for humans (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>A). This strongly suggests that not all nucleotides in the alignment domain of human telomerase are required for function.</p><p>Altering the sequence of the alignment domain of human telomerase at the first two positions from the 3&#x02032; end (<sup>56</sup>C and <sup>56</sup>CA<sup>55</sup>, respectively) influences some aspects of telomerase activity. Deletion of the first 3&#x02032; residue (<sup>56</sup>C) of the alignment domain marginally reduced overall activity to 84 &#x000b1; 8&#x00025; whilst deletion of the sequence <sup>56</sup>CA<sup>55</sup> (mutant &#x00394;2) had a more pronounced effect, but the decrease in overall activity was still of only &#x0223c;50&#x00025; (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf575tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f3">3</xref>). These observations demonstrate that the most 3&#x02032; terminal residues <sup>56</sup>C and <sup>55</sup>A of the alignment domain of human telomerase do contribute to the optimal function of telomerase but are not essential for catalytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Each mutant was assayed with three alternative primers differing just in their three most 3&#x02032; terminal nucleotides. Two of these primers (TS-GGT and TS-GGG) were designed to base pair only with the elongation domain of human telomerase, which remained unaltered for all mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c25">25</xref>). The initial primer recognition was therefore normalised during first round synthesis for all the mutants, which helps preclude changes in activity that would result purely from initiation. Comparable levels of activity and processivity profiles were generated with all three primers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f5">5</xref>), indicating that the variations in telomerase activity between the mutants reflect intrinsic biochemical properties of the core enzymes. The substitution mutants Sub1 and Sub2 show activities comparable to the corresponding deletions, which supports the hypothesis that the changes in activity relate to shortening of the alignment sequence, rather than a potential change in register between the RNA template and the catalytic core of the protein which might arise upon nucleotide deletion. This also indicates a tolerance in the hTR structure towards slight modifications in the region between the template and the upstream conserved pseudoknot structure (spanning nucleotides 57&#x02013;64). This is consistent with the fact that the length of this particular region is not conserved in vertebrate telomerase RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, deletion or substitution of the first 1 or 2 nt <sup>56</sup>C and <sup>55</sup>A of the alignment sequence did not alter the processivity of the enzyme as compared to wild-type telomerase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>). If repeat addition processivity is dependent on the re-alignment efficiency, one might have expected that a longer alignment domain, providing more base pairs, would favour repeat addition synthesis. The finding that processivity was insensitive to a loss of base-pairing potential from the first 2 nt, out of a total of 5 nt, of the alignment domain challenges this model. If DNA primers are re-aligned exclusively by base-pairing interaction during processive synthesis then loss of base pairing to both <sup>56</sup>C and <sup>55</sup>A would result in an estimated loss in free energy (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic>&#x000b0;) of &#x0002b;1.9 kcal&#x0002f;mol (at 37&#x000b0;C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c48">48</xref>). Our data do not support that having a 4 or 5 nt long alignment domain is beneficial for processive synthesis of human telomerase, but rather that the 3 nt sequence 3&#x02032;-<sup>54</sup>AUC<sup>52</sup>-5&#x02032; is sufficient for repeat addition with an efficiency comparable to wild-type telomerase. Non-base-pairing interactions between human telomerase and the DNA substrate may exist near to the alignment domain, as shown in yeast and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c50">50</xref>), cooperating with base pairing to position the 3&#x02032; end of the primer at the catalytic site. It is possible that such interactions could compensate for the difference in binding energy between the 3 and 5 bp hybrid duplex, thus allowing mutants &#x00394;1, &#x00394;2, Sub1 and Sub2 to display wild-type-like processivity.</p><p>Shortening of the alignment sequence beyond residue <sup>55</sup>A had marked qualitative and quantitative effects on catalytic activity. In particular, the specific deletion or substitution of the trinucleotide <sup>56</sup>CAA<sup>54</sup> completely abolished enzymatic activity, clearly indicating that the minimal length of the alignment domain required to sustain human telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> is three residues spanning nucleotides <sup>52</sup>C&#x02013;<sup>54</sup>A. Subsequently, mutants &#x00394;4, &#x00394;5, Sub4 and Sub5 were all judged inactive by both the conventional and modified TRAP assays. Despite the fact that none of the modified RNA residues were in a domain predicted to be involved in protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c51">51</xref>), we performed a competition assay to show that even the most significantly altered RNA variants, &#x00394;4 and &#x00394;5, bind specifically to telomerase protein with an affinity comparable to wild-type hTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f7">7</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;10). Therefore, it is very unlikely that the defects in reconstituting telomerase activity with some of the RNA mutants was due to the inability of these RNA variants to associate with hTERT. In addition, increasing the quantity of enzyme used in the assays by 10-fold still showed no activity, suggesting a drop in activity of &#x0003e;2 orders of magnitude for mutants &#x00394;4, &#x00394;5, Sub4 and Sub5. Activity loss was independent of the three DNA primers used as substrate for telomerase extension, suggesting that the effect cannot be simply due to initial primer recognition. The modified TRAP, capable of detecting as few as two repeats addition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f4">4</xref>B, lanes 8&#x02013;13), also failed to show activity. Taken together, the fact that an initiation problem during first round synthesis is unlikely and the absence of even two repeat addition products strongly suggests that human telomerase mutants with an alignment domain shorter than the trinucleotide sequence 3&#x02032;-<sup>54</sup>AUC<sup>52</sup>-5&#x02032; is unable to carry out post-first round synthesis. Studies on <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> have shown that shortening the alignment domain from 3 (wild-type) to 2 and 1 nt greatly impair multiple repeat synthesis while sustaining catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c31">31</xref>). Although the sequence of the <italic>T.thermophila</italic> telomerase alignment domain is not totally conserved with that of human telomerase, both enzymes are known to be normally very processive, suggesting that a 3 nt alignment domain may be a general minimum requirement of telomerases for processive synthesis. This is also consistent with the observation that most rodent telomerases, which have only a 2 nt alignment domain, are typically non-processive <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c29">29</xref>). The dinucleotide sequence 3&#x02032;-<sup>54</sup>UC<sup>52</sup>-5&#x02032; of the rodent telomerase alignment domain is the shortest known alignment sequence, which may be the minimum alignment domain for basic catalytic activity of telomerase.</p><p>The alignment domain and the anchor site are both important sites for primer interaction with the telomerase ribonucleoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c25">25</xref>). Interactions of the telomerase product with these binding sites are likely to determine whether re-alignment and further elongation or dissociation is most likely. Anchor site interactions may be especially important for telomerase function in ciliates, since the development of macronuclei and chromosome healing events frequently require the extension of DNA substrates whose 3&#x02032; termini are not complementary to the template sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c52">52</xref>). However, little is known about the relative contribution of the anchor site and alignment domain interactions with the primers for human telomerase. Our results suggest that at least 3 bp of the DNA substrate with the RNA template is required for efficient re-alignment and processive synthesis. These results imply that deletion of three or more residues from the alignment domain may destabilise the product DNA-alignment domain heteroduplex favouring product release from the enzyme. In light of our results, it would appear that for processivity control in human telomerase, the anchor site might only play a role secondary to the alignment domain. This is in good agreement with observations previously made that a strong interaction of human telomerase at the anchor site is insufficient to overcome a limited base-pairing interaction between the primer 3&#x02032; end and the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c25">25</xref>). By gradually deleting residues from the 3&#x02032; end of the DNA primer, Morin demonstrated that as few as two base-pairing interactions in the last 4 nt suffice for initiation and elongation by telomerase. While those primer modifications only affected first round synthesis (i.e. primer recognition), our study complements these findings and suggest that at least three base-pairing interactions are required for efficient synthesis in subsequent rounds of primer extension.</p><p>Detailed functional analysis of the template residues in telomerase have previously been limited largely to ciliates, including <italic>T.thermophila</italic> and <italic>Euplotes crassus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf575c53">53</xref>). This is the first study towards a detailed elucidation of the role of specific template residues in the function of human telomerase. Ideally, the recombinant human telomerase mutants described in this paper will be studied by a direct assay, for which there is no routine methodology yet established, owing to difficulties in expression and reconstitution. Consequently, we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that substitution or deletion in the alignment domain of human telomerase may affect catalytic activity in ways that do not manifest under the conditions of our assays. There also exists the possibility that certain residues in the alignment domain of human telomerase may contribute to enzyme catalytic activity in other ways besides base pairing, such as the structure of the catalytic pocket. Our results do indicate that the integrity in both length and sequence of the alignment domain of human telomerase contributes to optimal overall activity, but with only a minor contribution from the first two 3&#x02032; residues <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the basis of this study, we conclude that three residues (3&#x02032;-<sup>54</sup>AUC<sup>52</sup>-5&#x02032;) are the minimum for efficient processive repeat addition by human telomerase. Our results are consistent with the level of sequence conservation in the alignment domain of vertebrate telomerase RNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f3">3</xref>B), with the least conserved (34&#x00025;) residue of the 11 nt template region <sup>56</sup>C not being essential. The next two residues in the alignment domain, <sup>55</sup>A and <sup>54</sup>A, respectively, are both 90&#x00025; conserved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf575f2">2</xref>B). Interestingly, mutants with modification of the dinucleotide sequence <sup>56</sup>CA<sup>55</sup> show significant telomerase activity and high processivity, which supports the hypothesis that strongly conserved residue <sup>55</sup>A is actually not essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> activity. However, replacement of both <sup>55</sup>A and <sup>54</sup>A abolished telomerase activity (&#x00394;3 and Sub3), which is consistent with the conservation of both residues. Reasons for the presence of additional (&#x0003e;3) alignment domain residues of certain vertebrates, including human, are unclear. One possibility is that a more optimal structure in the RNA template for active site function results from the additional residues. Alternatively, there may exist an unknown <italic>in vivo</italic> function for these additional residues in certain organisms.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf575f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Telomeric DNA synthesis catalysed by human telomerase.
