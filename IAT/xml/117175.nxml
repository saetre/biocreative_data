We have targeted three polypurine sequences within the mouse <italic>myc</italic> mRNA with acridine-modified, clamp-forming antisense oligonucleotides (AS ODNs) in an effort to inhibit growth of murine melanoma cells. These ODNs are unique in that they hybridize to the target mRNA by both Watson&#x02013;Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bond interactions, forming a triple-stranded structure. At a concentration of 3 &#x000b5;M E1C, E2C and E3C inhibit B16-F0 proliferation by 76, 66 and 78&#x00025;, respectively. Both immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis corroborate a proportional reduction in c-Myc expression by all three ODNs. There were clear distinctions in the ability of these ODNs to inhibit tumor progression in C57BL&#x0002f;6 mice as a function of Myc expression. There was no synergy demonstrated between ODN E1C with cisplatin (DDP), which inhibited tumor growth by 77&#x00025; alone and 82&#x00025; in combination. Although E2C inhibited growth by 54&#x00025;, its effect was decreased to 32&#x00025; with DDP, when compared with controls. E3C, on the other hand, demonstrated a synergistic effect with DDP, inhibiting growth by 72&#x00025; in combination, but only by 1&#x00025; as a single agent. Immunofluorescence analysis of tumors for each group revealed a concomitant reduction in c-Myc expression in tumors from mice treated with the most active clamp ODN alone (E1C) or clamp ODN &#x0002b; DDP (E1C&#x0002f;E3C &#x0002b; DDP). Western blot analysis confirmed this decrease in target protein expression. Our results document the growth-inhibitory activity of two <italic>myc</italic>-targeting antisense clamp ODNs; E1C, which has activity as a single agent, and E3C, which has <italic>in vivo</italic> synergy with DDP pretreatment. These data confirm the antiproliferative effects of these novel ODNs and document an interesting synergy with the chemotherapeutic agent DDP.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many studies have documented c-<italic>myc</italic> overexpression in a variety of cancer cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c5">5</xref>), both at the mRNA and protein levels. Almost all of these studies found a correlation between the protein expression level and metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c5">5</xref>). Overexpression of the c-<italic>myc</italic> protooncogene has been thought to act as a causal factor in the aberrant proliferation of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c7">7</xref>). In addition to roles governing cellular growth and differentiation, <italic>myc</italic> also contributes to the signal transduction cascades that regulate apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c8">8</xref>). It is classified as an &#x02018;immediate early response&#x02019; gene, because it functions in several aspects of cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c8">8</xref>). Because of the large body of data implicating c-<italic>myc</italic> in abnormal cancer cell growth, we sought to utilize <italic>myc</italic> as a target in our efforts to revert the malignant melanoma phenotype using modified antisense oligonucleotides (AS ODNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c9">9</xref>).</p><p>In part because of positive results in animal models, efforts continue to explore the therapeutic potential of AS ODNs in treating cancers, inflammatory diseases and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c13">13</xref>). A number of these agents have entered clinical trials for antineoplastic and anti-HIV therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c14">14</xref>). Indeed, over the past 10 years, AS ODNs have been used in a wide variety of tissue culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c19">19</xref>). Modified AS analogs, in particular phophorothioates (PS), the most frequently studied, in which one of the non-bridging oxygen atoms is substituted by a sulfur atom in the phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c19">19</xref>), have shown the most promise at inhibiting gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c14">14</xref>). We utilized PS analogs in this study because they also have been demonstrated to possess increased serum stability and wide tissue distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c21">21</xref>). Our goal was to mimic human melanoma in a mouse model, so we used an ODN prototype that had been studied extensively.</p><p>AS-mediated inhibition of gene expression depends on the ability of ODNs to specifically interact with target mRNAs by Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c22">22</xref>). The resulting DNA&#x02013;mRNA hybrid structure serves as a cleavage substrate for RNase H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c23">23</xref>). We have added an additional ODN fragment in our AS design. This modification enables ODNs to target the mRNA by triplex-like interactions giving rise to an enhanced sequence-specific mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c24">24</xref>). Traditionally, triplex-forming ODNs have been designed to inhibit gene expression at the level of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c25">25</xref>). Unfortunately, their success has been hampered by the inaccessibility of target sequences within the chromatin structure of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c26">26</xref>). We have attempted to use this means of inhibiting gene expression at the translational level in which the target is single-stranded and more easily accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c27">27</xref>). We also chose this approach because it is known that when targeting certain sequences, normal ODNs do not hybridize with adequate affinity to generate the desired biological effect of blocking the activity of ribosomes or polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c26">26</xref>). Several groups have studied triplex formation with single-stranded purine strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c33">33</xref>). We have used this approach to target three different polypurine sequences in the second and third exons of the mouse c-<italic>myc</italic> primary transcript with &#x02018;clamp-forming&#x02019; polypyrimidine AS ODNs. The exon 2 target is an 11 bp sequence located at &#x0002b;2617&#x02013;2627 from the translation initiation start site. The two exon 3 targets are much closer to the AUG codon, at &#x0002b;34&#x02013;43 (target sequence of clamp ODN E3C) and &#x0002b;60&#x02013;69 (target sequence of clamp ODN E1C). The first exon 3 target is of particular interest because it has identical sequence homology with the human c-<italic>myc</italic> mRNA. An important point is that triple helical structures formed between single-stranded purine RNA targets and pyrimidine clamp or circular ODNs are stable at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c33">33</xref>). We also chose clamp ODNs as opposed to standard Watson&#x02013;Crick AS ODNs because of their higher binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c23">23</xref>).</p><p>A third modification of the ODNs used in these experiments was covalent conjugation of an intercalating acridine (Acr) moiety to the 5&#x02032; end, which increases the irreversibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c23">23</xref>) of the interaction, augments protection against exonuclease degradation and adds binding energy to better stabilize the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c34">34</xref>). Because we were studying the efficacy of these ODNs in a melanoma system, it was also rational to test for possible synergy using a &#x02018;standard&#x02019; chemotherapy drug. Cisplatin (DDP) is used clinically as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat malignant melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c35">35</xref>) and was chosen for our study based on previous work documenting a promising cooperation between antisense agents and DDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c38">38</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have documented successful inhibition of tumor cell growth after using AS ODNs targeting c-<italic>myc</italic>, in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c41">41</xref>). Here, we report positive results, using clamp-forming AS ODNs, in combination with cisplatin, targeted to three polypurine sequences within the mouse c-<italic>myc</italic> mRNA in a cell culture and whole mouse model system. After treatment with either ODN alone (3 &#x000b5;M) or following treatment with DDP (10 &#x000b5;M), B16-F0 mouse melanoma cellular growth was inhibited by 66&#x02013;78&#x00025; with either ODN alone. In the animals, only ODN E1C significantly slowed tumor progression alone, while only E3C worked synergistically with DDP to inhibit growth. Immunofluorescent and western blot detection of Myc demonstrated a reduction in expression after both cell culture and tissue administration. Further analysis, by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) detection, confirmed an increased incidence of apoptosis in tumors treated with active ODNs compared with those whose treatments had little or no effect on growth. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first report of using clamp-forming AS ODNs to target coding region sequences in the murine c-<italic>myc</italic> transcript. We have successfully demonstrated inhibition of cellular and tumor growth with a concomitant reduction in target protein, by a proposed apoptotic mechanism, in a syngeneic mouse model system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>B16-F0 is an established murine melanoma cell line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-6322&#x0005f;FL).

Acr-modified clamp ODNs E2C and E3C target the same 11 bp exon 2 and 10 bp exon 3 sequences, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c9">9</xref>).</p><sec><title>Acr-modified clamp ODN effects on B16-F0 proliferation</title><p>In order to evaluate the ability of these Acr-modified clamp ODNs to inhibit cellular proliferation, B16-F0 cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates (day 1) and incubated for 48 h at 37&#x000b0;C. On days 3, 6 and 9 cells were treated with 3 &#x000b5;M ODN (E1C, E2C or E3C) alone in supplemented DMEM (Gibco BRL). In other experiments, B16-F0 cells were treated for 1 h with 10 &#x000b5;M DDP then exposed to ODN (3 &#x000b5;M E1C, E2C or E3C). On day 11, cell viability was determined by the MTT assay.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f2">2</xref> demonstrates that E1C, E2C and E3C alone at a concentration of 3 &#x000b5;M inhibited cellular proliferation by 76, 66 and 78&#x00025;, respectively. When the cells were pretreated with DDP, neither E1C nor E3C, both at 79&#x00025;, demonstrated any synergistic effect on proliferation. On the other hand, E2C, the only ODN which targets exon 2, displayed increased inhibitory activity at 92&#x00025; when used in combination with DDP. The growth of cells treated with DDP alone was inhibited &#x0003c;20&#x00025; compared with the non-treated control cells, while the growth of cells treated with the control clamp ODN (SCR) was inhibited by only 11&#x02013;15&#x00025; in the absence or presence of DDP.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence detection of c-Myc after B16-F0 ODN treatment</title><p>To determine whether the Acr-modified clamp ODNs reduce the expression of cellular c-Myc protein, we used a c-Myc murine monoclonal primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an FITC-conjugated secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes) in an immunofluorescence analysis. B16-F0 cells were seeded at a density of 10<sup>2</sup> cells&#x0002f;well in 48-well plates (day 1), in duplicate, and treated according to the previously outlined procedure for the MTT assay, with one modification. On day 9 of the experiment, 1 h after the third treatment, cells were fixed with cold 4&#x00025; PFA for 20 min on ice and stained using a mouse-specific c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).</p><p>The expression of c-Myc is easily detected by bright green nuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic staining in untreated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f3">3</xref>b). Treatment with either of the active clamp ODNs alone at 3 &#x000b5;M moderately reduced this expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f3">3</xref>d, f and h), while a similar reduction occured with SCR treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f3">3</xref>j). Treatment with 10 &#x000b5;M DDP alone had no inhibitory effect on Myc expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f3">3</xref>c). However, when cells were treated with ODN in combination with DDP there was a significant reduction in c-Myc expression. Unlike the results from the proliferation experiment, there is clear synergy of DDP with E1C and E3C in their effect on expression of the target oncogene. In the cells treated with both agents, Myc staining is no longer detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f3">3</xref>e and i). E2C plus DDP treatment also synergistically inhibited c-Myc, by almost 90&#x00025; compared with the controls. Finally, there was no enhanced reduction of Myc staining in the cells treated with DDP and SCR, the control ODN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f3">3</xref>k). There was also no staining for c-Myc detected in the control cells serving as a background for immunostaining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f3">3</xref>a). At this point, we see synergy of DDP with the two exon 3-targeting clamp ODNs (E1C and E3C) in inhibiting c-Myc expression, while there does not appear to be synergism of growth inhibition at the concentrations tested. In contrast, E2C demonstrates high dependence on DDP to exert significant inhibition of either proliferation or <italic>myc</italic> expression. This suggests that the ODN may be less effective at inhibiting translation of the target mRNA or that the exon 2 sequence is not as important to biological activity as was previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c9">9</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis of cellular c-Myc expression after ODN treatment</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f4">4</xref> is a western analysis showing the degree to which the active Acr-modified clamp ODNs inhibit Myc expression, either alone or in combination with DDP. Cells were treated according to the same protocol used for immunofluorescence detection and they were harvested 60 min after the last treatment. Western blot analysis was performed, as described in Materials and Methods, using the c-Myc antibody, as well as a monoclonal antibody for &#x003b2;-actin to serve as an internal control. Treatment with active clamp ODNs E1C, E2C and E3C alone resulted in 45, 69 and 60&#x00025; reductions in Myc expression, respectively, while their treatment combined with DDP decreased cellular c-Myc by 66, 68 and 50&#x00025;, respectively, compared with the non-treated or DDP alone-treated controls. Thus, there again appears to be no synergistic benefit of treating with DDP prior to that of E1C or E3C, also shown by MTT assay. In contrast, the synergy that was demonstrated previously between the drug and E2C is not mimicked by western analysis, at the <italic>in vitro</italic> level. There was no significant change in Myc expression after treatment with SCR alone (23&#x00025;) or combined with DDP, and &#x003b2;-actin expression was not affected, supporting the argument that these antisense clamp ODNs act by specifically targeting the primary c-<italic>myc</italic> oncogene transcript.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> antitumor efficacy of Acr-modified clamp ODNs with DDP</title><p>The ability of Acr-modified clamp ODNs to inhibit B16-F0 tumor growth was evaluated in weanling age C57BL&#x0002f;6 mice (nine&#x000a0;per group, except E2C, with five per group). On day 1 of each study, each mouse was injected with 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> B16-F0 mouse melanoma cells in sterile 1&#x000d7; PBS. Prior to tumor challenge with each Acr-modified clamp ODN alone or in combination with DDP, each mouse was observed for a visible, palpable tumor mass. On days 4, 7 and 10 all tumor-bearing mice, except those in the control (untreated) group, received an intra-tumoral ODN injection at 3.3 mg&#x0002f;kg&#x0002f;day. The animals in the&#x000a0;combination groups were treated by i.p. injection with a 3.3&#x000a0;mg&#x0002f;kg&#x0002f;day dose of DDP, 30 min before ODN administration. At the end of the 10 day regimen, each mouse had received a total dose of 10 mg&#x0002f;kg of either ODN (E1C, E2C, E3C or SCR) alone or in combination with a total dose of 10 mg&#x0002f;kg DDP. Twenty-four hours later (day 11), the single agent and the combined treatment responses were evaluated as a function of average tumor weight, c-Myc expression and apoptosis induction.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f5">5</xref> displays a graphical representation of tumors excised from mice in this experiment. Compared with the untreated control group (CTL), only treatment with E1C alone caused a marked decrease in tumor growth, an average of 77&#x00025; inhibition (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf317tb1">1</xref>). Combined with DDP pretreatment, it inhibited growth by an average of 82&#x00025;. In contrast, when comparing the ODN dose alone versus the ODN plus drug, only E3C demonstrated a synergistic advantage for inhibiting growth; an average of 71&#x00025; better with DDP than alone (1&#x00025;). The <italic>in vivo</italic> effectiveness of E2C treatment was less than expected based on its <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative activity. Treatment with E2C alone resulted in moderate inhibition of growth at 54&#x00025;, but decreased to only 32&#x00025; with DDP, clearly not anticipated considering the level of antiproliferative activity of these two agents in cell culture. The averaged results from this experiment reiterate the ability of E1C to exert its inhibitory effects in the presence or absence of drug and support the conclusion that E3C plus DDP work better together than either agent alone. These data are in agreement with other findings that c-<italic>myc</italic> AS ODNs increase melanoma sensitivity to DDP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c42">42</xref>).</p><p>Some toxicity was observed in mice treated with E3C alone, DDP alone and E1C &#x0002b; DDP. The overall death rate was 11&#x00025;, because one mouse died in each of these three treatment groups. The deaths in both groups treated with DDP are believed to be associated with well-documented drug toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c42">42</xref>), following the second (one mouse in DDP group) or third (one mouse in E1C &#x0002b; DDP group) drug administrations and prior to ODN treatment. Death of the mouse in the E3C group after the full three treatments is believed to be tumor related, due to evidence of metastatic disease following animal necropsy. On average, no growth inhibitory effects were found after treatment with DDP alone, SCR or SCR &#x0002b; DDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f5">5</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf317tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>The percentages of tumor growth inhibition are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf317tb1">1</xref>. Our data indicate that the most effective therapeutic doses were treatment with Acr-modified clamp ODN E1C alone or in combination with DDP and E3C treatment with DDP, based on the concentrations tested. On day 11, one animal per group was perfused with 4&#x00025; PFA, prior to tumor excision, to evaluate the expression of c-Myc protein and the level of apoptosis in each tumor section.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> immunofluorescence detection of c-Myc after ODN and DDP treatment</title><p>Tumors removed from perfused animals were stained for c-Myc expression as outlined in Materials and Methods. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>, the sections stained with a rabbit polyclonal (N-262) anti-c-Myc antibody show distinct nuclear (brighter) versus cytoplasmic detection of Myc, especially in all the control tumors, CTL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>a), DDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>b), SCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>c) and SCR &#x0002b; DDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>d). As predicted by the <italic>in vitro</italic> reduction in Myc after treatment with E1C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>e) or combined with DDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>f), there is a drastically lower level of <italic>myc</italic> protein in these tumors. The same is true for the tumors treated with E3C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>i) or E3C &#x0002b; DDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>j). However, E1C alone appears to be more effective at inhibiting tumor c-Myc expression compared with a combination of this ODN and DDP, while the E3C&#x02013;DDP joint treatment is most effective. Once more, immunofluorescence results are reproduced in the tumors treated with E2C based on the cellular efficacy of E2C to reduce Myc expression alone or with DDP pretreatment; where alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>g) there is no effect, but the addition of DDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref>h) leads to a 50&#x00025; reduction compared with the controls. At this point the data suggest that the ability to generate sustained growth inhibition of this melanoma is definitely connected to the expression level of the c-<italic>myc</italic> oncogene. After these positive results, it was necessary to corroborate the data with a more quantitative assay.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> western blot analysis of c-Myc expression after ODN and DDP treatment</title><p>In order to confirm the decrease in Myc expression observed with immunohistochemistry in tumors treated with the antiproliferative ODNs, protein extracts were prepared as previously outlined in Materials and Methods. After being resolved by 8.5&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE and transferred to PDVF membrane, western blot analysis was performed using the same Myc (N-262) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used for immunofluorescence detection. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f7">7</xref> demonstrates a relative decrease in the expressed 67 kDa protein after E1C treatment, by &#x0003e;90&#x00025; alone and by 80&#x00025; with DDP pretreatment. The expression of Myc after either E2C treatment alone (50&#x00025;) or combined with DDP (54&#x00025;) nearly mimics the results seen in both the <italic>in vitro</italic> western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f4">4</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> immunofluorescence detection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f6">6</xref> and data not shown). It is now more clear that the reduced tumor efficacy of this ODN is a consequence of its inability to target the <italic>myc</italic> mRNA as effectively as the other two Acr-modified clamp ODNs. E3C treatment alone was also unable to reduce tumor Myc expression, but the E3C &#x0002b; DDP regimen resulted in &#x0223c;95&#x00025; inhibition. No changes in tissue Myc expression were observed after DDP, SCR or SCR &#x0002b; DDP treatment and there were also no changes in &#x003b1;-actin expression. We have concluded that the inability of E2C to significantly inhibit tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> is related to its poor activity as an antisense molecule against the c-<italic>myc</italic> message. On the other hand, we also suggest that the growth inhibitory efficacy of E1C and E3C with DDP are based on their ability to inhibit c-Myc expression. The exact mechanism by which DDP is implementing synergistic effects with the E3C clamp ODN is still not clear. More than likely, it is increasing the induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c42">42</xref>), which is also a consequence of <italic>myc</italic> down-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c8">8</xref>) and generated by the AS clamp ODN. It is also feasible to propose that E1C alone reduces Myc enough to irreversibly commit cells to undergo death.</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis evaluation of Acr-modified clamp ODN-treated tumors by TUNEL and PCNA western blot analysis</title><p>To verify whether or not there was an increase in apoptotic events in tumors treated with E1C and E3C alone or combined with DDP, we first performed the TUNEL assay using a Fluorescein <italic>In&#x000a0;Situ</italic> Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche). The slides containing cryosectioned tumor specimens were assayed according to the standard protocol, outlined in Materials and Methods. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref> confirms that the increased antiproliferative activity of E1C in cultured B16-F0 cells and tumors is related to an increased induction of apoptosis. The level of apoptotic positivity in the tumors treated with E1C alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>e) is pronounced to the same extent as that in the tumors treated with both ODN and drug (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>f). Interestingly, induction of apoptosis by E2C and E3C correlates with <italic>in vivo</italic> activity; where E2C treatment alone induced some apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>g) and inhibited tumor growth by 54&#x00025; (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f5">5</xref>), when combined with DDP, antiproliferative activity as well as apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>h) both decreased in what appears to be an antagonistic manner. E3C treatment alone did not significantly affect tumor growth (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f5">5</xref>) or activate the programmed death pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>i), whereas following DDP treatment, the synergy is clearly activating apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>j) to kill the tumor cells with &#x0003e;70&#x00025; efficiency (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf317tb1">1</xref>). Although there is some detection of apoptosis in the CTL (untreated) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>a) and DDP-treated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>b) controls, it is not like the distinct nuclear staining indicative of DNA fragmentation, characteristic in this assay, as clearly seen in the tumor sections treated with E1C or E3C &#x0002b; DDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>e, f and j). Treatments with SCR or SCR &#x0002b; DDP demonstrated no induction of apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>c and d).</p><p>To confirm the levels of apoptosis observed by TUNEL staining, western blot detection for PCNA was conducted. We used a 1:1500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal PCNA FL-261 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to establish whether the apoptotic program was possibly being driven by G<sub>1</sub> or S phase arrest, as a result of decreased c-Myc expression and DDP-generated DNA damage. The lower panel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f7">7</xref> shows a reduced level of PCNA expression in the tumor lysates corresponding to the same tumor sections with increased apoptotic signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>). Specifically, PCNA is reduced in both E1C- and E1C &#x0002b; DDP-treated tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f7">7</xref>), while TUNEL staining is increased in both of these tumor sections as well (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>e and f). Similarly, treatment with E3C &#x0002b; DDP also reduces PCNA with increased TUNEL detection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf317f8">8</xref>j). As was the case with TUNEL staining, no other ODN or ODN plus drug treatment significantly affected PCNA expression (either E2C treatment &#x0003e;40&#x00025;; data not shown). It is important to note that the levels of PCNA closely correlate with the expression profile of c-Myc in these tumors, as well as the antiproliferative activity of each treatment. Taken together, these data strengthen the conclusion that these modified AS clamp ODNs can inhibit murine melanoma growth and induce apoptosis, either alone (E1C) or more effectively when combined with DDP (E3C).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The ability of AS ODNs to inhibit the expression of oncogenes such as <italic>bcl</italic>-2, <italic>bcr</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>abl</italic>, c-<italic>myb</italic>, c-<italic>myc</italic> and <italic>ras</italic> in a variety of tumors has been repeatedly demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c44">44</xref>). Despite the considerable potential of this approach, major problems of uptake and stability must be addressed. Multiple ODN analogs have been designed to resist nuclease degradation. Currently, one PS AS ODN, Vitravene (Isis Pharmaceuticals), is an approved drug for the treatment of CMV-induced retinitis in AIDs patients, while several others are in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c45">45</xref>). Obvious key antisense targets should be cell cycle genes regulating growth, differentiation and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c46">46</xref>).</p><p>The dysregulation of c-<italic>myc</italic> and mutation of the <italic>ras</italic> gene family members have been the focus of many studies. With one or both commonly found in nearly all human tumors, these two genes clearly cooperate in malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c47">47</xref>). In melanoma, c-Myc overexpression has been associated with poor outcome and decreased disease-free interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c48">48</xref>). c-<italic>myc</italic> is therefore important to study in this tumor type. Also, two recent studies have suggested that activated N-<italic>ras</italic>, which is expressed in 12&#x02013;15&#x00025; of all melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c16">16</xref>), significantly contributes to chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c42">42</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with our findings, a majority of previous studies using AS ODNs targeted to c-<italic>myc</italic> or other oncogenes in combination with DDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c49">49</xref>) also demonstrated an increased induction of apoptosis at various stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c42">42</xref>). Unfortunately, in spite of the success in these animal studies, which basically all focused on reversing the dysregulated actions of one oncogene or another, eventually all test subjects died of their ensuing disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c42">42</xref>). The strategy of targeting major genetic contributors simultaneously with chemotherapeutic agents already proven to have some efficacy could prove deadly for cancers and other diseases.</p><p>In terms of specifically inhibiting gene expression by the AS method, clamp ODNs have an advantage in tested systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c23">23</xref>). Because triplex formation is highly sequence sensitive and any mismatch in the Hoogsteen fragment can prevent complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c50">50</xref>), this design should be considered along with other topological modifications, such as backbone analogs and end conjugates. It might be expected that triplex formation on single-stranded targets will more effectively inhibit gene expression than is the case with duplexes formed with normal AS ODNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf317c24">24</xref>). Previous work in our laboratory, using two of the clamp ODNs presented here (E2C and E3C), but substituted with a 5&#x02032; psoralen moiety, did not inhibit tumor growth (D.A.Steward and D.M.Miller, unpublished results). Based on those results we have demonstrated that Acr and possibly other naturally reactive conjugates, like chlorambucil, may be more effective than psoralen as end-conjugates for these ODNs.</p><p>We report here the identification of three sequences within the coding region of the mouse c-<italic>myc</italic> mRNA and have demonstrated that targeting two of them results in biologically significant inhibition of mouse melanoma proliferation. The reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of E2C may be attributed to the fact that the exon 2 target sequence is more than 75 bases downstream of the translation initiation start site. Thus, while clamp ODNs increase the spectrum of available AS targets, from mRNA regulatory regions to include the coding regions, there may be a limit to how far within the coding sequences the target can be and still remain relevant. Our observed effects reiterate that targeting c-<italic>myc</italic> with appropriately modified AS ODNs also contributes to DDP efficacy. Again, in this system the dominant mechanism of action appears to be activation of the apoptotic program. Considering the PCNA data, no definitive judgment can be made at this time using only the PCNA expression profile as to whether treatment with the ODNs alone or combined with cisplatin induces apoptosis after a G<sub>1</sub> or S phase arrest, primarily because PCNA is expressed during both of these phases, and our main goal in evaluating PCNA expression was to better confirm the levels of apoptosis observed in the TUNEL assay. To determine whether the pre-apoptotic cells arrest in G<sub>1</sub> versus S phase will require further analysis; for example, p53 and Ki67 antigen evaluation, in which an increase in p53 and decrease in Ki67 expression would suggest G<sub>1</sub> arrest, or monitoring Cdk2, whereby a decrease in activity accompanied by an increase in p21 expression would favor S&#x000a0;phase arrest. Although the exact mechanism through which apoptosis is being driven after clamp ODN treatment is yet to be elucidated, based on other ODN studies in our laboratory we propose that the cells are arresting in S phase prior to the activation of the death program.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf317f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> c-<italic>myc</italic> transcript target sequences and clamp ODNs.

Cells treated with DDP (<bold>c</bold>) alone, SCR (j) or SCR &#x0002b; DDP (k) show immunoreactivity consistent with the untreated control cells (b). In contrast, only treatment with E1C (e), E2C (g) or E3C (i) after DDP administration exhibit a drastic reduction in cellular Myc staining.

The blot was exposed to ECL reagents (Amersham) for c-Myc and actin protein detection. The lanes are labeled with the treatments (i.e. lane 1, CTL, is the untreated control for B16-F0 cellular c-Myc expression). E1C treatment reduced Myc protein expression by 45&#x00025; alone and by 66&#x00025; with DDP. E2C treatment resulted in 68 and 69&#x00025; reductions in Myc expression, alone and combined with drug. Cells treated with E3C alone or combined with drug reduced expression by 60 and 50&#x00025;, respectively.
