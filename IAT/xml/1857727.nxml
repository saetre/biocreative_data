The association between increased BMI and homozygosity for the minor allele was first observed in data from a genome-wide association scan of 86,604 SNPs in 923 related individuals from the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort. The association was reproduced in four additional cohorts, but was not seen in a fifth cohort. To further assess the general reproducibility of this association, we genotyped rs7566605 in nine large cohorts from eight populations across multiple ethnicities (total <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 16,969). We tested this variant for association with BMI in each sample under a recessive model using family-based, population-based, and case-control designs. We observed a significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) association in five cohorts but saw no association in three other cohorts. There was variability in the strength of association evidence across examination cycles in longitudinal data from unrelated individuals in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. A combined analysis revealed significant independent validation of this association in both unrelated (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.046) and family-based (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.004) samples. The estimated risk conferred by this allele is small, and could easily be masked by small sample size, population stratification, or other confounders. These validation studies suggest that the original association is less likely to be spurious, but the failure to observe an association in every data set suggests that the effect of SNP rs7566605 on BMI may be heterogeneous across population samples.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Obesity is an epidemic in the United States of America and developing world, portending an epidemic of related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. While diet and lifestyle contribute to obesity, half of the population variation in body mass index, a common measure of obesity, is determined by inherited factors. Many studies have reported that common sequence variants in genes are associated with an increased risk for obesity, yet most of these are not reproducible in other study cohorts, suggesting that some are false. Recently, Herbert et al. reported a slightly increased risk of obesity for people carrying two copies of the minor allele at a common variant near <italic>INSIG2</italic>. We present our attempts to further evaluate this potential association with obesity in additional populations. We find evidence of increased risk of obesity for people carrying two copies of the minor allele in five out of nine cohorts tested, using both family- and population-based testing. We indicate possible reasons for the varied results, with the hope of encouraging a combined analysis across study cohorts to more precisely define the effect of this <italic>INSIG2</italic> gene variant.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lyon HN, Emilsson V, Hinney A, Heid IM, Lasky-Su J, et al.

Thus, BMI is a readily accessible trait that can be used to screen for genetic variants that increase an individual's risk for obesity and its complications. There have been more than one hundred publications reporting association between common genetic variants and BMI, but few of the associations have been reproducible in multiple populations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Genotyping of variants has increased exponentially in scale over the past few years, and much more comprehensive screens of common genetic variation for association with obesity are now possible. The poor rate of reproducible findings in association studies in general and obesity in particular are likely due to a combination of false-positive results, underpowered attempts to reproduce associations with modest effects, systematic bias due to technical artifacts or population stratification, and perhaps true heterogeneity in effect across populations due to differences in genetic or environmental modifiers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

The SNP was genotyped in five additional cohorts, and the association was observed again in four of these, including population-based studies, case-control samples, and family-based cohorts. However, no significant association was found in a fifth cohort (the Nurses Health Study &#x0005b;NHS&#x0005d;), where a slight trend in the opposite direction was seen. Approximately 10&#x00025; of individuals were homozygous for the minor allele (C/C), and in a meta-analysis of the case-control samples (including the NHS cohort and excluding the FHS discovery cohort), these individuals had a 22&#x00025; increased risk of obesity (defined as BMI &#x02265; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). In the NHS cohort alone, the 95&#x00025; confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio (OR) for obesity was 0.58&#x02013;1.13. Subsequently, two further groups reported no evidence of association in large cohorts, and a third found association only for people on the overweight end of their population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We considered several possible explanations for observing an association in four cohorts but not in the fifth. The failure to observe association in the NHS sample could be due to more modest effects in this cohort and therefore inadequate sample size, population stratification, ascertainment bias, other unmeasured confounders, or any combination of these. It is also possible that evidence in the four cohorts was falsely positive, for any of a combination of reasons that could include hidden population substructure, technical artifacts, or statistical fluctuations causing false positives. However, because of the consistency across multiple cohorts, including studies with family-based design, we felt that these explanations were less likely. Finally, it is also possible that the association is heterogeneous across populations, either due to differences in ascertainment, or differences in genetic or environmental modifiers. Of these possibilities, it is most critical to assess first whether the original associations were spurious, so as to avoid further efforts expended on a false finding. Our primary objective was therefore to test additional large populations to evaluate further the validity and generalizability of this association. By studying these additional populations, including a sample with longitudinal data, we hoped to better assess the strength and consistency of the association between increased BMI and the risk genotype at rs7566605, and perhaps generate hypotheses about any inconsistencies in this association.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Descriptions of the cohorts used in this study are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030061-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030061-st001">Table S1</xref>, and in the Methods.

Association tests in the FHS cohort between the C/C genotype and obesity showed some apparent variability, achieving significance in some but not all of the six exams, with <italic>p</italic> values ranging from 0.003&#x02013;0.51(<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030061-t002">Table 2</xref>); correcting the best <italic>p</italic> value for having tested six exams suggests that the totality of these findings are consistent with a replication (corrected <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003d; 0.018).

The association is detectable in diverse cohorts, in children as well as in adults, and in both family-based and population-based samples. The association is not likely to be due to stratification because it was seen in family-based samples such as Costa Rica and CAMP, which are immune to stratification, and because the original publication also described associations in family-based testing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The effect of ascertainment on these analyses could potentially provide confounding of the association in four of these studies. Because index children in family-based studies in CAMP and Costa Rica were ascertained on the basis of asthma, a spurious association between SNP rs7566605 and BMI could be found if the SNP of interest was directly associated with asthma. However, none of the other cohorts were ascertained in this manner, lessening concerns about this source of bias as a potential cause of false-positive associations. In addition, the Scandinavian sample was ascertained as control subjects for a diabetes case control study (similar to the NHS in the original report). A further bias could potentially have been introduced by the selection of non-obese people in the Essen cohort who have a younger mean age than the obese people from this cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030061-t001">Table 1</xref>). The lean controls (mean BMI &#x0003d; 18.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) are less likely to be obese later in life, but a small portion of them could be misclassified as non-obese, which would tend to bias the estimate toward the null. Of note, the combined analysis remains significant even if we include this study (unpublished data).</p><p>The longitudinal nature of the FHS data may provide a clue to a possible cause for inconsistency in the association between SNP rs7566605 and obesity. In this cohort, a stronger effect on BMI was seen in the data from the first three exams than in the last three exams. The individuals at each exam are largely overlapping, making confounders less likely to explain a positive association in the early exam data and a lack of association in later data. Assuming that the association in this cohort is not a false positive due to statistical fluctuation, then the passage of time is the most likely explanation for the diminution of the association in this cohort. The decreasing evidence of association in theory could be due to an interaction with age, namely decreasing effect size with increasing age. Alternatively, a change in the environment could have diminished the strength of the association over time; this would be, in theory, consistent with a well documented &#x0201c;secular trend&#x0201d; of increased obesity over the relevant time period &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. A preliminary and <italic>post hoc</italic> examination of the FHS data suggests that age may play an important role in modifying the strength of the association (unpublished data). This hypothesis would also be consistent with stronger effects in controls matched for early-onset disease (such as asthma) than in controls matched for later-onset diseases (such as diabetes). Finally, an additional <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the KORA S3 data suggests a stronger association in the most severely obese individuals (OR for BMI &#x02265; 38 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was 1.78, 95&#x00025; CI, &#x0003d; 0.99&#x02013;3.21, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.054), who perhaps became obese at an earlier age. Although these hypotheses are speculative at this time, they and other possibilities could and should be tested by a formal meta-analysis of our data, recent studies showing no association &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030061-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, and additional data that are likely to emerge. We (I.M.H. and colleagues) are in the process of organizing a meta-analysis to reexamine the <italic>INSIG2</italic> association in light of these hypotheses to better understand the relationship of this gene to obesity in the population.</p><p>In summary, the association of SNP rs7566605 with higher BMI is found in diverse populations. The number of studies in which a nominal association has been observed (five out of the nine cohorts reported here) appears more frequently than expected by chance. However, a more precise assessment of this apparent excess of associations will depend on the availability of a complete set of studies of this polymorphism. Large sample sizes were required to observe the association, but even some large samples have not demonstrated an association with this allele, possibly due to modification by age or other issues related to ascertainment. A combined analysis of both positive and negative studies presented here suggests that the association is valid but also suggests the possibility of heterogeneity across populations. Additional data, both positive and negative, ideally from large samples with good information regarding potential confounders and in a format suitable for meta-analysis, would be required to confirm the existence of heterogeneity and to further refine the estimate of the effect of this SNP on BMI in different populations. However, the evidence to date suggests that this variant has a detectable influence on BMI in a diverse range of populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Iceland cohort.</title><p>DNA samples were obtained from a large group of 5,187 Icelanders.
