The aim of this study is to provide a large-scale data driven analysis of HIV-1 coreceptor usage with respect to the V3 loop evolution and to characterize CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viral phenotypes previously studied in small- and medium-scale settings. We use different sequence similarity measures, phylogenetic and clustering methods in order to analyze the distribution in sequence space of roughly 1000 V3 loop sequences and their tropism phenotypes. This analysis affords a means of characterizing those sequences that are misclassified by several sequence-based coreceptor prediction methods, as well as predicting the coreceptor using the location of the sequence in sequence space and of relating this location to the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count of the patient. We support previous findings that the usage of CCR5 is correlated with relatively high sequence conservation whereas CXCR4-tropic viruses spread over larger regions in sequence space. The incorrectly predicted sequences are mostly located in regions in which their phenotype represents the minority or in close vicinity of regions dominated by the opposite phenotype. Nevertheless, the location of the sequence in sequence space can be used to improve the accuracy of the prediction of the coreceptor usage. Sequences from patients with high CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell counts are relatively highly conserved as compared to those of immunosuppressed patients. Our study thus supports hypotheses of an association of immune system depletion with an increase in V3 loop sequence variability and with the escape of the viral sequence to distant parts of the sequence space.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host cell entry of HIV-1 is mediated by viral membrane-bound proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Berger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The initial contact between the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 and the cellular receptor CD4 is followed by a second interaction between gp120 and one of the cellular coreceptors: CCR5 or CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Bleul1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Deng1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown that viruses binding to CCR5 are almost exclusively present during the early asymptomatic stage of the infection whereas CXCR4-binding viruses may emerge in later phases of the infection and are associated with a CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell decline and progression towards AIDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Miedema1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The specificity of the virus to use one of the coreceptors is often termed tropism. Before the coreceptors were identified, two phenotypic variants were recognized according to the virus' ability of forming syncytia in MT-2 cells. Already at that time, syncytium-inducing (SI) and non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) viruses were observed to have a different impact on the disease progression in infected people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Schuitemaker1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. There is a high correlation between CCR5-tropic and NSI viruses, on the one hand, and between CXCR4-tropic and SI viruses, on the other hand. The question whether the emergence of CXCR4 and SI virus is a cause of advanced progression towards CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell depletion and the rise of AIDS symptoms or appears as a result of these phenomena (or both), as well as the evolutionary reasons for the development of these variants remain largely unresolved.</p><p>The capacity of HIV-1 to use a specific coreceptor resides mainly in the sequence of the V3 loop of the viral envelope protein gp120. Current coreceptor prediction methods (e.g. 11/25 rule, WebPSSM, geno2pheno) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Fouchier1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Jensen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Sing1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> aim at revealing the relationship between V3 loop sequence and viral coreceptor usage. However, the overall reliability of sequence-based methods for coreceptor prediction is still limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Sing1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this work, we present the results of a comprehensive analysis of the viral V3 loop sequence space. Using different sequence distance measures and visualization methods we describe the arrangement of the sequences in sequence space. Our results reveal a relatively high conservation of CCR5-tropic and NSI strains as compared to more diverse CXCR4-tropic and SI strains evolving in an apparently unconstrained manner. On the one hand, we find that the arrangement of the sequences imparts one of the reasons for the inaccuracy of sequence-based methods for coreceptor prediction. On the other hand, we show how the location of the V3 loop sequence in sequence space can be used to improve the accuracy of the prediction of coreceptor usage. We further investigate the relation between the location of V3 loop sequences in sequence space and the associated clinical markers such as CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell level. Sequences of patients with a functioning immune system tend to be located close to each other in sequence space and thus are likely to share common features whereas, with decreasing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell counts the conservation of the V3 loop among patients decreases and the diversity of possible viral genotypes increases. These results support the hypothesis of the immune system initially imposing strong selective pressure on the viral envelope gene. Once the immune system is compromised, this pressure diminishes which enables the virus to undergo less restrained variation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data preparation</title><p>Using the Los Alamos database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> we defined two sets of labeled V3 loop protein sequences: the labels of the first set, which we call <italic>NSI/SI</italic> are attributed according to the annotation of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) and syncytium-inducing (SI) strains. Those of the second set which we call <italic>R5/X4</italic> are attributed according to the annotation of the sequences concerning coreceptor usage &#x02013; CCR5-, CXCR4- and dual-tropic (R5X4) strains. In order to prevent samples from a single patient to dominate any of the two sequence sets and to analyze viral evolution among hosts rather than patient-specific selection pressures, we limited our datasets to contain one randomly chosen sequence from each patient. The two sets contain 1096 and 859 V3 loop amino acid sequences, respectively, with an 85&#x00025; prevalence of NSI and CCR5-tropic strains, respectively.</p><p>We used four sequence distance measures to compare the V3 sequences: Hamming distance, Blosum62 matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Henikoff1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, difference in amino acid charge and size, and difference in amino-acid composition at positions significant for the phenotype, as reported by Sing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Sing1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We noticed that different distance measures result in the same pattern of sequence separation and therefore we decided to apply the Blosum62 matrix as the distance measure in other parts of this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sequence clustering</title><p>Both datasets were clustered hierarchically, using complete linkage clustering. We analyzed the tendency of viral sequences of different phenotypes to form clusters depending on the cluster diameter i.e. the distance between the two most distant elements of the cluster. Clustering with a given upper limit for the diameter was achieved in an iterative procedure of merging two closest clusters in each step of the procedure until no two clusters can be merged without generating clusters of a diameter above the predefined limit. In complete linkage clustering, the distance between two clusters is defined as the largest distance between two elements, one in each cluster. Only clusters containing at least 1&#x00025; of all sequences in the dataset were considered, we define the sequences belonging to smaller clusters as well as singletons as <italic>unclustered</italic>. We additionally use a weighted notion of a cluster size such as to compensate for the imbalance between the amount of CCR5/NSI and CXCR4/SI sequences. The number of sequences of a given type in a cluster is multiplied by the ratio of the number of sequences of all other types in the full dataset over the number of sequences of the same type. This reweighting allows for considering smaller clusters of an underrepresented phenotype as significant.</p><p>The notion of silhouette value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Rousseeuw1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> was used to choose one clustering whose individual cluster structures should be investigated. The silhouette value of a sequence in a cluster is defined as the difference between the average distance of the sequence to sequences in other clusters and to sequences in the same cluster. The silhouette value of a cluster is the average silhouette value of its sequences. The silhouette value of a collection of clusters is the average of the silhouette values of its clusters. This measure can be used as a quantitative indicator of the coherence of a collection of clusters - larger values represent clusterings containing clearly separated, coherent clusters. We calculated the average silhouette values for clusterings obtained in successive steps of the hierarchical clustering and selected the clustering exhibiting a maximal silhouette value, among those clusterings that cluster more than 50&#x00025; of the sequences in a dataset and contain more than one cluster. We call the clustering resulting from this procedure the <italic>selected</italic> clustering.</p><p>For analyzing the selected clustering we used an unsupervised learning method of data density estimation via classification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Hastie1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This method allows for determining regions in sequence space in which the sequence density is significantly higher than average. For this purpose, we augmented the datasets with 500000 random reference data points distributed uniformly over the high-dimensional sequence space. The number of the reference data points was chosen as a balance between the computational load and sufficient space fill for accurate density estimation. A binary logistic regression model where true data points are assigned the value 1 and the generated reference data points have the value 0, was fitted using maximum likelihood estimation. The value returned by the fitted logistic regression for each of the true data points is treated as the probability of a point to be sampled by a distribution producing the analyzed dataset. The log-odds of this probability for each data point represent the local density of the original data relative to the generated reference data. Data density of a single cluster was calculated as the mean of log-odds of the cluster sequences. The larger the density of a cluster is, the more highly concentrated set of data points it contains.</p><p>We additionally measured the amount of positive selection among sequences in each cluster. For this purpose each of the protein sequences has been assigned its corresponding DNA sequence from the Los Alamos database.

NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences appear to be more conserved and to form clusters while SI/CXCR4 diverge in an apparently unconstrained manner and occupy distant parts of sequence space. Based on the above observations we tested if the position of a sequence relative to conserved NSI/CCR5-tropic V3 loop sequences in sequence space conveys sufficient information for the effective coreceptor prediction. We investigated the predictive power of the three aforementioned methods of characterizing sequence space based on distances, clustering and phylogeny on the NSI/SI and R5/X4 datasets separately. The proposed classification methods aim at distinguishing NSI/CCR5-only from SI/CXCR4-capable sequences. The score of each classifier is based on the separation of the sequence from the NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences in sequence space. Low scores characterize sequences less separated from NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences and therefore more conserved and probable to be NSI/CCR5-tropic. High scores indicate divergent sequences that, according to our sequence space analysis, are more likely to be SI/CXCR4-capable.</p><p>The classifiers were evaluated on both the NSI/SI and R5/X4 datasets using ten times ten-fold (10&#x000d7;10) cross-validation. In the following steps of the cross-validation procedure training and test sets are derived from the analyzed datasets.</p><p>The first classifier is based on the distance measures and predicts the tropism of a sequence depending on its average distance from all NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences in the training dataset. We constructed classifiers using three distance measures &#x02013; Blosum62 matrix, Hamming distance and differences on positions significant for the coreceptor tropism according to Sing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Sing1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. As the coreceptor prediction score we use the mean distance of a sequence to all the NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences in the training set.</p><p>The second classifier predicts the coreceptor of a sequence according to the step of the hierarchical clustering algorithm in which the sequence ceases to be a singleton (called the clustering step for short). In order for the score to reflect the divergence of a sequence from the NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences, only these sequences from the training set are used in the prediction procedure.</p><p>The third classifier uses the Splitstree method for estimating the phylogenetic distance between pairs of sequences. Due to the high computational cost of a large splitstree construction, the phylogenetic distance between two sequences of a large dataset is calculated as an average distance between those two sequences in trees of randomly sampled sequence subsets composed in half of NSI/CCR5-only and in half of SI/CXCR4-capable sequences. The training procedure consists of 100 iterations of sequence sampling, tree construction and tree distances extraction. First, subsets of 100 sequences of the training dataset (50 NSI/CCR5-tropic and 50 SI/CXCR4-capable) are sampled. Then a splitstree is constructed for each of the sampled sets and for each sequence pair in the trees the information on phylogenetic distance between the two sequences is extracted. We tested the predictive power of two different measures of phylogenetic distance: the sum of the lengths of the splits separating two sequences and the number of splits between them. After the iterative sampling and tree construction procedure, additional trees are constructed containing the sequences in the training dataset that did not appear in any of the sampled trees. The distance between two sequences is the mean of distances between those two sequences in the trees in which both sequences appeared. This way a phylogenetic distance matrix of the training set is assembled. For the prediction step we select from the distance matrix a subset of 90 sequences: 45 NSI/CCR5-tropic that are most conserved (have the least number of splits or shortest splits separating them from other sequences) and 45 SI/CXCR4-tropic that are the most diverse (have the largest number of splits or longest splits separating them from other sequences). These sequences are used in the prediction procedure on the test set. In the prediction procedure subsets of 10 sequences from the test set are added to the selected 90 sequences of the training set and a splitstree is constructed for the merged set. The proportion of the test to train set sequences on this tree was chosen as the optimal after testing several other proportions for the accuracy of predictions. The mean number of splits and the mean sum of lengths of splits between a sequence and the NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences on the tree are used as the score predictive of the coreceptor usage.</p><p>All three classifiers were tested on both the NSI/SI and R5/X4 datasets using ten times ten-fold (10&#x000d7;10) cross-validation. We compared the performance of sequence space classifiers to three existing methods - SVM, PSSM and 11/25 rule. SVMs were trained using the package libsvm with linear kernel. PSSMs were implemented according to the description in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Jensen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. All methods were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves focusing on the trade-off between false positive (FPR) and true positive rates (TPR) which can be controlled by choosing a prediction cutoff for turning the continuous scores into actual class predictions. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was taken as a cutoff-independent class separation criterion. Averaged ROC curves were estimated from the 10&#x000d7;10 individual cross-validation curves using vertical averaging. In the analysis we used the ROCR package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Sing2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>After comparing the performance of each of the proposed prediction methods individually, we additionally tested if adding the sequence space information to the SVM or combining several prediction methods into one can result in improved predictions. In the first approach we added to the binary feature vector coding the given sequence for the SVM the description of its location in sequence space. As the description of the location in sequence space we tested both the output score of the proposed classifiers, thus the separation of a sequence from the NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences, as well as the sequence and phylogenetic distance to each of the NSI/CCR5-tropic sequences. In the second approach we combined scores of several predictors, trained on the same training set, into one score. The scores of each predictor were normalized to the 0-1 interval with the higher scores representing CXCR4-capable sequences. We tested several methods of combining prediction scores, such as min, max, mean and Euclidian distance from the origin of the score space. We restricted the classifier combination methods to the simple, non-trainable combiners, bearing in mind their generally good performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Altmann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell counts in sequence space</title><p>In the last part of the study we related the location of a V3 loop sequence in sequence space to the corresponding patient CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count.

We additionally selected sequence samples and the corresponding CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell counts of 88 patients (225 sequences) from the University of Cologne. Since both Los Alamos and Cologne sequence sets exhibited similarities in the sequence space arrangement we merged them into a single dataset which we call the <italic>full dataset</italic>.

We analyzed the longitudinal patient data in both datasets to see how sequences of viral variants inside an individual patient trace paths in sequence space in association with the progression of the disease.

The distribution of the distances for pairs of SI sequences has also a larger variance than the one of the NSI sequences. The fact that the mean distance between pairs of sequences of opposite phenotypes is smaller than the mean distance of pairs of SI sequences implies that the SI sequences are widely spread out throughout sequence space and show no apparent common pattern of evolution. Distances between sequences in the R5/X4 dataset exhibit a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) with the dual-tropic sequences spread out less, on average, than the CXCR4 sequences and more than the CCR5 sequences.

Data density is an indicator of how much more are the sequences concentrated in a given part of sequence space relative to the rest of the space. The relation of the cluster size and the sequence space density is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Unclustered sequences occur in less dense parts of sequence space and are predominantly SI/CXCR4-tropic. Detailed inspection of the individual cluster structure allows for relating data density and the amount of positive selection on a sequence to the position of a given sequence within its cluster. Positive selection is a measure of the amount of change in the amino acid sequence and reflects the rate of evolution of a sequence. The sequence position in a cluster is characterized in terms of its distance from the cluster center. The two largest clusters of the R5/X4 dataset are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g004">Figure 4</xref>. In the case of cluster 2 we observe a strong correlation of the sequence distance from the cluster centre with the data density at the location of the sequence as well as with the amount of positive selection exerted on the sequence (correlation coefficient of -0.76 and 0.71, respectively). The results reveal that there is a dense center in cluster 2 grouping most of the cluster sequences and sparse brims where the concentration of sequences is smaller. The selection pressure in the center of such cluster is greater and reduced farther from its center. CXCR4- and dual-tropic sequences preferentially occupy the outer regions of the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, no such cluster pattern is observed in the case of cluster 1. Data density analysis shows that this cluster groups sequences spread over a similar density range independently of their position within the cluster. There is no clear distribution of variation in selection pressures in cluster 1 either.</p><fig id="pone-0007387-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007387.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Data density in clusters of the selected clustering.</title><p>Mean data density of sequences in clusters in the selected clustering of the NSI/SI (A) and R5/X4 dataset (B) is plotted against the cluster size.

First, we used the description of the position of a sequence in sequence space, either in terms of the score of each of the sequence space prediction methods or in terms of a vector of distances to each NSI/CCR5-tropic sequence, and added it to the binary feature vector coding the given sequence for the SVM. However, none of the resulting enriched SVMs showed better performance than the one based on the sequence only.</p><p>Next, we combined the scores of several predictors into a single score. We started by comparing the scores returned by different classification methods within the same cross-validation run. All the methods show a high correlation in the scoring (Pearson correlation coefficient &#x0003e;0.8) with the exception of phylogeny-based and SVM classifiers (correlation of about 0.25 and 0.7, respectively). Despite the low prediction power of the phylogeny-based method, we observed several sequences (about 15 in both datasets in each cross-validation run) where the score returned by this classifier is 50&#x00025; more accurate than the score of the SVM. However, since the phylogeny-based classifier contains a stochastic step, the scores returned by this method have a high variation between different cross-validation runs and this result is not reproducible in each run. We then tested several methods for combining scores and found the Euclidian distance from the origin of the score space to be the combiner achieving the best discrimination between the two sequence classes.

Three distance-based classifiers coupled together achieve better results than each one individually (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007387-t002">Table 2</xref>).

As in the analysis of misclassified sequences in the NSI/SI and R5/X4 datasets, we used the mean distance to the sequences annotated as NSI or CCR5-tropic in the full dataset (653 sequences) as a measure of sequence conservation.

Among sequences collected from highly immunosuppressed patients (T-cell count below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) we observe a large range of sequence conservation spanning conserved, NSI/CCR5-like, as well as highly divergent sequences. Among the patients with higher T-cell counts this range is narrower and includes only conserved sequences.</p><fig id="pone-0007387-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007387.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Patient sequence evolution in sequence space.</title><p>CD4&#x0002b; cell count level is plotted against mean distance to NSI/CCR5 sequence set in the full (A and B) and the therapy-na&#x000ef;ve datasets (C and D).

In the full dataset we counted 76 patients (both therapy-na&#x000ef;ve and therapy-experienced) with data occupying several time points. We examined the conservation of sequential measurements of each of the selected patients against the corresponding CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count. For 21 patients we could observe an increase in sequence divergence with decreasing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count to the immunodeficiency level - below 200cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Five patients show an opposite trend with a decrease in mutations co-occurring with a decrease of the number of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). Remaining patients showed no or various conservation change with varying CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count level.</p><p>In order to see how drug therapies can influence the relationship between sequence conservation and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell levels, we performed the same study on the data of untreated patients included in the therapy-na&#x000ef;ve dataset. This dataset contains 2213 sequences, 112 of which are annotated as NSI or CCR5-tropic. Other sequences are annotated as SI/CXCR4-tropic or have no annotation. The NSI/CCR5 sequences were used as a reference set in the sequence space. In the therapy-na&#x000ef;ve dataset the lack of conservation of the sequences of patients with an impaired immune system is more pronounced. Among severely immunosuppressed patients (CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), almost no highly conserved sequences can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g010">Figure 10C and D</xref>). Again, patients with higher T-cell counts do not exhibit highly divergent viral strains.</p><p>The longitudinal data analysis revealed that among 16 patients with more than one time point measurement, four show an increase in the sequence divergence with the transition to the immunodeficiency state (T-cell count below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). However, none of the patients shows the opposite trend.</p><p>As in the previous part of this study, we used the silhouette value to determine the selected clustering of the full and the therapy-na&#x000ef;ve datasets. Both sequence sets contain one major cluster containing 86&#x00025; and 52&#x00025; of all sequences, respectively, and three smaller clusters of about 3&#x00025; and 5&#x00025; in each set respectively. We observed an important overrepresentation of samples collected from ill patients (T-cell count below 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) among the unclustered sequences (p&#x0003c;0.001, chi-square test) which reflects their high evolutionary divergence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>By means of different distance measures, clustering and phylogenetic methods, the present study illustrates and interprets patterns in V3 loop sequence space of the HIV-1 envelope gene. The analysis confirms a relatively high conservation of CCR5-tropic and NSI viral sequences as compared to more highly divergent CXCR4-tropic and SI sequences. According to our study, the CCR5/NSI sequences appear to share common features and the CXCR4/SI sequences to be highly divergent and not showing a unique mutation pattern. Other studies detect at least several possible V3 loop mutation pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Milich1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and indicate the twofold larger heterogeneity of the X4-tropic viruses over the R5-tropic. The lack of common features among the CXCR4 sequences, as well as their high divergence, render these sequences impossible to group in coherent clusters. A statistical model of CXCR4 sequences is therefore difficult to obtain. This divergence pattern has already been reported in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Chesebro1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Nelson1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Resch1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, in contrast to these analyses done on small data samples, we support these hypotheses with a large-scale analysis of V3 loop sequence data.</p><p>The analysis of cluster structure revealed the existence of dense regions of sequence space occupied by CCR5-tropic sequences sparsely surrounded and interspersed by CRCX4- and dual-tropic sequences. The sparse outer boundaries of these regions are less highly conserved and are under positive selection. The finding of such regions suggests that the coreceptor usage switch which is correlated with high sequence divergence might be driven by the lack of selective pressure on the viral V3 loop. This finding supports other studies that report presence of selective pressure maintaining the relative homogeneity of the CCR5 viruses as well as the correlation of the emergence of the CXCR4-tropic strains with the accelerated V3 loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Chesebro1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Shankarappa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Localization of the misclassified sequences in sequence space revealed a possible reason for errors of V3 loop sequence-based coreceptor prediction tools. These sequences are located in parts of the sequence space untypical for their phenotype and show an inverse pattern in their distances distribution as compared to the distances among correctly predicted sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Only the sequences misclassified by the 11/25 rule do not exhibit such a distance inversion (data not shown) which suggests that in certain cases mutations at positions 11 and 25 are insufficient for the change of phenotype and that the accumulation of other mutations on the V3 loop might drive the coreceptor switch. Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Pillai1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> report dual-tropic V3 loop sequences as being predominant among the sequences misclassified by different prediction methods. It may be that the sequences we observe to be located in untypical regions of sequence space for their tropism represent an intermediate form between the two mono-tropic types. Other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Low1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> reveal a dependence of the predictive value of positions 11 and 25 on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell level, suggesting that individual patient parameters can influence the viral coreceptor usage. Another possible reason for errors in predicting coreceptor usage on the basis of V3 sequence may be the occurrence of complementary mutations in other parts of the gp120 protein. However, a similar inspection of the sequence space of the V2-V3 sequences revealed no separation between the CCR5 and CXCR4 phenotypes in the V2 part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g008">Figure 8</xref>). A similar observation has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> in an analysis of the V1-C3 region of the gp120 protein sequences that revealed a relative conservation of the V2 region with only a few positions in the V1/V2 stem being significant for the coreceptor usage. This strongly points to the V3 loop being the region of the gp120 protein crucial for the viral tropism that is under selection pressures driven by the interaction with the host.</p><p>The separation of the two classes of sequences in sequence space can therefore be used for the coreceptor usage prediction. Our prediction methods are drawn from sequence space localization determined by the means of sequence distance measures, phylogenetic distance and clustering. The predictive power of the methods is below that of SVM and PSSM which is not surprising as the prediction score based on sequence space is obtained by averaging over many sequence distances, an operation in which information on a single position in a sequence is lost. Adding the sequence space location descriptor to the sequence-based SVM did not improve its accuracy which might be due to the fact that the sequence space location is drawn from the genetic information that is already used by the SVM. However combining prediction methods, in particular the phylogeny-based method with other classifiers, resulted in a performance increase. Nevertheless the stochastic step involved in the phylogeny-based method renders its predictions less reliable which is reflected by the weak predictive power of the method by itself.</p><p>Relating clinical markers to the sequence space position shows higher sequence variability among patients with an impaired immune system. Other studies have reported the emergence of highly mutated viruses in the later stage of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Shankarappa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-McNearney1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Our analysis shows the association of this emergence with the drop in patient CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count. This association might be due to a selection pressure exerted on the viral V3 loop that disappears with the gradual erosion of the immune system. With the attenuation of this selection force the virus is apparently undergoing an unrestricted evolution on the V3 loop which traverses distant parts of sequence space. The existence of a similar selection mechanism has been suggested in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Zhang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However the nature of the selection pressure limiting the viral mutation in the early stage of infection is not clear. The observation that the development of a highly mutated CXCR4-tropic virus is associated with low CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell numbers and therefore with the impairment of the immune system suggests an immunological component of this mechanism. There is some evidence for selective pressure against the emergence of CXCR4 strains having an immunological basis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-vanRij1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and decrease of positive selection accompanying the drop in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count. This supports the hypothesis that the emergence of mutated strains late in infection is related to the limitation in the suppressive capacity of the immune system. However, recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Shepherd1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> show examples of patients exhibiting CXCR4-tropic virus at relatively high CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell counts. Such cases could be explained by a successful antiretroviral treatment, as viral tropism appears not to impact the response of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell count on the treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Waters1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In our datasets we find patients (mostly therapy-experienced) who exhibit an increase in sequence conservation with a reduction of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell counts (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007387-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). Other parameters may therefore influence the evolution of the viral V3 loop. Notably, high sequence conservation has been observed among patients under long-term successful therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007387-Chun1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our large-scale analysis of the sequence space of the V3 loop provides a comprehensive description of CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viral phenotypes. By characterizing CXCR4 viruses as highly variable and dispersed in sequence space we provide further evidence for the fact that not only is this phenotypic change predictive of disease progression but also that it comes as a result of an extensive evolution of the V3 loop sequence and a decrease of the selective pressure on the viral envelope genome.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like
