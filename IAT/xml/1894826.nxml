Human cyclophilin A (CypA), also known as peptidyl prolyl isomerase A (PPIA), is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic protein (by convention, we refer to the protein as CypA and the gene as <italic>PPIA</italic>). CypA has long been known for its incorporation into HIV-1 virions and its important role in facilitating HIV-1 replication in host cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. CypA is a member of the cyclophilin family, members of which all possess peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase activity. Peptidyl prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerases (<italic>PPIA</italic>ses) catalyze the <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds and are believed to be involved in protein folding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The incorporation of CypA into the HIV-1 virion capsid is mediated through the direct binding between prolyl peptide bond located in a proline-rich loop of the fourth and fifth helices of the HIV-1 capsid and the active sites of CypA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Disruption of CypA incorporation, either by HIV-1 Gag mutations or by cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressive drug that prevents HIV-1 Gag binding to CypA, leads to an attenuation of HIV-1 infectivity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

CypA is therefore an important host factor that regulates HIV-1 replication.</p><p>Recently, the role of CypA in HIV-1 has gained even greater attention with the discovery of a fusion protein of CypA and TRIM5&#x003b1;, a host restriction factor against HIV-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, which confers HIV-1 resistance in owl monkey &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

Using <italic>PPIA</italic>-specific primers we resequenced virtually the entire <italic>PPIA</italic> gene to screen for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 92 European Americans (EA) and 92 African Americans (AA). Seven polymorphisms were discovered: three in the putative promoter region, one in the 5&#x02032; UTR, one in the 3&#x02032; UTR, one in intron 4, and one in the second Alu repeat region upstream of the putative promoter. No SNPs were found in the coding regions. These SNPs and four additional SNPs available from dbSNP database located in regions not detected by our sequencing were selected for genotyping in the AIDS cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030088-t001">Table 1</xref>). SNP1 genotypes deviated from the frequencies expected under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), probably due to its location in the Alu repetitive element; thus, SNP1 was excluded in the analysis.

In this experiment, ~25-bp DNA probes containing either of the SNP alleles were incubated with the nuclear extracts from Th1 cytokine-stimulated human T lymphocytes. Both SNPs showed differential binding affinity to nuclear protein(s) with the same mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030088-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, top band). Averaged from two independent experiments, a 4-fold decrease or 2.8-fold increase in the band density was observed for the minor allele of SNP3 (G) and SNP4 (G), respectively. The cold unlabeled oligonucleotides with minor alleles were unable to compete with wild-type oligonucleotides, suggesting the bindings are specific. These results indicate that these two SNPs within the promoter alter the binding affinity with certain transcriptional protein(s). On the contrary, no obvious differential binding was observed for SNP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030088-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>In silico analysis of the sequence at these three SNP sites by using TESS software also predicted differential binding for SNP3 and 4, but not for SNP5. SNP3 and 4 were each located in one of the consensus-binding motifs of transcription factor SP1, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030088-g005">Figure 5</xref>B. The local sequence with SNP3C is identical to the consensus sequence of SP1 site, GGGG<underline>C</underline>C, whereas SNP3C&#x0003e;G change perturbs this motif. In contrast, the sequence with SNP4C has two mismatch sites compared to an alternative consensus sequence of SP1 site, GAGGC<underline>G</underline>GGGC, whereas SNP4C&#x0003e;G reduced the mismatch to one, predicting a stronger binding. There is, therefore, a plausible biochemical basis for the differential binding affinity observed in the gel shift experiment. These results also suggest that SNP3 and SNP4 affect transcription, likely through their interactions with SP1. The sequence of the region of human <italic>PPIA</italic> promoter resided in by SNP3 and SNP4 was compared to the corresponding sequence from other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030088-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). SNP3 and SNP4 are both located in the highly conserved regions. The C allele of SNP3 is present in both primates and rodents. The C allele of SNP4 occurs only in primates and the minor allele G occurs in rodents, suggesting a possible association with speciation. These interspecies data support the hypothesis that SNP3 and SNP4 changes may have functional consequences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The role of CypA in promoting HIV-1 replication has been well established through extensive in vitro experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, we have undertaken a systematic investigation of the association between genetic variations in the <italic>PPIA</italic> gene and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression in HIV-1 natural history cohorts. We found that two promoter variants in perfect LD, SNP3 and SNP4, in <italic>PPIA,</italic> were associated with rapid HIV-1 disease progression. This effect was revealed for CD4 cell depletion or for AIDS progression, reflecting early or late stage of disease progression, in AA and EA, respectively. The racial difference in the strength or timing of the effects may be due to interactions with other sequence variations that are distributed differently in two populations or to immunologic and viral variables. We further found that both SNPs had differential binding efficiency to nuclear proteins in the gel shift experiment. These findings suggest that the functional promoter SNP3/SNP4 influences HIV-1 disease progression.</p><p><italic>PPIA</italic> in human encodes a 165-amino acid protein that is highly conserved across species, with 100&#x00025; and 96&#x00025; sequence identity to rhesus monkey and mouse, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of <italic>PPIA</italic> is 98&#x00025; identical between human and chimpanzee. No variation in the coding sequence of human <italic>PPIA</italic> was found in this study or in the dbSNP database. This suggests that differential genetic impact of <italic>PPIA</italic> SNPs and haplotypes on infection and progression are likely due to regulatory region variation affecting protein levels. The regulation and promoter function of human <italic>PPIA</italic> is still undefined. <italic>PPIA</italic> is highly expressed in almost all cell types and is considered a housekeeping gene. Sequence analysis revealed that <italic>PPIA</italic> promoter contains a TATA box and two SP1 binding sites and is highly GC-rich (~70&#x00025;) with overrepresented CpG dinucleotides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, we identified two SNPs, each located in two additional SP1 binding elements. SP1 is generally believed to function as a transactivating factor for many housekeeping genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. These two SNP changes, SNP3G and SNP4G, always occurring together through LD, had opposite effects on the nuclear protein binding. Assuming the predicted stronger SP1 binding effect of SNP4 is dominant over the weaker SP1 binding of SNP3, a higher <italic>PPIA</italic> gene expression would be predicted. This would be consistent with more rapid disease course as observed in this study.</p><p>Based on our analyses of eight SNPs covering the entire gene region of <italic>PPIA</italic> and their haplotypes, we found that the <italic>PPIA</italic> disease-modifying effects were most likely afforded by promoter SNP3 or SNP4 and the associations with the downstream SNPs 7&#x02013;11 were largely due to tracking of these two SNPs through LD. In a previous report, Bleiber et al. studied the ex vivo HIV-1 infectivity in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from healthy individuals carrying the SNP4 and SNP5 alleles (named as <italic>PPIA</italic>-1604 and <italic>PPIA</italic>-1650, respectively, in the Bleiber's report), as well as their impact on the CD4 gradient (from CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell counts 500/mm<sup>3</sup> to 200/mm<sup>3</sup>) among SPs enrolled in the Swiss HIV cohort, largely comprised of Caucasians &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. In the ex vivo experiment, both SNPs showed nonsignificant tendencies toward greater HIV-1 replication, with the effects of SNP5 being more pronounced. In the population study, both SNPs were associated with faster CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell depletion in a model also containing two other candidate genes (model 2); with the SNP5 of <italic>PPIA</italic> effect again being more pronounced. Thus, the detrimental effect of SNP4 observed from these two studies is largely consistent. In contrast, no evidence supporting a role of SNP5 in AIDS progression was found, although the SNP5 G allele was carried significantly less often in HREU than in SC but was similarly distributed in SC and SN. Thus, the role of CypA polymorphism in HIV-1 infection remains inconclusive and warrants further investigation. Taken together, the association and functional results from these two studies point to a role of <italic>PPIA</italic> genetic variation in HIV-1/AIDS. In future studies, it may be informative to determine the mechanism of association between <italic>PPIA</italic> variants and host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or disease progression in view of the interaction between CypA and the capsid domain of the Gag polyprotein.</p><p>Population-based genetic association studies provide a powerful approach to uncovering host genes that confer disease susceptibility or resistance. This approach has led to identification of various genetic factors that affect HIV-1/AIDS, and has provided unique insights into the host HIV-1 interaction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The successful identification of true genetic associations requires a large sample size (to minimize the type II error), replication in independent studies (to ward off type I error), and plausible functional evidence (to infer causal relationship). In this study, the plausible genetic-modifying role of <italic>PPIA</italic> is supported by replication in two independent ethnic groups and the demonstration that SNPs 3 and 4 are each associated with altered binding affinities to transcription factors. Moreover, the previous independent study also provides supportive association and functional evidence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our comprehensive analysis of nearly all variant alleles and their haplotypes in the <italic>PPIA</italic> gene is, in essence, equivalent to a gene-based approach &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. A major problem facing genetic association studies is the difficulty in replication, particularly for single SNP associations. One reason for failure to replicate previous studies is due to potential differences in allele frequencies and LD structure across populations. Gene-based replication has recently been advocated as a gold standard for replication studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. The entire gene with prior SNP association is considered the functional unit and is examined for association with effectively all genetic variation in the gene.
