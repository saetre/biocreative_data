The libraries were scanned first for protein production with polyvalent antiserum prepared against the 73kDa gag protein of mouse intracisternal A-particles (IAP). Reactive plaques were crossed-screened by hybridization with an IAP-specific DNA probe. Two IAP-specific protein-producing plaques were obtained from the C57BL/6 library and 4 from the DBA/2 library. One C57BL/6 cDNA clone (B12) and two DBA cDNA clones (D8 and D20) were sequenced in their entirety. Clones B12 and D8 were remarkably similar, particularly when compared to the 6 other IAP elements that have been sequenced thus far. We discuss the evidence which leads us to suggest that these clones may be derived from allelic IAP elements expressed in mouse thymus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3823"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3824"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3825"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3826"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3827"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3828"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3829"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3830"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3831"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3832"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3833"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3834"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
