Candidal Hsp70 proteins are classical chaperone proteins with two discrete functional domains consisting of peptide binding and ATP binding regions. Pull-down assays with full-length and truncated Ssa2 proteins found that the ATPase domain was required for Hst 5 binding. Further mapping of Ssa2p by limited digestion and peptide array analyses identified two discrete Hst 5-binding epitopes within the ATPase region. Expression of Ssa2p in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells carrying mutations in the first epitope identified by thermolysin digestion (Ssa2<sub>128-132A3</sub>) significantly reduced intracellular transport and fungicidal activity of Hst 5, confirming its importance as a binding site for Hst 5 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since this Hst 5 binding site lies within the Ssa2p ATPase domain near the ATP-binding cleft, it is possible that ATP modulates Hst 5 binding to Ssa2p.

Hst 5 is strongly fungicidal for <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and other fungal pathogens associated with oral candidiasis. Unlike other cationic peptides, the fungicidal mechanism of Hst 5 is not a result of cytolysis or membrane disruption. Instead, Hst 5 induces selective leakage of intracellular ions and ATP from yeast cells resulting in gradual cell death that is similar to osmotically induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Koshlukova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Vylkova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). These cytotoxic effects are initiated once Hst 5 reaches the intracellular compartment; therefore the ability of this protein to be transported into the cell is essential for its fungicidal activity. We found that <italic>C. albicans</italic> expresses cell wall proteins that bind Hst 5, which we identified as Heat Shock Protein (Hsp) 70 family members Ssa1 (656 amino acids) and Ssa2 (645 amino acids) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Ssa2 protein is more important than Ssa1 in mediating toxicity of Hst 5, since Hst 5 intracelluar uptake and killing are significantly reduced in <italic>C. albicans SSA2</italic> deletion mutants while <italic>SSA1</italic> knockouts are only mildly resistant to Hst 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This unexpected role of Ssa2 protein in facilitating intracellular translocation of Hst 5 prompted us to examine the molecular basis for its interactions with Hst 5.</p><p id="P4">Ssa (<underline>s</underline>tress <underline>s</underline>eventy <underline>a</underline> subfamily) proteins belong to the Hsp70 family, of which <italic>Candida</italic> has only two members: Ssa1p and Ssa2p. Ssa proteins in <italic>Candida</italic> are predominantly localizated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) where they function as chaperones in the translocation of client proteins across microsomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ngosuwan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and transportation of proteins to the vacuole for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Satyanarayana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). However, both <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> export Hsp70 proteins, including Ssa1p and Ssa2p, to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lopez-Ribot and Chaffin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lopez-Ribot <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Nombela <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). These proteins are likely directed to the cell surface through a non-conventional secretion pathway, since yeast Ssa proteins do not contain an N-terminal secretion signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Nombela <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In contrast to cytosolic Ssa proteins, the general function of cell wall-localized Ssa proteins is not known, although our studies suggest that they may have binding activity with extracellular proteins.</p><p id="P5">All Hsp70 proteins contain two functional regions, an ATPase domain and peptide-binding domain, which interplay in the process of binding and release of client substrates. The larger ATPase domain is composed of two equally sized lobes (designated I and II) that are separated by a deep cleft containing the nucleotide binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Flaherty <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>). Each lobe can be further subdivided into two separate topological domains IA, IIA, IB and IIB of which the IA (&#x0223c;110 residues) and IIA (&#x0223c;130 residues) subunits form the nucleotide-binding cleft. Conventional protein binding with yeast cytosolic Ssa chaperones requires specific sites within its C-terminal peptide-binding domain, and is driven by cycled ATP binding and hydrolysis within the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). However, it is not known whether binding with smaller peptides of non-fungal origin (such as Hst 5) involves the same nucleotide-dependent substrate-binding process. Since ATP levels within the cell wall are likely to be low under normal conditions, it is possible that binding of non-native peptides by cell wall Ssa proteins is largely ATP independent and may occur at non-conventional binding sites. Indeed, evidence for such atypical binding functions by microbial Hsp70 proteins is accumulating. Surface-localized Hsp70 proteins in <italic>Heliobacter pylori</italic> and <italic>Hemophilus influenza</italic> have binding specificity for sulfogalactolipids consistent with a cell surface receptor function which was mapped to the ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mamelak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Bacterial periplasmic surface-localized Hsp70 (DnaK) is actively involved in transport of peptides and prevents aggregation of several unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Richarme and Caldas, 1997</xref>). Similar to our findings with candidal Ssa proteins, binding by bacterial DnaK to cationic antimicrobial peptides including drosocin, apidaecin and pyrrhocoricin was shown to be related to their intracellular uptake and killing functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kragol <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The probable interaction sites between DnaK and pyrrhocoricin were mapped to the C-terminal variable region of the lid domain outside the conventional peptide binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Otvos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kragol <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Thus, microbial cell surface-localized Hsp70 proteins appear to have a broad role in recognition and binding of substrate proteins, and may utilize sites other than the conventional peptide binding region described for cytosolic family members.</p><p id="P6">To determine whether Hst 5 binding with <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ssa2 protein utilizes the conventional nucleotide-dependent peptide-binding domain or instead involves other novel binding sites, we mapped Hst 5-binding epitopes using immunoprecipitation, limited digestion and peptide array strategies. Here we report that Hst 5 binding maps to the IA subunit region in the ATPase domain of Ssa2p, and <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ssa2p carrying mutations within this identified site reduced binding and intracellular uptake of Hst 5 independently of other co-chaperones and nucleotides. Thus binding of yeast Ssa2 protein with human salivary Hst 5 involves at least one epitope (Ssa2<sub>128-132</sub>) within the ATPase region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ssa2p ATPase domain (Ssa2<sub>1-385</sub>) binds Hst 5</title><p id="P7">Since <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ssa2p has stronger association with Hst 5 than Ssa1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), we used this Hsp70 family member for mapping Hst 5-binding domains. A series of truncated <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ssa2 proteins were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) guided by known functional domain structures of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ssa1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Qian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Recombinant Ssa2 proteins encompassing the ATPase domain (rSsa2<sub>1-385</sub>), the peptide-binding domain (rSsa2<sub>386-645</sub>), and full-length Ssa2 protein deleted of 15 amino acid residues of the anchor region at the C-terminus (rSsa2<sub>1-630</sub>) were constructed and expressed in a yeast expression system. Each purified protein (&#x0003e; 95%) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue-stained to verify that the apparent molecular weight of each expressed protein corresponded to its predicted size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To determine which domains are essential for interaction with Hst 5, BHst 5 (Biotin-Hst 5) was used as the bait protein in pull-down assays with Ssa2 proteins in native as well as chemically cross-linked conditions as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Although binding complexes were detected between BHst 5 and full-length rSsa2p in pull-down assays in native conditions, none of the truncated Ssa2 variants could form complexes with BHst 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, lane 3</xref>), indicating that full-length Ssa2p is optimal for formation of stable complexes with BHst 5 in these assays. Addition of a cross-linker to stabilize interactions resulted in detection of BHst 5 complexes with both rSsa2<sub>1-630</sub> and rSsa2<sub>1-385</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, lane 4</xref>); however, Ssa2p variant missing the ATPase domain (rSsa2<sub>386-645</sub>) did not form any detectable complexes with BHst 5. To rule out the possibility that the cross-linker itself contributed to the pull-down complex, truncated Ssa2 proteins were incubated with cross-linker and Streptavidin conjugated beads; however, no complex formation was detected (data not shown). Thus, the 46 kDa ATPase domain of Ssa2 (rSsa2<sub>1-385</sub>) appeared to be the crucial domain involved in binding of Hst 5, consistent with its reported function of binding nucleotides and accessory proteins such as Hsp40, Hip, Hop, Hap and BAG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Benjamin and McMillan, 1998</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Since the C-terminus of Hsp70 contains docking sites for co-chaperones Hsp40 and Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Qian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Carrigan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), we constructed an Ssa2p truncated in this classical protein anchor domain (rSsa2<sub>1-630</sub>). However, Ssa2p deleted of this anchor region still was able to associate with BHst 5, showing that this anchor domain is not required for binding with Hst 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). To verify this result, two peptides representing the Ssa2<sub>631-645</sub> anchor domain (EPSNDGPTVEEVD), as well as a 4mer peptide EEVD recognition sequence from this domain were tested for their ability to inhibit complex formation between full-length rSsa2p and BHst 5. Neither the anchor domain protein nor the EEVD peptide was able to inhibit rSsa2p-BHst 5 complex formation when pre-incubated with BHst 5 as assessed by pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, neither of these classical peptide anchor regions appears to be required for Hst 5 binding with Ssa2p, although it is possible that they may contribute to structural features of Ssa2p involved in substrate binding.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Two epitopes within the Ssa2p ATPase domain are putative binding sites for Hst 5</title><p id="P10">To more finely map Hst 5 binding sites within the rSsa2p ATPase domain, limited digestion of cross-linked rSsa2p-BHst 5 complexes was performed. Thermolysin was selected as the proteolytic enzyme for these experiments since Hst 5 contains only one weak digestion site at its extreme N-terminus, while Ssa2p contains over 30 sites distributed over its 645 amino acid length (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/nickpred/">http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/nickpred/</ext-link>). Following enzymatic digestion of Ssa2p-Hst 5 cross-linked complexes, Ssa2p digestion fragments not associated with BHst 5 were removed by washing, while those associated with BHst 5 were recovered by pull-down with Streptavidin beads and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, lane 4</xref>). Same amount of Ssa2p was digested with thermolysin without the presence of BHst 5 as a control and loaded directly on the SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, lane 3</xref>). Strikingly different digestion products of rSsa2p were observed when rSsa2p was bound to BHst 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, lane 3 and lane 4 respectively</xref>), showing that Hst 5 binding substantially alters available thermolysin digestion sites exposed for enzymatic cleavage. The smallest major digestion fragments (&#x02248; 8 kDa) released from Hst 5-Ssa2p complexes were selected for analysis by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, lane 4, arrow</xref>) as being representative of more complete digestion products of flanking regions. Higher-molecular-weight digestion products were not further characterized since they were likely to contain regions more distally removed from cross-linked binding sites. Two peptides were identified: ETAEGFLGTTVK (Ssa2<sub>127-138</sub>) and VDEIV-LVGGSTR (Ssa2<sub>330-341</sub>), both of which are located in the ATPase domain of Ssa2p, but are separated by 172 amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, green regions</xref>). These results confirmed that the ATPase domain is indeed the site for binding with Hst 5, but suggested the possibility of two independent binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Hst 5-binding motifs within the Ssa2p ATPase domain</title><p id="P11">In order to assess binding epitopes by an alternative approach as well as to compare relative binding of Hst 5 with Ssa2p and Ssa1p, we used scanning peptide arrays of Ssa1p concurrently with Ssa2p. Peptide arrays provide a high-throughput method for simultaneous measurement of binding to discrete peptides under the same binding conditions. Peptide arrays containing a complete library of Ssa1 and Ssa2 proteins were incubated with BHst 5 (2 &#x003bc;M), then with Streptavidin-HRP and quantified following ECL development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Among the strongest peptide binding sites for Hst 5, three spots (7, 23 and 38) as well as four less intense spots (9, 25, 45, 46) were identified in common to both Ssa1 and Ssa2 arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These peptides sequences are nearly identical in both Ssa1p and Ssa2p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting information</xref>, <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Data S1</xref>), therefore we did not pursue them further as they were not likely to show a specific basis for binding of Hst 5 with Ssa2p. Also, we observed that these three peptides showed a high degree of homology in primary sequence with Hst 5 suggesting self-self binding, since previously we had found that Hst 5 has a high propensity for self-aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Interestingly, three peptides were identified (spots 12, 14 and 32) that exhibited strong binding with BHst 5 (and without homology to Hst 5) as well as being unique for Ssa2p. Importantly, these peptides were located within the ATPase domain of Ssa2p protein and either overlapped, or were adjacent to fragments identified by limited thermolysin digestion. One other unique Ssa2p-binding epitope (spot 55) was identified but not further examined since it was outside the ATPase domain. Two distinct Hst 5 binding regions formed by contiguous epitopes identified by these two independent methods (marked with red boxes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) were mapped on primary and secondary structures of <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ssa2p. Both regions were found to have defined secondary structures consisting of adjacent &#x003b2;-sheet and &#x003b1;-helical regions, and have numerous non-conserved amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), potentially providing the basis for selectivity of Hst 5 binding with Ssa2p.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>Mutagenesis of</italic> C. albicans <italic>Ssa2p-Hst 5 T1-binding epitopes reduces function</italic></title><p id="P13">We next examined whether the epitopes identified from <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays would have a functional role for Hst 5 binding in living cells. As a first approach, synthetic peptides identified as binding epitopes (T1: Ssa2<sub>127-157</sub>, T2: Ssa2<sub>329-356</sub>, and peptide array spots Ssa2<sub>68-83</sub> and Ssa2<sub>245-257</sub>) were used for competition experiments in which Hst 5 and each peptide were pre-incubated together in solution before addition to <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells. However none of the peptides significantly reduced Hst 5 killing and translocation, showing that Hst 5 interactions with Ssa proteins do not take place at extracellular regions and/or do not occur with small linear fragments of Ssa2p. Therefore, our next approach was to use site-directed mutagenesis of each epitope in full-length Ssa2p <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P14">A series of Ssa2p mutagenesis sites were designed within thermolysin digestion fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, top, T1 and T2 regions shown beneath green bars</xref>); and within spot 14 from the peptide array (P1 indicated with a blue bar). Alternating amino acids were mutated using mutagenesis primers and were integrated into the <italic>ssa2</italic>&#x00394; strain genome. We expected that strains expressing mutations within a region unrelated to Hst 5 functions would be similar to the gene restoration strain <italic>ssa2</italic>&#x00394;/<italic>SSA2</italic> that expresses wild-type (wt) protein<italic>;</italic> while mutations within regions essential for Hst 5 binding would have a phenotype like the <italic>ssa2</italic>&#x00394; null mutant. Cytosolic expression levels of all mutated Ssa2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, lanes 4-7</xref>) were very similar to wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, lane 1</xref>) and gene restoration <italic>ssa2</italic>&#x00394;/<italic>SSA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, lane 3</xref>) strains. Mutated Ssa2 proteins from T1 and P1 regions were secreted to the cell wall at levels comparable to wt protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, bottom, lanes 4-6</xref>); however, mutation of only three amino acid residues within the T2 region of protein Ssa2<sub>(334-338A3)</sub> nearly abolished its secretion to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, lane 7</xref>). Thus we expected attenuation of Hst 5 translocation in this strain as a result of this secretion defect independently of amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="P15">Next, strains carrying Ssa2p mutations were compared with wt and <italic>ssa2</italic>&#x00394;/<italic>SSA2</italic> gene restoration strains for their ability to translocate Hst 5 and for cell susceptibility to Hst 5 cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Mutations within the first T1 region in Ssa2<sub>(128-132A3)</sub> resulted in the most pronounced reduction of Hst 5 intracellular translocation and toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7, lane 4</xref>) to levels of <italic>ssa2</italic>&#x00394; knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7, lane 2</xref>). Thus, the TAEGF epitope (found only in Ssa2p) is crucial for Hst 5 activity and may be one reason for propensity of Hst 5 binding for Ssa2p over Ssa1p. These results also confirm involvement in this region for Hst 5 binding as determined by <italic>in vitro</italic> thermolysin digestion experiments. In contrast, mutations in the downstream T1 region of Ssa2p (131-135) reduced, but did not prevent Hst 5 killing and intracellular uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7, lane 5</xref>), suggesting that this region may partially overlap the Hst 5 binding site or may modulate Ssa2p conformation required for binding. As expected, the T2 Ssa2<sub>(334-338A3)</sub> mutant with defective cell wall secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7, lane 7</xref>) had reduced Hst 5 translocation and killing to levels of the <italic>ssa2</italic>&#x00394; knockout. Attempts to produce substitution mutations within other regions of T2 failed, resulting in complete loss of both cytosolic and cell wall Ssa2 protein. Thus, this region appears to be critically important for correct protein expression as well as its secretion to the cell wall. However, we could not validate its ability to interact with Hst 5 using a mutational approach. Mutation of the P1 region of Ssa2<sub>(150-156A3)</sub> resulted in approximately 20% reduction in Hst 5 translocation and in cellular killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7, lane 6</xref>), which may be a consequence of a slight reduction in cell wall secretion of this mutated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, lane 6</xref>). Similarly, mutations within the region of Ssa2<sub>(342-355)</sub> representing spot 32 in the peptide array did not alter Hst 5 killing or translocation (data not shown), thus showing that this region is not involved in Hst 5 function. Thus, Hst 5 binding regions identified using linear probes in the peptide array do not appear to be actual binding sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, but may have some secondary role.</p><p id="P16">In order to visualize the spatial relationship and surface accessibility of sites identified as important for Hst 5 activity by mutational analyses, these epitopes were mapped on a tertiary model of full-length <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ssa2p predicated using ROBETTA Full-chain Protein Structure Prediction Server (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). The T1 Hst 5 binding site identified by <italic>in vivo</italic> assays with the highest function effects was labelled with green (Ssa2<sub>128-135</sub>) and the T2 region with possible functional effects was labelled with magenta (Ssa2<sub>334-338</sub>). Ribbon structure mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8, left</xref>) showed that the strong Hst 5 interaction site (green) is located on the &#x02018;shoulder&#x02019; of the ATPase domain within the IA subunit lobe. Surface modelling of this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8, centre and right</xref>) showed that this area is quite surface accessible. In contrast, the intermediate functional region (magenta) lies within the ATP-binding cleft of the IIA subunit and has little surface accessibility. Thus changes in Hst 5 binding upon mutation of this region may be a result of structural modification, or loss of the ability of ATP to bind the groove area in the ATPase domain. This raised the question whether Hst 5 binding is influenced by conformational changes of Ssa2p as a result of functional binding with ATP or other nucleotides as a part of its typical chaperone function.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Hst 5 does not compete for nucleotide binding sites in Ssa2p</title><p id="P17">Gel filtration analyses were used to assess binding of BHst 5 to rSsa2p in the presence of nucleotides.

A 10-fold molar excess of BHst 5 was incubated with rSsa2p for 30 min with either 1 mM ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> 1 mM ATP&#x003b3;S-Mg<sup>2+</sup> or 0.9 mM ADP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.1 mM ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 1 mM P<sub>i</sub> to allow complex formation, then subjected to gel filtration using a pre-equilibrated column in Buffer A containing nucleotides. Eluted rSsa2p-BHst 5 complexes (both monomeric and polymeric rSsa2p) were collected, subjected to SDS-PAGE to detect rSsa2p, and quantified by slot blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). Since these two proteins are of different sizes (645 amino acids and 24 amino acids respectively) which could result in differences in blotting efficiency, we first optimized loading to produce linear standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9, right, lanes 1 and 2</xref>) and then selected an appropriate volume from each pool in order to quantify each protein within its linear range. As expected, BHst 5 was co-eluted with both the rSsa2p monomer and rSsa2p polymer peaks, although the majority of BHst 5 (83-95%) was identified in the rSsa2p monomer peak either with or without nucleotides (data not shown). Thus, the monomeric form of Ssa2p is most favourable for Hst 5 binding, consistent with previous reports that hsc70 monomers favour protein or peptide substrate interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Because we were interested in total binding affinity under different conditions, polymer and monomer peaks were considered together to simplify calculation of dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for rSsa2p-BHst 5 complexes under each nucleotide condition were calculated using average values obtained from free Hst 5, co-eluted Hst 5 and Ssa2p peaks from at least three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Hst 5 was found to bind Ssa2p with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 5.4 &#x003bc;M in the absence of added nucleotide, confirming that Ssa2p-Hst 5 complexes can be formed without nucleotides or cofactor proteins. However, addition of ATP or ADP reduced the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> by about 10-fold, showing that ATP or ADP association with Ssa2p favours Hst 5 binding, but that Hst 5 does not compete for nucleotide binding sites in Ssa2p and further confirming that the binding site is outside the nucleotide binding groove. In addition, replacing ATP with non-hydrolysable ATP&#x003b3;S reduced the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> by only threefold, also showing that ATP hydrolysis is not involved in formation of Ssa2-Hst 5 complexes.

The functional role of these proteins (as well as other Hsp70 proteins) in the cell envelope is not understood, although they may serve as recognition sites for antibodies and may retain chaperone functions with extracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Botzler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Classical chaperone activity of Hsp70 family members involves co-chaperones including Hsp40, Hsp90, Hsp104; and nucleotide-dependent binding and release of client proteins from the peptide-binding domain. In contrast, the antifungal protein Hst 5 has direct interactions with Ssa2p that occur in the ATPase domain outside the conventional Ssa2 peptide-binding domain. Consistent with such &#x02018;ectopic&#x02019; binding, nucleotides are not required for binding, suggesting that Ssa2p should be capable of binding proteins within the environment of the yeast cell envelope <italic>in vivo</italic> where there is limited availability of nucleotides. Furthermore, candidal cell wall Ssa proteins are capable of functioning as chaperone or facilitating proteins for Hst 5 entry into yeast cells without requiring co-chaperones, even though cell surface localization of Hsp90 and Hsp104 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pitarch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Urban <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Similar non-conventional binding associations have been reported for bacterial proline-rich cationic peptides that bind the lid domain of DnaK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kragol <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and bacterial ClpB (similar to Hsp104 in yeast) that binds substrates within its nucleotide-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schlieker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In mammalian cells, Hsp70 can also bind short peptide sequences (8-26 amino acids in length) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Grossmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) indicating its versatility in binding with smaller substrates.</p><p id="P19">Hst 5-Ssa2p interactions are novel in that they do not require conventional binding sites, co-chaperones or nucleotides for function. However, the presence of nucleotides does enhance Hst 5 binding, suggesting that ATP binding to Ssa2p alters the secondary (or tertiary) conformation of the Hst 5 binding site in a way that improves Hst 5 interactions. Crystal structure data of Hsc70 (having 75% identity with candidal Ssa2p) under conditions of bound and unbound ATP/ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) provide insight into the conformational changes that occur upon nucleotide binding. Treatment of Hsc70 with ATP or ADP showed that the two lobes of ATPase domain rotate into a more closed conformation (7.4&#x000b0; rotation towards each other) in the presence of nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). If candidal Hsp70 follows this structural model, the Ssa2<sub>128-135</sub> region should be more highly exposed upon nucleotide binding making the site more accessible for Hst 5 binding. Addition of nucleotides to Hst 5 prior to incubation with cells did not alter its activity (data not shown) suggesting that ATP itself does not bind to Hst 5 but instead affects subsequent interactions with Ssa2p. However non-hydrolysable nucleotide ATP&#x003b3;S did not substantially alter binding between Ssa2p and Hst 5 when compared with ADP or ATP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), suggests that Hst 5 binding is improved by conformational changes of Ssa2p related to nucleotide binding rather than nucleotide hydrolysis.</p><p id="P20">Many cationic peptides are salt sensitive, and Hst 5 is among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Electrostatic mapping of full-length Ssa2p showed no specific clustering of negatively charged amino acid residues either in the whole protein or within identified Hst 5 binding sites (data not shown), indicating that Hst 5-Ssa2p interactions are not simply a result of electrostatic interactions between this cationic peptide and negatively charged areas on Ssa2p. Furthermore, buffer conditions that disrupt Hst 5 binding to intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) did not affect binding interactions between rSsa2p and Hst 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Since Ssa2p is located within the cell envelope rather than at the cell surface, we conclude that salt-sensitive interaction between Hst 5 and intact cells likely involves initial binding at the cell surface and precedes Hst 5 binding with Ssa2p. Potential candidates for these salt-sensitive interactions with Hst 5 are negatively charged glucans or polysaccharide components on the outer cell wall surface.</p><p id="P21">Ssa proteins do not contain a canonical secretion signal, yet are abundantly present at the yeast cell surface. Alternative mechanisms by which proteins lacking N-terminal signal peptides are secreted could involve pathways outside the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretion process such as adhesion to secretory vesicles, entry into endosomal subcompartments, passive transfer across the cell membrane or substrate-specific recognition by a transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Nombela <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, construction of one of our substitution mutants Ssa2<sub>(334-338A3)</sub> resulted in complete expression of Ssa2 protein in cytoplasm; however, its secretion to the cell wall was nearly abolished. Inspection of this region showed two potential O-linked glycosylation sites (STRIP) that were removed with three introduced amino acid substitutions. These results suggest that post-translational glycosylation of Ssa2p residues 334-338 is required for cell wall secretion, and further imply that endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway are involved in this secretion process. Investigation of levels of cell wall Ssa proteins in <italic>C. albicans</italic> secretion mutants may provide further information about this process. This mutant also provides strong evidence that cell wall, but not cytosolic, Ssa2p is involved in efficient uptake and killing by Hst 5.</p><p id="P22">Our experiments using <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells with selected mutations within Ssa2p revealed one likely contiguous binding site for Hst 5 mapped to amino acid residues 128-135. However, we were unable to rule out a second binding site identified from thermolysin digestion experiments in regions 330-341, since all mutations constructed in this region resulted in loss of Ssa2p expression and/or stability. Three-dimensional modelling showed that this site is also surface localized and adjacent to the 128-135 epitope. Thus, this site could be an independent binding epitope or a distal part of one single region. Although this region could be involved solely in structural conformation of the Ssa2 protein needed for Hst 5 binding, our digestion experiments indicate this region is directly associated with Hst 5 peptide.</p><p id="P23">Although Ssa2p clearly plays an important role in intracellular translocation of cationic peptides, our results point to a facilitator function rather than being an actual transporter/importer since (i) Ssa2p deletion mutants have reduced but measurable uptake of Hst 5, and (ii) the requirement of cellular energy for peptide import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) suggests that the actual import mechanism involves active transport or energy-dependent processes such as endocytosis. One possibility is that Ssa2p serves as a chaperone to transfer cell wall-bound peptides to a membrane permease that transports cationic peptides. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> uses at least four plasma membrane permeases, DUR3 and SAM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Uemura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), AGP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aouida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and GAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Uemura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), that catalyse the uptake of extracellular polyamines in an energy-dependent manner. In this regard, yeast two-hybrid screening of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteome for Hsp90 interactions uncovered strong interactions with a large group of membrane transporters including AGP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Millson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), suggesting that these chaperones could function to pass substrates to transporter proteins. Candidal homologues of these permeases (<italic>AGP2</italic>, <italic>GAP1</italic>, <italic>DUR3</italic>) are potential candidates as intracellular transporters of Hst 5. Alternatively, <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ssa proteins have been identified in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Insenser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), putting forth the possibility that Ssa2p and its client substrate are internalized by endocytosis. Thus, Hst 5 or other cationic peptides could be taken up by Ssap-mediated endocytosis then released into the cytosol by retrograde transport as has been described for yeast killer toxins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eisfeld <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Breinig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

Protein concentration for each preparation was measured by BCA assay (Pierce) and cytosolic proteins (10 &#x003bc;g) were separated using 16% Tricine SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with Streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce), and developed by ECL. Intracellularly translocated Hst 5 was quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The reported values are means &#x000b1; standard errors of triplicate independent assays for each cell type.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Construction of predicted secondary and tertiary structures of Ssa2p</title><p id="P35">Ssa1 and Ssa2 proteins sequence alignments were performed using <sc>clustal x</sc> (1.83) multiple sequence alignment software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/en/Documentation/ClustalX/">http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/en/Documentation/ClustalX/</ext-link>). Ssa2p-Hst 5 interaction epitopes identified from peptide arrays (blue) and limited digestion (green) were mapped onto aligned sequences of the Ssa2p ATPase domain, and overlapping areas detected using both methods were indicated with red boxes. The secondary structure of Ssa2p was predicted from the protein homology analogy recognition engine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre/">http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre/</ext-link>).

Purified rSsa2p (5 &#x003bc;M) was mixed with excess BHst 5 (100 &#x003bc;M) with or without different nucleotides. Nucleotides added were one of the following: 1 mM ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> 1 mM ATP&#x003b3;S-Mg<sup>2+</sup> or 0.9 mM ADP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.1 mM ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 1 mM P<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Greene <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). The total volume was adjusted to 250 &#x003bc;l with the same dialysis buffer used for purification of rSsa2p (Buffer A), and the protein mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice before loading onto Superose 12 10/300 GL FPLC column equilibrated in Buffer A or Buffer A containing nucleotides at a flow rate of 0.25 ml min<sup>-1</sup>. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected, 25 &#x003bc;l of each fraction around the peak area was loaded on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and silver-stained to locate rSsa2p-positive fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9, left</xref>). Pure rSsa2p and BHst 5 were loaded in gradient onto the Minifold II Slot Blot System (Whatman) to obtain a linear standard range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9, right, lane 1 and 2</xref>). Fractions containing rSsa2p was pooled, and a concentration range of pool A and pool B were loaded together with each standard and detected with anti-Xpress or Streptavidin-HRP antibodies for rSsa2p or BHst 5 respectively. Only proteins falling within the linear range were used for quantification by densitometric scanning (Bio-Rad) against the quantification standards.

Dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of rSsa2p-BHst 5 complexes under each nucleotide condition were calculated using the equation <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = [BHst 5<sub>f</sub>][rSsa2pf]/[rSsa2p-BHst 5].</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><?landscape?><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Site-directed mutagenesis primers</p></caption><table frame="below" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primers</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sequences (5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;)</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Digestion site</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>SSA1</italic> promoter-f</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aag-CTGCAG-agtattgtagaataaattattcagc</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PstI (CTGCAG)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>SSA1</italic> promoter-r</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aag-GTCGAC-aatttaattttttgtttaattgtgtttt</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SalI (GTCGAC)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>SSA2</italic> CDS + 582 bp UTR-f</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aag-GTCGAC-atgtctaaagctgttggtattga</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SalI (GTCGAC)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SSA2 CDS + 582 bp UTR-r</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aag-GGATCC-atccaatcataatccagtaaattg</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BamHI (GGATCC)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ssa2<sub>128-132A3</sub></td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">gatcttgggtaaaatgaaggaa<bold><underline>g</underline></bold>ccg<italic>CT</italic><bold><italic><underline>G</underline></italic></bold><italic>CAG</italic>gt<bold><underline>gc</underline></bold>cttgggtaccac</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PstI (CTGCAG)*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ssa2<sub>131-135A3</sub></td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aaatgaaggaaaccgctg<italic>AAG</italic><bold><italic><underline>C</underline></italic></bold><italic>TT</italic>tc<bold><underline>gc</underline></bold>gggt<bold><underline>g</underline></bold>ccactgttaaagatgctgttgtc</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HindIII (AAGCTT)*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ssa2<sub>150-156A4</sub></td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">actgtcccagcttacttcaatg<bold><underline>c</underline></bold>ttcc<bold><underline>gc</underline></bold>aaga<bold><italic><underline>gC</underline></italic></bold><italic>AGCT</italic><bold><italic><underline>G</underline></italic></bold>ccaaagatgctggtaccattgc</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PvuII (CAGCTG)*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ssa2<sub>334-338A3</sub></td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">caaatctaaagttgatgaaattg<bold><italic><underline>C</underline></italic></bold><italic>CTTGG</italic><bold><underline>c</underline></bold>tggtg<bold><underline>c</underline></bold>ttctaccagaattccaaaggttc</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">StyI (CCTTGG)*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Sequences of sense mutagenesis primers for each construct are shown.
