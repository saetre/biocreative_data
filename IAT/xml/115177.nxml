ROS produce a variety of damages in DNA including base and sugar damage, sites of base loss, strand breaks and DNA&#x02013;protein crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c7">7</xref>). Oxidatively damaged DNA bases are thought to be primarily repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c11">11</xref>). 8-Hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua) is a prevalent DNA lesion caused by oxidizing agents and ionizing radiation and is highly mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c15">15</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> two DNA glycosylases prevent mutagenesis by 8-OH-Gua: the Fpg protein which excises 8-OH-Gua in damaged DNA and the MutY protein which excises the adenine residues incorporated by DNA polymerases opposite 8-OH-Gua. Inactivation of both the <italic>fpg</italic> (<italic>mut</italic>M) and <italic>mut</italic>Y(<italic>mic</italic>A) genes of <italic>E.coli</italic> results in a strong G:C to T:A mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c15">15</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a DNA glycosylase that is encoded by the <italic>OGG1</italic> gene and named yOgg1, catalyses the removal of 8-OH-Gua and formamidopyrimidines from damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c19">19</xref>). Furthermore, Ogg1-deficient strains of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> exhibit a G:C to T:A mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c21">21</xref>). In mammalian cells, 8-OH-Gua is released by DNA glycosylases showing strong sequence homology with the yeast Ogg1 and named mOgg1 and hOgg1 for the mouse and human enzymes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c28">28</xref>). To investigate the biological role of the Ogg1 protein in mammalian cells, <italic>ogg1</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice have been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c30">30</xref>). Null animals are viable and show no marked pathological changes up to 12&#x000a0;months. However, Ogg1-deficient mice show an abnormal accumulation of 8-OH-Gua in their genome and exhibit a significantly higher spontaneous mutation rate in non-proliferative tissues compared to the isogenic wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c30">30</xref>). These results strongly suggest that excision of 8-OH-Gua by DNA glycosylases such as the bacterial Fpg and the eukaryotic Ogg1, prevent mutations induced by endogenous ROS. Although they have similar biological functions, the Fpg and Ogg1 proteins do not exhibit significant sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c19">19</xref>). Indeed, Ogg1 belongs to a family of DNA glycosylases&#x0002f;AP lyases, the signature of which is the &#x003b1;-helix&#x02013;hairpin&#x02013;&#x003b1;-helix-Gly&#x0002f;Pro-Asp motif together with a conserved catalytic lysine, which we refer to as the HhH-GPD&#x0002f;K family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c31">31</xref>), the prototype of this family being the Nth (Endo III) protein of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c32">32</xref>).</p><p>Yeast and mammalian Ogg1 proteins have very similar, if not identical, substrate specificities and catalytic properties. The Ogg1 proteins are monomers of ~40 kDa endowed with both DNA glycosylase and AP lyase activities (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c12">12</xref>). They excise 8-OH-Gua, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-<italic>N</italic>-methylformamidopyrimidine (Me-FapyGua) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua) from damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c28">28</xref>). In addition, the Ogg1 proteins efficiently remove 8-hydroxyadenine (8-OH-Ade) placed opposite a cytosine in oligodeoxyribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c34">34</xref>). Yeast and human Ogg1 proteins are also endowed with an AP lyase activity that incises DNA at AP sites placed opposite a cytosine via a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c24">24</xref>). The catalytic mechanism of the Ogg1 proteins involves the formation of a transient covalent imino enzyme&#x02013;DNA intermediate presumably between the &#x0025b;-NH<sub>2</sub> group of a catalytic lysine residue and the C1&#x02019; of the abasic sugar moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c31">31</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the ribosomal protein S3 has been shown to possess an 8-OH-Gua DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c37">37</xref>). The glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) fusion of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S3 (GST-S3) efficiently releases 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua from &#x003b3;-irradiated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c35">35</xref>). These results suggested that S3 could play a role in DNA repair in addition to its involvement in protein synthesis. In the present study, we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> also possesses an <italic>OGG1</italic> homolog, <italic>dOGG1</italic>. The data presented show that this gene expresses a functional DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyase, capable of excising 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua from DNA exposed to &#x003b3;-irradiation. Our results also show that dOgg1 efficiently incises 34mer DNA duplexes containing 8-OH-Gua, 8-OH-Ade and AP sites placed opposite to a cytosine. The biochemical properties of the dOgg1 protein were compared to those of S3. The expression pattern of the <italic>dOGG1</italic> mRNA in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and ovaries is also presented.

The purity of the dOgg1 protein was assessed by the observation of a single protein band on a SDS&#x02013;PAGE with a molecular mass of ~38 kDa, which agreed well with the expected mass (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f2">2</xref>). The specificity of the site of cleavage was confirmed by a single N-terminal sequence (data not shown). The purification steps were monitored by measuring the excision of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-Me-FapyGua by the protein fractions. For the purified dOgg1 protein, the specificity constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) for the excision of Me-FapyGua is 214 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> (min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> nM<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). This value is very similar to that measured for the human &#x003b1;-hOgg1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c33">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Excision of modified bases by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dOgg1 from &#x003b3;-irradiated DNA: GC&#x0002f;IDMS analysis</title><p>We investigated the ability of the dOgg1 protein to excise modified DNA bases from &#x003b3;-irradiated DNA. Using GC&#x0002f;IDMS, 17 modified bases were identified and quantified in DNA &#x003b3;-irradiated under N<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c44">44</xref>). Of these modified bases, dOgg1 protein efficiently excised FapyGua and 8-OH-Gua. No other modified base was excised significantly under the conditions used in this work. The excision of 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua was assessed by their appearance in supernatant fractions of DNA substrates incubated with active enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f3">3</xref>). The amounts of 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua in DNA pellets after incubation of &#x003b3;-irradiated DNA with active protein were significantly reduced when compared to those in DNA pellets incubated with heat-inactivated enzyme or without enzyme. The amounts found in the supernatant fractions of DNA substrates incubated with active enzyme were similar to those removed from the pellets of the same DNA substrate, demonstrating the excision of the lesions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f3">3</xref>). Kinetic parameters were determined by measurement of excision at six different concentrations of FapyGua and 8-OH-Gua with the total amount of DNA remaining constant in each sample. The excised amounts of these products in supernatant fractions were used for the determination of the initial velocity. Excision followed Michaelis&#x02013;Menten kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c45">45</xref>). Kinetic constants and standard deviations (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6) were calculated using Lineweaver&#x02013;Burk plots and a linear least-squares analysis of the data (data not shown). Kinetic parameters calculated from these plots are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd676tb1">1</xref>. The specificity constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><italic>&#x0002f;K</italic><sub>M</sub>) for excision of 8-OH-Gua is 1.9-fold higher than that for FapyGua (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd676tb1">1</xref>). This result suggests that, for the dOgg1 protein, 8 -OH-Gua may be a better substrate than FapyGua in N<sub>2</sub>O &#x003b3;-irradiated DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage of 34mer DNA duplexes containing 8-OH-Gua, 8-OH-Ade or an AP site placed opposite each of the four DNA bases</title><p>The specificity of the dOgg1 protein was also investigated using DNA lesions embedded in 34mer DNA duplexes as substrates. These substrates were also used to analyze the opposite base dependence of the dOgg1 activity on 8-OH-Gua, 8-OH-Ade and AP site. For this purpose, 34mer harboring one of these lesions was hybridized to complementary sequences harboring each of the four normal DNA bases opposite the lesion. The cleavage activity of the dOgg1 protein on the strand harboring the lesion was analyzed for each of the four DNA duplexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f4">4</xref>). In the case of 8-OH-Gua, dOgg1 efficiently cleaves 8-OH-Gua.C and 8-OH-Gua.T duplexes whereas it cleaves 8-OH-Gua.G and 8-OH-Gua.A duplexes at a very slow rate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f4">4</xref>A). In the case of 8-OH-Ade and AP site, dOgg1 efficiently cleaves 8-OH-Ade.C and AP.C duplexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f4">4</xref>B and C). In contrast, dOgg1 does not cleave 34mer DNA duplexes containing an 8-OH-Ade or an AP site placed opposite a thymine, a guanine or an adenine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f4">4</xref>B and C). This last result explains why 8-OH-Ade is not released from &#x003b3;-irradiated DNA substrates which contain 8-OH-Ade.T base pairs.</p></sec><sec><title>Catalytic mechanism of the dOgg1 protein</title><p>To further investigate the catalytic mechanism of dOgg1, we compared the products generated by dOgg1, yOgg1 and Fpg after cleavage of an 8-OH-Gua.C duplex. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f5">5</xref>A shows that dOgg1 and yOgg1 generate the same product (P1) corresponding to the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond at the 3&#x02032;-side of the AP site resulting from the excision of the 8-OH-Gua &#x0005b;18&#x0005d;. It is widely accepted that this product results from a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction catalyzed by the AP lyase activity of this class of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c46">46</xref>). In contrast, the Fpg protein generates a product that migrates faster (P3) and results from successive &#x003b2;- and &#x003b4;-elimination reactions at the AP site generated by the glycosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c46">46</xref>). Control experiments show that the dOgg1 product P1 is not modified by post-treatment with Endo&#x000a0;III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f5">5</xref>A). In contrast, the addition of Endo IV after cleavage by the dOgg1 protein results in a nearly quantitative conversion of the dOgg1 product P1 into another product (P2) which is probably generated by the release of the trans-4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate at the 3&#x02032;-end of the P1 fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c46">46</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of strand cleavage by the dOgg1 protein involves the release of the 8-OH-Gua residue followed by a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction at the 3&#x02032;-side of the resulting AP site.</p><p>The mechanism of DNA strand cleavage after excision of 8-OH-Gua by DNA glycosylases&#x0002f;AP lyases such as the bacterial Fpg or the yeast and human Ogg1 involves the nucleophilic attack at the C1&#x02019; of the sugar moiety leading to the formation of an enzyme&#x02013;DNA Schiff base intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c47">47</xref>). To probe for such an intermediate, the Ogg1 protein was allowed to react with a labeled 8-OH-Gua.C substrate in the presence of the reducing agent NaBH<sub>4</sub> and the products of the reactions were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f5">5</xref>B shows that the presence of NaBH<sub>4</sub> in the assay mixture results both in the inhibition of the cleavage activity of the dOgg1 protein and in the formation of a shifted band (trapped complex) with an apparent molecular weight of 55&#x02013;60 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f5">5</xref>B). The dOgg1&#x02013;DNA complex can be digested with proteinase K to yield a product that co-migrates with free DNA (data not shown). Control experiments show that the dOgg1-DNA complex is not formed when NaCl is present instead of NaBH<sub>4</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f5">5</xref>B). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f5">5</xref>B also shows the formation of a Fpg&#x02013;DNA and yeast Ogg1&#x02013;DNA complexes in the presence of NaBH<sub>4</sub>. These results suggest that the Ogg1 protein forms a transient Schiff base intermediate, which is converted into a covalent protein&#x02013;DNA adduct in the presence of NaBH<sub>4</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the dOgg1 proteins in <italic>E.coli</italic> fpg mutY complements the mutator phenotype</title><p>Plasmid PR195 expressing GST&#x02013;dOgg1 protein was transformed into <italic>E.coli</italic> strain PR195 in which the <italic>mutY</italic> and <italic>fpg</italic> genes are disrupted.

The rates of mutation to rifampicin resistance were determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c26">26</xref>). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd676tb2">2</xref> shows that the expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein in this strain reduces the mutation frequencies to rifampicin resistance as effectively as the human Ogg1 protein expression, partially complementing the spontaneous mutator phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression pattern of dOGG1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries and larvae</title><p>We examined the distribution of the <italic>dOGG1</italic> transcripts in ovaries and larvae by whole-mount RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. In all the tested tissues, a specific signal has been observed after a long time of staining compared to a control probe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f6">6</xref>). This result suggests that the <italic>dOGG1</italic> mRNA might be expressed at a low level in these tissues. Ovaries are composed of about 16 ovarioles, each with a germarium at its anterior tip and progressively older egg chambers toward the posterior. An egg chamber consists of three cell types: the oocyte connected to 15 polyploide nurse cells, both surrounded by a monolayer of somatic follicle cells. The subsequent development of the egg chamber is divided into 14 stages. From stage 10B onwards, the nurse cells expel their entire content into the oocyte. At the end of the oogenesis, the columnar follicle cells synthesize the vitelline membrane and the chorion of the egg and then both nurse cells and follicle cells degenerate. Hybridization on ovaries with an antisense <italic>dOGG1</italic> probe revealed a signal in the cytoplasm of the nurse cells from stage 3 (data not shown) and in the oocyte&#x02019;s cytoplasm from stage 10B onwards (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f6">6</xref>A and B). Hybridization on third instar larvae with an antisense <italic>dOGG1</italic> probe revealed a specific signal in the imaginal discs which are the precursors of the epidermal structures of the head, thorax and external genitalia of the adult fly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f6">6</xref>C and D). In late third instar larvae, they appear as sac-like epithelial organs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The unavoidable but potentially mutagenic DNA base alterations resulting from endogenous ROS attack are primarily removed by the BER pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c11">11</xref>). The first step in this ubiquitous repair pathway is the recognition and removal of the altered base by a DNA glycosylase catalyzing the cleavage of the glycosylic bond between the modified base and the sugar moiety, leaving an AP site in DNA. Subsequently, the resulting AP site is incised and the repair is completed by the successive actions of a phosphodiesterase, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c11">11</xref>). In yeast three DNA glycosylases are involved in the removal of oxidatively-damaged DNA bases, namely Ntg1, Ntg2 and Ogg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c48">48</xref>). Structural and&#x0002f;or functional homologs of these DNA glycosylases have been found in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c2">2</xref>). The biological function of this class of enzymes is thought to prevent genetic instability due to endogenous DNA base damage such as 8-OH-Gua. Assessments of 8-OH-Gua formation and mutagenic potential are strongly supported by the G:C to T:A mutator phenotype of <italic>E.coli</italic>, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and mouse strains deficient in 8-OH-Gua DNA glycosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c30">30</xref>).</p><p>Three classes of 8-OH-Gua DNA glycosylases have been identified in living organisms: (i) The Fpg family in Bacteria and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c49">49</xref>); (ii) the Ogg1 family in Archae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c50">50</xref>), yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c2">2</xref>); and (iii) The S3 ribosomal protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c37">37</xref>). In the present study, we report sequence alignments that indicate the presence of Ogg1 homologs in <italic>A.thaliana</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f1">1</xref>A). The high degree of sequence homology and the conservation of critical blocks of amino acids strongly suggest that these are functional 8-OH-Gua DNA glycosylases from the Ogg1 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c2">2</xref>). The results from the characterization of the purified dOgg1 protein from <italic>Drosophila</italic> presented in this paper show that the dOgg1 protein is indeed a DNA glycosylase that removes Me-FapyGua, FapyGua and 8-OH-Gua from damaged DNA as do the yeast and human Ogg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c28">28</xref>). Previous experiments had suggested that there is no Fapy glycosylase activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c51">51</xref>). Consistently, experiments carried out in cell extracts from a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line, although positive for 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity, failed to detect an activity capable of removing Me-FapyGua from DNA (data not shown). Moreover, it was suggested that no BER system was present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c53">53</xref>). These contradictory results suggest that such an activity in crude extracts might be subject to some inhibitory factor. Alternatively, the Fapy glycosylase activity could be too low to be detected in the extracts. The kinetic constants for excision of the various lesions are very similar in the different organisms studied. For example, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values for the excision of 8-OH-Gua are 0.084, 0.038 and 0.056 (min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) for yeast, human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ogg1 proteins, respectively. The dOgg1 protein also shows a marked preference for lesions placed opposite a cytosine as do the yeast and human Ogg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c24">24</xref>). The GC&#x0002f;IDMS experiments fail to show a DNA glycosylase activity of the dOgg1 protein on pyrimidines. This makes it an unlikely candidate for the activity reported in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c51">51</xref>). Analysis of the genomic sequences suggests that the activity on fragmented pyrimidines could be coded by the putative Endonuclease III open reading frame. Finally, the dOgg1 protein possesses an AP lyase activity which generates the same product as do the yeast and human Ogg1. In conclusion, the substrate specificity and catalytic properties of the dOgg1 protein are, to the best of our knowledge, identical to that of the yeast and human Ogg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c2">2</xref>). Therefore sequence homologies reveal functional Ogg1 proteins in evolutionary distant organisms such as <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> which in turn strongly suggests that the <italic>A.thaliana</italic> sequence also encodes a functional Ogg1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd676f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>These results lead us to conclude that <italic>Drosophila</italic> has two 8-OH-Gua DNA glycosylase activities, S3 and dOgg1, because of this apparent redundancy, it was important to analyze in detail the properties and the expression of the dOgg1 protein. Indeed, dOgg1 and S3 have very similar properties. Both dOgg1 and S3 are DNA glycosylases that excise 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua from &#x003b3;-irradiated DNA. Specificity constants for the excision of 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua by dOgg1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd676tb1">1</xref>) and S3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c35">35</xref>) have been measured using the same experimental conditions. The results show that <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values for excision of 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua by dOgg1 were 8.1- and 4.5-fold higher than that by S3, respectively. The better <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><italic>&#x0002f;K</italic><sub>M</sub> values of dOgg1, compared to S3, are due to lower <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values. Furthermore, both dOgg1 and S3 have a marked preference for 8-OH-Gua placed opposite a cytosine. Finally, dOgg1 and S3 are AP lyases whose reaction mechanisms involve the formation of a covalent imino enzyme&#x02013;DNA intermediate. dOgg1 and S3 have then very similar, if not identical, substrate specificities and potentially the same biological function.</p><p>In the present study, we also show that <italic>dOGG1</italic> mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues. The experiments presented suggest that the nurse cells synthesize the <italic>dOGG1</italic> transcript and then expel it in the oocyte. The zygote is transcriptionaly inactive during the first 14 division of embryogenesis. Therefore, the accumulation of the <italic>dOGG1</italic> transcript in the oocyte might be important for the mitotic divisions that occur during early embryogenesis, in order to avoid oxidative damage-induced mutations. No <italic>dOGG1</italic> expression is detected in follicle cells. These cells will not divide any more as they degenerated at the end of the oogenesis. Then, we could expect that they do not need an important DNA repair machinery to keep their DNA without damage. The presence at a detectable level of the <italic>dOGG1</italic> transcript in the imaginal discs could be related to the rapid divisions of the disc&#x02019;s cells during larval development. Since S3 is essential, both S3 and Ogg1 are likely to be present in most <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. The dOgg1 possesses a cluster of basic amino acids at its C-terminal end which is probably used as a nuclear localization signal as previously reported for the human Ogg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c24">24</xref>). Similarly, the S3 ribosomal protein has been suggested to possess a nuclear localization signal and to bind the nuclear matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c37">37</xref>). Therefore, both dOgg1 and S3 may have access to the nuclear DNA. All the data point then to the fact both dOgg1 and S3 are functional <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although dOgg1 seems to have somehow better kinetic properties than S3 the relative importance of their activities in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells remains to be determined. The transcription-coupled repair of 8-OH-Gua in Ogg1-deficient rodent cells reveals the existence of an unidentified Ogg1-independent repair pathway in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd676c54">54</xref>). If it exists in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this could be a third repair system for 8-OH-Gua.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd676f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> OGG1 sequence analysis.
