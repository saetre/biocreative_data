It is suggested that sCD14 is mainly released from blood monocytes by serine protease-mediated shedding. Because &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (AAT), an inhibitor of serine proteases, has been shown to regulate CD14 expression in human monocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, we sought to investigate plasma levels of sCD14 and monocyte expression of mCD14 in subjects at age 30 years with normal MM and deficient PiZZ and PiSZ genotypes of AAT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Plasma levels of AAT and sCD14 were measured in 75 PiZZ and 34 PiSZ individuals with normal lung function identified from the Swedish neonatal AAT deficiency screening, and in 95 age matched PiMM controls. The mCD14 expression in monocytes from 9 PiZZ, 6 PiSZ and 11 PiMM subjects was analysed by FACS and Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription PCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>As expected, plasma AAT concentrations were PiMM&#x0003e;PiSZ&#x0003e;PiZZ (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Plasma sCD14 levels were higher in PiZZ than in PiMM subjects (p &#x0003c; 0.01). The expression level of mCD14 was higher (1.89-fold) in monocytes isolated from PiZZ subjects compared to PiMM controls (p = 0.00189).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to show higher levels of plasma sCD14 and monocyte mCD14 expression in young, clinically healthy PiZZ AAT subjects.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>CD14 is a multifunctional receptor constitutively expressed on the surface of various cells, including monocytes and macrophages, but it also occurs as a soluble form (sCD14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In normal serum, sCD14 is present in relatively high concentrations (&#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;g/ml). However, in different inflammatory and infectious diseases like sepsis and autoimmune diseases, characterised by the activation of monocytes and macrophages, highly elevated levels of sCD14 can be found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies show that endotoxin (LPS) can induce sCD14 secretion and expression in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, after stimulation with various agents, an increased release of sCD14 is observed from monocytes. This suggests that sCD14 could be used as a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The exact role of CD14 in normal and pathological situations is not completely known. Recent findings provide evidence that sCD14 expresses systemic anti-inflammatory effects and functions as a modulator of cellular and humoral immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated a direct proteolytic effect of serine proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase (NE), on mCD14 resulting in the release of CD14 into the extracellular medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (AAT), a major inhibitor of NE in the lower respiratory system, is thought to play an essential role in limiting host tissue injury at sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The clinical importance of AAT is highlighted by an increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory disease, in particular chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in individuals with severe AAT deficiency, PiZZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Severely decreased levels of AAT in subjects with AAT deficiency may result in increased activity of NE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] with consequent proteolysis of immune cell membrane receptors, such as CD14, and release of soluble forms of those receptors. In addition, we have recently found that AAT also directly regulates CD14 expression and release in human monocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. When cells were exposed for 18 h to a constant amount of AAT alone or in combination with LPS, CD14 and TLR4 mRNA expression was dramatically reduced compared to non-treated controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We hypothesize that AAT may play an important role in modulating sCD14 levels, both as an inhibitor of NE and as a direct regulator of CD14 expression and release, and, therefore, subjects with AAT deficiency may have higher CD14 expression than those with normal AAT levels. These considerations led us to examine plasma levels of sCD14 and blood monocyte mCD14 expression in clinically healthy young adults with PiSZ and PiZZ AAT deficiency relative to age and gender matched controls with normal PiMM AAT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>This study included 204 individuals (98 males and 106 females) aged 30 (26&#x02013;34) years.

The consequent lack of circulating AAT in individuals with severe PiZZ AAT deficiency may lead to development of premature pulmonary emphysema and COPD. Pulmonary symptoms occur in the 3rd to 5th decade of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and the progression of lung disease is markedly accelerated by cigarette smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Because of both the lack of knowledge about the inflammatory processes in COPD and a lack of established biomarkers, it is not possible today to detect sub-clinical lung obstruction in time for preventive physician intervention that could limit lung tissue damage. Therefore, many of the COPD cases with AAT deficiency are undiagnosed or diagnosed too late. From 1972 to 1974, 200,000 Swedish newborns were screened for AAT deficiency. Those with severe (PiZZ) and moderate (PiSZ) deficiency having plasma levels of AAT that are 10&#x02013;15% and 30&#x02013;40% of the normal levels have been followed prospectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The important aims of this project were to study the natural history and pathophysiology of AAT deficiency in childhood and adolescence, and to prevent lung disease. Follow-up results of PiZZ and PiSZ individuals at age 30 indicate retention of normal lung function but with a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms compared to age matched PiMM controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Currently there are no reliable clinical and/or biochemical parameters that allow us to predict who of those individuals will get COPD and emphysema. Therefore, studies aiming to improve our understanding of the basic mechanisms behind the development of COPD and to translate this to the diagnosis and/or the treatment are of great importance. We believe that the examination of the possible difference in cellular protein expression and the release profile between clinically healthy Z and M AAT subjects may improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of COPD.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate significantly higher sCD14 levels in plasma from 30-year old PiZZ deficiency subjects compared to age matched PiSZ individuals and PiMM controls. It is important to note that this finding was not related to the levels of the inflammatory marker CRP nor to the smoking habits of our study participants. Our results also indicate that ZZ and SZ monocytes have higher surface expression of mCD14 and that these monocytes cultured over night release larger amounts of sCD14 than MM monocytes. Whether higher plasma levels of sCD14 and higher mCD14 expression in blood monocytes in the AAT deficient individuals reflect specific pathophysiological changes in these individuals and may be used as specific marker of inflammation remains to be proven.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated a direct proteolytic effect of NE on mCD14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Individuals with severe AAT deficiency arising from lower plasma levels and decreased activity suffer a shortfall of NE inhibitor capacity. According to Ogushi and colleagues, Z type AAT-elastase complexes are less stable than M type AAT-elastase complexes and, compared to active M type AAT, active Z type AAT requires twice as long to inhibit neutrophil elastase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, Z AAT individuals have uncontrolled elastase activity and increased susceptibility to emphysema as a result of these lower levels and dysfunction of the AAT protein. This supports the concept that lack of AAT may be the reason for the higher sCD14 shedding in subjects with severe AAT deficiency. Different assays usually fail to discriminate between free active elastase and elastase-inhibitor complexes. These limitations have hampered our investigations of the direct relationship between plasma levels of free NE and sCD14 in AAT deficiency subjects.</p><p>It is not yet known whether monocytes and macrophages are the major sources of sCD14, since hepatocytes also have been shown to produce sCD14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Circulating AAT is primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Hepatocytes from Z AAT individuals may express greater amounts of cell-associated CD14 protein, and therefore more of the sCD14 is released resulting in an inverse link between plasma levels of Z AAT and sCD14 in AAT deficiency. Further studies will be needed to test these speculations.</p><p>The biological function of sCD14 is so far not clear. <italic>In vitro</italic>, an excess of sCD14 is shown to inhibit LPS binding to mCD14 and hence block cellular activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It has also recently been shown that the response to low-dose LPS instilled intratracheally is completely dependent on CD14, whereas at higher doses the response is also dependent on CD11b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Grunwald and collaborators have shown that binding of LPS to monocytes and LPS-induced cell activation are abrogated by an exogenously added high dose of sCD14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Moreover, injection of sCD14 has been shown to decrease endotoxin-induced mortality in a murine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that intravenous injection of an anti-CD14 antibody attenuates LPS-induced lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It also appears that CD14 may be critical to LPS-induced airway disease and that macrophage CD14 is sufficient to initiate neutrophil recruitment into the airways but that CD14 may need to interact with other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CD14 is a pattern-recognition receptor that plays a central role in innate immunity and directs the adaptive immune responses. We for the first time demonstrate that clinically healthy young adults with PiZZ AAT deficiency have higher plasma sCD14 levels, show increased sCD14 release and higher mCD14 expression in peripheral blood monocytes as compared to age matched PiMM subjects. Our findings, therefore, argue strongly for further studies on relationship between CD14 expression, AAT deficiency and increased susceptibility of PiZZ subjects to develop emphysema.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AAT: &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin; COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CRP: c-reactive protein; LPS: Lipopolysacharride; sCD14: Soluble CD14; mCD14: Membrane CD14; NE: Neutrophil elastase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declares that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have contributed to the manuscript.
