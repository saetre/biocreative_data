The uPA/uPAR system has been of great interest in cancer research because it is involved in the development of most invasive cancer phenotypes and is a strong predictor of poor patient survival. However, little is known about the role of uPA/uPAR in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive type of lung cancer.

We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), fluorescence microscopy and clonogenic assays to demonstrate uPAR expression in a subpopulation of cells derived from primary and metastatic SCLC cell lines. Cytotoxic assays were used to determine the sensitivity of uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

SCLC cell lines displayed heterogeneous phenotypes with regard to tumor surface determinants. All six SCLC cell lines were positive for CD29 (20&#x02013;99&#x00025;), CD44 (8&#x02013;98&#x00025;), CD105 (3&#x02013;34&#x00025;), CD166 (85&#x02013;98&#x00025;), and negative for CD90, and CXCR4. uPAR (CD87) was the only cell surface antigen expressed on a small sub-population of cells (1&#x02013;4&#x00025;) in each of the six SCLC cell lines, when analyzed by FACS using anti-uPAR-FITC antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g001">Figure 1, <italic>lower panels</italic></xref>).</p><p>Control samples stained with isotype-matched IgG-FITC were negative for uPAR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g001">Figure 1, <italic>upper panels</italic></xref>).

We performed cytotoxicity assays on three selected cell lines using non-sorted (bulk) as well as sorted uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cell populations. Increasing concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (10, 100, 200 &#x000b5;g/ml) were added to these cell cultures and incubated for 72 hrs, followed by counting of both viable and killed cells. Data was normalized to 100&#x00025;, which signified the number of uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells without drug added. A cell-killing effect was detected in all three non-sorted cell lines (H211, H69AR, H1417), where 40&#x02013;80&#x00025; of cells were killed by 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, uPAR-positive sorted cells from these three cell lines displayed significantly increased resistance to 5-FU, with only 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of cells being killed in the case of H211 and H1417 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Although the H69AR cell line also showed differential killing of uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells (e.g., 10 &#x000b5;g/ml 5-FU killed 30&#x00025; of uPAR-positve cells versus 85&#x00025; of uPAR-negative cells), at high concentration of 5-FU (200 &#x000b5;g/ml), the killing effect for both populations (H69AR) was the same (&#x0223c;100&#x00025;). Statistical analysis (2-way ANOVA) of uPAR(&#x0002b;) and uPAR(&#x02212;) data sets revealed significant differences in survival of uPAR(&#x0002b;) and uPAR(&#x02212;) cells after treatment with 5-FU (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0002, 0.0027, 0.0008 for H211, H69AR, H1417 cells, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We similarly investigated the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and etoposide, drugs currently used for treatment of patients with SCLC. The non-sorted SCLC cell lines (H211, H69AR, H1417) were used in cytotoxic assays with cisplatin and etoposide in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (3, 10, 100 &#x000b5;g/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). 60&#x02013;80&#x00025; of cells were killed by cisplatin and etoposide (used separately or in combination) in non-sorted lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Again, the uPAR-positive sorted cells from these three cell lines displayed significantly increased resistance to cisplatin and etoposide, with only 30&#x02013;50&#x00025; of cells being killed, compared to 60&#x02013;80&#x00025; killing of the uPAR-negative sorted cells (data not shown). These data suggest that the uPAR-positive cell subpopulation in SCLC may be responsible for chemoresistance to 5-FU and other traditional chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin and etoposide.</p><p>In order to confirm that uPAR expression confers tumor resistance to cisplatin and etoposide, we performed cytotoxicity assays on the same non-sorted SCLC cell lines and looked for enrichment of uPAR-positive cells in the surviving cell population. Indeed, we detected a significant enrichment of uPAR-positive cells (40&#x02013;70&#x00025;) among surviving cells, compared to only 1&#x02013;5&#x00025; of uPAR-positive cells in control cultures grown in the absence of these drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that uPAR expression confers chemoresistance in SCLC, and that the uPAR-positive cells should be considered as a novel target for more effective therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Clonogenic Activity of uPAR-positive Cells</title><p>To show that uPAR-positive cells possess high clonogenic and self-renewal potential, we sorted primary lung (H1417, H69AR), metastatic bone marrow (H211) cell lines by FACS using anti-uPAR-FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies. After sorting (97&#x00025; purity), uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells were plated in methylcellulose media at densities of 3000, 1000, 100 cells/well (6-well plate). uPAR-positive cells from these primary and metastatic SCLC lines formed multiple distinct colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We estimated that approximately &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the uPAR-positive cells (lung, H1417; bone marrow, H211) formed colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Conversely, the uPAR-negative cells from the primary lung (H1417) cells did not form colonies, and from metastatic bone marrow (H211) and lung (H69AR) formed only few colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). After uPAR-positive cells were allowed to form colonies for 16 days in methylcellulose culture, 20 colonies were isolated and analyzed for uPAR expression by flow cytometry. We found both uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells in each colony analyzed (H1417), with 30&#x02013;50&#x00025; of cells displaying uPAR positivity within each colony, following 18 days of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that uPAR-positive cells can give rise to both uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells. uPAR expression was also analyzed in the colonies derived from H211 and H69AR cell lines. In all colonies derived from sorted uPAR-positive cells we detected both uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells (&#x0223c;50&#x00025; each after 16 days in methylcellulose culture) (data not shown). Analysis of colonies derived from uPAR-negative cells (e.g., H211 cell line) revealed a small proportion of uPAR-positive cells in those colonies (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;). The reason for this might be possible contamination during sorting. Alternatively, uPAR-negative cancer cells may acquire uPAR expression under certain culture conditions. Several uPAR-positive colonies have been picked and grown further for 2 weeks in RPMI culture medium, followed by FACS sorting and clonogenic assay. Interestingly, we detected a similar proportion of uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells (1&#x02013;5&#x00025; and 95&#x02013;99&#x00025;, respectively) in these cultures, suggesting that uPAR-positive colonies can recapitulate the parental cell phenotype.

To further characterize the uPAR-positive population, we performed double-labeling experiments with uPAR-FITC, and CD44-PE as well as MDR1-PE on H211, H69AR, H1417 cell lines. uPAR-positive cells derived from SCLC cell lines (H211, H69AR, H1417) expressed CD44 on 50&#x02013;80&#x00025;, whereas MDR1 on 10&#x02013;40&#x00025; of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Expression of the above markers was also confirmed using fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000243-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

The cytotoxic effect of 5-FU has been ascribed to misincorporation of fluoronucleotides into RNA and DNA and to inhibition of the nucleotide synthetic enzyme thymidylate synthase, which mainly targets the fast dividing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000243-Longley1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

A major transporter of the ABC family is P-glycoprotein, the product of the MDR1 gene, which is produced by hematopoetic stem cells (HSC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000243-Zhou1">32</xref>.

Activation of CD44 occurs through heterodimerization of CD44 with growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, FGFR, HGFR, VEGFR, TGF-&#x003b2;R), which leads to activation of MAP kinase and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000243-Kobayashi1">34</xref>. CD44 stimulation by its ligand hyaluronan up-regulates the expression of uPA and uPAR mRNA, through activation of MAPK-Ras pathway, while PI3K activation stimulates MDR1 expression and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000243-Kobayashi1">34</xref>.

The CD44-MAPK-PI3K signaling leads to uncontrolled expression of uPA/uPAR and MDR1, which promotes invasive and multi-drug resistant cancer cell phenotype.

In summary, we have identified the uPAR-positive subpopulation of SCLC cells that possess high multi-drug resistance and clonogenic activity, while the uPAR-negative cells are sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs and display little or no clonogenic activity. We also provide evidence of association of uPAR, CD44 and MDR1 expression on SCLC cells. Further investigation is warranted to determine if targeting of this cell population will be critical for therapeutic success.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Kristine A.
