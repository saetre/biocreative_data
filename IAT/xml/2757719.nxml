USP7 affinity column profiling identified a complex between USP7 and human GMP synthetase (GMPS), which was shown to stimulate the ability of USP7 to cleave monoubiquitin from histone H2B <italic>in vitro</italic>. Accordingly, silencing of USP7 in human cells resulted in a consistent increase in the level of monoubquitylated H2B. The USP7-GMPS complex formed a quaternary complex with DNA-bound EBNA1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and, in EBV infected cells, was preferentially detected at the <italic>oriP</italic> functional element, FR, along with EBNA1. Down-regulation of USP7 reduced the level of GMPS at the FR, increased the level of monoubiquitylated H2B in this region of the origin and decreased the ability of EBNA1, but not an EBNA1 USP7-binding mutant, to activate transcription from the FR. The results indicate that USP7 can stimulate EBNA1-DNA interactions and that EBNA1 can alter histone modification at <italic>oriP</italic> through recruitment of USP7.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections persist for the lifetime of the host largely due to the actions of the EBNA1 viral protein. EBNA1 enables the replication and stable persistence of EBV genomes and activates the expression of other EBV genes by binding to specific DNA sequences in the EBV genome. We have shown that the cellular protein USP7 stimulates EBNA1 binding to its DNA sequences and that EBNA1 recruits USP7 to the EBV genome, which in turn recruits another cellular protein GMP synthetase. The complex of USP7 and GMP synthetase then functions to alter the chromatin structure at a region of the EBV genome that controls EBV persistence. These changes to the EBV genome are likely important for enabling the persistence of EBV genomes in infected cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma herpesvirus that infects over ninety percent of people worldwide.

The core domain is a &#x003b2;-barrel structure that forms the dimerization interface and makes transient sequence-specific contacts with the DNA through an &#x003b1;-helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Bochkarev1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Cruickshank1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

EBNA1 can also affect cellular processes through sequestration of cellular proteins, as best exemplified by the EBNA1 interaction with the ubiquitin specific protease USP7, also referred to as Herpesvirus Associated Ubiquitin Specific Protease (HAUSP). USP7 was originally identified as a binding partner of the ICP0 protein of herpes simplex virus (HSV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Everett1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and, since then, several cellular targets of USP7 have been identified including the p53 tumour suppressor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Cummins1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Song1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In response to genotoxic stress, USP7 binds and deubiquitylates p53 thereby protecting it from proteasome-mediated degradation. In addition to cleaving polyubiquitin chains, USP7 has been reported to reverse monoubiquitylation in some proteins (eg. p53 and FOXO4), thereby affecting their subcellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Marchenko1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-vanderHorst1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of USP7 was found to contribute to epigenetic silencing by reversing monoubiquitylation of histone H2B, and this activity required USP7 to be in complex with guanosine 5&#x02032; monophosphate synthetase (GMPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-vanderKnaap1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our studies on the EBNA1-USP7 interaction have shown that EBNA1 binds the N-terminal domain of USP7 (USP7-NTD), which is distinct from the catalytic domain, and is the the same domain that is bound by p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Holowaty2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

In particular interactions mediated by Ser447 in EBNA1 were shown to be critical for USP7 binding. Given the large size of USP7 (135 kDa) and the proximity of its binding site to the EBNA1-DBD residues that are inserted in the DNA minor groove (amino acids 461&#x02013;469), we wondered whether the USP7 interaction interfered with EBNA1 binding to DNA. Here we report that, contrary to our expectations, USP7 had a large stimulatory effect on the DNA-binding activity of EBNA1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and can form a ternary complex with DNA-bound EBNA1. Furthermore, USP7 was found to bind GMPS, forming a complex active in histone H2B deubiquitylation, and this complex was recruited to <italic>oriP</italic> in EBV-infected cells resulting in decreased H2B ubiquitylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effect of USP7 on DNA binding by EBNA1 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We initially assessed the effect of USP7 on the DNA binding activity of EBNA1 using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with a version of EBNA1 that has a shortened Gly-Ala repeat but has wildtype activity for all known EBNA1 functions (referred to as EBNA1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000624-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

For these experiments, GMPS, like USP7, was generated using a baculovirus and extensively purified. Analysis of the individual proteins by glycerol gradient sedimentation showed that USP7 migrates close to its calculated molecular mass of 130 Kd indicating that it is monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000624-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, top panel).

These results are consistent with GMPS stimulating deubiquitylation of H2B by USP7 by forming a stoichiometric complex with USP7 and are inconsistent with GMPS acting catalytically. We also asked whether the stimulatory activity of GMPS was specific to H2B deubiquitylation or also occurred for other USP7 targets.

In keeping with this hypothesis, we found that USP7 within this complex can mediate an interaction with GMPS which promotes deubiquitylation of histone H2B and that USP7 contributes to EBNA1-mediated transcriptional activation. However we have also shown that USP7 can stimulate the assembly of EBNA1 on <italic>oriP</italic> elements in transfected plasmids suggesting that USP7 might play a role in the initial association of EBNA1 with these elements upon initial EBV infection, and/or during the switch from the EBV latency form in nonproliferating cells, in which EBNA1 is not expressed (referred to as the latency program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-ThorleyLawson1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>), to latency forms in proliferating cells in which EBNA1 is expressed and bound to <italic>oriP</italic>.

The ternary complex formed between USP7 and DNA-bound EBNA1 also appears to require the interaction of the USP7-NTD with the EBNA1 441&#x02013;450 region for the following two reasons. First, the USP7-NTD was sufficient to supershift the EBNA1-DNA complex. Second, USP7 did not supershift the complex formed by DNA and EBNA1<sub>452&#x02013;641</sub>, which lacks the USP7 binding site but retains full DNA binding activity. However, it is curious that we observed partial but not complete stimulation of EBNA1 DNA binding by the USP7-NTD. We had previously assessed the ability of all USP7 stable domains to bind EBNA1 by examining the retention of partially proteolysed USP7 on an EBNA1 affinity column and only the USP7-NTD was found to bind EBNA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Holowaty2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that other regions of USP7 might have weak affinities for EBNA1. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data are consistent with a model in which the USP7-NTD binds EBNA1 residues 441&#x02013;450 to bring USP7 to EBNA1, enabling subsequent weaker or less specific interactions of other regions of USP7 with the EBNA1 DNA binding or C-terminal regions (452&#x02013;641). This might explain why the DNA binding activity of EBNA1<sub>452&#x02013;641</sub> was weakly stimulated by USP7. Another possible interpretation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> data is that the interaction of the USP7-NTD with EBNA1 is stabilized by the rest of USP7 due to effects on the structure of the USP7-NTD. However we do not think this is likely because the USP7-NTD is a TRAF domain that is stably folded in the absence of the rest of USP7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Saridakis1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Hu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While stoichiometric amounts of USP7 were sufficient to stimulate the DNA binding activity of EBNA1, only at higher USP7 concentrations was USP7 observed to be stably associated with the EBNA1-DNA complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. This indicates that the affinity of USP7 for free EBNA1 is higher than for DNA-bound EBNA1 and that a higher effective concentration of EBNA1 or USP7 may be necessary to drive the interaction of these proteins on DNA. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that USP7 is preferentially associated with EBNA1 on the FR element over EBNA1 on the DS element of <italic>oriP</italic>. The FR element is bound by 20 EBNA1 dimers as compared to 4 EBNA1 dimers at the DS element and, in both cases, the dimers within the element interact with each other to form a larger EBNA1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Frappier1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Goldsmith1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result the effective concentration of EBNA1 at the FR is higher than at the DS and this may drive recruitment of USP7.</p><p>An increasing number of human cellular protein binding targets of USP7 have been identified including p53, Mdm2, FOXO, March 7 and PTEN, all of which can be deubiquitylated by USP7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Cummins1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Song1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-vanderHorst1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Our proteomic profiling of USP7 protein interactions identified GMPS as another USP7 binding partner. We expect that other USP7 binding partners were not identified by this method due to their low abundance or transient nature of the interaction in response to particular stimuli (such as occurs with the USP7-p53 and USP7-FOXO interactions). The interaction of USP7 with GMPS is unique in that it appears to affect the activity of USP7 for specific substrates, as opposed to being a substrate itself. This is supported by the fact that GMPS levels are not altered when USP7 is silenced (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000624-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>The finding that human USP7 forms a stable complex with GMPS fits well with the observations of van der Knaap et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-vanderKnaap1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, where <italic>Drosophila</italic> USP7 was found to co-purify with GMPS. Our glycerol gradient sedimentation analyses indicated that human USP7 and GMPS form a 1&#x02236;1 complex and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays show that GMPS stimulates the ability of USP7 to deubiquitylate H2B (but not H2A), as observed for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> GMPS-USP7 complex. Van der Knapp et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-vanderKnaap1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> also showed that the stimulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> USP7 activity by GMPS did not require the catalytic activity of GMPS. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results are consistent with this conclusion because stimulation of USP7 deubiquitylation activity for H2B required stoichiometric amounts of GMPS (indicative of formation of a USP7-GMPS complex) and did not occur with substoichiometric amounts of GMPS (as would be expected for an enzymatic activity). Although our results are largely in agreement with those of van der Knaap et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-vanderKnaap1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, there are subtle differences in the findings of the two studies. First, <italic>Drosophila</italic> USP7 was not found to deubiquitylate H2B <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of GMPS while we found that human USP7 was able to cleave Ub-H2B <italic>in vitr</italic>o but that this activity was stimulated by GMPS. Second, In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, GMPS was found to stimulate deubiquitylation of p53 by USP7 and we have not observed this effect with human USP7. It is presently unclear whether these discrepancies are the result of the different <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction conditions and protein concentrations or reflect genuine differences in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human USP7.</p><p>ChIP assays consistently showed higher recruitment of USP7 and GMPS to the <italic>oriP</italic> FR over the DS and the BZLF1 promoter region, however some degree of interaction of USP7 and GMPS was also detected at the DS and BZLF1 regions as compared to the IgG negative control. This may indicate that these proteins are wide spread on chromatin where they could regulate multiple processes that are affected by H2B ubiquitylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000624-Weake1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore the contribution of H2B monoubiquitylation to gene expression is complicated and possible contributions to other DNA processes such as DNA replication are largely unexplored. We have observed that USP7 silencing increases H2B ubiquitylation at the FR as well as at LMP1 and Cp promoters and decreases transcriptional activation from the FR element, suggesting that H2B ubiquitylation is inhibitory to transcription controlled by the FR.
