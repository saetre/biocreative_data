Of all mammalian body cells, photoreceptor cells consume the largest amount of oxygen and generate the highest levels of oxidative damage. The accumulation of such damage throughout life is a major factor of aging tissues. Several multiprotein complexes have recently been identified as the major sensors and mediators involved in the maintenance of DNA integrity. The activity of these complexes initially seemed to be restricted to dividing cells, given their ultimate role in major cell cycle checkpoints. However, it was later established that they are also active in post-mitotic cells. Recent findings demonstrate that the DNA damage response (DDR) is essential for the development, maintenance, and normal functioning of the adult central nervous system. One major molecular factor in the DDR is the protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). It is required for the rapid induction of cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks. These cytotoxic DNA lesions may be caused by oxidative damage. To understand how ATM prevents oxidative stress and participates in the maintenance of genomic integrity and cell viability of the adult retina, we determined the ATM expression patterns and studied its localization in the adult mouse eye.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Atm</italic> gene expression was analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR experiments and its localization by in situ hybridization on adult mouse ocular and cerebellar tissue sections. ATM protein expression was determined by western blot analysis of proteins homogenates extracted from several mouse tissues and its localization by immunohistochemistry experiments performed on adult mouse ocular and cerebellar tissue sections. In addition, subcellular localization was realized by confocal microscopy imaging of ocular tissue sections, with a special focus on retinal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using RT&#x02013;PCR, we detected a band of the expected size, with its sequence matching the amplified <italic>Atm</italic> cDNA sequence. <italic>Atm</italic> mRNA was detected in most cell bodies of the adult mouse eye by in situ hybridization of ocular tissue sections with specific digoxigenin-labeled PCR-amplified cDNA probes. Western blotting with different specific antibodies revealed bands corresponding to the expected sizes of ATM and its active forms (ATMp). These bands were not observed in the analysis of protein homogenates from <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mouse tissues. ATM immunoreactivity was detected in the nucleus of all adult mice retinal cells and in most non-neuronal ocular cell types. The active phosphorylated form of ATM was also present in the retina as well as in non-neuronal cells of the adult mouse eye. However, its subcellular localization differed as a function of the cell type examined. A major finding of this study was that ATMp immunostaining in photoreceptor cells was exclusively in the cytoplasm, whereas ATM immunostaining was only in the nucleus of these cells. Furthermore, the specific and distinct ATM and ATMp immunolabeling patterns in photoreceptor cells were identical to those observed in the adult mouse cerebellar granule cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the expression profile of <italic>Atm</italic> gene and protein in the adult mouse eye. In particular, we observed a difference between the localization patterns of the active and inactive forms of ATM in photoreceptor cells. These localization patterns suggest that ATM and its phosphorylated activated form may be involved in both the protection of cells from oxidative damage and the maintenance of ocular cell structure and function. The protection mechanisms mediated by the two forms of ATM appear to be particularly important in maintaining photoreceptor integrity.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>corr-author</meta-name><meta-value>Marc Abitbol</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The retina is a part of the central nervous system (CNS). It forms from the prosencephalon early in embryogenesis and from the telencephalon at later stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Like the brain, retinal neurons are terminally differentiated, and post-mitotic cells must survive for as long as the organism does. The multiple visual processes occurring in the vertebrate eye require the production and consumption of huge amounts of energy. It is not surprising that the oxygen consumption of the mammalian retina is higher than that of any part of the adult brain or of other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. At the base of the outer segment of the photoreceptor, stacks of flat disks are generated daily, whereas disks at the tip are shed and phagocytosed by the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Both processes entail high levels of biosynthetic activity, involving a large number of metabolites. Thus, both RPE and photoreceptor cells consume large amounts of ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain.</p><p>Paradoxically, while light and oxygen are essential for vision, high levels of oxygen consumption create a stressful environment for neurons. Indeed, metabolic byproducts, primarily reactive oxygen species (ROS), constantly attack neuroretinal genomic and mitochondrial DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. ROS are involved in visible light-induced retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Oxidative damage is also implicated in several ocular diseases including inherited retinal dystrophies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], age-related macular degenerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], cataracts, and overexposure to sunlight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Oxidative damage accumulates throughout life, contributing to the aging process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The retina is a typical tissue, displaying frequent oxidative damage, including DNA damage; this causes the loss of retinal cells, which is particularly marked during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. As with all other neurons of the CNS, retinal cells are irreplaceable and must maintain the cellular integrity throughout the whole lifespan. These cells therefore require stringent defense mechanisms against ROS-induced damage to ensure their longevity.</p><p>Oxidative stress causes many types of DNA damage, such as oxidative DNA damage, single-strand breaks, or double-strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. DNA DSBs are potentially lethal to the cell and therefore must be rapidly recognized and repaired to avoid subsequent genetic damage and cell death or cancerous transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Multiprotein complexes involved in DNA maintenance as well as repair also function as sensors of DNA damage. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) are members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinases (PIKKs) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. They are activated at very early stages of the DNA damage response and are essential for transducing DNA damage signals to checkpoint control proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. The ATM protein is a major activator in the cellular response to DSBs, after initial DSB processing by the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The ATM interaction domain of the NBS1 C<bold>-</bold>terminus is required to recruit ATM to sites of DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. ATM is rapidly activated in a process of autophosphorylation and conversion of inert ATM homodimers or multimers to active monomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. ATM phosphorylates several downstream targets, including p53, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), Fanconi anemia complementation group 2 (FANCD2), and Nibrin (NBS1). These target proteins are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, stress response, and DSB repair or cell death by apoptosis, and possibly in sensing oxidative stress as well as damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. ATM is also activated in response to changes in chromatin structure caused by DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. After its rapid activation by autophosphorylation, ATM mediates cellular responses that lead to either repair and cell survival or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>].</p><p>Loss of ATM function in human and mouse cells causes defects in molecular pathways that are normally activated by DNA DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>ATM</italic> gene lead to ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, conjunctival telangiectasias, and other defects including immunodeficiency, cancer susceptibility, chromosomal instability and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. ATM is expressed in both embryonic and adult murine cerebral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. It is predominantly found in the cell nucleus of most proliferating cells, with smaller amounts of ATM detected in the cytoplasm of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>].</p><p>ATM is activated in response to increased levels of endogenous as well as induced oxidative DNA damage that includes, but is not necessarily limited to DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice spontaneously develop increased levels of oxidative damage and display mutation profiles suggestive of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. Elevated ROS levels in <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice are particularly marked in Purkinje cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. Oxidative stress is linked to several human diseases, especially cancer and neurologic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>], and thus may be involved in the pathogenesis of A-T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>].</p><p>Although ocular tissues, especially the retina, are exposed to extremely high levels of ROS, and despite the increased sensitivity of <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice to ROS-induced DNA damage, retinal neurodegeneration has not been reported in patients affected by A-T. Most studies aimed at elucidating the DSB response have been performed in proliferating cell lines. Nevertheless, it was recently shown that an intact DNA damage response is essential for normal development, organization, and maintenance of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. The pro-apoptotic ATM response to IR in the developing mouse CNS suggests that ATM functions at a developmental survival checkpoint, serving to eliminate neurons with excessive DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. The selective nature of IR-induced ATM-dependent apoptosis is p53-dependent and related to the differentiation status of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>]. Indeed, ATM-dependent apoptosis may be important for the development and maintenance of the nervous system.</p><p>Recent studies have reported that the role of ATM in the DNA damage response in the CNS&#x02014;including the retina&#x02014;is conserved between several species. In the zebrafish, surveillance of genome integrity is ATM-dependent. Indeed, a zebrafish mutant, <italic>pinball eye</italic> (<italic>piy</italic>), in which almost all retinal neurons undergo apoptosis during differentiation, has been recently isolated. A missense mutation in a small subunit of DNA primase (Prim1) underlies this mutant phenotype. This mutation does not affect cell proliferation but specifically induces extensive retinal neuronal apoptosis by activation of the ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. Similarly, ATM knockdown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eyes causes progressive degeneration of photoreceptors in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. In this model, post-mitotic neurons re-entered in the cell cycle, indicating that ATM is involved in a cell-cycle checkpoint and prevents post-mitotic neurons from undergoing degeneration.</p><p>The rare diseases A-T and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)-with mutations in the <italic>Nbs1</italic> gene encoding the Nibrin protein-share a variety of phenotypic abnormalities, such as spino-cerebellar ataxia, chromosomal instability, radiation sensitivity, and defects in cell-cycle checkpoints in response to IR. The similarity between A-T and NBS may be a result of biochemical links between ATM and NBS1 in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulatory pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. Indeed, the targeted disruption of murine <italic>Nbs1</italic> gene in the CNS shows a neurologic phenotype in these animals, characterized by the arrested proliferation of granule cell progenitors and apoptosis of post-mitotic neurons in the cerebellum; this leads to severe ataxia and microcephaly, typical clinical features of NBS in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>]. These mice also present microphthalmia due to reduced proliferation of the lens epithelial cells and early onset cataracts due to altered lens fiber cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>]. <italic>Nbs1</italic> disruption also leads to a dramatic impairment in the development of the eye and optic nerve, with severe dysfunction of the photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. This animal model recapitulates many clinical aspects of the neurologic phenotype in A-T patients, whereas <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice do not exhibit this neurologic phenotype. A simple explanation for the phenotypic differences between <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice and A-T patients could be that generation of the A-T cerebellar phenotype in the mouse requires a greater suppression of the DNA damage response than that achieved by deletion of the <italic>Atm</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>].</p><p>A recent study suggested that the formation of retinal and choroidal vascular abnormalities (idiopathic perifoveal telangiectasia) observed in patients of European-American descent is associated with <italic>ATM</italic> missense variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>], consistent with findings of an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>]. These findings further support the notion that neuronal degeneration is caused by a defect in the DNA damage response in both human A-T and animal models.</p><p>These studies demonstrate a fundamental role for ATM both in the development and maintenance of the eye. However, no previous systematic study has yet determined the precise localization of both <italic>Atm</italic> mRNA and protein in the adult murine eye. Thus, we performed such a study to better understand both the physiologic role of ATM in the adult murine eye and the pathological features of A-T, which seem to have a broader spectrum of ocular manifestations than previously thought.</p><p>In this study, we determined the distribution pattern of <italic>Atm</italic> mRNA and the localization of ATM protein in the adult mouse eye. We showed that ATM protein was essentially localized in the nucleus of retinal cells and non-neuronal cells of the mouse adult eye. High levels of the activated phosphorylated form of ATM (ATMp) were detected in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of most ocular cell types. Additionally, immunoreactivity was detected in the same cells for both ATM and ATMp; however, ATMp cellular localization in photoreceptor cells differed from that detected in other retinal cells. In mouse photoreceptors, ATM immunostaining seemed to be exclusively in the nuclei, whereas ATMp immunostaining was confined to the cytoplasmic compartment. The specific patterns of ATM and ATMp immunoreactivities appeared to be the same in the mouse cerebellar granule cells as those observed in mouse photoreceptor cells. This may be indicative of a particular susceptibility of these cells to oxidative damage. Our findings suggest that ATM and its phosphorylated form have common and redundant functions as well as distinct and specific functions in the maintenance of the integrity of ocular cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animals were handled in strict accordance with the ARVO Statement for Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.

Two labels colocalized if they were too close in the tissue to be resolved optically. The extent of colocalization of two labels was measured using the &#x0201c;Colocalization&#x0201d; module of Imaris software (6.1.2; Bitplane, Zurich, Switerland), described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>]. Briefly, this program analyzes images of confocal sections acquired in two channels. Each confocal section consists of an array of square elements called pixels. A voxel is defined as a prism in which the base is the pixel and the height is the thickness of the confocal section. Imaris colocalization analyzes the entire confocal image by measuring the intensity of each label in each voxel. An intensity threshold (on a scale of 0&#x02013;255 for pixel intensity) for each of the two labels is determined. In this study, we used a threshold of 30 (on a scale of 0&#x02013;255) for each label. Voxel intensity values above this threshold were considered to be above background intensity. A voxel was defined as displaying colocalization when the intensity of both labels was above their respective thresholds. The percentage of material colocalized was based on the number of voxels displaying colocalization and the intensities (material) of the two labels in each voxel. The Pearson coefficient measures the correlation between the values of intensity for the two labels in voxels showing colocalization. The Pearson coefficient lies between +1 and &#x02212;1, with positive values indicating a direct correlation and values near 0 indicating no correlation.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Total protein lysates were prepared in a Potter-homogenizer with cold buffer composed of 150&#x000a0;mM Nacl, 10&#x000a0;mM Tris HCL, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 1&#x000a0;mM EGTA, 2&#x000a0;mM NaOV, 190&#x000a0;mM NaF, 2&#x000a0;mM PMSF, 1% Triton X100, 0.5% NP-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich).

We detected ATMp immunostaining, mostly in the cytoplasm of photoreceptor cells, but mainly in the nuclei of other retinal cells. We also observed the same distinct and specific patterns of ATM and ATMp localization in the cerebellar GL. ATM protein was detected mostly in nuclei, whereas ATMp seemed to be localized in the cytoplasm of granule cells. To confirm this, we determined ATM and ATMp distribution and their subcellular localization using high-resolution confocal imaging of adult mouse retinal and cerebellar tissue sections.</p><p>Confocal imaging showed ATM immunolabeling to be present in the nuclei of the ONL. Colocalization of ATM and nuclear DNA staining (TO-PRO-3) was particularly marked at the peripheral nucleoplasmic euchromatin, which surrounds the central densely stained heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r67">67</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f13">Figure 13A</xref>). We used an anti-recoverin antibody to further investigate the subcellular localization of ATM in the ONL. Recoverin is a cytoplasmic protein involved in the visual transduction cascade in both types of photoreceptor cells (cones and rods). The anti-recoverin antibody revealed a specific immunostaining exclusively in the area surrounding the nuclear region, which is immunoreactive for ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f13">Figure 13B</xref>). We analyzed confocal images using the &#x0201c;Colocalization&#x0201d; module of the Imaris software package (Bitplane) to quantify the extent of ATM and recoverin colocalization. Results of the correlation analysis for the staining intensity of both antibodies were expressed as Pearson correlation coefficients. The Pearson coefficient is a number between +1 and &#x02212;1, with positive values indicating a direct correlation and values near 0 indicating no correlation. A representative image of ATM and recoverin staining is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f13">Figure 13B</xref>. The correlation coefficient of overlap between them was &#x02212;0.28. Thus, ATM and recoverin did not colocalize. These data provide strong evidence that ATM protein is localized mostly in the nuclei of photoreceptors cells. To confirm the localization of ATMp immunolabeling in the ONL, we performed a double immunostaining for ATMp and recoverin proteins.

DNA alterations caused by oxidative damage in the retina under normal conditions, during aging or in retinal degenerative disorders, are likely to be detected by the same sensor systems operating elsewhere in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r71">71</xref>]. We performed in this study the unequivocal detection of 8-oxo-dG in 2-month-old adult C57BL/6J mouse retina submitted to normal conditions of illumination, as well as the indisputable detection of 8-oxo-dG in normal cerebellar neurons, especially in granule cells. The detection of this abnormally oxidized base in these highly oxygenated cells likely reflects the oxidative stress striking many of their compartments, including mitochondrial and genomic DNA. Moreover, we did not detect any differences in the &#x003b3;H2AX retinal and cerebellar immunohistochemical pattern between <italic>Atm</italic> knockout and age-matched wild-type control mice. The technical approach used is not sensitive enough for detecting differences between <italic>Atm</italic> knockout and control mice. There might be compensatory systems that could make this detection extremely difficult whatever the method used. It seems plausible that ATR and DNA-PKcs serve to repair the DSBs potentially triggered by physiologic oxidative stress naturally existing in the retinal neurons in general and in the photoreceptor cells in particular. Furthermore, more detailed studies of retinal and cerebellar &#x003b3;H2AX phosphorylation throughout C57Bl/6J mouse lifespan are required for evaluating accurately the time course of spontaneous occurrences of DSBs and their extent both in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Similar studies should also be performed, both in retina and cerebellum, of <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and control mice at different stages of their lifespan, independently of any gamma irradiation.</p><p>The ATM protein acts to protect the nervous system from oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. Indeed, there is substantial evidence for a role of oxidative damage in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r72">72</xref>]. <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice have both high levels of oxidative stress in cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r74">74</xref>] and a defective DNA damage response. The cells of these mice spontaneously develop elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>], the cerebellar granular and Purkinje cells being particularly affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r75">75</xref>]. Additionally, cells from patients with A-T display genetic instability, hypersensitivity to radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>], and a continuous state of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. The A-T phenotype had been mostly attributed to a defective cellular response to DSBs and possibly also to an intrinsic defective cellular response to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. High levels of oxygen consumption and ROS production make the eye highly susceptible to the generation of a huge number of DNA lesions, including DSBs.</p><p>Several studies suggest that ATM protein is localized in the cytoplasm of human and murine cerebellar neurons, contrasting with its nuclear localization and functions in proliferating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r76">76</xref>]. However, several teams have examined the subcellular localization of ATM and have characterized the ATM-mediated damage response in mouse cerebellar neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r77">77</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r79">79</xref>]. These studies demonstrated that ATM is essentially nuclear in these cells, with a minor cytoplasmic fraction. Additionally, various features of the ATM-mediated damage response seen in neuron-like cells and spontaneous post-mitotic neurons are similar to those in commonly used cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>]. These features include the ATM autophosphorylation, which is a hallmark of its activation, and phosphorylation of several of its downstream substrates.</p><p>We investigated the presence and distribution of ATM mRNA and protein. ATM is present in cells as two different forms: ATM and ATMp. We thus performed a comparative study of their cellular distribution in the normal adult mouse eye and cerebellum.</p><sec><title>ATM and ATMp expression in non-neural tissues of the adult mouse eye</title><p>The cornea and lens are the first tissues to receive and absorb the light directly. ATM immunoreactivity was mostly detected in the nucleus, with a fraction observed in the cytoplasm of all corneal epithelial cells. ATMp showed strong staining both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of all epithelial corneal cells. It has been demonstrated that <italic>Atm</italic> gene expression is upregulated in response to a mitogenic stimulus, resulting in an increase in ATM protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r66">66</xref>]. Moreover, during cell cycle progression in physiologic conditions, ATM is activated during mitosis and localizes at centrosomes with p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r80">80</xref>]. As mitosis frequently occurs in the corneal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r81">81</xref>], it is not surprising that both ATM and ATMp immunoreactivities are detected in these cells. Similar observations were made in all dividing cellular and fiber compartments of the adult mouse lens. ATMp immunostaining suggests the possible involvement of ATM in the differentiation and cataractogenesis of the lens. Interestingly, mice heterozygous for <italic>Atm</italic> gene are more sensitive than wild-type animals to the cataractogenic effects of IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r83">83</xref>]. IR-induced cataracts result from the accumulation of abnormally differentiated progeny of the lens germinative cells, which are located in the equatorial region of the lens and are in complete continuity with the lens epithelium. Moreover, the targeted disruption of <italic>Nbs1</italic> in the lens altering the nuclear localization of the MRN (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) complex contributes to the early stages of cataract development due to impaired lens fiber cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>]. The MRN complex is essential for the cellular response to DNA DSBs and links DNA repair to activation of checkpoint signaling through the protein kinase ATM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r84">84</xref>]. Additionally, many proteins involved in DNA repair seem to be involved in cataractogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r85">85</xref>]. Indeed, overexpression of DNA polymerase &#x003b2; in the lens epithelium results in the early onset of severe cortical cataracts. This mechanism seems to be linked to DNA damage of lens epithelial cells, which can result in defective cell cycle control and apoptosis. Thus, ATM is present in its activated form in lens and corneal cells to regulate cell cycle and eliminate DNA damage.</p><p>Light as well as UV radiation cross the cornea and aqueous humor of the anterior chamber to meet iridal and ciliary body cells. As may be expected, ATMp shows strong immunostaining in these cells. Indeed, the iris is a potential site of free radical damage as it is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are particularly susceptible to peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r86">86</xref>]. Furthermore, many antioxidant enzymes, such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, catalase, and acidic glutathione S-transferase are present in the iris. These enzymes are capable of coping with high amounts of ROS and other free radical species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r87">87</xref>]. Similarly, several classical antioxidant enzymes, as well as 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (PRDX), are detected in the ciliary body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r88">88</xref>]. These enzymes are all involved in the neutralization of hydrogen peroxide and protect the cellular components against oxidative stress. These studies suggest a physiologic function for 2-Cys PRDXs in the protection of cells in the human ciliary body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r89">89</xref>].This suggests that ATM and ATMp are present to protect iridal and ciliary body cells from oxidative damage.</p></sec><sec><title>ATM and ATMp expression in the adult mouse retina</title><p>Photoreceptor cells continuously produce high levels of ROS as a byproduct of their various functions throughout their lifespan. Thus, as may be expected, we detected ATM and ATMp immunoreactivities in these cells. The POS may be highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation by ROS due to their high concentration of docosahexaenoic fatty acyl chains and to the proximity of the likely sources of ROS production: peroxisomes and mitochondria in the adjacent PIS and RPE cells during POS phagocytosis. In this study, we detected significant levels of ATMp in PIS and in the IPL and OPL. However, the subcellular localization of ATM and ATMp in photoreceptors differed substantially from that observed in other retinal cells. Indeed, ATM immunoreactivity in the ONL was mostly, if not exclusively, confined to photoreceptor nuclei and did not colocalize with recoverin immunoreactivity. In stark contrast with ATM staining in photoreceptor cell bodies, ATMp had a predominantly cytoplasmic localization.</p><p>The function of ATM in the cytoplasm is not clear, but previous findings in mice have demonstrated that <italic>Atm</italic> deficiency leads to abnormalities of cytoplasmic organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. The different patterns of intracellular localization reported for ATM may result from tissue-specific functions of ATM or from cell-cycle arrest inherent to the post-mitotic nature of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r90">90</xref>]. It is widely known that cells in which ATM is localized in the nucleus undergo cell division. By contrast, neurons are post-mitotic and undergo cell-cycle arrest. It remains to be established whether the differences in intracellular localization depend on the nature of the tissue as well as the cell type producing ATM, or on any cell cycle arrest.</p><p>In the neuroretina, the activated form of ATM is present in the cytoplasm, where it may protect against oxidative damage resulting from the high levels of ROS production by peroxisomes and mitochondria-major sites of oxidative metabolism. A pioneering study suggested that some ATM protein was localized outside the nucleus in cytoplasmic vesicular structures, more precisely in the microsomal fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r91">91</xref>]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that a portion of the extranuclear ATM was localized to peroxisomes. It was indeed shown that ATM might be bound to peroxisome membranes, but ATM internalization in the peroxisomal matrix still remains to be confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r92">92</xref>]. Another study described a marked preferential distribution of ATM immunoreactivity in the endosomes of the cerebellar granule neurons, with a much lower intensity of the ATM immunohistochemical staining in the Purkinje and molecular layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r76">76</xref>]. Cytoplasmic ATM may be required in the mouse brain for preventing lysosomal accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. A similar function of ATM may be required in retinal cells.</p><p>The reason for cerebellar degeneration in A-T is not clear. It has been attributed, by several investigators, to cytoplasmic functions of ATM that are not necessarily linked to the DNA damage response. PIS are highly enriched for peroxisomes and mitochondria. These organelles are sources of ROS but contain specialized antioxidant systems responsible for detoxifying reactive oxygen intermediates. However, when faced with excessively high oxidative stress and DNA damage, these systems cannot carry out their normal detoxification functions. ATM signaling is required to sense and initiate DNA DSBs repair. Therefore, nuclear genomic instability resulting from loss of this function has so far been considered as the major mechanism underlying the pathology of A-T. However, this disease presents a wide variety of symptoms, not all of which are readily explained by nuclear genomic instability. The study of cells and animal models of A-T has led to much speculation about additional pathogenic mechanisms.</p><p>Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that ATM is involved in other important functions. Two novel intertwined roles have been proposed for ATM: the regulation of ribonucleotide reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, and the control of mitochondrial homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r94">94</xref>]. ATM could modulate mitochondrial respiratory rates directly or indirectly, or through some DNA repair functions. Alternatively, ATM may regulate mitochondrial function in a DNA-repair-independent, hence metabolic, capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r95">95</xref>]. These new findings suggest that A-T pathophysiology is more complex than anticipated and may be closely related to the field of mitochondrial diseases. The photoreceptor mitochondria are confined within the inner segment and presynaptic regions of the OPL. ATMp protein was also readily detected within the OPL of the retina, where photoreceptors form synapses with neuronal bipolar cells. Most mitochondria in the presynaptic regions of the rod bipolar neurons are concentrated in the IPL. Indeed, axonal presynaptic terminals of the bipolar cells are either synaptically connected to AII amacrine cells&#x02014;which, in turn, are connected to the cone cells circuitry&#x02014;whereas cone bipolar cells are directly synaptically connected to the retinal ganglion cells of the cone pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r96">96</xref>]. Mitochondria are primary sites of ROS generation. Previous studies have shown that one characteristic feature of cells from patients with A-T is their state of continuous oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. A-T cells display intrinsic mitochondrial dysfunction, implicating ATM in the regulation of mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r95">95</xref>]. It is thus possible that the activated form of ATM reduces or prevents the deleterious effects of ROS production in the mitochondria-rich regions of retinal neurons, resulting from the normal functioning of the electron transport chain coupled with phosphorylative oxidation.</p><p>Although the highest oxygen concentrations are detected in the neural retina, one should not underestimate the importance of oxygen consumption and ATP production and thus the high amounts of ROS physiologically produced in RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r98">98</xref>]. ATM protein showed immunostaining in the nucleus of RPE cells, and strong ATMp labeling was observed in these cells. The RPE plays a central role in the physiology of the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r99">99</xref>]. RPE has numerous functions extremely important for the neural retina. It regulates the ionic environment of the subretinal space. It phagocytoses shed outer segments of photoreceptors. It converts the 11 <italic>trans</italic> retinal to the photosensitive 11 <italic>cis</italic> retinal, which is a key molecule of the visual cycle and phototransduction cascade. It also constitutes the outer hemato-ocular barrier of the eye. In addition to its light absorption properties, which generate free radicals, RPE is exposed to high oxygen concentrations, which may promote the generation of ROS, inducing oxidative damage in the event of impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r68">68</xref>]. Indeed, POS phagocytosis subjects RPE cells to an oxidative event of the same order of magnitude as that measured in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r100">100</xref>]. The event is not an extracellular macrophage-type respiratory burst, but may be due to intracellular hydrogen peroxide resulting from NADPH oxidase activity in the phagosome or from &#x003b2;-oxidation of ROS lipids in peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r101">101</xref>]. The significant levels of ATMp immunoreactivity observed in RPE cells may prevent the detrimental consequences, in particular DNA damage, caused by the frequent occurrence of oxidative events during physiologic RPE functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Distribution of ATM and ATMp in photoreceptor and cerebellar granule cells</title><p>The cytoplasmic localization of ATMp in photoreceptors is intriguing, as some form of retinal degeneration or dysfunction would be expected to occur in <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice and A-T patients. So far, no such abnormalities have been reported. It remains to be determined why distinct ATM and ATMp immunostaining patterns are observed in granule cells and photoreceptors but not in other neuronal cells.</p><p>One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be related to the specific neuronal cell types targeted in various neurodegenerative diseases involving either the cerebellum or retina, or both. Indeed, studies performed on postmortem cerebellum samples from A-T patients unequivocally demonstrate that cerebellar granule cells are major targets of the A-T neurodegenerative process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r102">102</xref>]. Whatever the molecular genetics cause might be for any type of inherited retinal degenerations, photoreceptor or RPE cells are the major retinal cell types that undergo degeneration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/Retnet/">RetNet</ext-link>). This highlights a specific susceptibility of these cells to oxidative stress and DNA damage. The molecular basis of this cell type-specific susceptibility remains to be elucidated. The Harlequin mutant mouse strain (Hq) is an important mouse model, combining both cerebellar granule and photoreceptor cell degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r103">103</xref>]. This model has enabled the establishment of a link between oxidative damage, cell cycle reentry, and cell death. Reduced levels of apoptosis-inducing factor (Aif) were obtained in this mutant by proviral insertion. The cerebellar neurons and retinal cells in this mouse thus display increased ROS-induced DNA damage accompanied by the appearance of S-phase markers, preceding apoptotic death, cell cycle activation in neurons, and DNA synthesis. The particular vulnerability of cerebellar granule and photoreceptor cells to ROS cannot be fully understood without consideration of the crucial functions of ATM in cell survival. The consequences of ATMp cytoplasmic localization in these cell types open up new possibilities in the study of ATM-associated molecular pathways in cell survival, both in physiologic conditions and in neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, the links between the cytoplasmic localization of ATMp and the major role played by mitochondria and peroxisomes in ROS production, including vicious circles of ROS overexpression in neurodegenerative processes, have not been clearly established.</p><p>Another alternative, but not exclusive, explanation of these distinct patterns of ATM and ATMp localization and their possible link to the apparent sparing of photoreceptor cells in A-T patients might be provided by findings obtained in the mutant Purkinje cell degeneration mouse model (<italic>pcd</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r104">104</xref>]. <italic>Pcd</italic> mutant mice undergo selective degeneration of specific neuronal populations: cerebellar Purkinje cells, photoreceptor cells, and olfactory mitral cells. A recent study has identified predegenerative changes, including DNA damage/repair foci in target neurons with a well preserved general cytology, in the early stages of the neurodegenerative process in these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r105">105</xref>]. The substantial vulnerability of photoreceptors in <italic>pcd</italic> mice contrasts with the apparent resistance of the same cells in <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice. Indeed, no retinal degeneration or dysfunction has been reported so far both in A-T patients and in <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r106">106</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r108">108</xref>]. However, A-T patients and <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice ophthalmic phenotypes must nowadays be reassessed by emerging noninvasive techniques increasingly available for exploring both human and mouse retinal structure and functions. This is mandatory for eliminating the possibility that A-T patients and <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient mice photoreceptors might actually display some subtle or manifest retinal dysfunctions corresponding to predegenerative alterations possibly reversible, such as those detected at the earliest stages of the neurodegenerative process occurring in the olfactory mitral cells of <italic>pcd</italic> mutant mice. Most A-T patients are affected by oculo-motor abnomalities. These abnormalities prevent in most cases the stable fixation of any visual stimulus. The absence of fixation often does not allow the ophthalmologists to perform complete and accurate visual examinations. Many A-T patients display a characteristic oculomotor apraxia (difficulty in the initiation of voluntary eye movements) frequently preceding the development of telangiectases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r109">109</xref>]. Moreover, many A-T patients present a strabismus and/or a nystagmus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r106">106</xref>]. It is important to emphasize that a nystagmus presumed to be of oculomotor origin might well be a consequence of retinal dysfunction or degeneration.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the discrepancy observed between ATM and ATMp cellular immunostaining patterns may involve the second master regulators of the DNA damage response: ATR protein kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r110">110</xref>]. Most ATM substrates can also be phosphorylated by ATR, and the major functions of ATR and ATM in cell-cycle control are overlapping and redundant. However, ATM and ATR respond to different types of DNA damage: ATM responds to DSBs, and ATR responds to replication stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r111">111</xref>]. Although ATR is primarily a replication stress-response kinase, it is also activated by DSBs. A major established fact must be emphasized: both ATM and ATR are interdependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r113">113</xref>]. In A-T cells, shared ATM and ATR substrates are not phosphorylated efficiently in response to IR because ATM is absent, causing a delay in end resection. Eventually, ATM-independent end resection does occur, allowing ATR to recognize the damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r114">114</xref>]. The consequence of this interdependency is that <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient cells have severe cell-cycle checkpoint defects in response to IR exposure. The overlapping and redundant functions of ATM and ATR, as well as their specific distinct functions, may vary according to neuronal cell type. Further experiments based on conditional knockout mice for ATR as well as ATM are needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>The importance of maintaining genomic stability in neurons cannot be overemphasized. Their finite number, long life, high metabolic rate, and continuous exposure to oxidative stress, together with high levels of gene transcription, require stringent control of genomic integrity. Our findings show that ATM is present in the adult mouse whole cerebellum and retina. ATM and its activated form seem to be required for preventing the accumulation of oxidative damage in the eye, especially in the photoreceptors of the retina. The ATM/ATMp system is involved in the protection from abnormal ROS production and irreparable lethal DSBs and DNA deletions. Retinal antioxidants and DNA repair systems seem to be particularly efficient in the adult retina; indeed, retinal malignancy is rare in adult patient retinas despite daily exposure to UV and visible light radiations and metabolism-induced damage. Our study provides further insight into the molecular building blocks and pathways underlying the highly efficient retinal systems protecting against oxidative stress, DNA damage, retinal degeneration, and malignancies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the president of Retina-France, Jean-Paul Ratte, and all the members of the administrative council of Retina-France for their continued financial and moral support.
