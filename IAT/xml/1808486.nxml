In this study, we draw an extended expression map of the rostral neural plate that reveals discrete domains inside the presumptive posterior forebrain.

To address whether these early subterritories are already committed to restricted identities, we began to analyse the consequences of ablation and transplantation of these specific cell populations. We found that precursors of the prethalamus are already specified and irreplaceable at late gastrula stage, because ablation of these cells results in loss of prethalamic markers. Moreover, when transplanted into the ectopic environment of the presumptive hindbrain, these cells still pursue their prethalamic differentiation program. Finally, transplantation of these precursors, in the rostral-most neural epithelium, induces changes in cell identity in the surrounding host forebrain.

These territories are further developing into highly specialised structures. In the case of the hindbrain, subdivisions are easy to detect morphologically, because rhombomeres are marked by visible borders during the course of development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. By contrast, the partition of the embryonic forebrain is not as obvious. The optic recess creates a border between the dorso-rostral telencephalon and the diencephalon. The latter is traditionally split into five different domains: the ventrally located hypothalamus, the prethalamus (or ventral thalamus), the thalamus (or dorsal thalamus), the dorsally positioned epithalamus, and the caudalmost pretectum &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The prosomeric model by Puelles and Rubenstein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d; suggests that the forebrain develops from a set of compartments called prosomeres. Boundaries between individual prosomeres are not morphologically visible. It is hypothesized, based on gene expression profiles, that the pretectum, the thalamus, and the prethalamus develop from different prosomeres &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Inside the embryonic diencephalon, morphological landmarks distinguish the forming hypothalamus and epithalamus. The zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) separates the prethalamus from the thalamus and pretectum, and has been shown recently to be required for the maintenance of prethalamic and thalamic identities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The molecular and cellular events leading to this complex organization are very poorly understood. Until recently, the neural plate itself was considered as a uniform epithelium of unspecified neural precursors. However, the detection of local signalling centres inside the forming neural plate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; indicates that, as the neural plate forms, at least some cell populations are strictly committed to distinct fates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. An increasing number of genes found to be expressed in restricted areas inside the rostral neural plate raise the possibility that a whole set of forebrain fate decisions are already taken inside this nascent neuroepithelium.</p><p>To gain knowledge of early forebrain development, fate map studies are of great interest. Fate maps of the rostral neural plate have been generated in frog, chick, and mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. These studies show that precursors of a given forebrain region are located in a very defined area of the neural plate, implying very little or no cell mixing during early brain development. In zebrafish and medaka, fate maps were generated at early, mid, and late gastrulation stages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b011">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. These fish neural plate maps establish the broad location of forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain precursors during neural plate maturation without reaching a resolution revealing the location of different diencephalic areas inside the neural plate.</p><p>Being predominantly interested in exploring cell-fate specification inside the presumptive diencephalon, we set out to generate detailed expression and fate maps of the diencephalic anlage in the mature neural plate (bud stage in zebrafish). We constructed our expression map by double in situ hybridization using a vast panel of forebrain markers. In addition, we established a refined fate map of the anterior neural plate using a laser uncaging technique. The results show a remarkable segregation of each major diencephalic domain. Finally, we show, using ablation and transplantation approaches, that one such domain, the presumptive prethalamus, is already strictly committed and irreplaceable inside the neural plate, and exerts some control upon fate decision of its surroundings. All together, our observations strongly suggest the existence of a novel neural plate &#x0201c;mid-forebrain&#x0201d; compartment, regulating early steps of forebrain partitioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>At Neural Plate Stage, the Presumptive Diencephalon Contains Distinct Domains of Gene Expression</title><p>To date, studies of gene expression in the vertebrate anterior neural plate have highlighted the presence of, from rostral to caudal, a horseshoe-shaped telencephalic domain, followed by a well-defined eye field, which in turn abuts a diencephalic anlage (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; for review).

Other genes that we found to be expressed in the posterior diencephalic domain III are <italic>wnt8b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g001">Figure 1</xref>E) and <italic>foxb1.2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g001">Figure 1</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g001">1</xref>G), which are expressed in an overlapping pattern with <italic>irx7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g001">Figure 1</xref>F) and are located posterior to <italic>fezl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). The resulting expression map of early forebrain markers shows a subdivision of the forebrain into six different domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g001">Figure 1</xref>H), which expands the previously described map of the rostral neural plate, revealing subdomains inside the diencephalic anlage.

This can be interpreted in two ways. Either the neural plate has already begun to keel and the presence of a seemingly continuous retinal field is due to invisible ventricular limits; or, alternatively, the neural plate is not strictly a single pseudo-stratified epithelium, and the hypothalamic precursors are lying, and moving, underneath a single eye field. This second interpretation is supported by previously published fate maps in axolotl &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Xenopus</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, and chick &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; showing an eye field uninterrupted by hypothalamic precursors; and by a very recent study, showing by computer-aided cell-tracking experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; that, contrary to what has been previously suggested &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, the eye field is not split by hypothalamic precursors in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Differential Dynamic Shape Changes in Rostral and Caudal Diencephalic Anlagen</title><p>To assess whether the different diencephalic subdomains found in our expression map give rise to specific areas of the developing forebrain, we set out to perform fate-mapping experiments. To achieve a high level of precision in labelling neural plate cells, we needed visible landmarks inside the rostral neural plate. We made use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic line <italic>her5</italic>pac:egfp &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, which shows a very robust GFP expression in a V-shaped territory covering the anlagen of the midbrain and rostral hindbrain at bud stage. Tallafuss and Bally-Cuif &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; showed that the most rostrally positioned GFP-expressing cells contribute exclusively to the developing midbrain. By combination with the forebrain marker <italic>pax6a,</italic> we confirm that <italic>her5</italic>pac:egfp is expressed directly posterior to the presumptive forebrain inside the neural plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">2</xref>D). Testing the location of the different diencephalic expression domains in combination with the GFP marker, we see a clear gap between the anterior diencephalic markers such as <italic>barhl2</italic> and GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">2</xref>F). Inside this gap, the expression of the posterior marker <italic>irx7</italic> is found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">Figure 2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">2</xref>H). The mild V-shape expression domain of the anterior diencephalon anlage at early bud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) has straightened by late bud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Conversely, the anlage of the midbrain still remains V-shaped, revealing a triangular posterior diencephalic territory at that stage. These shape changes are accompanied by the initiation of keel formation (neurulation), which positions the rostro-alar midbrain area on top of the posterio-basal diencephalon during early somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). As a consequence, at later stages of embryogenesis, the rostral part of the dorsal midbrain (optic tectum) appears to lie dorsal to the caudal-most ventral diencephalon (anterior tegmentum).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Specific Cell Populations inside the Rostral Neural Plate Give Rise to Distinct Regions of the Developing Diencephalon</title><p>Our expression map of the presumptive forebrain shows that cells located in the diencephalic territory differ already by their molecular constituents. To assess whether these molecular subdivisions match territories fated to become well-defined parts of the developing diencephalon, we performed fate-mapping studies of these specific cell populations, using the <italic>her5</italic>pac:egfp transgenic fish (permitting a high level of accuracy in cell targeting). We injected a caged form of fluorescein into one-cell stage <italic>her5</italic>pac:egfp transgenic embryos. Once the embryos reached bud stage, the fluorescein in 6&#x02013;10 cells, within arbitrary domains, were uncaged using a laser beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). A cross section of the neural plate just after uncaging shows that cells have been labelled all along the <italic>z</italic>-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), indicating that our setup allows precision along the <italic>xy</italic>-axes, but not control of depth inside the neural plate. When uncaging broad areas of the diencephalic neural plate, we observe that cells inducing a specific early diencephalic marker tend to keep expressing it specifically through somitogenesis. Indeed, when we carefully label the <italic>barhl2</italic> expression domain at bud stage, fluorescein is detected in a broad forebrain domain at prim 5, which closely resembles the expression pattern of <italic>barhl2</italic> in the diencephalon at the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g003">3</xref>D).</p><p>Because we wanted to establish a more precise fate map of the diencephalon, we decided to label smaller areas of the neural plate using an arbitrary grid. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>A shows a more abstract version of the expression map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g001">Figure 1</xref>, highlighting domains I to IV.

After a set of preliminary data using the grid on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, we refined our arbitrary domains to 12 colour-coded areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). For a better understanding of the results, we indicated different areas of the rostral brain in a prim5 embryo displaying <italic>shh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).

Forebrain cells of the anterior midline populate reproducibly the developing hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>E) and the eye field (not shown in our dissected brains), whereas cells posterior to those give rise to cells in the posterior tuberculum and anterior tegmental domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>G&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">4</xref>H&#x02032;). At the interphase between these two domains, we found a medial cell population displaying an unexpected behaviour. These cells, located inside the anterior diencephalic anlage revealed by the expression map, give rise to progenies that spread into a more-alar region than their caudal and rostral midline neighbours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). This domain corresponds to the ventral-most part of the presumptive ZLI (co-localises with the <italic>shh</italic>-expressing cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). Cells of the dark red&#x02013;labelled region in Figure4C become the prethalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>I). Close to this area, towards the edge of the neural plate (orange and light blue area), precursors of the dorsal telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>J) or dorsal telencephalon and epithalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>K) are found. When we labelled cells in a slightly more medial position (dark blue), the fluorescein was detected in a region spanning the dorsal telencephalon and the epithalamus, and abutting the dorsal pretectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>L). Cells of the bright red and dark green areas are destined to become part of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>M&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">4</xref>N&#x02032;). And cells positioned in the neural plate very close to our GFP landmark give rise to the most-caudal forebrain cells (pretectum and anterior tegmentum, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>O&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">4</xref>P&#x02032;).</p><p>If one compares the relative distribution of the subdomains at bud stage and at prim5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">5</xref>B), one can predict that a simple rostral shift of the midline accompanying the closure of the plate into a keel may be sufficient to create most of the embryonic brain pattern observed at prim5. To investigate whether such a shift takes place and if so, at which stage of development this movement happens, we used confocal microscopy to create time-lapse movies allowing to monitor the movement of neural plate cells from bud stage to mid-somitogenesis. We recorded <italic>her5</italic>pac:egfp transgenic embryos in which a proportion of the nuclei were labelled with red fluorescent protein (RFP; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). With this technique, we were able to follow cells of the diencephalic territory during the course of development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050069-sv001">Video S1</xref>). After three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">5</xref>D), the movement of specific nuclei could be tracked over the course of the recorded time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). We found that between bud and 5-somite stage (when the rostral neural plate is just completing closure), substantial movement can be observed in the ectoderm. Looking at the trajectories of the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>E), one sees that cells of the medial neural populations (basal plate) move anteriorly (green arrow), while lateral cells (alar plate) move either first towards the midline and then anterior (posterior alar forebrain, yellow arrow) or diagonally towards the anterior if they belong to the anterior alar forebrain (red arrow). These results therefore strongly suggest that the final location of the different diencephalic areas found in prim5 brains is taken during the beginning of somitogenesis, as the neural plate is &#x0201c;keeling.&#x0201d;</p><p>When we label cells of the midline (basal plate) in the neural plate, we observe often a more dorsal&#x02013;positioned progeny of the cells then we first expected. A dramatic example of such observation is the presence of basal plate cells inside the ZLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). In our uncaging experiments, we are not able to define the medio-lateral extent of the basal plate as there is no visible boundary between basal and alar neural plate. To find the border between basal and alar plate, we set out to mark solely basal-derived cells. It is known that, in zebrafish, cells of the basal plate originate close to the shield at 50&#x00025; epiboly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, cells of the alar forebrain are positioned in the animal pole region at the same stage. Therefore, we transplanted cells at 50&#x00025; epiboly on top of the shield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">5</xref>G) and selected at bud stage for embryos in which the transplanted cells were nicely spread along the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>H). By that approach, we labelled cells along the basal plate, similar to the uncaging experiment, but this time, because of the specific origin and movement of these basal cells during gastrulation, we were sure that just cells of the basal plate were marked. We let these embryos develop up to prim5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>I) or prim22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>J&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">5</xref>L) and compared the distribution of the transplanted cells to the expression of <italic>shh</italic>. Cells from the basal plate contribute to a bigger part of the rostral forebrain then we expected. In comparison to more caudal parts of the brain and spinal cord, basal plate cells can be found at much more dorsal positions in the rostral forebrain (up to the optic recess in its rostral-most portion), probably due to a high level of proliferation of these cells in the rostral central nervous system (CNS). Basal cells also contribute to the ventral part of the ZLI and thalamus (yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">5</xref>L). Just the tip of the ZLI (white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">5</xref>L) is always deprived of basal cells. In the hindbrain, very few cells can be found dorsal to the basal&#x02013;alar border (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref>K), which are likely to reveal directed neuronal migration into the alar plate.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The Ablation of the Anterior Diencephalon Anlage Results in Loss of the Prethalamus</title><p>Our fate-map experiments show that different forebrain territories, marked by the differential combination of gene expression, give rise to specific parts of the forebrain in later stages of development.

Studies done in fish, frog, chick, and mouse support the idea that, within the prospective forebrain, telencephalon and eyes are specified in regions of no or low Wnt activity, whereas posterior diencephalic fates are promoted by Wnt signalling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b029">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the molecular, cellular, and temporal regulations leading to the acquisition of specific diencephalic identities (such as prethalamic, epithalamic, hypothalamic, thalamic, and pretectal) have yet to be elucidated.</p><p>We established an expression map for genes expressed in the anterior neural plate at bud stage. At such an early stage of development, we were able to find distinct expression territories within the diencephalon anlage. This result is the first experimental evidence showing that as soon as a diencephalic identity can be detected molecularly inside the neural plate, it already contains at least four distinct domains of gene expression. One cannot exclude the possibility that there may even be further discrete subdivisions. In this respect, it is worth noting that the boundary of expression of some of the markers is dynamic. This could create a further molecular difference at a slightly later stage in development, by establishing differential temporal exposure to various proteins. Our fate-map results show that the progeny of each labelled cell group develops in a continuous clone and does not show cell mixing with neighbouring regions. Clones could be allocated to distinct parts of the diencephalon, thus allowing us to predict which cells of the neural plate will develop into the prethalamus, thalamus, pretectum, and their basal counterparts. Forebrain fate maps done in mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, chick &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, and frog &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; showed clonal distributions that suggest a similar lack of cell mixing. Knowing that a lot of morphological changes take place between bud and prim5 stage, such absence of cell mixing points to a considerable level of cohesion in cell movements. Indeed, our time-lapse imaging of the closing neural plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050069-sv001">Video S1</xref>) revealed that the relative positions of the mapped prim5 forebrain territories are established during the formation of the keel, by a series of coordinated movements. In fact, most of the mapped neural plate territories adopted their relative positions by the 5-somite stage (completion of keeling).</p><p>Superimposing our expression and fate-map data, specific combinations of gene expression can be associated to specific fates. Interesting is the observation that some gene expression in the neural plate seems to be kept in the same cells up to prim5 stage, as shown for the example of <italic>barhl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050069-g003">3</xref>D). In contrast, our work demonstrates that the neural plate <italic>flh-</italic>expressing cells (domain II), previously thought to include mostly the pineal gland precursors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, form a territory contributing to the dorsal telencephalon, the roof of prosomere 3, and the epithalamus. Just very few cells of this early <italic>flh</italic> expression domain in the neural plate participate to form the pineal gland itself, although <italic>flh</italic> is clearly mostly expressed in the epiphysis at prim5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The fate map also reveals two origins for the ZLI precursors (defined by expression of <italic>shh</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;): a basal cell population forms the ventral part of the peak, and an alar cell population is contributing to the more dorsal ZLI. Our results support the model by which the ZLI forms at the interphase between an already specified presumptive prethalamus and thalamus. Although our data do not support the existence of a wedge-shaped precursor for the ZLI in zebrafish (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; for review), it does not disprove the existence of a ZLI compartment, although in fish, such a segment would have to be much narrower than in chick. The basal contribution to the ZLI is strongly supported by our transplants of basal plate cells. These transplants also highlight basal participation to extensive parts of the anterior forebrain, such as the pre-optic area and the ventral portion of the thalamus.</p><p>Our clonal analysis further shows that one is able to distinguish between prethalamic or thalamic precursors in the neural plate, pointing to the possible presence of a compartment boundary between these two populations at bud stage. This supports the presence of compartments suggested by the prosomeric model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Our ablation and transplantation data indeed further suggest that the prethalamic territory acts as a compartment, with rostral and caudal boundaries, supporting the idea proposed in the latest prosomeric model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, of a prethalamus acting as a boundary separating the secondary prosencephalon from the rest of the forebrain. It also indicates that such prosomeres may form during or just prior to neurulation.</p><p>Our ablation experiments show that the prethalamic precursors are irreplaceable and therefore are acquiring a unique cell identity between mid and late gastrulation. Detection of residual prethalamic identity at different stages following ablation uncovers some degree of recovery in a small proportion of the prim5 brains. This is likely due to a rescue of the area during the course of development in embryos in which prethalamic precursors were only partially ablated. More importantly, the fact that we still see a dramatic effect in a good proportion of the prim5 embryos indicates that the area cannot be rescued if all prethalamic precursors are removed. This finding indicates the presence of specific factors defining prethalamic identity. A handful of genes are to date known to be expressed in the anterior diencephalic neural plate. The combinatorial expression of these candidates may lead to the establishment of prethalamic identity. Future extensive expression profiling and loss of function experiments will elucidate the genetic components of such fate commitment. Very recent publications show that Fez and Fez-like are key proteins for prethalamic identity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. However, loss of function of these genes does not completely abolish induction of the prethalamic territory, indicating that other factors are required.</p><p>It has been shown that the expression of <italic>shh</italic> in the ZLI is important for maturation of the prethalamus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. One could argue that by ablation of the prethalamic anlage at bud stage, we partially ablate precursor cells of the ZLI, which are positioned close by and therefore may impair proper development of the prethalamus. However, we know that patterning genes such as <italic>fezl</italic> and <italic>lhx5</italic> are still expressed in the prethalamic anlage in the absence of <italic>shh</italic> expression in the ZLI (S. Scholpp and C. Houart, unpublished data, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050069-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Moreover, we do not observe a loss of <italic>shh</italic> expression in domain I&#x02013;ablated embryos (unpublished data). The prethalamic identity is therefore lost in ablated embryos, despite the presence of <italic>shh,</italic> due to a loss of neural plate cells, which uniquely acquired a specific prethalamic competence.</p><p>Our transplantation experiments further confirm prethalamic fate commitment. Several hours following transplantation, prethalamic cells are still expressing markers specific to their fate. Strikingly, the transplanted cells not only keep the expression of the transcripts already present at the time of ablation, but are also able to pursue prethalamic differentiation. Indeed, these cells are able to express <italic>dlx2a,</italic> whose transcription starts to be induced in the wild-type diencephalon 6&#x02013;7 h after bud stage. As mentioned earlier, <italic>shh</italic> plays a crucial role in the development of the prethalamus. Therefore, one could speculate that <italic>shh</italic> signalling may be involved in the establishment of prethalamic identity and activation of prethalamic markers in our transplantation experiments. We excluded this possibility because both endogenous <italic>lhx5</italic> transcripts in the developing prethalamus and ectopic expression in the prethalamic transplants are observed in embryos with impaired Hh signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050069-sg001">Figure S1</xref>G&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050069-sg001">S1</xref>I). This finding demonstrates that the early steps in prethalamus development are not dependent upon Hh signalling and, therefore, that other factors are essential to establish the prethalamic fate within these cells of the neural plate.</p><p>When cells were transplanted away from their origin into the presumptive hindbrain, we observed a cell-autonomous induction of prethalamic markers and no induction of telencephalic markers. The result is rather more complex when transplants are placed in the presumptive forebrain. In these transplants, we observe cell&#x02013;non-autonomous expression of the prethalamic transcripts <italic>dlx2a</italic> and <italic>lhx5</italic>. This surprising result suggests that some prethalamic precursors not only maintain their identity, but are also able to influence surrounding forebrain tissues. The prethalamic cells may secrete one or a combination of signalling factors, which can be interpreted by neighbouring forebrain tissue, but not by hindbrain cells. In our operated embryos, only a fraction of the transplanted domain is generally able to induce cell&#x02013;non-autonomous changes, suggesting that a specific subset of the prethalamic precursors contains the signalling property. This signal is able to impose prethalamic identity to presumptive forebrain cells. In the wild-type situation, it is therefore likely that the action of this (these) presumptive signal(s) is restricted to a narrow region by formation of strict boundaries rostral and caudal to the prethalamic precursors. Here again, Hh is a potential candidate because Vieira and Martinez &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050069-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; observe some similar effects when transplanting quail Hh-expressing diencephalic basal plate into chick alar forebrain areas.
