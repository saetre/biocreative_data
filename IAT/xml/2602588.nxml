Here, genetic and pharmacologic approaches show that the absence of neutrophils leads to acute blood pressure dysregulation. Following neutrophil depletion, systolic blood pressure falls significantly over 3 days (88.0 &#x000b1; 3.5 vs 104.0 &#x000b1; 2.8 mm Hg, day 3 vs day 0, mean &#x000b1; SEM, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), and aortic rings from neutropenic mice do not constrict properly. The constriction defect is corrected using <sc>l</sc>-nitroarginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) or the specific inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor 1400W, while acetylcholine relaxation is normal. iNOS- or IFN&#x003b3;-deficient mice are protected from neutropenia-induced hypotension, indicating that iNOS-derived nitric oxide (NO) is responsible and that its induction involves IFN&#x003b3;. Oral enrofloxacin partially inhibited hypotension, implicating bacterial products. Roles for cyclooxygenase, complement C5, or endotoxin were excluded, although urinary prostacyclin metabolites were elevated. Neutrophil depletion required complement opsinization, with no evidence for intravascular degranulation. In summary, circulating neutrophils contribute to maintaining physiological tone in the vasculature, at least in part through suppressing early proinflammatory effects of infection. The speed with which hypotension developed provides insight into early changes that occur in the absence of neutrophils and illustrates the importance of constant surveillance of mucosal sites by granulocytes in healthy mice.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="CS100">GM15431</contract-num><contract-num rid="CS100">ES13125</contract-num><contract-num rid="CS100">DK48831</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="CS100" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">National Institutes of Health</contract-sponsor><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circulating neutrophils interact with the vessel wall through the action of adhesion molecules including P- and L-selectins. Although the mechanisms by which they bind to endothelium, roll, adhere, and extravasate are understood, whether neutrophils themselves exert functional influences on the vessel wall itself has not been studied in vivo. There are several potential mechanisms by which these cells may regulate vascular function in vivo. On activation of NADPH oxidase (respiratory burst), they generate superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x000b7;&#x02212;</sup>), a reactive oxygen species that reacts with nitric oxide (NO), the primary mediator of endothelium-dependent relaxation in large vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> NADPH oxidase&#x02013;mediated NO consumption occurs immediately on activation of neutrophils by fMLP, and rates of NO removal are 2- to 3-fold greater than corresponding O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x000b7;&#x02212;</sup>-generation rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> This could have significant consequences for the ability of NO to maintain vascular tone in vivo, especially during inflammation. Reaction of NO with O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x000b7;&#x02212;</sup> forms peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), a powerful oxidant and nitrating agent that may itself lead to vascular dysfunction through protein and lipid modification, and thiol depletion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> nitrates prostacyclin synthase, the enzymatic source of another important endothelial-derived vasorelaxant, prostacyclin (PGI2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> Neutrophils also may remove NO indirectly through myeloperoxidase (MPO)&#x02013;catalyzed reactions. Following degranulation, MPO binds to the endothelium where it can potentially remove NO during peroxidase turnover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> Apart from direct oxidative reactions, neutrophils could influence vascular function through release of mediators that exert direct vasoactive effects, including cytokines, adenosine, proteases, and phospholipases. Finally, through interactions with adhesion molecules they may activate endothelial signal transduction, although this is less well understood</p><p>Previous experiments have addressed the idea that neutrophils may modulate vascular function by examining vascular tone in isolated aortic rings in vitro. Addition of activated neutrophils prevented or reversed endothelium-dependent relaxation or elicited a O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x000b7;&#x02212;</sup>-dependent vasoconstriction of rabbit or cat arteries, consistent with a role for oxidative inactivation of NO by the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> Separately, other studies implicated prostaglandins or leukotrienes in the vasoconstrictive effect of neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> However, studies have not addressed the ability of neutrophils to modulate vascular function in vivo.

The aorta was dissected of adipose tissue, cut into rings (2-3 mM), and suspended in an isometric tension myograph (model 610; DMT, Aarhus, Denmark) containing Krebs-Henseleit buffer (120 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 24 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.4) at 37&#x000b0;C and gassed at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>. A resting tension of 3 mN was maintained, and changes in isometric tension were recorded via Myodaq software (DMT). After a 60-minute equilibration period, vessels were primed with 48 mM KCl before a concentration (0.1 &#x003bc;M) of phenylephrine (PE) producing approximately 75% contraction was added. Once responses stabilized, 1 &#x003bc;M acetylcholine (ACh) was added to assess endothelial integrity. Any rings that did not maintain contraction to PE, or relaxed less than 50% of the PE-induced tone after addition of ACh (1 &#x003bc;M) were discarded. No differences in the number of rings discarded between wild-type and neutrophil-depleted vessels were observed. Rings were washed for 30 minutes, after which a cumulative concentration-response curve to PE was constructed (1 nM to 0.1 mM) to assess vasoconstrictor activity. The tissues were then washed for 60 minutes to restore basal tone before contracting to approximately 80% of the 0.1 mM PE-induced response. Once a stable response to PE was observed, cumulative concentration response curves were constructed to ACh (1 nM to 10 &#x003bc;M), and then after a 30-minute wash, to DEA-NONOate (0.1 nM to 0.1 mM; Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI), to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations, respectively.

Indeed, L-NAME normalized vasoconstriction of rings from neutropenic animals to levels comparable with healthy controls. Endothelial-dependent relaxation to ACh was unaffected by neutropenia indicating that eNOS bioactivity is unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F). However, a role for iNOS is indicated since the specific inhibitor 1400W (10 &#x003bc;M, 30 minutes) normalized PE constriction, similar to L-NAME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G). Furthermore, in vivo deletion of iNOS totally prevented the neutropenia-dependent fall in systolic BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Finally, using immunohistochemistry, an increase in iNOS staining was seen to colocalize with smooth muscle fibers in neutropenic vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B,C).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>iNOS- or IFN&#x003b3;-deficient mice are resistant to the hypotensive effects of neutropenia.</bold> (A) iNOS knockout mice are resistant to the hypotensive effects of neutrophil depletion.

While the mechanisms by which they migrate and activate are well characterized, whether their interaction(s) with the vasculature during normal circulation has functional consequences on blood vessel behavior has not been studied before. Herein, we uncovered a novel facet of neutrophil biology, namely the requirement of these cells for maintenance of normal vascular tone in otherwise healthy mice. Benign hereditary neutropenia is found in certain population groups, including Yemenites, Jews, black Bedouins, West Indians, and Arab Jordanians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref></sup> In these groups, the neutropenia is usually mild, with only up to 50% decrease from normal range, and is not associated with increased risk of severe infection. However, Yemenites (with on average 25% lower neutrophil counts) have lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure than non-Yemenites with the difference being statistically significant for females (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref></sup> The drop is smaller (3-5 mm Hg drop) than noted herein, although the extent of neutropenia in Yemenites is mild. Neutropenia in humans also occurs following chemotherapy (eg, in cancer). Hypotension occurs in this group in the context of fever and infection, however a small drop in blood pressure may be missed in the clinical setting in the absence of other symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref></sup></p><p>In our studies, neutropenia was induced by immunodepletion of Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> The protocol resulted in a complete and selective removal of neutrophils within 24 hours that persisted for up to 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A,B). This model has been extensively used by others to study immune responses and behaves similarly to chemical neutropenia (eg, induced by vinblastine, cyclophosphamide or Gfi1 deficiency).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref></sup> The mechanism involves opsonization of antibody-coated cells with C3b, then their removal through the reticuloendothelial system, since C3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice but not C5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were protected against RB6-8C5&#x02013;induced neutropenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). There was no evidence of intravascular activation of neutrophils, since MPO was not found either in plasma or localized to vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Hypotension occurred within 3 days of neutropenia, coinciding with an inability of the aorta to maintain tone in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C,D). fMLP-activated human neutrophils consume NO in vitro exclusively through NADPH oxidase, therefore inhibition of NO consumption through neutrophil depletion was considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> However, neutropenia was complete by day 1, while onset of hypotension was more gradual. This instead suggested a mechanism involving alterations in gene expression. Pharmacologic and genetic studies established that elevated NO generation was responsible and that this was generated exclusively via iNOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>E-G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A-C). iNOS induction involved IFN&#x003b3;, although elevations in mRNA for this cytokine were not found in aortic tissue of neutropenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D,E, and data not shown). This suggests that IFN&#x003b3; signaling is not up-regulated via changes in its protein level. Alternatively, it may involve regulation of SOCS1 or PIAS1, proteins that inhibit by preventing IFN&#x003b3;-mediated STAT1, signaling.</p><p>The effect of antibiotics indicated that bacterial products were involved, but not LPS since its plasma levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C,D). Numerous other bacterial products can synergize with IFN&#x003b3; to up-regulate iNOS via TLR receptors, including lipotechoic acid and peptidoglycans. While neutropenia in humans increases susceptibility to infection, the speed with which these vascular effects become apparent, in the absence of overt clinical symptoms, was notable. The mice were certified free from 11 viruses, 14 bacterial strains, 6 parasites, and various mycoplasma and fungi when obtained and were housed in a clean facility (routinely tested negative for 17 viruses, 3 parasites, and 15 bacterial strains) for approximately 2 weeks. The results reveal the critical role that neutrophils play in continuous suppression of infection, even in healthy &#x0201c;clean&#x0201d; animals. No reports exist regarding how soon humans with neutropenia experience subclinical infection. However, healthy Yemenites have elevated hsCRP and fibrinogen, suggesting that chronic low-grade inflammation due to infection occurs in humans with minor forms of neutropenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref></sup> In more severe neutropenia, for example associated with fever and leukemia in children, hypotension is one of the major predictive risk factors for an invasive bacterial infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref></sup> In our study, the origin of the bacteria is not known, however the gastrointestinal tract is a potential source. Patients with hematologic malignancies can develop neutropenic enterocolitis, and gut sterilization has been advocated as a treatment for preventing infection in granulocytopenic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref></sup> Several other sites are also possible, including respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin, oral cavity, and ear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref></sup></p><p>In a wound healing model, neutrophils exert an active anti-inflammatory action in vivo via inhibiting tissue TNF&#x003b1; and IL1&#x003b2; synthesis, through generation of an unknown factor of less than 3 kDa, but this factor has not been identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> In the light of our data, a role for bacteria stimulating inflammation in that study cannot be excluded. We looked for changes in lipid signaling mediators (&#x0003c; 3 kDa) that decrease blood pressure or inflammation. Neutropenic mice generated more prostacyclin in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E), however vascular tone was not restored using prostaglandin H synthase inhibitors in vitro or in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and data not shown). Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), an anti-inflammatory lipid generated by neutrophils, was not detected in plasma of either control or neutropenic mice. Previous studies have reported levels of LXA4 of 5 ng/mL in murine plasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref></sup> This would be easily detected by our mass spectrometry method, which has a limit of quantitation for eicosanoids around 1 pg. The discrepancy may be due to use of ELISAs to measure LXA4, a technique known to be susceptible to overestimation, as recently described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref></sup> We also measured TGF&#x003b2;1, since inflammatory-challenged neutropenic mice generate less, and mice lacking this cytokine have elevated iNOS and IFN&#x003b3; signaling in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref></sup> However, we did not detect changes in plasma TGF&#x003b2;1 or aortic TGF&#x003b2;1 mRNA in our model (not shown). While our study showed that the most likely effect of IFN&#x003b3; was to alter iNOS expression and NO generation, it should be appreciated that this cytokine may exert additional influences that could contribute to altered vasoconstriction. These may include changes in IFN&#x003b3;-regulated vessel wall expression of recently described NOX isoforms, altered mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and alterations in NOS coupling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref></sup></p><p>These studies indicate that neutrophils actively exert an anti-inflammatory effect in the vasculature in vivo, through blocking proinflammatory actions of bacteria. However, this may apply only to neutrophil counts below and up to normal, since elevated neutrophils have been independently associated with increased inflammation and atherosclerosis in a number of separate studies, as noted in Madjid et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref></sup> and references therein. In that case, their proinflammatory action is likely due to direct effects of the neutrophils themselves, for example through mediating oxidative damage to the vascular wall. Up to now, studies designed to uncover roles of neutrophils in pathophysiology have focused on responses in inflammation models. Consequently, there is no information regarding how they might influence physiological processes in otherwise healthy animals, or how quickly inflammation may become apparent in their absence. This study shows that a constant surveillance of the vasculature by neutrophils is critical for eliminating low-grade bacterial infections and mechanistically helps to maintain the homeostatic regulation of vascular tone. The results provide insight into early changes that occur in neutropenic vessels and are relevant for our understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition in humans.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>An Inside <italic>Blood</italic> analysis of this article appears at the front of this issue.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.
