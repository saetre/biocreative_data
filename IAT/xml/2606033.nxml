However, several reports have demonstrated that TLR3 signaling is either dispensable or even harmful following infection with certain viruses. Here, we asked whether TLR3 plays a role in the response to coxsackievirus B4 (CB4), a prevalent human pathogen that has been associated with pancreatitis, myocarditis and diabetes. We demonstrate that TLR3 signaling on macrophages is critical to establish protective immunity to CB4. TLR3 deficient mice produced reduced pro-inflammatory mediators and are unable to control viral replication at the early stages of infection resulting in severe cardiac damage. Intriguingly, the absence of TLR3 did not affect the activation of several key innate and adaptive cellular effectors. This suggests that in the absence of TLR3 signaling on macrophages, viral replication outpaces the developing adaptive immune response. We further demonstrate that the MyD88-dependent signaling pathways are not only unable to compensate for the loss of TLR3, they are also dispensable in the response to this RNA virus. Our results demonstrate that TLR3 is not simply part of a redundant system of viral recognition, but rather TLR3 plays an essential role in recognizing the molecular signatures associated with specific viruses including CB4.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protective immunity to viral infection is often critically dependent on early recognition of the pathogen. This first-line of defense against viral infection is mediated, in part, by a series of pattern-recognition receptors that include Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Rig-like helicases (RLH). TLRs act as sensors that can recognize several molecular patterns associated with viruses including surface glycoproteins (TLR1, 2 and 4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Boehme1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Triantafilou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and nucleic acids (TLR3, 7, 8 and 9) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Alexopoulou1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Lund1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Recognition of a cognate ligand induces a downstream signaling cascade culminating in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and maturation of antigen presenting cells (APCs). As such, TLR signaling contributes to the establishment of an anti-viral state and, by activating APCs, to the establishment of an adaptive anti-viral response.</p><p>TLR3 has long been proposed to play an important role in the innate response to viruses due to its capacity to recognize double stranded (ds) RNA, a common intermediate of viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Alexopoulou1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Binding of dsRNA to TLR3 initiates a unique signaling cascade that, unlike other TLR ligands (with the exception of some TLR4 ligands that can initiate two separate signaling pathways) does not depend on the signaling adaptor MyD88 but rather utilizes the molecular adaptor TRIF (or TICAM-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Oshiumi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Hoebe1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the well documented capacity of Poly I&#x02236;C, a synthetic mimic of dsRNA, to increase antiviral immunity in a TLR3 dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Ichinohe1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Ashkar1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, the protective role of TLR3 <italic>in vivo</italic> remains controversial. For instance, a protective role for TLR3 has been demonstrated in a model of viral induced myocarditis. Following encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) challenge, TLR3 deficiency resulted in heightened mortality that correlated with increased viral replication and viral mediated cardiac damage. However, in this study TLR3 signaling was only partially protective as EMCV infection of wild-type (WT) mice still resulted in over 75&#x00025; mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Hardarson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR3 was also shown to play a minor role in the immune response to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Tabeta1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and murine norovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-McCartney1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> as TLR3 deficient mice were observed to harbor increased viral titers following infection although this did not affect their capacity to survive viral infection. In contrast, TLR9 deficient mice rapidly succumbed to infection by MCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Tabeta1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, a dominant negative TLR3 allele was found in patients suffering from Herpes Simplex encephalitis implying a role for this receptor in protection from neurotropic viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Zhang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR3 signaling may be of particular importance for the immune responses to viruses that do not directly infect dendritic cells (DCs) as it was demonstrated to promote cross-priming of CD8 T cells in response to dsRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Schulz1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, Edelmann and colleagues have reported that in the absence of TLR3 signaling, mice can still mount a protective immune response following challenge with various viruses, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), MCMV, and reovirus, resulting in unaffected viral clearance and no increase in viral pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Edelmann1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, it was reported that TLR3 does not play a major role in the immune response of astrocytes to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Carpentier1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, TLR3 has been observed to play a deleterious role towards the host following pathogen challenge in several models. TLR3 deficiency has been reported to confer a survival advantage following influenza A challenge due to a reduction in inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-LeGoffic1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and was also determined to protect mice following challenge with lethal doses of Punta Toro Virus by reducing viral-induced liver pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Gowen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, TLR3 deficiency was shown to be beneficial following West Nile virus infection. It was demonstrated that while the absence of TLR3 signaling resulted in increased peripheral viral load it also served to reduce neural inflammation leading to a decrease in both viral loads and pathology in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Wang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, a recent report has suggested that TLR3 may act to protect from West Nile virus infection directly within neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Daffis1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these data demonstrate that TLR3 may only be required for the response to a specific subset of viruses. Further, multiple reports suggest that TLR3 signaling is either dispensable or even harmful following infection with other RNA viruses.</p><p>Coxsackievirus B4 (CB4) is a small, single stranded, positive sense RNA picornavirus with tropism for the pancreas, where it has been associated with induction of pancreatitis and autoimmune diabetes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Richer1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>), and the heart where it can cause both acute and chronic myocarditis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Rose1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. It is estimated that coxsackieviral infections are responsible for nearly a third of all new cases of dilated cardiomyopathy a disease responsible for the majority of heart transplantations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Wang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Taylor1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, CB4 was originally isolated from a patient suffering from type 1 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Yoon1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and has been demonstrated to accelerate onset of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Richer2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Serreze1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The immune response to this virus may be strongly dependent on innate mechanism as it has been previously demonstrated that SCID mice are capable of surviving infection even at high infectious doses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Horwitz1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. It was previously reported that CB4 can signal through TLR4 on pancreatic islet cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Triantafilou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and that a closely related virus, CB3, signals through TLR8 on cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Triantafilou2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The generation of dsRNA, the ligand for TLR3, is a common by-product of the replication cycle of single stranded RNA viruses including picornaviruses like coxsackievirus and arenaviruses like LCMV. The importance of TLRs and particularly TLR3 following CB4 infection <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that the early immune response to CB4 is solely dependent on TLR3 signaling as infection of TLR3 deficient but not MyD88 deficient mice had fatal consequences. We have further demonstrated that this increased mortality is due to the inability of the host to control viral replication rapidly leading to severe cardiac damage. Interestingly, TLR3 deficiency did not affect the maturation of APCs or the activation of the adaptive immune response. Rather, TLR3 deficiency decreases the production of the pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-&#x003b1; and CCL5 resulting in uncontrolled viral replication that outpaces the developing adaptive immune response. Most importantly, we demonstrate that adoptive transfer of WT macrophages is sufficient to protect TLR3 deficient mice from succumbing to CB4 infection indicating that TLR3 signaling on macrophages is critical for the host response to this RNA virus.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TLR3 plays a critical role for survival following CB4 infection</title><p>In order to elucidate the role of TLR3 in the innate immune response to coxsackievirus, NOD mice deficient for TLR3 (TLR3KO) were infected with sublethal doses of CB4 and were monitored for survival. As a control, NOD mice lacking MyD88 (MyD88KO) (and therefore unable to signal from the remaining TLRs) were also infected with CB4. We observed a significant increase in mortality following CB4 challenge in TLR3KO mice with nearly 60&#x00025; of TLR3KO mice dying by day 7 compared to less than 15&#x00025; of WT NOD and MyD88KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). For comparison to other studies and to ensure that the phenotype observed was not simply dependent on mouse strain differences, mice were challenged with LCMV as TLR3 was previously demonstrated to be dispensable for the immune response to this RNA virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Edelmann1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. As previously reported, deficiency of TLR3 did not result in mortality following LCMV infection confirming that TLR3 is not necessary for the response to this virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Edelmann1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, this suggests that while TLR3 plays a critical role in the response to some RNA viruses like CB4, it is not necessary for the control of other RNA viruses like LCMV. Importantly, the MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathway is not required for survival following CB4 challenge, nor can it compensate for the lack of TLR3 signaling.</p><fig id="pone-0004127-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004127.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Deficiency of TLR3 results in increased mortality and increased viral replication following CB4 challenge.</title><p>A) WT NOD (solid grey line), TLR3KO (solid black line) and MyD88KO mice (dashed black line) were challenged with 400 pfu of CB4 and mortality was monitored.

No significant differences were observed at day 3 PI (data not shown). Conversely, we observed a significant increase in viral replication in the heart and liver of TLR3KO mice compared to both WT NOD and MyD88KO mice at day 7 PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We also observed increased viral replication in the pancreas of TLR3KO mice although this difference did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Most notably, at day 7 PI the viral titers in the hearts of TLR3KO mice were approximately 100 and 1000 fold higher than that observed in WT NOD and MyD88KO mice respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We next determined whether increased viral replication resulted in heightened tissue damage that might explain the rapid death observed in TLR3KO mice. Histological examination of pancreatic tissue revealed extensive damage in TLR3KO mice that was comparable to WT NOD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, blood glucose levels were comparable in all 3 strains at day 3 and 7 PI (data not shown) suggesting that pancreatic dysfunction is unlikely to explain the increased mortality observed. Analysis of TLR3KO livers did not reveal any obvious differences in pathology compared to either WT NOD or MyD88KO mice following CB4 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Liver damage was further analyzed at day 3 and 7 PI using a quantitative assay based on the levels of Alanine transaminase (ALT) in the serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed increased ALT levels in the serum of TLR3KO mice compared to WT NOD mice at day 3 and 7 PI although this difference never reached statistical significance suggesting that liver damage is not a major contributor to the observed increased mortality in TLR3KO mice. Finally, we measured the extent of cardiac damage. Histological analysis revealed an atypical increase in the number and severity of cardiac lesions at day 7 PI in TLR3KO mice compared to both WT NOD and MyD88KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

TLR signaling can also affect the activation of the adaptive immune response either directly or through effects on the APC population. As such, we sought to determine the activation status of several important antiviral effectors following CB4 infection in TLR3KO mice. First, we determined the activation of NK (pan-NK<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and NK T (pan-NK<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) cells by measuring surface expression of the activation marker CD69 by flow cytometry. At 48 hours post-infection, we observed that both NK and NKT cells from TLR3KO mice upregulated CD69 to levels comparable with WT NOD mice suggesting that these cells can respond normally to viral infection despite the absence of TLR3 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Interestingly, NK and NK T cell activation was completely abrogated in MyD88KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004127.s001">Figure S1A,B</xref>). This highlights an important role for this pathway and other TLRs in the activation of NK and NK T cells although it also suggests that activation of these cells is not necessary for survival following CB4 challenge. We next determined the activation status of APCs by measuring surface expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and CD86 (data not shown) on macrophages (CD11b&#x0002b;CD11c&#x02212;) and DCs (CD11c&#x0002b;) at day 4 PI. We observed comparable upregulation of costimulatory molecules on macrophages and DCs in both WT NOD and TLR3KO mice demonstrating that TLR3 signaling is not necessary for the maturation of APCs and further suggest that a defect in APC maturation is not responsible for the increased mortality observed in TLR3KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Following infection of MyD88KO mice, we observed reduced maturation of both macrophages and DCs compared to WT mice again suggesting a role for the MyD88 pathway in the maturation of APCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004127.s001">Figure S1C,D</xref>).

In order to determine whether presence of TLR3 on macrophages or DCs was sufficient to decrease the susceptibility of a TLR3 deficient host, adoptive transfer experiments were performed. Splenocytes from WT NOD or TLR3KO mice were purified by flow cytometry in order to obtain two separate populations based on CD11c and CD11b expression. TLR3KO mice were adoptively transferred with a population containing either predominantly macrophages (CD11b&#x0002b;CD11c&#x02212;) or a population containing DCs (CD11c&#x0002b;) and challenged with CB4 at 24 hours post-transfer. We observed that while adoptive transfer of WT DCs did not confer a survival advantage (data not shown), transfer of WT macrophages resulted in greater survival with the median survival time extended to 20 days compared to 9 days for mock treated and nearly 25&#x00025; more mice surviving to 21 days PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Further, adoptive transfer of WT macrophages conferred a significant survival advantage compared to mice adoptively transferred with macrophages purified from TLR3KO donors with the median survival time extended to 20 days compared to 7.5 days and greater than 35&#x00025; more mice surviving to day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) confirming that simply increasing the number of macrophages available to respond to virus is not sufficient to confer protection. Instead, TLR3 signaling on macrophages is required to establish protection and ensure survival following CB4 infection. In addition, this suggests that TLR3 signaling on DCs is not sufficient to confer survival following CB4 infection. Importantly, after transfer of WT macrophages, we observed a significant reduction in serum levels of cTn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) as well as the number and severity of cardiac lesions in infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004127-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) compared to infected mice adoptively transferred with macrophages from TLR3KO mice. This demonstrates that TLR3 signaling on macrophages is critical to prevent viral-mediated cardiac pathology. Furthermore, we observed that protection following adoptive transfer of WT macrophages did not correlate with increased serum levels of TNF&#x003b1; or CCL5 (data not shown). These results suggest that macrophages contribute to protection independent of significant increases of these mediators in the periphery and, as expected, macrophages contribute to the antiviral response in a number of ways both globally and locally within the infected tissue.</p><fig id="pone-0004127-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004127.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Adoptive transfer of WT macrophages rescues TLR3KO mice following CB4 challenge.</title><p>A) TLR3KO mice were adoptively transferred with macrophages from WT NOD mice (dashed black line) or macrophages from TLR3KO mice (solid grey line) or mock-treated with DMEM (solid black line) and infected with 400 pfu of CB4 24 hours post-transfer.

Mice lacking TLR3 succumb rapidly to viral infection due to uncontrolled viral replication leading to a rapid increase in cardiac damage. Conversely, we observed that MyD88 deficiency did not result in increased mortality suggesting that signaling from other TLRs is not necessary during the early stages of CB4 infection. Our data further highlights the important role of pro-inflammatory mediators, specifically TNF-&#x003b1; and CCL5, in controlling viral replication in the host.</p><p>In light of the redundancy of innate receptors capable of recognizing virus-associated patterns, it is intriguing that TLR3 plays such a critical in the early response to CB4 infection. Despite the fact that coxsackieviruses have previously been described to signal through other TLRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Triantafilou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Triantafilou2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, our results suggests that the other TLRs as well as the other innate viral sensors such as RLHs are unable to compensate for the loss of TLR3. Additionally, our results suggest that not only are other innate viral sensors unable to compensate for the loss of TLR3, they are in fact dispensable for the early response to CB4. This is supported by a report describing that deficiency of MyD88 provided a survival advantage compared to WT mice following challenge with high infectious doses of coxsackievirus B3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Fuse1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. These intriguing observations can be explained by several non-exclusive mechanisms. One likely explanation is that CB4 is recognized by TLRs other than TLR3 but the functional consequences of this interaction are not critical for survival. To this effect, we observed that IL-6 production was significantly reduced following CB4 infection in MyD88KO but not TLR3KO mice, suggesting that CB4 must signal through at least one MyD88-dependent pathway and that the resulting production of IL-6 is not critical for the early control of viral replication. Subcellular localization may explain why the RLHs, in particular MDA-5 which has previously been demonstrated to play an important role in the recognition of other viruses including murine norovirus and the picornavirus, EMCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-McCartney1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Gitlin1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, are unable to compensate for the lack of TLR3. As opposed to TLR3 which is usually localized within endosomal compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Schulz1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, MDA-5 is localized in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Kang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. CB4 enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and therefore would be localized within the endosome rapidly after infection. However, as CB4 is a single stranded virus it seems unlikely that dsRNA intermediates are generated prior to the start of viral replication in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, other picornaviruses, including poliovirus and hepatitis A virus, have been demonstrated to prevent MDA-5 signaling by cleaving either MDA-5 itself or the signaling adaptor molecule mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor (MAVS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Barral1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Yang1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these reports, we are currently investigating the interaction between RLHs and CB4 and speculate that this virus may be able to abrogate signaling from RLHs potentially explaining the critical role of TLR3 over the course of infection.</p><p>Here, we report that TLR3 deficiency does not affect the activation of several cellular effectors typically involved in the response to viruses including NK cells and APCs. Instead, the absence of TLR3 signaling resulted in significantly reduced levels of the cytokine TNF-&#x003b1; and the chemokine CCL5. This suggests that early production of these inflammatory mediators plays a critical role in controlling viral replication and that, in their absence, even the activation of innate effectors and the adaptive response are insufficient to reestablish control of the viral infection. To this effect, we observed that although MyD88 mice present with reduced immune cell activation following CB4 infection, they produce similar levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and CCL5 compared to WT mice. The survival of these mice following CB4 infection further highlights the importance of these pro-inflammatory mediators in the control viral replication at the earliest stages of infection. Similarly, it was previously reported that SCID mice, that lack T and B cells, are able to survive the early stages of infection with CB4 suggesting that these cell types are not critical for survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Horwitz1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by several cell types, including macrophages, that has been ascribed antiviral properties both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Herbein1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>).

Taken together with the data presented in this report, this suggests that the TLR3-dependent production TNF-&#x003b1; plays a particularly important role in cardiac protection following infection with cardiotropic viruses.</p><p>CCL5 is a pro-inflammatory chemokine with chemotactic properties towards both T cells and monocytes/macrophages that is commonly associated with anti-viral responses. Blocking CCL5 activity has previously been demonstrated to result in increased viral antigen in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice following TMEV challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Ure1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, normal T cell infiltration was also observed in these mice suggesting that T cells were still able to migrate to the CNS and that the antiviral activity of CCL5 is not simply due to recruitment of T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Ure1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the early mortality observed in our model, it seems unlikely that improper recruitment of T cells is responsible for this increased susceptibility to CB4 infection. Rather, we hypothesize that CCL5 deficiency results in a decrease recruitment of macrophages that may be important for the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and, potentially, nitric oxide. To this effect, we observed that the adoptive transfer of a population composed mostly of macrophages but not DCs from WT mice was sufficient to reduce mortality induced by CB4 in TLR3KO mice by preventing viral-mediated cardiac pathology. These data suggest that TLR3 signaling on macrophages results in the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and CCL5 both of which act to control early viral replication which, in turn, likely allows for the adaptive immune response to activate and clear the viral infection.</p><p>Contrary to what has been reported for several other viruses including another picornavirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Edelmann1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Carpentier1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, TLR3 signaling plays a role in the protection of the host from cardiotropic viruses such as coxsackievirus and EMCV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004127-Hardarson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our results demonstrate that the production of important pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-&#x003b1; and CCL5 are dependent on the TLR3 signaling pathway and independent of the MyD88 pathway. Further, we demonstrate that mortality occurs despite the normal activation of the adaptive immune response. This suggests that in the absence of macrophages recognizing the invading pathogen in a TLR3 dependent manner, viral replication cannot be controlled and is allowed to outpace the developing adaptive immune response. The differences in requirement for TLR3 signaling between RNA viruses (eg. LCMV and CB4) suggest that the wide variety of viral-specific pattern recognition receptors does not represent simple redundancy. Rather this system has been evolved to provide a first-line of defense tailored to the requirements of the host to protect itself against a specific virus. As such, gaining understanding of this complex interplay of viruses with the innate immune system will likely provide insight for the design of more effective antiviral therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>NOD/ShiLtJ and TLR3KO mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, USA).
