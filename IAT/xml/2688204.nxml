Age-matched BALB/c females or eight-week-old NOD females were used as controls. Apoptotic mediators and TNF-&#x003b1; receptor expression were assessed by immunoblotting and RT-PCR, caspase 3 activity was assessed by optical density at 405 nm with Ac-DEVD-pNA as a substrate and chromatin condensation by Hoechst stain. They were evaluated in resting conditions and after a 3.5 or 6 hours of culture with TNF-&#x003b1;.

Acini from NOD mice were more sensitive to TNF-&#x003b1;-induced increases of apoptotic mediators than control cells.

The pathogenic mechanisms of disease are presently unknown and the active involvement of epithelial acinar cells producing inflammatory mediators has been discussed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hence, studies on acinar cell cultures from patients with Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome and biopsies indicate an aberrant expression and activation of inflammatory mediators together with defective activity of key enzymes involved in saliva secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Observations that acinar cells may be actively involved in the pathogenesis of Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome thus encourage the search for molecules that could mediate these processes, which could even arise as biomarkers for diagnosis and/or disease activity. Evidence obtained with the nonobese diabetic (NOD) Sj&#x000f6;gren's mouse model also supports this view providing a feasible approach for this search. The NOD mouse model of Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome, at the pre-diabetic stage, has the unique characteristic of developing a deep secretory dysfunction with mild infiltration of the glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] consistent with a structural-dysfunctional aetiology.</p><p>The role of apoptosis of secretory epithelium as a triggering factor of early dysfunction and autoimmune response has been explored in patients with Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome and in the pre-diabetic NOD mouse model. Apoptosis evaluated by terminal UTP nucleotide end-labelling method (TUNEL) and Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis have already been reported in both cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In keeping with this, we have shown early signalling alterations in submandibular glands from NOD mice involving neural isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS 1), calcium-calmodulin kinase II and cGMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, with a lower activity of NOS 1 in exocrine glands and higher serum levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, we recently reported an increased DNA fragmentation with increased Bax expression in isolated acinar cells from NOD submandibular glands at the Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome-like period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1; receptors (TNF-&#x003b1;R) are important cell surface inducers of apoptosis leading to proteolysis and DNA fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The ability of TNF-&#x003b1; to regulate apoptosis in isolated pancreatic acini and experimental pancreatitis has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuroimmunopeptide with several actions on exocrine glands. In addition to inducing vasodilation and exocrine secretion, VIP was postulated as a trophic factor for acini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and it has shown strong anti-inflammatory properties in several models of chronic autoimmune and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Regarding NOD mice at the Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome-like stage, treatment with VIP <italic>in vivo </italic>from the fourth week of age reduced Th1 cytokine levels in the serum and increased IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In line with this, VIP was proposed as one of the promising approaches for the treatment of Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome based on VIP gene-transfer experiments in NOD females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to analyse apoptotic events involving TNF-&#x003b1;/TNF-&#x003b1;R in isolated acini from NOD mice submandibular glands and to explore the ability of VIP to modulate these effects. In addition to Bax and other pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals, we investigated the expression of two proteins encoded by tumour protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 gene (<italic>TP53INP1)</italic>, TP53INP1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; whose over-expression was associated to Bax expression and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our present data indicate that isolated acini from submandibular glands of NOD mice present increased chromatin condensation, TNF-&#x003b1;R, Bax and TP53INP1&#x003b1; expression, and caspase 3 activity than normal BALB/c mice. TNF-&#x003b1; was more potent in inducing pro-apoptotic mediators and nuclear chromatin condensation in NOD acinar cells. VIP inhibited TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptotic events through a cAMP-mediated pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>NOD and BALB/c female mice were bred and maintained in the Central Animal Care Facility at the School of Exact and Natural Sciences, University of Buenos Aires.

The preincubation of acinar cells with 100 nM VIP prevented the inducing effect of TNF-&#x003b1; on all of the apoptotic events shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). As it is shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref> (caspase activity) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref> (TP53INP1 and bax) TNF-&#x003b1; was unable to induce these factors in control acinar cells although it did increase their expression/activity in the NOD suspension. Moreover, VIP only reduced their expression in NOD acini suggesting that VIP modulation mainly affects TNF-&#x003b1; upregulated factors. To identify and functionally characterise VIP receptors involved in this acinar cell preparation, we investigated VIP receptor expression, cAMP accumulation and amylase secretion.

Finally, as expected for a VPAC1-cAMP-PKA-mediated effect, VIP failed to reverse apoptotic signals induced by TNF-&#x003b1; in acinar cells in the presence of PKA inhibitor H89 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). VIP alone did not modify the basal expression of apoptotic mediators or the condensation of chromatin in NOD and control acini (not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We presented evidence to indicate that acinar cells isolated from submandibular glands of NOD mice with salivary dysfunction are more sensitive to TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptotic events than BALB/c control cells and that VIP prevents these effects. We also showed that NOD acinar cells are functional for cAMP signalling and amylase secretion through VIP receptors, although they express a number of apoptotic signals and mediators activated in resting conditions that were enhanced with TNF-&#x003b1; and prevented by VIP.</p><p>Our conclusions are based on three main observations. First, acinar cells isolated from submandibular glands of NOD mice undergoing salivary flow decline showed increased condensation of nuclear chromatin, caspase 3 activity and Bax, TNF-&#x003b1;R1 and TP53INP1&#x003b1; expression compared with control mice. Second, TNF-&#x003b1; enhanced apoptotic events in NOD acini at a concentration that did not modify various apoptotic mediators in BALB/c acini. However, the treatment of normal BALB/c acinar cells with a higher (10 ng/ml) TNF-&#x003b1; concentration reproduced the apoptotic pattern of resting NOD acini. Third, pretreatment of NOD acini with VIP acting on functional VPAC1 receptors prevented apoptotic events induced by TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>Apoptosis mediated through Fas/FasL has already been reported in salivary glands of NOD and NOD-<italic>scid </italic>mice with increased Fas expression in both acinar and ductal cells at 18 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In contrast, FasL was detected as earlier as eight weeks in NOD submandibular glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similarly, caspase 3 gene expression appeared to be increased in submandibular glands of the Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome-susceptible strain C57BL6/NOD.Aec1Aec2 mice at eight weeks of age but returned to baseline values at the 12th week of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This supports the notion that early defects in glandular homeostasis leading to apoptotic events might predispose them to the autoimmune response.</p><p>Here we showed that acinar cells from NOD mice present a characteristic apoptotic pattern with increased Bax expression, chromatin condensation and caspase 3 activation adding new evidence to previously reported apoptosis markers in NOD whole gland samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and DNA fragmentation in NOD acinar suspension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The signs of apoptosis were detected in acinar cells from NOD mice at 16 weeks of age when they had already developed a saliva flow reduction higher than 40% compared with BALB/c mice. Of note, at eight weeks of age NOD females showed normal salivary function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and there was no detectable apoptosis of acinar cells, suggesting that apoptotic processes, if present, might be incipient at this early stage and not detectable by the methods used.</p><p>Among the pro-apoptotic mediators determined in NOD acinar cells, here we chose to analyse &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; TP53INP1 isoform expression. The overexpression of nuclear TP53INP1s stimulates the transactivation activity on the Bax promoter and induces apoptosis in cell lines and the exocrine pancreas in a model of pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that increased expression of TP53INP1 during the acute phase of pancreatitis was only observed in acinar cells with no staining of Langerhans islets or pancreatic duct cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Here we showed that NOD acini had an enhanced expression of TP53INP1&#x003b1; in resting conditions from the eighth week of life and when stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1;. The &#x003b2; isoform did not show significant changes as it was also described in mice pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The modulation of nuclear proteins Ku70 and Ku80 in a caspase 3-dependent pathway was proved in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of AR42J pancreatic acinar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A sparing action of these partner Ku70 and Ku80 nuclear proteins was suggested, as one subunit may stabilise the other subunit under certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report on an increased TP53INP1 expression in acinar cells from salivary glands in relation to apoptosis, either in the NOD model or in normal mice glands treated with TNF-&#x003b1;. Regarding the NOD model, it is also remarkable that the higher TP53INP1 protein expression observed co-occurred with a lower amylase secretion in functional assays of the acinar cell suspensions from low secretory capacity animals. However, the involvement of TP53INP1&#x003b1; expression previous to overt apoptosis and salivary dysfunction in NOD mice and its putative value as a biomarker for patients with Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome needs further research.</p><p>Our results indicate that an increased expression of TNF-&#x003b1;R and a higher sensitivity to TNF-&#x003b1; underlies the inflammatory/apoptotic profile displayed by acinar cells isolated from submandibular glands of NOD mice in the Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome-like stage. Increased levels of plasma and saliva TNF-&#x003b1; in NOD mice at the Sj&#x000f6;gren's like stage have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, increased levels of TNF-&#x003b1; in saliva and serum of pre-diabetic NOD mice were shown to correlate with the decline of salivary flow but not with the severity of mononuclear infiltrates measured as focus score and ratio of inflamed area to total glandular area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Similarly, compared with age-matched BALB/c mice, we have shown increased bioactive TNF-&#x003b1; produced by peritoneal macrophages of NOD females concomitant with a decline of salivary flow but no signs of severe mononuclear infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Enhanced expression of six of 30 TNF-&#x003b1; superfamily genes was detected at earlier ages in RNA from freshly extracted submandibular glands of C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 strain used as a model of Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These results are consistent with previously reported identification of Tnfsf6 (FasL) y Ox40 protein from the TNF superfamily as a potential candidate SjS susceptibility marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Likewise, evidence that autoantigens fodrin, SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La), in human salivary gland cells treated with TNF undergo a striking redistribution during apoptosis and relocate to the cell membrane of apoptotic cells has been presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. On the other hand, pancreatic acini produce TNF-&#x003b1; and express TNF-&#x003b1;R1 in a model of pancreatitis suggesting a role of TNF-&#x003b1; in the autocrine regulation of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In line with this, NOD acini from submandibular glands showed an increased expression of TNF-&#x003b1;R1 in resting conditions that was enhanced by TNF-&#x003b1;, while several pro-apoptotic mediators but not the anti-apoptotic BclxL were also up-regulated by the cytokine. NOD acini required a lower concentration of TNF-&#x003b1; to promote chromatin condensation, pro-apoptotic mediators and caspase 3 activation than BALB/c acini consistent with a higher expression of its own receptor in the former.</p><p>Proteomic and genomic approaches in NOD mice and patients samples have allowed the identification of several apoptotic and inflammatory factors as well as acinar cell components as putative biomarkers of Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, a lower amylase expression in saliva has been proposed as a biomarker in a proteomic approach in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, a correlation between biomarkers, salivary dysfunction and common immunopathological signatures in both NOD mice and patients with Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome was not found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Finally, VIP inhibited TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptotic events in NOD acinar cells. VIP has been proved as a potent anti-inflammatory molecule in several models of autoimmune inflammatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. When given every other day to pre-diabetic NOD females between the 4th and 16th week, it reduced serum Th1 cytokine IL-12 and increased IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, VIP transfer experiments onto NOD pre-diabetic females reduced the autoimmune response against submandibular glands and reversed salivary flow decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In line with this, <italic>in vitro </italic>treatment of NOD macrophages with VIP reduced TNF-&#x003b1;, nitric oxide and IL-12 and increased IL-10 produced by peritoneal macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although VIP has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis through the inhibition of the expression of Fas ligand in activated T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] data are lacking about VIP on TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated apoptosis in immune and non-immune cells. Here we showed that the anti-apoptotic effect of VIP on acinar cells induced with TNF-&#x003b1; involved direct activation of functional amylase secretion-coupled VIP receptors through a PKA-dependent pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>An increased expression of TNF-&#x003b1;R and a higher sensitivity to TNF-&#x003b1; underlies the inflammatory/apoptotic profile displayed by acinar cells isolated from submandibular glands of NOD mice in the Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome-like stage. The anti-inflammatory neuropeptide VIP was able to inhibit TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptotic events through a PKA-mediated pathway.
