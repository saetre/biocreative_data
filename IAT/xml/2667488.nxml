Recent studies show that the activity of several transcription factors including C/EBP&#x003b2;, which is needed for maximal NOS2 expression, is modulated by conjugation of the small molecular weight protein SUMO. We examined whether the expression of SUMO Related Genes (SRGs: SUMO-1, the conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and the protease SENP1) are affected by inflammatory conditions or NA and whether SUMO-1 regulates NOS2 through interaction with C/EBP&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammatory responses including NOS2 expression in primary astrocytes. The mRNA levels of SRGs were determined by QPCR. A functional role for SUMOylation was evaluated by determining effects of over-expressing SRGs on NOS2 promoter and NF&#x003ba;B binding-element reporter constructs. Interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; with the NOS2 promoter were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Interactions of SUMO-1 with C/EBP&#x003b2; were examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>LPS decreased mRNA levels of SUMO-1, Ubc9 and SENP1 in primary astrocytes and a similar decrease occurred during normal aging in brain. NA attenuated the LPS-induced reductions and increased SUMO-1 above basal levels. Over-expression of SUMO-1, Ubc9, or SENP1 reduced the activation of a NOS2 promoter, whereas activation of a 4 &#x000d7; NF&#x003ba;B binding-element reporter was only reduced by SUMO-1. ChIP studies revealed interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; with C/EBP binding sites on the NOS2 promoter that were modulated by LPS and NA. SUMO-1 co-precipitated with C/EBP&#x003b2; and a close proximity was confirmed by FRET analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates NOS2 expression in astrocytes, and point to modification of C/EBP&#x003b2; as a possible mechanism of action. Targeting the SUMOylation pathway may therefore offer a novel means to regulate inflammatory NOS2 expression in neurological conditions and diseases.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Nitric oxide generated by Nitric Oxide Synthase type 2 (NOS2, also termed iNOS) contributes to disease progression in a variety of neurological diseases and conditions. NOS2 is the calcium-independent isoform of the NOS family whose expression is generally restricted, but is highly and rapidly induced upon activation by a variety of stimuli, among them cytokines and bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Several investigators have confirmed NOS2 expression in primary astrocytes upon inflammatory induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] as well as in neurological diseases including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), its animal model EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Transcription of the NOS2 gene has been shown to require activation of transcription factor NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; however in many cell types activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) are necessary for maximal NOS2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The C/EBPs constitute a family of basic leucine-zipper transcription factors which form homo and hetero dimers that bind to similar cis-regulatory elements with varying affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The leucine-zipper motif constitutes the dimerization domain of the C/EBP protein whereas the basic region is the DNA contact area that determines binding specificity. C/EBP isoforms include C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2; (also known as NF-IL6, IL-6-DBP, LAP, AGP/EBP, or CRP2), C/EBP&#x003b4; (also called CRP3, CELF, or NF-IL6b), C/EBP&#x003b3; (IgEBP), C/EBP&#x003b5; (CRP1), and C/EBP&#x003b6; (CHOP). C/EBP&#x003b2; is itself composed of several variants due to use of alternative translation start sites, resulting in C/EBP&#x003b2;1 (the full length protein, also called LAP*), C/EBP&#x003b2;2 (LAP, shorter by 23 amino acids versus LAP*), and C/EBP&#x003b2;-20 (LIP, which lacks the transactivation domain and is considered to be a dominant negative isoform).</p><p>The expression of NOS2 has been shown to be regulated by the neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA), via activation of beta-adrenergic receptors and a resulting increase in cAMP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although the effect of NA occurs at the transcriptional level, it does not inhibit the activation of NF&#x003ba;B or its binding to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A 27 bp region of the NOS2 promoter containing an almost consensus (6/7 identities) CRE site and a consensus binding site for C/EBP was shown to be critical for inhibition by NA raising the possibility of regulation through these transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The activity of C/EBP family members, like many transcription factors and co-factors, is regulated by the protein Small Ubiquitin like Modifier (SUMO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The covalent binding of SUMO to acceptor sites on target proteins involves several steps starting with conversion of the precursor to mature SUMO by a C-terminal hydrolase (SENP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The SUMO Activating Enzyme (SAE) E1 transfers SUMO to conjugating enzyme E2 (Ubc9) which then catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of SUMO and the &#x003b5;-amino group of a target lysine. The majority of target lysines are within SUMO consensus motifs, however proteins without such motifs can also be SUMOylated. SUMO E3 ligases (PIAS, RanBP2) increase the efficiency of the reaction possibly also facilitating SUMOylation of targets lacking the consensus motif. The proteases (SENP) involved in maturation are also responsible for the removal of SUMO from substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Recent reports implicating SUMOylation in regulation of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] as well as NOS2 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] combined with our findings that effects of NA on NOS2 expression most likely involve C/EBP&#x003b2; prompted us to investigate whether SUMO-1 is involved in regulation of NOS2 transcription through modification of C/EBP&#x003b2;. In this study we show that the expression of SUMO-1 and two critical SUMOylation enzymes (collectively referred to here as SRGs for SUMO Related Genes) as well as C/EBP&#x003b2; are regulated under pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions, and that these genes modulate NOS2 promoter activation. Our data further support that interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; occur at the NOS2 promoter and are important for modulating NOS2 transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells and treatments</title><p>Primary astrocytes were prepared from cerebral cortices of postnatal day 1 Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].

NA not only reversed the LPS effect on SUMO-1 mRNA levels but caused an increase of approximately 20% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The inflammatory effect of LPS was verified by an increase in NOS2 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b2; mRNA levels were also increased by LPS, consistent with its involvement in inflammatory activation. As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], co-treatment with NA reduced the effect of LPS on NOS2 but had no effect on C/EBP&#x003b2; mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SRG expression decreases with aging</title><p>During aging, a reduction in brain NA levels occurs, which could contribute to increased neurological damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Analysis of expression of SUMO-1 and the conjugating enzyme Ubc9 mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) revealed a significant age-dependent change in SUMO-1 and Ubc9 mRNA levels in the frontal cortex of wild type C57BL/6 mice between 3 and 15 months of age, with values at 15 months reduced about 70% compared to the values measured at 3 months. During this time, there was also a significant age-dependent change in C/EBP&#x003b2; and NOS2 mRNA levels, with increases of 3- to 5-fold measured between 3 and 15 months of age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) suggesting an age-dependent increase in overall inflammatory status.</p></sec><sec><title>Over-expression of SRGs modulate NOS2 promoter activity</title><p>To determine if SUMOylation was involved in inflammatory activation, rat C6 glioma cells stably transfected with luciferase reporter constructs pNF&#x003ba;B (4 &#x000d7; NF&#x003ba;B binding-element) or pGL3-2.2 (containing the 2.2 &#x003ba;B NOS2 promoter sequence)were transiently transfected with SRG expression plasmids and the promoter activation by LPS was determined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Over-expression of SUMO-1 diminished the LPS-dependent increase in activity of both constructs. Increasing Ubc9 levels did not affect pNF&#x003ba;B activity but decreased pGL3-2.2 activity. Similarly, over-expressing SUMO protease SENP1 did not affect pNF&#x003ba;B but diminished pGL3-2.2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of LPS and NA on association of C/EBP&#x003b2; and SUMO-1 with the NOS2 promoter</title><p>The involvement of C/EBP&#x003b2; and SUMO-1 in NOS2 transcription was further investigated using ChIP assays to detect the association of these proteins with regions of the NOS2 promoter containing either the C/EBP-2 or the C/EBP-3 site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b2; was found associated with both the C/EBP-2 and C/EBP-3 sites under all conditions; however binding to C/EBP-2 was increased by treatment with LPS plus NA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). SUMO-1 was detected at both sites, although a stronger signal was obtained with the fragment of the NOS2 promoter containing the C/EBP-3 site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Treatment with LPS reduced association of SUMO-1 with this site while addition of NA restored it (or prevented that loss). Re-precipitation of SUMO-1 interacting fragments with anti-C/EBP&#x003b2; antibody showed that under all conditions, the C/EBP-3 site also interacted with C/EBP&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, <bold>bottom panel</bold>). In contrast there was little evidence for simultaneous association of both SUMO-1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; at C/EBP-2 site. An interaction of SUMO-1 with C/EBP&#x003b2; was confirmed by Western blots which showed that SUMO-1 co-immunoprecipitated with C/EBP&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), and this interaction was increased by the presence of NA.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Presence of C/EBP&#x003b2; and SUMO-1 on the NOS2 promoter</bold>.

Primary astrocytes were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding CFP-tagged C/EBP&#x003b2; and YFP-tagged SUMO-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), and FRET measured by the increase in donor fluorescence (CFP-C/EBP&#x003b2;) after photobleaching of the acceptor molecule (YFP-SUMO-1) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Acceptor photobleaching of selective ROIs in cells expressing both fluorophores resulted in a significant increase of donor fluorescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), consistent with a close proximity of C/EBP&#x003b2; and SUMO-1 since FRET can only occur between a donor and acceptor pair at distances less than 10 nm.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we demonstrate that SUMO-1 and the enzymes Ubc9 and SENP1 of the SUMOylation process are expressed in primary astrocytes and that their expression is modified under inflammatory conditions. We also show that over-expressing these proteins modifies the astrocyte response to LPS, demonstrating a functional role for SUMOylation in astrocytes. To our knowledge this is the first report to characterize SUMO-1 and SRGs in astrocytes, confirming the existence and functionality of this important signaling pathway in one of the most abundant cell types in brain.</p><p>Our data shows that pro-inflammatory conditions that are induced by LPS or during normal aging, and as evidenced by a significant increase in the expression of NOS2 as well as C/EBP&#x003b2;, decrease the expression levels of SUMO-1, Ubc9 and the protease SENP1, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for SUMO-1 in brain. Although a decrease in SENP1 expression might be expected to promote inflammation (by reducing overall SUMOylation status), this enzyme is also involved in SUMO-1 maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The fact that NA, an anti-inflammatory neurotransmitter, attenuates the effects of LPS on both the SRGs and NOS2 further supports an anti-inflammatory role of SUMO-1, and suggests that SUMOylation contributes to NA effects. Reduction in NA levels that occur during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] could therefore contribute to the age-dependent decrease in SRGs.</p><p>In our experiments NOS2 promoter activity was decreased when SUMO-1, Ubc9, or SENP1 were over-expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting an inhibitory role in primary astrocytes. SUMO-1 over-expression also decreased the activity of a pNF&#x003ba;B reporter plasmid that can only bind NF&#x003ba;B, which itself is not a SUMO target, therefore implying modulation of NF&#x003ba;B activity through interaction with other factors such as NEMO, IKK, or the inhibitory I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; protein. Since NA increases both SRGs as well as I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], this raises the possibility that SUMOylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; contributes to the inhibitory effects of NA. However, the fact that over-expression of Ubc9 or SENP1 did not affect pNF&#x003ba;B activity suggests that their ability to inhibit NOS2 involves SUMOylation of proteins other than NF&#x003ba;B-related molecules.</p><p>The increase we observed in C/EBP&#x003b2; mRNA levels caused by inflammatory stimuli are in accordance with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Interestingly, and as we have shown before for the activation of NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], NA did not affect C/EBP&#x003b2; mRNA levels although it reduced NOS2 mRNA. Several reports have shown that C/EBP&#x003b2; activity is controlled by modulating its binding to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and in many cell types NF&#x003ba;B and C/EBP&#x003b2; co-operate in regulating NOS2 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. This suggests that NA could inhibit NOS2 activation by altering the interaction of C/EBP&#x003b2; with DNA and/or NF&#x003ba;B.</p><p>Although some reports suggest that other C/EBPs can be involved in the regulation of NOS2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] in this paper we have focused attention on the C/EBP&#x003b2; isoform since in most studies NOS2 transcription has been shown to involve C/EBP&#x003b2;. In rat C6 glioma cells, NOS2 induction by over-expression of MAPKs was blocked by a dominant negative form of C/EBP&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In human astrocytes, activation by the HIV-1 tat protein induced C/EBP&#x003b2; expression and a dominant negative C/EBP&#x003b2; blocked NO production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In smooth muscle cells induction of NOS2 was accompanied by binding of C/EBP&#x003b2; to the promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and in kidney cells, supershift assays revealed only the presence of C/EBP&#x003b2; on the NOS2 promoter, when induced by LPS and IFN&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In liver cells, overexpression of the C/EBP&#x003b2;-20 inhibitor LIP suppressed activity of the human NOS2 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Other inhibitors have also been shown to reduce NOS2 expression associated with a decrease in C/EBP&#x003b2; levels or binding to the promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Although several roles for SUMOylation in brain have been reported, there are limited studies describing the ability of SUMOylation to regulate brain inflammation. SUMOylation can have pro- or anti-inflammatory actions, depending on the specific SUMO isoform that is conjugated and the target protein. SUMO-1 levels were shown to be low in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD) samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]; while SUMO-2/3 was detected at high levels in cortex after cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Transfection studies have shown that SUMOylation of amyloid precursor protein reduced A&#x003b2; production in human neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and in HeLA cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]; and that SUMO-1 modification increases human superoxide-dismutase-1 stability and aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The protein IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase type 1) which transduces IL1 signaling and immune responses of Toll-like receptors is SUMOylated in brain, which could influence its ability to modulate inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p>SUMOylation is known to modulate transcription factor: DNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] and in many cases has been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. SUMOylation of JunB modifies its ability to induce cytokine expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], SUMOylation of PPAR&#x003b3; increases it's interactions with the NCoR co-repressor and prevents inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], SUMO-1 can modify several members of the NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, including NEMO (NF&#x003ba;B essential modulator) necessary for NF&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], as well as the inhibitory I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] and its kinase IKK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]; and SUMOylation of STAT1 reduces IFN-dependent, STAT1 mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. SUMOylation of C/EBPs has been shown to modulate transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>], and in many cases associated with reduced activity. An increase in SUMOylated C/EBP&#x003b2; was shown to be involved in reduction of COX2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], and SUMOylation of C/EBP&#x003b2; reduces albumin transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Similarly, the synergic control elements of C/EBP&#x003b1; are believed to require SUMOylation for activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We therefore we considered the possibility that NA altered CEBP/&#x003b2; activity through SUMOylation.</p><p>There are several binding sites for members of C/EBP family on the rat NOS2 promoter, two of which are located close to the proximal NF&#x003ba;B binding site (C/EBP-2, located upstream; C/EBP-3, located downstream). ChIP results show that LPS treatment is associated with decreased levels of SUMO-1 associated with C/EBP-3; and that NA restores those levels (or prevents the LPS-induced loss). This suggests that SUMO-1 at this site exerts suppressive effects. We observed that C/EBP&#x003b2; was bound to both site-2 and site-3, and was not significantly modified by LPS; however in the presence of NA there was a clear increase in C/EBP&#x003b2; at site-2. Although C/EBP&#x003b2; is generally considered to be pro-inflammatory, as indicated above there are also studies showing that it can suppress transcription. C/EBP&#x003b2; represses activation of the cyclin D promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; and activation of c-Myc expression in Tcells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments showing both C/EBP&#x003b2; and SUMO-1 interacting at the C/EBP-3 site suggest that the SUMOylated factor at this site may be C/EBP&#x003b2;. The results of Western blots and FRET analysis indicate strongly that C/EBP&#x003b2; is SUMOylated however these results may also indicate the presence of a complex containing both C/EBP&#x003b2; and SUMOylated factor(s). Thus, we conclude that the suppressive effects of NA on NOS2 expression involve increased SUMOylation at the NOS2 promoter.</p><p>Since in this paper we have focused attention on modification of C/EBP&#x003b2; by SUMO-1, our results do not address the possibility that inflammatory stimuli or NA modify SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 interactions with the NOS2 promoter or with C/EBP&#x003b2;, as recently reported to occur in COS1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, in these studies we used an antibody directed against the amino terminus of C/EBP&#x003b2; which does not distinguish between C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms; however findings that C/EBP&#x003b2;1 is a preferential target for SUMOylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] suggests that our results may primarily reflect SUMOylation of this isoform.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate an important role for SUMOylation in regulating NOS2 expression in astrocytes, and point to modification of C/EBP&#x003b2; as a critical determinant. However, there are likely to be other SUMO targets involved in the regulation of NOS2 transcription which may also contribute to suppressive effects of NA which need to be characterized. In view of the known involvement of NOS2 in a variety of neurological diseases and conditions, the knowledge that increasing SUMOylation processes can reduce NOS2 expression provides novel targets for therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>EAE: experimental acute encephalomyelitis; NF&#x003ba;B: nuclear factor &#x003ba;B; C/EBP: CCAAT enhancer-binding protein; MAPK: mitogen activated protein kinase; PIAS: protein inhibitors of activated stat; CRE: cAMP response element; CFP: cyan fluorescent protein; YFP: yellow fluorescent protein; CREB: cAMP response element binding protein; IL1: interleukin1; PPAR&#x003b3;: peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor&#x003b3;; NCoR: nuclear receptor co-repressor; I&#x003ba;B: inhibitor of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B; IKK: I&#x003ba;B kinase; STAT: signal transducers and activators of transcription; QPCR: quantitative polymerase chain reaction; GDH: glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CAA designed and performed the experiments, analyzed the data, prepared figures and wrote the manuscript.
