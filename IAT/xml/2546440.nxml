Both phosphorylations were radiation specific and could not be observed after treatment with EGF. Inhibition of EGFR by the antibody Erbitux resulted in a strong accumulation of caveolin/EGFR complexes within the cytoplasm, which could not be further increased by irradiation. Radiation-induced caveolin-1- and EGFR-phosphorylations were associated with nuclear EGFR transport and activation of DNA-PK, as detected by phosphorylation at T2609. Blockage of src activity by the specific inhibitor PP2, decreased nuclear transport of EGFR and inhibited caveolin-1- and DNA-PK-phosphorylation. Knockdown of src by specific siRNA blocked EGFR phosphorylation at Y845, phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at Y14 and abolished EGFR transport into the nucleus and phosphorylation of DNA-PK.

EGFR can be phosphorylated in response to binding of its specific ligands (EGF, TGF alpha and Amphiregulin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and after exposure to unspecific stimuli like ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], UV-radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], hyperthermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and trans-activation by G-protein coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Ligand-dependent as well as ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR results in receptor internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and intracellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Up to date internalization is assumed to be essential for receptor silencing and inactivation. Indeed, EGF treatment results in internalization of EGFR into coated pits followed by receptor degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As reported by Khan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], exposure to oxidative stress can lead to internalization of EGFR by caveolae and this process is associated with peri-nuclear accumulation of EGFR.</p><p>A characteristic constituent of caveolae is caveolin. In vertebrates the caveolin gene family has three members: CAV1, CAV2, and CAV3, coding for the proteins caveolin-1, caveolin-2 and caveolin-3, respectively. Caveolins form oligomers and associate with cholesterol and sphingolipids in certain areas of the cell membrane, leading to the formation of caveolae. Caveolae are involved in receptor independent endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore Caveolin-1 is an integral transmembrane protein and an essential component in interactions of integrin receptors with cytoskeleton-associated and signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Compartmentation into caveolae prevents EGFR degradation and simultaneously enables intracellular EGFR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These findings suggest a new function of EGFR &#x02013; depending on its intracellular localization -, which supplements its functions described so far. The idea of additional EGFR functions is further supported by the observation, that peri-nuclear EGFR can be transported into cell nucleus in response to irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As we and others have reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], nuclear EGFR is linked with activation of DNA-PK and regulation of non-homologous end-joining DNA-repair resulting in increased radioresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], nuclear EGFR detection in tumors biopsies correlated strongly with treatment resistance and bad prognosis.</p><p>In the present study, we focused on the radiation-induced nuclear translocation process of EGFR via caveolae. Evidence is provided that inhibition of src activity blocks the caveolin-dependent EGFR internalization and nuclear EGFR transport, which results in impaired DNA-repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfection, irradiation and colony formation assay</title><p>Experiments were performed with the human bronchial carcinoma cell line, A549 (ATCC) and the human squamous carcinoma cell line FaDu (ATCC, origin head and neck cancer).

Stabilization of src was associated with phosphorylation at residue Y416, which indicates src activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Radiation-induced stabilization and activation of src led to complex formation with caveolin-1 and EGFR as shown by means of a src-specific immune-precipitation. Caveolin-1 associated EGFR was phosphorylated at residue Y845, which is a known src kinase specific phosphorylation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, increased src activity was associated with increased caveolin-1 and EGFR binding and phosphorylation at Y14 and respectively Y845 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). EGF treatment also stabilized src protein and triggered a weaker Y416 phosphorylation. However, caveolin-1 and EGFR were not increased over the control in the src associated complex following EGF treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To elucidate the role of src-driven EGFR phosphorylation at residue Y845 following irradiation, we determined the phosphorylation status of additional tyrosine residues of EGFR after irradiation with 4 Gy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In general, tyrosine phoshorylation of EGFR was markedly increased.

Indeed, such a scenario can be observed following EGF stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which initiates proliferation associated signaling. However, the EGFR can be also activated by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], radiation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and G-coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms of this ligand independent activation of EGFR are not fully understood. However, ligand independent stimulation of EGFR, e.g. by ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], is clearly characterized by receptor internalization also. The data presented herein, give new insights into the mechanism of EGFR internalization process and the intra-nuclear function of EGFR following exposure to ionizing radiation.</p><p>Several pathways enable endocytic transport of cargo molecules from the surface of eukaryotic cells into cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The two best understood pathways, relevant for EGFR internalization, are the clathrin-coated pit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and the caveolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] driven internalization mechanisms. As shown by Khan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the clathrin-coated pit associated EGFR internalization can be observed following treatment with EGF and results in a fast degradation and silencing of receptor function. In contrast, treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>leads to EGFR internalization into caveolae, which sort internalized EGFR into a per-nuclear localization associated with an ongoing receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In agreement with these data, we could show, that exposure to ionizing radiation induced a caveolin-1 associated EGFR internalization, whereas EGF treatment failed to trigger complex formation between <italic>src</italic>, EGFR and caveolin-1. Sorting into different compartments in response to different stimuli may explain signal discrimination at the level of activated EGFR. Like for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], exposure to ionizing radiation also mediates the src driven phosphorylations of EGFR at Y845 and of caveolin-1 at Y14, which is needed for internalization of EGFR into caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In response to radiation not only EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 &#x02013; which is Src dependent &#x02013; was observed, but also phosphorylation at Y992 and Y1173 could be observed. Both are described as autophosphorylation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This implicates that ionizing radiation activates not only src kinase, but also EGFR kinase and both kinases contribute to altered phosphorylation pattern of EGFR following radiation exposure. Caveolin-1 phosphorylation seems to be critical for caveolae formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. On the contrary, Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR probably is rather essential in regulation of EGFR-kinase activity than in formation of coated pits or caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, as shown by us and by Khan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] src activity is crucial for radiation- and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced formation of caveolae. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism responsible for activation of src has to be resolved. From our data it appears, that radiation leads to a fast activation of src, which is documented by phosphorylation of src at residue Y416. This phosphorylation is described as an autophosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As activating molecular switch several mechanisms are discussed: (i) oxidation associated structural modifications result in activation of src kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], (ii) inhibition of a phosphatase leads to auto-activation of kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], (iii) G-coupled receptor signaling mediates src activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Which of these potential mechanisms is relevant for radiation-induced src kinase activity is currently unclear and is subject of ongoing investigations.</p><p>As shown herein, treatment with Erbitux, which binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR, results in receptor internalization and formation of an intracellular complex of EGFR, caveolin-1 and Erbitux. Internalized EGFR however can not be activated by EGF and this observation may explain growth inhibitory effects of Erbitux.</p><p>Khan et al. observed a peri-nuclear EGFR accumulation due to caveolin-1 driven internalization after exposing cells to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We could also detect a peri-nuclear localization of the EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in irradiated cells, which is accompanied by a nuclear EGFR shuttling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Based on these results we hypothesized, that peri-nuclear EGFR serves as a pool for nuclear EGFR transport following irradiation. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that inhibition of src either by its specific inhibitor PP2 or by specific siRNA, prevents nuclear translocation of EGFR by blocking caveolin-1 driven EGFR internalization. It is noteworthy, that caveolin-1 driven EGFR internalization occurs predominantly following treatment of cells with genotoxic agents. This observation is in favor with the idea, that EGFR internalization and nuclear transport of EGFR are linked with DNA-repair processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This assumption is supported by the observation, that caveolin-1 driven EGFR internalization is not observed after EGF treatment. As shown for irradiated cells nuclear EGFR is found in complex with DNA-PK, which is an essential compound of non-homologous end-joining DNA-repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], inhibition of EGFR nuclear transport by Erbitux, markedly impaired radiation associated activation of DNA-PK and increased cellular radiosensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In agreement with that, inhibition of src, which blocks EGFR internalization and subsequently nuclear transport after irradiation, abolished activation of DNA-PK, inhibited DNA-repair and increased radiosensitvity. Based on the data presented, it can be concluded, that the radiation-induced activation and nuclear translocation of EGFR is mediated through src kinase activity in a caveolin-1 dependent process. As blocking of these processes markedly effects repair of DNA-double strand breaks, this EGFR-coupled radiation response mechanism offers new interventional molecular targets for cancer therapy, especially by radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>EGFR internalization by caveolin-1 is a stress specific cellular reaction, which is src kinase activity dependent. Linked with EGFR internalization nuclear transport can be observed following irradiation. Nuclear EGFR transport can be hampered by inhibition of src. Consequently, src inhibition is associated with inhibition of EGFR triggered activation of DNA-PK, which leads to an inhibition of DNA-repair and cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KD, CM and RK performed experiments and interpreted data; the authors contribution to this research are reflected in the order shown.
