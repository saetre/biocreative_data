Although there are about 600 000 L1 copies covering 23% of the rat genome, full-length rat L1s (L1Rn) with intact open reading frames (ORFs) representing functional master copies for retrotransposition have not been identified yet. In conjunction with studies to elucidate the role of L1 retrotransposons in tumorigenesis, we isolated and characterized 10 different cDNAs from transcribed full-length L1Rn elements in rat chloroleukemia (RCL) cells, each encoding intact ORF1 proteins (ORF1p). We identified the first functional L1Rn retrotransposon from this pool of cDNAs, determined its activity in HeLa cells and in the RCL cell line the cDNAs originated from and demonstrate that it is mobilized in the tumor cell line in which it is expressed. Furthermore, we generated monoclonal antibodies directed against L1Rn ORF1 and ORF2-encoded recombinant proteins, analyzed the expression of L1-encoded proteins and found ORF1p predominantly in the nucleus. Our results support the hypothesis that the reported explosive amplification of genomic L1Rn sequences after their transcriptional activation in RCL cells is based on L1 retrotransposition. Therefore, L1 activity might be one cause for genomic instability observed during the progression of leukemia.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>LINE-1s (Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1s or L1s) represent a family of abundant non-long-terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons in mammalian genomes. More than 99.8% of L1s are retrotransposition-defective because they are 5&#x02032; truncated, contain internal rearrangements or harbor mutations within their open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). However, the average human genome is estimated to contain 80&#x02013;100 retrotransposition-competent (RC) L1s, and &#x0223c;10% of these elements are classified as highly active or &#x02018;hot&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). By comparison, the mouse genome is estimated to contain at least 3000 active L1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). L1s have shaped mammalian genomes through a number of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). First, they have greatly expanded the genome both by their own retrotransposition and by providing the machinery necessary for the retrotransposition of other mobile elements, such as <italic>Alu</italic>s and processed pseudogenes. Second, they have shuffled non-L1 sequences throughout the genome by a process termed transduction. Third, they have affected gene expression by several mechanisms.</p><p>The best-studied L1s are those found in mice and men. There are at least 599 000 copies of mouse L1 (L1Md) that are interspersed in all chromosomes, and together comprise &#x0223c;19% of the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). RC L1Mds are &#x0223c;6500 nt in length. Full-length RC-L1s have a 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) with internal promoter activity, two ORFs, a 3&#x02032; UTR that ends in an AATAAA polyadenylation signal and a poly A tail. The role of the ORF1-encoded protein (ORF1p) is poorly understood. ORF1p represents a basic protein that co-fractionates as a large ribonucleoprotein complex with L1 RNA in extracts of human and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>), binds RNA and single-stranded (ss) DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>), and possesses nucleic acid chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). It was suggested that ORF1p is capable of protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The ORF2 protein (ORF2p) provides the enzymatic activities of endonuclease (EN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and reverse transcriptase (RT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) for a process termed &#x02018;target-site primed reverse transcription&#x02019; (TPRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) which is initiating the insertion of a new non-LTR retrotransposon copy into genomic DNA. For efficient retrotransposition, both functional L1-encoded proteins are required in <italic>cis</italic> and must be translated from the primary bicistronic transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>L1 is the only autonomous non-LTR retrotransposon in rodents. Approximately 600 000 copies, in variable stages of decay, comprise &#x0223c;23% of the rat genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Considering the fraction of the genome it is occupying, L1 of <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (L1Rn) is the most successful mammalian L1 retrotransposon identified so far. Following the mouse-rat split, L1 activity appears to have increased in rat. The 3&#x02032; UTR sequences define six rat-specific L1 subfamilies, represented by 150 000 copies that cover 12% of the rat genome. L1 copies accumulated over the same period in mouse cover only 10% of the genome. This higher accumulation of L1 copies could explain some of the size difference between the rat and mouse genome. Full-length L1Rn elements have a structural arrangement similar to that of L1Md and many elements are present as 7-kb full-length copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The 5&#x02032; UTR of L1 in rodents is bipartite: there is a 5&#x02032; module that can occur as a tandem repeat and therefore is referred to as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and a 3&#x02032; module which is called the tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) that links the monomer to ORF1. Although the entire 5&#x02032; UTRs of the modern mouse and rat L1 subfamilies are not homologous, the regulatory property of the monomer was shown using transient expression assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The 5&#x02032; one-third of murine ORF1s contains a hypervariable domain (length polymorphic region, LPR), which has uniquely been the site of repeated deletions and duplications, and in rat it is the locus of replacement base substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The ancestral rat hypervariable domain contains a 21-bp sequence that is deleted in some modern L1Rn elements and a 66-bp sequence that is tandem-duplicated in some elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The currently active L1 in rat is L1<sub>mlvi2</sub> (or L1Rn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), but although evolution of L1Rn elements was intensively studied, structure and nucleotide sequence of a functional L1Rn element is unknown hitherto and there is only sparse information on expression of these elements. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Full-length L1Rn elements are transcribed in RCL cells.

Also, UV irradiation was shown to rapidly induce L1Rn transcription during fast exponential growth of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). L1Rn RNA could be detected in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle of the adult rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), in kidney tissue during the neonatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) as well as in multipotent neural progenitor cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Recently, L1Rn transcription was shown to be up-regulated in adult cardiac tissue after ischemia-reperfusion and the presence of L1-encoded proteins could be demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe isolation and characterization of the first functional rat LINE-1 retrotransposon from a pool of 10 different cDNAs generated from actively transcribed endogenous full-length L1Rn elements which are all coding for intact ORF1ps in rat chloroleukemia (RCL) cells. We determined the retrotransposition activity of this active L1Rn element in HeLa cells as well as in the RCL cell line from which the cDNAs originated. This is the first report on a functional endogenous L1 element that is mobilized in the tumor cell line in which it was shown to be endogenously expressed. In order to investigate L1 translation and subcellular localization of L1-encoded proteins in rat cells, we generated monoclonal antibodies directed against recombinant ORF1p and ORF2p. Our experiments revealed that both L1-encoded proteins are expressed from endogenous elements in RCL cells. While endogenous ORF1 proteins appeared almost exclusively in the nucleus, transiently expressed ORF1p localized predominantly to the cytoplasm. Localization studies with ORF1p deletion mutants indicate that the N-terminal third of ORF1p has a function in cytoplasmic retention and targeting to cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. Our data demonstrating expression and retrotransposition of functional endogenous L1 elements in RCL cells support the idea that L1 activity might be at least one cause for the accumulation of molecular and chromosomal abnormalities leading to genomic instability which is characteristic for the progression of leukemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and UV irradiation</title><p>RCL cells growing in suspension culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and HeLa S3 cells were kindly provided by K.

We chose RCL cells, since they were reported to increase transcription of endogenous L1s by &#x0223c;10-fold after they reached 50% of the maximum population density of the suspension culture, and by even more as a consequence of UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Polyadenylated [poly(A)<sup>+</sup>] RNA was prepared from RCL cells that were growing under the aforementioned conditions activating L1 transcription, and submitted to northern blot analysis using a probe specific for the EN-coding region of L1 ORF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). Among the three detected transcriptional products, a predominant &#x0223c;7-kb band corresponds to full-length L1Rn transcripts. The probe also detected high-molecular-weight transcripts that migrated at 8.3 and &#x0223c;4.7-kb. The 8.3-kb transcript could be the consequence of transcriptional read-through of a full-length L1 element, while the latter might result either from transcription of distinct 5&#x02032;-truncated L1Rn copies or from premature polyadenylation which has been shown to be conserved in mammalian L1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p><p>To identify and isolate full-length RC-L1s from rat, cDNA derived from RNA of UV- irradiated RCL cells was used as template for long-distance PCR employing the oligonucleotides Pr-L1Rn1 and Pr-L1Rn2 which are specific for the monomeric promoter region of the 5&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and for the 3&#x02032; UTR of L1Rn, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Ten resulting PCR products were cloned and sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>C and S1), each consisting of &#x0223c;5.9 kb L1Rn sequences flanked by &#x0223c;640 nt 5&#x02032; UTR- and &#x0223c;260 nt 3&#x02032; UTR sequences. As a consequence of the chosen 5&#x02032; UTR-specific oligonucleotide Pr-L1Rn1, which binds position 156&#x02013;181 of the functional L1Rn promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), the amplified 5&#x02032;-UTR sequences are covering only the following 450&#x02013;453 bp of the 608-bp promoter sequence (Figure S1). Although the most prominent sequence divergences were observed in the highly heterogeneous N-terminal third of ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and S2A), none of the 10 cloned L1Rn cDNA sequences carried any termination codon within ORF1. In contrast, only two isolated cDNAs, L1-3 and L1-13, represent typical mammalian L1-specifc bicistronic RNAs and are characterized by potentially functional ORF2p coding regions that are not interrupted by any termination codons, insertions and/or deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>C and S3). Based on the nomenclature of the heterogeneous ORF1 regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), we categorized our L1Rn sequences in the two classes I-21p and I-21a characterized by the presence (p) or absence (a) of a seven-amino acids insertion around position 64. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A shows an alignment of amino acid sequences of the hypervariable N-terminal third (N-1/3) of ORF1 proteins encoded by the cloned L1Rn cDNAs with the ORF1p sequence of L1<sub>mlvi2&#x02013;rn14</sub> (accession no. U87602), which is a member of the currently active L1 family in <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). ORF1p sequences encoded by L1-3, -8, -10, -12, -13 and -23 are of the I-21p<sub>mod-type</sub> class, defining the modern, most recently emerged subfamily of L1Rn-encoded ORF1ps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Members of this family have the characteristic lysine deletion at position 59 and a 7-amino acid insertion in the N-1/3 region of ORF1p. Both deletion and insertion are absent in ORF1ps encoded by L1-17, -19, -21 and -22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). L1-17-, -19- and -21-encoded ORF1ps include tandem repeats in the hypervariable N-terminal region. While L1-17 and -19 are coding for proteins carrying two slightly differing 22-amino acid tandem repeat insertions resulting from non-synonymous base substitutions, L1-21 is coding for a protein characterized by a 7-amino acid imperfect duplication in the first tandem repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In sharp contrast to these I-21a class sequences, L1-22 is encoding an ORF1p lacking tandem repeats. L1-22 apparently has the potential for an alternative translational start site at nucleotide position -42, leading to an extension of ORF1p at its N-terminus by 14 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and S2A). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Analyses of cDNA-encoded ORF1p classes and intergenic regions (IGR).

All three domains are highly conserved in mammalian L1-encoded ORF2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>A and S3). ORF2 regions of L1-8 and L1-23 are each disrupted by a termination codon (L1-8: <sup>481</sup>CAG&#x02192; TAG; L1-23: <sup>1372</sup>GAA&#x02192; TAA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>C and S3).

For that purpose, we used a cell culture assay that accurately detects authentic retrotransposition events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). In this assay, L1 retrotransposition does not require an intact 5&#x02032; UTR if an exogenous promoter is provided. We replaced the human L1.3 sequence of pJM101/L1.3 covering the 5&#x02032;UTR, both ORFs and the 5&#x02032; part of the 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) by the L1-3 and L1-13 cDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) which are lacking 155 nt of the 5&#x02032; end of the L1Rn-specific promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In the resulting retrotransposition reporter constructs, pAD5/L1-3 and pAD6/L1-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), transcription of the L1Rn cDNAs was under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. While the control construct pJM101/L1<sub>RP</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) as well as pAD5/L1-3 generated G418<sup>R</sup> foci in HeLa cells, both the EN-defective L1<sub>RP</sub>-mutant expressed by pJM101/L1<sub>RP</sub>H230A and pAD6/L1-13 failed to generate G418<sup>R</sup> foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). pAD5/L1-3 generated retrotransposition events at frequencies of 30% relative to pJM101/L1<sub>RP</sub>, while pAD6/L1-13 did not retrotranspose at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). As both ORFs encoded by L1-13 are not destroyed by stop-codons or deletions, we conclude that single point mutations within the ORFs might have inactivated the retrotransposition capacity of the L1-13 element. cDNA sequences of the active L1-3 and the inactive L1-13 element vary in 9, 2 and 5 nucleotides in their 5&#x02032;-UTR-, IGR and 3&#x02032;-UTR sequences, respectively. Point mutations within the coding regions are resulting in 6 and 20 amino acid substitutions in ORF1p and ORF2p, respectively (Figures S2A and S3).

In each of these experiments identical numbers of hygromycin-resistant cells (Hyg<sup>R</sup>) expressing the different L1 retrotransposition reporter constructs were then plated in medium containing G418 separately, and selected for G418 resistance for another 28 days. Live cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion. Transfection of RCL cells with pAD6/L1-13 or with the negative control construct pJM101/L1<sub>RP</sub>H230A led to the elimination of RCL cells after 18-25 days of G418 selection. By contrast, transfection with pJM101/L1<sub>RP</sub> and pAD5/L1-3 was leading to G418<sup>R</sup> cells that continued to grow at a density of 1.3&#x02013;1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml.

Taken together, the data demonstrate authentic retrotransposition from pAD5/L1-3 and pJM101/L1<sub>RP</sub> in RCL cells. These results are also indicating that the functional genomic L1-3 element the isolated cDNA is derived from is actively retrotransposing in the RCL tumor cell line as well.</p><p>The L1Rn cDNAs we had identified could not be attributed unambiguously to defined L1 copies annotated in the present <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> genome database. This is not really surprising as it is known that only 50&#x02013;60% of functional L1 sequences are fixed in mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). This means that our particular active L1-3 sequence might not be annotated in the published rat genome sequence, simply because it does not cover all existing allele variations. Alternatively, we might not find our particular L1 sequence because the presently available sequence &#x02018;draft&#x02019; is covering only &#x0223c;90% of the rat genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Nonetheless, we screened L1base, a database containing L1Rn elements with intact ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), by a BLAST analysis with the L1-3 nucleotide sequence in order to identify additional potentially functional genomic L1Rn copies. Of the 377 full-length L1s with intact ORFs listed in L1base, we identified eight elements (Figure S4A) that differ from L1-3-encoded ORF1p and ORF2p only in &#x02264;3 residues and &#x02264;23 residues, respectively (Figure S4B).</p></sec><sec><title>Transiently expressed ORF1p appears in the cytoplasm with a speckled pattern and is localized to the nucleus</title><p>If the identified L1Rn mRNAs, which are coding for both functional ORFs are actively retrotransposing in RCL cells, the presence of both functional proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, is an essential prerequisite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In order to be able to study the L1Rn-encoded protein machinery, we raised monoclonal antibodies against proteins encoded by intact L1 ORFs. To generate antibodies that are able to react with both major variants of intact ORF1p, we immunized mice with the recombinant, L1-21-encoded ORF1p<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup> polypeptide (&#x0223c;33 kDa) lacking the hypervariable N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>A and S2A). We selected one hybridoma clone named rG24, which is producing IgG specifically recognizing an epitope in the His-tagged ORF1p<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B) that is expected to be conserved among the different classes of L1Rn ORF1ps. To confirm the specificity of this antibody, we transiently transfected REFs with the L1Rn-ORF1 expression constructs pORF1-IRESpuro and pORF1<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup>-IRESpuro (Figure S6, D and E) and with the empty expression vector pIRESpuro (BD Biosciences). We chose REF cells because they do not contain any detectable amounts of RNA expressed from endogenous genomic full-length L1Rn elements (Tolstonog and Schumann, data not shown). Subsequently, transfected cells were tested for specific detection of recombinant ORF1-encoded proteins by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) and immunofluorescence staining with rG24 IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D&#x02013;F). The molecular weight of the polypeptide (&#x0223c;33 kDa) detected with the rG24 antibody in pORF1<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup>-IRESpuro-transfected, but not in pIRESpuro-transfected REF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) is consistent with the theoretical mass of the ORF1<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup> protein expressed in these cells. pORF1-IRESpuro-transfected cells exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic staining with the rG24 IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and E), indicating that the antibody is specifically interacting with the recombinant ORF1p. The absence of detectable staining in non-transfected as well as pIRESpuro-transfected REF cells (data not shown) is consistent with the lack of any traceable L1 RNA in these cells, indicates that expression of endogenous L1-encoded ORF1ps is either negligible or not existing, and supports the specificity of the rG24 antibody. Concurrently, transfection of REF cells gave us also the opportunity to study the intracellular localization of transiently expressed ORF1p and ORF1p<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D&#x02013;F). Co-localization analyses of deconvoluted immunofluorescence images of REF cells transiently transfected with pORF1-IRESpuro, demonstrate that ORF1p is predominantly cytoplasmic forming large aggregates with most of them being associated with vimentin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). A small subset of transiently transfected cells (&#x0003c;1%) was characterized by cytoplasmic as well as nuclear localization of ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). These observations are in line with a previous report demonstrating predominant cytoplasmic aggregation of transiently expressed L1Hs ORF1p but also translocation of epitope-tagged L1Hs ORF1p into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). As demonstrated for human ORF1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and recombinant mouse ORF1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>), the overexpressed L1Rn ORF1 protein is probably able to form stable multimeric complexes, which cannot enter the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). However, an exiguous pool of monomeric ORF1p may exist in the cytoplasm, at least when overexpressed, which are small enough to be transported into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). By contrast, ORF1p<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup> was distinctly localized to the nucleus in all transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F), suggesting that the N-terminal third of ORF1p may either be essential for the formation of multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), which cannot passively enter the nucleus, or have a function in cytoplasmic retention as recently demonstrated for the human L1 ORF1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). The nuclear localization of the N-terminally truncated version of ORF1p could be explained by the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal KKEHMETTLDIENQKKR (residues 150&#x02013;166 in ORF1p encoded by L1-21) and KRKK (residues 204&#x02013;207) predicted in the central third of L1Rn ORF1p (Figure S2B) by the WoLF PSORT server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Our data are also consistent with the recent identification of a sequence within L1Hs ORF1p that was suggested to be responsible for the nuclear localization of truncated L1Hs ORF1p fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Monoclonal anti-ORF1p<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup> antibodies (rG24) specifically recognize ORF1-encoded proteins.

Confocal microscopy of RCL cells immunostained with the rG24 IgG localized the vast majority of ORF1p to the nucleus and only relatively low or barely detectable amounts to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B).

Also, the weak signal intensity of the &#x0223c;150-kDa band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D and E) would be consistent with a reduction of the translation rate of ORF2p relative to ORF1p which was reported to be the consequence of an unconventional termination/reinitiation mechanism during translation of human L1 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). In order to test the possibility that the detected 90-kDa band could be caused by a cross-reacting protein species not related to L1 which is found in RCL but not in REF cells, we immunoprecipitated RCL cell lysates with the 2H9 IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E) and subjected the &#x0223c;90-kDa polypeptide to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses. The obtained results revealed indeed that the 90-kDa protein recognized by the 2H9 antibody is the cellular Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) (data not shown) which is involved in processing and presentation of cellular peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we were able to verify the presence of ORF1- and ORF2-encoded proteins in rat cells by applying monoclonal antibodies directed against recombinant L1Rn-encoded proteins. Molecular weights of the proteins detected with the anti-ORF1p IgM antibody, and the identification of a &#x0223c;150-kDa polypeptide applying the anti-ORF2p IgM antibody are consistent with the presence of functional L1 proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Transcription of both functional and inactive endogenous full-length L1s coincides with L1 retrotransposition in RCL cells</title><p>The recently published genome sequence of <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) shows that the rat L1 element is the most successful member of the mammalian L1 family identified until now. Although previous extensive studies of different structures of rat L1s were focusing on 5&#x02032;UTR sequences and ORF1-coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), functional L1s whose protein machinery is responsible for the success of these mobile elements had not been identified so far. Therefore, we set out to identify functional and actively transcribed endogenous L1Rn elements, and to generate monoclonal antibodies to identify L1Rn-encoded proteins. Furthermore, we explored whether functional endogenous L1 elements are mobilized in a given tumor cell line which could support genome instability generally attributed to tumor cells.</p><p>In RCL cells that were grown under conditions supporting transcriptional activation of L1Rn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), we detected significant amounts of L1-specific transcriptional products of three different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). We were able to generate 10 L1 cDNAs from RNA isolated from UV-irradiated RCL cells, each covering nearly full-length L1 sequences. The fact that we isolated almost full-length cDNAs from RCL cells is suggesting that they are derived from the putative &#x0223c;7-kb full-length transcripts and/or the putative &#x0223c;8.3-kb read-through products. Six isolated L1Rn cDNAs, including the functional L1-3 sequence, are derived from the phylogenetically youngest family of L1Rn elements, the I-21p<sub>mod-type</sub>, and only four originate from the older I-21a class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). While each of the cDNAs had coding capacity for intact ORF1ps, only two of them also included non-interrupted ORF2 coding regions, and therefore had the potential to represent RC-L1s. Applying a retrotransposition reporter assay in HeLa as well as in RCL cells, we tested the latter two cDNAs for their potential to retrotranspose. We demonstrated that only the L1-3 cDNA is functional and the transposition rate in HeLa cells amounted to 30% relative to the highly active human L1 element, L1<sub>RP</sub>. <italic>De novo</italic> insertions carry the hallmarks of human L1 retrotransposition initiated by TPRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We further show that the tagged L1-3 cDNA can retrotranspose in the RCL tumor cell line the endogenous L1-3 element was originally expressed in and from which its RNA was isolated. Therefore, we conclude that the untagged, endogenously expressed L1-3 RNA is also retrotransposing in RCL cells. This conclusion is supported by a previous publication presenting evidence for transcriptional activation of endogenous L1Rn elements in RCL cells and subsequent amplification of genomic L1 sequences &#x0223c;24 h later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Activation of endogenous L1 expression is also observed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells isolated from CML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), and it was shown to be caused by hypomethylation of L1 promoter sequences. It was suggested that such a reactivation of retroelements might contribute to genomic instability in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). Furthermore, it was hypothesized that ongoing L1 retrotransposition in CML cell lines might be an explanation for the observation that the transition of CML from the chronic phase to the blast crisis is characterized by the accumulation of molecular and chromosomal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Translation and subcellular localization of ORF1p</title><p>Similar to L1Hs, the L1Rn transcript is unusual because a 60-bp intergenic spacer containing two in-frame stop codons separates ORF1 and ORF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). It is likely that L1Rn-encoded ORF1p and ORF2p are translated from one full-length, bicistronic L1 mRNA by an unconventional termination/reinitiation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66 B67 B68 B69">66&#x02013;69</xref>). Also, the fact that our rG24 antibody reactive to native L1Rn ORF1p has only identified &#x0223c;40- and &#x0223c;46-kDa products argues against the synthesis of an ORF1p-ORF2p fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Consistently, immunoblot analyses of RCL cell extracts with the anti-ORF2p antibody led to the detection of a &#x0223c;150 kDa protein in RCL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D). This again is in accordance with the detection of an L1 ORF2 protein with a similar molecular weight in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments indicate that both L1Rn ORF1p classes, I-21a and I-21p, are present in RCL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, B and D) The results are suggesting that there is no obvious bias in expression activity of any of the two classes, and that there is a highly heterogeneous group of ORF1ps expressed in these cells. Because 9 out of 10 isolated close-to-full-length cDNAs are retrotransposition-incompetent but are coding for intact ORF1ps, it can be concluded that the vast majority of the detected cellular ORF1ps is not part of functional RNP complexes. The heterogeneous pool of ORF1p visualized in the nuclei of RCL cells could also include defective proteins, which are encoded by mutated L1 ORF1 copies. Also, a fraction of the detected &#x0223c;40-kDa ORF1ps may be the result of expression of copies of the non-autonomous HAL1 element that is derived from L1 by deletion of its ORF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). There are about 7500 HAL1 copies in the rat genome, and it was concluded that the currently identified HAL1-like elements (RNHAL1) still propagate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). RNHAL1 contains only an ORF1, and the 5&#x02032; 2600 bases are 98% identical to the L1 currently active in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The repeated origin and high copy number of HAL1s suggest that the ORF1 product, which binds strongly to its messenger RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>), may render this transcript a superior target for L1-mediated reverse transcription. Taken together, the majority of these heterogeneous, endogenous ORF1p may not be able to be part of functional L1 RNPs, because of the absence of an intact ORF2 protein, or because they are not able to multimerize or interact with their full-length RNA due to mutations. These monomeric ORF1ps may be small enough to be transported into the nucleus and cause the predominant nuclear staining of RCL cells observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B. Accumulation of both the vast majority of endogenous ORF1p and a fraction of transiently expressed ORF1p in the nuclei of RCL and few REF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E), respectively, could be explained by two predicted NLS in the conserved C-terminal two-thirds of both L1Rn-ORF1p classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and S2B). The presence of an NLS in ORF1p is supported by the exclusive nuclear localization of the transiently expressed, N-terminally truncated ORF1p<sup>&#x00394;1&#x02013;143</sup> in REF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F). As, by contrast, transiently expressed ORF1p was found predominantly in the cytoplasm in an aggregated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and E), the N-terminal third of ORF1p may either be essential for the formation of multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) which cannot be transported into the nucleus, or have a function in cytoplasmic retention as recently demonstrated for the human L1 ORF1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p><p>Although endogenous ORF1p patterns in mouse and humans were described to be predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), more recent publications are reporting that L1 ORF1p is also migrating into the nucleus: (i) Transiently expressed functional human ORF1p was detected mainly in the cytoplasm and in nucleolar sites in human osteosarcoma and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). (ii) Immunohistochemical analyses revealed both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of rat ORF1p in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>); (iii) Tagged human L1 ORF1p was visualized in the nucleus of human 143 Btk- and 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p><p>Also, the ORF1-encoded Gag protein of TART, a LINE-like non-LTR retrotransposon from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is found predominantly in the nucleus where it has a role in telomeric localization of TART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). Although the precise function of ORF1p in L1 retrotransposition remains unclear, the nucleic acid chaperone activity of ORF1p proposed to contribute to reverse transcription by TPRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) would require the presence of functional ORF1p in the nucleus.</p><p>The interaction between ORF1p and vimentin observed under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions raises the possibility that cytoskeletal proteins, such as IF proteins, might be important for the intracellular localization of ORF1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The localization of RNA encoded by the LINE-like retrotransposon <italic>Doc</italic> in the region of the cytoskeleton of <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>) would be consistent with a role of IFs in intracellular localization of retrotransposon RNPs. Two possible roles of an interaction of ORF1p with intermediate filaments could be envisioned:</p><p>One of the steps of the L1 retrotransposition cycle that could be affected by this interaction is the transport of cytoplasmic RNP complex particles to the nucleus. Since intermediate filaments directly connect nuclear and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>), they could serve as a guide to direct RNPs toward the nucleus. ORF1p, as a major part of the L1 RNP and because of its affinity for vimentin, could consequently serve as an anchor molecule and allow the two-dimensional movement of RNPs along IFs through the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane. Such a guided movement of RNPs would be significantly more efficient than undirected diffusion. A similar role in the guided movement of viral particles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was proposed for the recently reported interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein and vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>). Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TMEV) capsid protein was also shown to interact with vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>) but the function of this interaction is unknown.</p><p>Alternatively, vimentin may interact with L1 ORF1p as one component of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). This would suggest a mechanism whereby the host cell may attenuate the potential mutagenic effects of retrotransposition by sequestering L1 RNPs and possibly targeting them for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that RNP particles of variable composition (stress granules) are associated with vimentin in Ptk<sub>1</sub> and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, ORF2p localization studies in RCL cells cannot be performed with our monoclonal 2H9 antibody raised against recombinant L1Rn ORF2p, because mass spectrometry revealed that this antibody is not only recognizing the L1Rn ORF2-encoded 150-kDa protein but is also cross-reacting with the cellular HSP90 protein. Nevertheless, this antibody is applicable for the study of recombinant L1Rn ORF2p transiently expressed in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). <italic>In silico</italic> analyses of the L1-3-encoded ORF2p sequence on the PredictNLS server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) revealed that the conservative amino acid sequence LRDKDR (residues 48&#x02013;53, accession no. AAY88216) which is localized within the EN domain, is a putative NLS. Its functionality in the context of the EN domain is supported by the nuclear localization of transiently expressed full-length L1Rn ORF2p in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). The observation that transiently expressed full-length L1Hs ORF2p is mainly accumulated in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) and 143B osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) could be explained by differences between the putative NLS sequences of L1Rn-EN (LRDKDR) and the respective corresponding region in L1Hs-EN (LTDKDT) (Figure S3). Based on analyses on the PredictNLS server, the latter sequence motif is not consistent with a putative NLS function.</p></sec><sec><title>Applications</title><p>The functional L1Rn element L1-3 has the potential to serve as a tool in transgenic research. In recent years, transgenic rats were increasingly favored as model organisms to study cardiovascular diseases and brain physiology. Also, the laboratory rat is the principle model in the initial stages of drug development because their organ sizes allows more detailed investigations, which are problematic in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>). In transgenic rats, a tagged functional L1Rn element that is under control of a tissue-specific promoter will be useful as insertional mutagen or as a gene-trap tool helping to dissect genetic mechanisms of pathologic processes. Furthermore, the ORF1p-specific monoclonal antibody described in this work will enable cell-biological studies on L1 ORF1p with broad application to rat tumor models and will help expand our knowledge about L1 biology and the role of L1s in disease development and tumorigenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_10.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_4.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_5.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_6.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_7.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_8.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_9.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm1045_nar-00736-w-2007-File010.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Annemarie Scherbarth and Ulrike Traub for providing tissue culture cells, Klaus Boller for crucial advice in immunofluorescence imaging, Heike Strobel and Katharina Grikscheit for excellent technical support, and Johannes L&#x000f6;wer for helpful discussions.
