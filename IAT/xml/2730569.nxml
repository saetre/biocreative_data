Trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) leads to chromatin silencing and the formation of heterochromatin by recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). dSETDB1/Eggless (Egg), the ortholog of the human methyltransferase SETDB1, is the only essential H3K9 methyltransferase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is required for H3K9 trimethylation in the female germ line. Here we show that Windei (Wde), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of mouse mAM and human MCAF1, is an essential cofactor of Egg required for its nuclear localization and function in female germ line cells. By deletion analysis combined with coimmunoprecipitation, we have identified the protein regions in Wde and Egg that are necessary and sufficient for the interaction between the two proteins. We furthermore identified a region of Egg that gets covalently modified by SUMOylation, which may facilitate the formation of higher order chromatin-modifying complexes. Together with Egg, Wde localizes to euchromatin, is enriched on chromosome 4, and binds to the Painting of fourth (POF) protein. Our data provide the first genetic and phenotypic analysis of a mAM/MCAF1 homolog in a model organism and demonstrate its essential function in the survival of germ line cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Germ line cells are the only cells in an organism that are able to transmit their genetic material to the next generation by forming eggs or sperm. They do not participate in the formation or function of tissues and organs and therefore show a unique pattern of transcription, with many genes being silenced that are only required for somatic functions. The covalent modification of histones by methylation, acetylation, and other mechanisms is crucial for these global alterations in the transcriptional program. Among the modifications involved in silencing of chromatin regions, methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) is among the most important ones. Methylation of this residue in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is controlled by three different histone methyl transferases, but only one of these, dSETDB1/Eggless, is essential for viability and fertility of the fly. Here we describe an essential cofactor for dSETDB1/Eggless that is specifically required in germ line cells for their survival. This cofactor, that we called Windei, binds to dSETDB1/Eggless and recruits it to the nucleus. Null mutations in <italic>windei</italic> show strongly reduced trimethylation of H3K9 in germ line cells, demonstrating that Windei is one of the factors required for controlling chromatin organization in the germ line.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The epigenetic regulation of gene expression by the modification of histone proteins is a very important mechanism to control the differentiation of many cell types during development.

We have confirmed and extended these observations by showing that a region including the coiled-coil domain of Wde is sufficient for binding to Egg and that a short region of Egg (aa 366&#x02013;521) devoid of any known protein motif is sufficient for binding to Wde. For mAM/MCAF1 it was proposed that its binding to SETDB1 alters the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of the histone methyl transferase domain, thus allowing efficient trimethylation of H3K9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000644-Wang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. While the same may be true for the Wde/Egg interaction, our results show that in the absence of Wde, Egg is hardly detectable in germ line cells, most likely because Wde is required to protect Egg from proteolytic degradation. Moreover, when Egg is overexpressed in the absence of Wde, it fails to localize to the nucleus, revealing an additional function for Wde in nuclear import of Egg.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Wde binds to POF and may control the transcription of genes located on chromosome 4</title><p>On polytene chromosomes Wde binds strongly to the fourth chromosome and to multiple euchromatic bands on all other chromosomes.
