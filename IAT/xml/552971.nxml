Flp-recombinase-mediated cassette exchange was demonstrated to be highly efficient in our system, even in the absence of locus-specific selection. The feasibility of constructing a library of ES cell clones using our gene trap vectors was tested and a thousand insertion sites were characterized, following electroporation in ES cells, by RACE&#x02013;PCR and sequencing. We validated the system <italic>in vivo</italic> for two trapped loci in transgenic mice and demonstrated that the reporter transgenes inserted into the trapped loci have an expression pattern identical to the endogenous genes. We believe that this system will facilitate <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of gene function and large-scale generation of mouse models of human diseases, caused by not only loss but also gain of function alleles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The study of gene function <italic>in vivo</italic> has been facilitated by the insertion of transgenes in the mouse genome, either at random sites or at preselected sites by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). When a transgene is injected in zygote pronuclei, there is no control over where it is introduced into the genome. This affects the reproducibility of the transgene expression pattern, a problem which was only partially solved by BAC-based transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). On the other hand, homologous recombination while ideally suited for gene replacements and knock-outs is still somewhat laborious and time consuming, despite the recent development of high-throughput protocols.</p><p>Gene trapping strategies have been developed to partially circumvent these limitations, because they allow the selection of ES cell clones carrying the DNA insertion and a rapid identification of the trapped gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The ultimate aim of gene trapping approaches is to generate a collection of ES &#x02018;gene trapped&#x02019; clones that encompass all genes in the genome, as already proposed by Hicks <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). This is a very ambitious project that will require the effort of several laboratories over several years. While published reports in this field appear to have adopted the gene trapping approach exclusively or primarily to generate loss of function alleles, it would be relevant to take advantage of these &#x02018;insertion sites&#x02019; into genes for other purposes, such as the creation of allelic series. Along these lines, an additional feature of the vectors used for gene trapping strategies would be that of allowing to exchange the initial reporter cassette with any desired DNA sequence. This additional feature would greatly expand the usefulness, versatility and flexibility of a large collection of ES clones. For example, if the trapped gene is relevant for a human disease, multiple different alleles can be generated by cassette exchange. In addition, it is possible to exchange the trapped cassette with <italic>trans</italic>-regulation functions (cre recombinase, tet-dependent repressors and activators, etc.), which can be expressed in specific cells and tissues, taking advantage of the pattern of expression of the trapped gene.</p><p>Cassette exchange has been successfully achieved in cell culture by exploiting the property of Cre or Flp recombinases and their recognition sequences [Lox and Flp recognition target site (FRT), respectively]. For example, Bode <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) have shown that a cassette exchange can be readily obtained if the recipient and the donor cassette are both flanked by matched heterospecific FRT sites. In addition, some of the public databases (Sanger Institute Gene Trap resource, Centre of Modeling Human Disease and German Gene Trap Consortium) report the sequence of trapped genes employing vectors carrying flanking heterospecific FRT or loxP sites, however, without experimental details describing their use.</p><p>In this work, we describe novel vectors that afford flp-based cassette exchange, and, more importantly, present evidence that with these reagents and method we can generate mice strains, which carry at the same locus different cassette obtained by flp-mediated exchange.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Vector construction</title><p>The pFLIPa1 vector is a modification of the pGT1.8bgeo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), and pFLIPb1 and FLIPb2 are variants of the RET gene trap vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), respectively. These vectors have been engineered and modified through the introduction of two heterospecific Flp-recognition sites (F5/F1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and buffer regions derived from the pBS SK<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> plasmid. Two double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the mutated and wild-type FRT sequences (indicated as F5 and F1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) were ligated to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of gene trapping cassettes derived from the pGT1.8bgeo and RET vectors. The modified cassette was ligated to SalI-digested BS SK<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup>; the buffer sequences, flanking the cassette, are the segment of the pBS plasmid derived from the linearization of the vector with ScaI present in the ampicillin gene.</p><p>The exchange vector pEXCH1 was generated by the substitution of the bgeo cassette of pIRESbgeo vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) with the Hygromicin&#x02013;green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion gene (NheI/ClaI fragment) derived from pTK-HygEGFP vector (Clontech). The pEXCH2 vector was created by the insertion of the SAiresCre-PR cassette, in front of the tk/Hygro/GFP cassette of the commercial vector. As buffer sequence, at 3&#x02032; of the F1 site in the backbone of the vector, we cloned at SpeI site a 1 kb region containing segments of noncoding DNA of human origin (stuffer), derived from adenoviral vector (C4HSU) described by Sandig <italic>et al</italic>.

We used standard culture conditions to grow and maintain the ES cell lines. ES cells were electoporated with ScaI-linearized pFLIPa1, pFLIPb1 and pFLIPb2 vectors and selected with G418 as described previously. Briefly, 10<sup>8</sup> ES cells were electroporated with 150 &#x003bc;g of linearized vector DNA in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), by applying single pulse at 0.8 mV, 3 &#x003bc;F in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. After electroporation, cells were seeded on gelatin-coated plates at 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/100 mm dish. Selection with G418 (Gibco-BRL) at the recommended concentration started 48 h after electroporation. After 7&#x02013;10 days of selection, single G418-resistant colonies were isolated, then picked and replicated in 96-well dishes. A set of master plates were frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C using standard conditions.</p><p>The &#x003b2;gal activity of the clones generated with pFLIPa1 vector was assayed by Xgal staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), and &#x003b2;gal positive cell lines were cultured and duplicated for total RNA purification.</p></sec><sec><title>5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RACE&#x02013;PCR and direct sequencing</title><p>The pFLIPa1 insertions were characterized by 5&#x02032; RACE&#x02013;PCR, while the pFLIPb1 and pFLIPb2 insertions by 3&#x02032; RACE&#x02013;PCR. In detail, total RNA from ES cell lines was prepared using SV 96 total RNA isolation system (Promega) with the BIOMEK 2000 robot (Beckman Coulter). The 5&#x02032; RACE&#x02013;PCRs were performed by using 5&#x02032; RACE kit (Invitrogen) on total RNA extracted from ES cells.

The salient features of this vector are (i) the buffer regions, which are segments added to avoid loss of informative sequences from both ends before integration in the genome; (ii) the mutated FRT recognition sequence (F5) and the wild-type FRT sequence (F1), which are unable to recombine with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and allow Flp-mediated cassette exchange (Flp-RMCE); (iii) the mouse <italic>engrailed 2</italic> splice acceptor sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>); (iv) the promoterless coding sequence for the <italic>beta-galactosidase-neo</italic> fusion gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>); and (v) the SV40 poly(A) addition signal.</p></sec><sec><title>3&#x02032; tagging vectors</title><p>We also constructed a novel 3&#x02032; tagging vector, pFLIPb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), in which the selectable marker lacks a poly(A) signal, whereby if its insertion occurs upstream of an endogenous poly(A) signal, it will be expressed independently on the expression of the trapped gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The salient features of this vector are (i) the &#x02018;protective&#x02019; buffer regions; (ii) the F5 and F1 sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>); (iii) the mouse <italic>bcl-2</italic> splice acceptor sequence; (iv) the mouse RNA polII gene promoter, which drives the selectable marker neomycin; and (v) the mouse HPRT splice donor sequence, followed by the mRNA instability signal derived from the human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>An additional feature of the 3&#x02032; trapping vector is the possibility to carry any promoterless gene of interest (GOI), upstream of the selectable marker, and whose transcription should be driven by the endogenous promoter of the trapped locus. As an example, we constructed pFLIPb1, in which the promoterless GOI is <italic>GFP</italic>, and FLIPb2 in which the promoterless GOI is a progesterone-regulated <italic>Cre</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cassette-exchange vectors</title><p>In order to exchange the tag at the trapped locus, the exchange vectors must contain similarly oriented FRT sequences, and different buffer sequences. For this purpose, we constructed pEXCH1 and pEXCH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) with the following features: (i) the same set of heterospecific FRT sites (F5 and F1), in the same orientation of the corresponding FLIPa and FLIPb vectors, flanking the gene cassette; (ii) the &#x02018;protective&#x02019; buffer sequences different from those added to the FLIP vectors in order to design discriminative primers between the vectors (see Materials and Methods); (iii) the mouse <italic>engrailed 2</italic> splice acceptor sequence; and (iv) the SV40 poly(A) addition signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Gene tagging</title><p>To disseminate various tags (&#x003b2;gal, GFP or Cre) into the ES cells genome, the same experimental procedure was applied to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; trapping vectors. In all our experiments, a feeder-independent ES cell line (E14Tg2A.4) was used.</p><p>After electroporation with pFLIPa1, the cells were subjected to G418 selection and independent clones were analyzed for &#x003b2;gal activity. In our experimental conditions, an average of 30% (1012 out of 3360) of the clones expressed detectable &#x003b2;gal. To identify the integration sites, we performed the 5&#x02032; RACE&#x02013;PCR on total RNA extracted from &#x003b2;gal-positive cells. One-fifth (203 out of 1012) of the clones did not yield any PCR product. The remaining clones (809) were analyzed by direct PCR-sequencing and their sequences compared with the public mouse genome databases using the BLAST algorithm. This analysis revealed that in 95% (768) of the clones splicing between endogenous splice sites and the vector occurred as expected. Five percent (41) of the clones, in which there was no sign of a splicing event, were discarded. Sequence analysis of the remaining clones revealed that 60% (461) of them matched known genes, 34% (261) matched expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The remaining 6% (46) did not match any sequence in the public sequence databases. Although most of the insertions were unique (42%), the same integration site was found in more than one clone, probably due to integration hot-spots, as already reported in other gene trapping studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>A list of unique trapped genes with pFLIPa1 is reported in Supplementary Table 1.</p><p>We introduced the pFLIPb1 and pFLIPb2 into ES cells and 48 h later G418 selection was initiated to select for integration events. A total of 4 &#x000d7; 96 well plates were arrayed and the 3&#x02032; RACE&#x02013;PCR was used to detect the insertion sites. Direct PCR sequencing followed by the BLAST analysis revealed that the splicing properly occurred between the vector and the endogenous splice sites in 91% (262) of the clones with the pFLIPb1 vector. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that 74% (213) of them matched with known genes, 26% (68) with ESTs.</p><p>The analysis of the clones obtained with the pFLIPb2 vector shows that the splicing occurred in the 80% (77) of the clones with a similar distribution of matches, 66% (51) with known genes and 33% (25) with ESTs. A list of the trapped genes with pFLIPb1 and FLIPb2 is shown in the Supplementary Table 2.</p><p>To test the ability of the pFLIPb2 vector to trap genes independently of their expression status, we used the progesterone-regulated Cre system and an indicator vector containing a loxP-disrupted lacZ transgene. Using this system, we found that in 60% of these clones Cre was able to induce &#x003b2;gal activity in undifferentiated ES cells, while in an additional 30% of the clones the induction of &#x003b2;gal activity was observed only in differentiated ES cells, obtained after LIF deprivation. The remaining 10% of the clones did not induce &#x003b2;gal activity (data not shown).</p><p>To estimate the fraction of ES clones with multiple insertions, we performed FISH analysis on 12 clones, using the entire plasmid vector as probe. A single fluorescent spot was observed in 11 out of 12 analyzed clones. In the 12th clone, we observed a double fluorescent spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>Southern blot analysis was also performed on the same clones. Hybridization with the neo probe revealed that those clones with a single integration show a single band of different length, whereas the clone with double integration shows a double band, of 8 kb and 11 kb, respectively, confirming the results of the FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cassette exchange</title><p>The cassette exchange mediated by the Flp recombinase is based on the observation that a DNA segment flanked by two heterospecific FRT sites can be exchanged with another DNA cassette flanked by the same set of heterospecific FRT sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>To find out whether the Flp-RMCE takes place at the tagged loci and how efficient is this reaction, we designed a set of experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the exchange with or without a locus-specific selection. The RMCE strategy is schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>.</p><p>Six different tagged clones (<italic>B56/PP2A&#x003b3;</italic>, <italic>SPNR</italic>, <italic>Otub1</italic>, <italic>Pep4</italic>, <italic>Rex2</italic> and <italic>Usp9y</italic>) were transfected with the exchange vector pEXCH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), which contains the promoterless Hygro/GFP cassette, which will be driven by the endogenous promoter of the tagged locus, flanked by the two heterospecific FRT sites in the same orientation as the genomic tag. The <italic>in vitro</italic> enhanced FlpE recombinase was transfected in an expression vector (pCAAGS/FlpE) by electroporation, and 20 independent hygro-resistant ES clones were subjected to further analysis. Hybridization with the hygro probe revealed a 7 kb fragment on Southern blot analysis in the subclones in which RMCE had taken place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The data were also confirmed by PCR using buffer-specific primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We evaluated the frequency of the site-specific recombination occurred in the different clones, ranging from 92 to 56%, with an average frequency of 75%. Thus, the results demonstrated that the locus-specific recombination event mediated by FlpE is highly favored over random insertion.</p><p>We then evaluated whether the FlpE enzyme is able to drive a genetic element in the tagged locus in the absence of a locus-specific selection. To this aim, we generated an exchange vector (pEXCH2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) containing (i) a promoterless progesterone-regulated form of the <italic>Cre</italic> gene (CRE-PR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) that will be driven by the endogenous promoter of the tagged locus and (ii) the <italic>Hygro/GFP</italic> fusion gene, under the control of the tk promoter that is necessary for the selection of transfectants but not for the selection of the exchange event at the trapped locus. The pEXCH2 vector was introduced with FlpE by electroporation in the <italic>SPNR</italic>-tagged clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p>After transfectants selection, 30 hygro-resistant clones were analyzed by PCR, showing that a correct exchange occurred in 2 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, 7%). Taken together, these results indicate that our cassette-exchange system does not require locus-specific selection and that the process is frequent enough to identify the exchanged clone by screening a relatively small number of clones. We also demonstrated that the progesterone-regulated Cre was functional in our clones by infecting the exchanged clones with an indicator vector containing a loxP-disrupted lacZ transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We found that &#x003b2;gal activity was strictly dependent on Cre-mediated recombination and the production of an active Cre is regulated by the progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> studies</title><p>Of crucial importance was to verify that the ES cells that had undergone multiple passages were still capable of germline transmission and that the transcription of the various tags exchanged by RMCE in the tagged loci show the identical pattern of expression of the endogenous gene. To this end, we generated transgenic animals using ES cell clones before and after the cassette exchange. For this analysis, we selected the ES cell clones bearing the insertions in the <italic>B56/PP2A</italic>&#x003b3; isoform and <italic>SPNR</italic> genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>Both the original trapped ES cell clone and the corresponding one after the cassette exchanges were injected into blastocysts to generate mouse chimeras. The resulting chimeras were used to produce mouse lines bearing either the original trap cassette (&#x003b2;gal) or the exchanged GFP cassette. We studied the expression patterns of &#x003b2;gal and GFP in heterozygous animals, and compared them with those of the corresponding endogenous genes. The <italic>B56/PP2A</italic>&#x003b3; isoform transcript showed at 14.5 d.p.c. a major expression site in the developing heart. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> (top left) shows the expression pattern of the endogenous <italic>B56/PP2A</italic>&#x003b3; isoform gene in the heart by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Analysis of &#x003b2;gal activity (trap cassette) and GFP fluorescence (exchanged cassette) revealed an identical expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We confirmed that the protein co-localizes in the same tissue by immunofluorescence using anti-GFP antibodies. In conclusion, we observed that the expression pattern of the reporter genes faithfully mimicked that of the endogenous gene.</p><p>We also studied the <italic>B56/PP2A</italic>&#x003b3; isoform gene expression in adult mice. In this case, a specific pattern of expression of the endogenous gene is observed in the cerebellum and hippocampus. We confined the analysis to the B56<sup>+/GFP</sup> mice and we demonstrated by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization that the GFP transgene reproduced the same expression pattern, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>.</p><p>A similar analysis was also performed for the SPNR mice carrying the GFP cassette after the RMCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We observed that the transgene had the same pattern of expression of the endogenous <italic>SPNR</italic> gene, as visualized by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with both SPNR and GFP probes and by direct GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Taken together, these data provide experimental evidence that ES clones that have undergone the cassette exchange treatment retain the capacity of germ-line transmission and that the RMCE does not significantly interfere with the regulation of the endogenous promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the majority of the previously published work on gene trap methodologies, the genomic modifications mediated by the gene trap vectors are essentially irreversible and the trapped loci cannot be further manipulated. In some cases, loxP and FRT sites were used to perform RMCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), but these studies were confined to <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The present work sought to refine the design of the RMCE vectors and to demonstrate the flexibility of the strategy for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications, i.e. the construction of mouse strains carrying exchanged cassettes.</p><p>The cassette-exchange system has important applications in the development of animal models, especially for those models of human genetic diseases that are characterized by allelic heterogeneity. In &#x02018;recessive&#x02019; diseases, the presence of &#x02018;hypomorphic&#x02019;, rather than null mutations may result in milder phenotypes, while in &#x02018;dominant&#x02019; diseases different gain of function mutations at the same locus may result in completely different phenotypes. In these situations, a simple &#x02018;knock-out&#x02019; of the disease gene does not provide a good animal model to study the phenotype of different mutations. Conversely, a disease locus trapped by our cassette-exchange system can be easily manipulated multiple times with mutated cDNAs, thus allowing the substitution of the wild-type allele with a variety of disease-causing mutant alleles.</p><p>Transgenic mice are typically generated by using cDNAs flanked by &#x02018;surrogate&#x02019; promoters driving their expression either in a ubiquitous or in a tissue-specific manner. This approach has several limitations. First, the pattern of expression of the transgene might differ (sometimes significantly) from the pattern of expression of the endogenous gene, both in the amount and tissue distribution. Second, the expression pattern will be influenced by the site of integration into the mouse genome, thus limiting the reproducibility of the expression pattern even when the same promoter is used multiple times. Third, the choice of the promoter that mimics as much as possible the expression of the favored gene is limited by the &#x02018;repertoire&#x02019; of characterized promoters.</p><p>Ideally, transgenic animals should express the GOI with the same regulation of the endogenous one. In this case, labor-intensive gene-targeting experiments must be performed to insert an extra-copy of the transgene under the control of the endogenous regulatory sequences.</p><p>Our approach has the potential of overcoming these difficulties using the power of gene trapping with the flexibility and reproducibility of the cassette-exchange system.</p><p>Our system can be used to create a large collection of ES cells, each carrying a tag whose expression is driven by a different promoter. These tags may potentially become &#x02018;standard&#x02019; insertion sites for the expression of any transgene in specific tissues and in a reproducible way. Among the potential applications of this strategy are the construction of a collection of ES cells that can be tagged at the same locus with expression reporter genes (beta-gal, gfp, etc.) with site-specific recombinase (for example cre, as shown in this work), or transactivators (e.g. tTA, rtTA, etc.), for drug-induced and reversible gene expression in different tissues, or with toxin-encoding genes (e.g. tk, DTA) for cell ablation studies.</p><p>We validated <italic>in vivo</italic> the efficacy of our system by generating two sets of transgenic mice carrying the tag in two different loci. In both the cases, expression pattern of transgenes, before and after the cassette exchange, was identical to those of the endogenous-tagged genes. These data provide clear evidence that RMCE does not interfere with the regulation of gene expression.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that our vectors can efficiently and reliably trap genes in ES cells. We isolated several hundreds of ES cell clones carrying insertions in genes expressed and not expressed in ES cells. A comprehensive collection of ES cells bearing cassette-exchange tags will be a useful resource for functional genomics and disease studies.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_4_e44__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_4_e44__1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_4_e44__2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank W.

The salient features of these vectors are described in the text. (<bold>b</bold>) FISH and Southern analysis. Fluorescent hybridization, performed with the entire vector sequence as probe, visualized a single spot in those clones, in which a single copy integration occurred (indicated by asterisk). A double fluorescent spot is visualized in those clones where double integration occurred (indicated by double asterisk). The clones were then analyzed by Southern blot analysis. Single-copy integrants show single band of different length, while the double integrant is visualized by the presence of two bands. (<bold>c</bold>) Schematic diagram of the RMCE strategy with the pEXCH2 vector. A tagged clone is subjected to a co-transfection with an exchange vector, containing a GOI, and the FlpE recombinase. The DNA cassette to be exchanged must be flanked by the same set of heterospecific FRT sites, present in the trapping vector.

The PCR product specific to FlpE-mediated cassette exchange gave the expected 500 bp product from all the candidate clones diagnosed by the Southern blot analysis, in which a 7 kb band is observed.
