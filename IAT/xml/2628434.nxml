As cell population density increases, the accumulation of autoinducers leads to co-ordinated changes in gene expression across the bacterial community. The marine bacterium, <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic>, uses three autoinducers to achieve intra-species, intra-genera and inter-species cell&#x02013;cell communication. The detection of these autoinducers ultimately leads to the production of LuxR, the quorum-sensing master regulator that controls expression of the genes in the quorum-sensing regulon. LuxR is a member of the TetR protein superfamily; however, unlike other TetR repressors that typically repress their own gene expression and that of an adjacent operon, LuxR is capable of activating and repressing a large number of genes. Here, we used protein binding microarrays and a two-layered bioinformatics approach to show that LuxR binds a 21 bp consensus operator with dyad symmetry. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses of two promoters directly regulated by LuxR allowed us to identify those bases that are critical for LuxR binding.

As cell population density increases, AIs accumulate and trigger population-wide changes in the expression of genes involved in processes including motility, biofilm formation, virulence, type III secretion and bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Waters and Bassler, 2005</xref>). The marine bacterium, <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic>, makes and responds to at least three different AIs; HAI-1 (3-hydroxybutanoyl homoserine lactone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cao and Meighen, 1989</xref>), CAI-1 [(<italic>S</italic>)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Higgins <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and AI-2 [(2<italic>S</italic>,4<italic>S</italic>)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran-borate] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). HAI-1, CAI-1 and AI-2 are suggested to mediate intra-species, intra-genera and inter-species cell&#x02013;cell communication respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Henke and Bassler, 2004a</xref>). <italic>V. harveyi</italic> detection of these AIs requires three cognate two-component sensors that function in a phosphorelay cascade that impinges on the phosphorylation state of the response-regulator protein LuxO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bassler <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Freeman <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lilley and Bassler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Henke and Bassler, 2004a</xref>). At low cell density, phospho-LuxO activates transcription of genes encoding five small RNAs (<italic>qrr</italic>1&#x02013;5) that act to destabilize the <italic>luxR</italic> transcript, preventing production of the global quorum-sensing regulatory protein, LuxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Lenz <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Tu and Bassler, 2007</xref>). Increasing AI concentration reverses the phosphorelay, depleting phospho-LuxO, which leads to termination of <italic>qrr</italic> expression and a corresponding increase in LuxR production. LuxR, directly or indirectly, controls the expression of genes in the quorum-sensing regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Waters and Bassler, 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The <italic>V. harveyi</italic> quorum-sensing circuit. At high cell density, the three two-component sensors, CqsS, LuxN and LuxPQ, bind their respective AIs and act as phosphatases, resulting, via LuxU, in dephosphorylation of LuxO. This terminates <italic>qrr</italic>1&#x02013;5 sRNA production and permits the translation of the master regulator, LuxR. Quorum-sensing target genes are classified according to their affinity for LuxR as indicated by arrow thicknesses. Class III genes have high affinity for LuxR, Class II genes have intermediate affinity and Class I genes have the lowest affinity. Dashed lines indicate the flow of phosphate at high cell density. The three AIs are CAI-1, HAI-1 and AI-2, and they are synthesized by CqsA, LuxM and LuxS respectively. Hfq is a sRNA chaperone.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0070-0076-f1"/></fig><p>In many Gram-negative bacteria, e.g. <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, quorum sensing is mediated by a LuxIR-type system in which a LuxI-type enzyme produces a homoserine lactone AI molecule that is subsequently bound by a cognate cytoplasmic DNA-binding protein of the LuxR type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Miller and Bassler, 2001</xref>). However, these LuxR proteins are not related to <italic>V. harveyi-</italic>type LuxR proteins. Rather, <italic>V. harveyi</italic> LuxR is a member of the TetR protein superfamily: repressor proteins that share conserved N-terminal helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Jobling and Holmes, 1997</xref>). TetR-type proteins act as dimers and recognize DNA operator sequences possessing dyad symmetry. Usually, upon binding a cognate small-molecule ligand, TetR-type proteins release DNA, allowing RNA polymerase access to the target promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Ramos <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The classic example is TetR (e.g. in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>), which represses its own expression and that of <italic>tetA</italic>, the gene encoding the tetracycline exporter that confers resistance to the drug. When tetracycline enters the cell, it is bound by TetR, inducing a conformational change that inactivates TetR DNA binding capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hillen and Berens, 1994</xref>). QacR, CprB and EthR are also canonical TetR proteins that have been studied extensively and behave analogously to TetR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Ramos <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The TetR-type protein BetI, on the other hand, possesses the conserved helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix domain, but it binds to DNA both in the absence and presence of its ligand, choline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Rkenes <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the crystal structure of the TetR-type protein HapR from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> was solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">De Silva <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). HapR is 71% identical to <italic>V. harveyi</italic> LuxR, and HapR plays the same role in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> as LuxR does in <italic>V. harveyi</italic>, i.e. LuxR/HapR is the master regulator of the quorum-sensing response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Henke and Bassler, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Lenz <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The HapR structure suggests the presence of a ligand binding pocket; however, no small molecule has been identified that modulates HapR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">De Silva <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). We anticipate that LuxR/HapR represses transcription via a mechanism characteristic of other TetR-type proteins, by interfering directly with RNA polymerase. Alternatively, LuxR/HapR could repress transcription by obstructing DNA binding of ancillary activator proteins. HapR is known to function by this latter mechanism in at least one case, at the <italic>V. cholerae aphA</italic> promoter. Specifically, <italic>aphA</italic> transcription is activated by the combined action of the transcription factors Lrp and VpsR, both of which are antagonized by HapR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>V. harveyi</italic> LuxR protein is the founding member of a family of homologous proteins that exist in all Vibrio species. In every species examined, the LuxR-type protein controls a variety of behaviours. This facet sets the LuxR-type proteins apart from other TetR-type proteins, which generally control only their own transcription and that of an adjacent gene or operon (e.g. <italic>tetR/tetA</italic>). Another interesting feature of <italic>V. harveyi</italic> LuxR that makes it unlike other characterized TetR-type proteins is that while it clearly represses expression of some genes, LuxR also functions as an activator. For example, LuxR is a direct activator of the <italic>lux</italic> operon (encoding luciferase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Martin <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Showalter <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Miyamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>) and several other quorum-sensing target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Waters and Bassler, 2006</xref>). A few other TetR-type proteins have been suggested to activate gene expression; however, no mechanism has been described to explain this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alatoom <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chatterjee <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hirano <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). LuxR-directed activation of gene transcription could occur through direct recruitment of RNA polymerase or through DNA bending. LuxR could also interfere with other transcription factors, similar to the role HapR plays at the <italic>aphA</italic> promoter, but resulting in gene activation rather than repression.</p><p>Defining the mechanism of <italic>V. harveyi</italic> LuxR regulation is complicated by the fact that LuxR controls genes differentially with respect to the discrete AI inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). As mentioned, each AI encodes unique information regarding the relatedness of the vicinal population, and <italic>V. harveyi</italic> commonly exists at different cell population densities and in a variety of bacterial consortia, exposing it to different combinations of AIs. Accordingly, these different signal mixtures lead to different cytoplasmic concentrations of LuxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Tu and Bassler, 2007</xref>). LuxR availability, in turn, defines which promoters are bound and activated, or repressed, under a given condition. To date, we have identified three classes of LuxR-regulated target genes. Class I genes require the highest concentration of LuxR protein for regulation because their promoters have the lowest affinity for LuxR. Class II genes respond to intermediate concentrations of LuxR. Class III promoters have the highest affinity for LuxR and thus require the lowest level of LuxR for regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Waters and Bassler, 2006</xref>). In terms of temporal expression, Class III genes are activated/repressed first, followed by Class II, and then Class I genes. While our knowledge of the <italic>V. harveyi</italic> quorum-sensing regulon is incomplete, all of the directly LuxR-activated promoters that we have identified are Class I genes. In contrast, directly LuxR-repressed genes are members of all three classes. We presume that a particular promoter's affinity for LuxR is determined by the similarity of its binding site or sites to a consensus LuxR binding sequence and thus defines whether the promoter is Class I, II or III.</p><p>To investigate how LuxR directly regulates genes with differing affinities, and to examine how LuxR can act as both an activator and a repressor, we determined the LuxR DNA recognition sequence using protein binding microarrays (PBMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bulyk <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Berger <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The information garnered from the PBMs coupled with genomic sequence scanning and development and application of several bioinformatic algorithms allowed us to define the optimal LuxR binding site, as well as to identify potential LuxR binding sites upstream of putative conserved open reading frames (ORFs). To explore LuxR-DNA binding specificity, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutations in LuxR-binding DNA sequences and analysed the consequences both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. LuxR binds a 21 bp operator with dyad symmetry. The critical bases for binding in each half-site are independent of one another, leading to context-dependent DNA binding affinity and specificity. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we scanned the <italic>V. harveyi</italic> genome for putative LuxR binding sites and tested several of the candidate promoters for LuxR regulation. Indeed, the candidate genes are controlled by LuxR, confirming that our approach allows us to identify novel members of the <italic>V. harveyi</italic> quorum-sensing regulon. We now intend to use this strategy to identify the entire set of LuxR-regulated genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PBM</title><p>The LuxR protein was engineered with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag and purified. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), using a fragment of the <italic>aphA</italic> promoter known to bind LuxR, confirmed that our purified GST-LuxR specifically bound DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, using bioluminescence as the readout, we determined that the GST-LuxR complemented a <italic>V. harveyi luxR</italic> null mutant, showing that the engineered protein also functions <italic>in vivo</italic> (data not shown). To characterize LuxR's DNA binding specificity, universal PBMs containing approximately 44 000 double-stranded DNA sequences were designed to contain all possible 10-mer sequence variants. Importantly, all contiguous and gapped 8-mers, including all possible 4-gap-4 variants with gaps of up to 20 nucleotides, were covered 32 times each in the synthetic sequences used to construct these arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Berger <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The PBMs were incubated with GST-LuxR, and bound protein was subsequently detected with a fluorescently labelled anti-GST antibody. We used the program MultiFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Huber and Bulyk, 2006</xref>) to identify and align over-represented motifs in the 50 best LuxR-bound sequences on the PBM, according to normalized fluorescence intensity. The resulting position weight matrix (PWM) model of the binding site describes the preferred nucleotide at each position in a probabilistic manner. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>, MultiFinder identified a 21 bp binding site with dyad symmetry (arrows) flanking a 4 bp region of non-specific sequence. This site is similar to those defined for other TetR-type transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Ramos <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). To test the validity of the PBM results, we synthesized a 31 bp fluorescein-labelled double-stranded DNA fragment containing the putative 21 bp LuxR consensus binding sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>) and incubated it with LuxR. Binding was measured <italic>in vitro</italic> using fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Heyduk <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Head <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref> shows that following incubation of LuxR with a DNA fragment containing the consensus sequence (red circles), a significant increase in anisotropy occurred. By contrast, LuxR did not bind to a DNA fragment of the same size containing a random sequence (blue circles).

Potential 21 bp sites identified by the PWM were further evaluated using the SVM model, which takes into account the context of the entire site, and automatically allows for codependencies between different positions as well as for different weights for the individual positions. In practice, the higher the SVM score, the more a particular sequence resembles those sequences on the PBM that bound most tightly to GST-LuxR. The two-layered approach including the SVM is much more selective for actual binding sites than the PWM alone. When tested on the raw PBM data, the PWM alone was poor at recognizing true binding sites (those in sequences producing the highest fluorescence in the PBMs) at high confidence thresholds, and had a high false positive rate at low confidence thresholds. For example, at 95% confidence, the PWM recognized only 8% (7/88) of the bound sequences on the PBM, with a 0.002% (2/83 790) false positive rate. At 85% confidence, the PWM recognized 99% (87/88) of the bound sequences, but with a 2.5% (2053/83 790) false positive rate (the false positive rate is for returning a false positive 21 bp sequence anywhere within the 36 bp of variable sequence contained within each 60 bp probe on the PBM). By contrast, our two-layered PWM/SVM model performed much better on the PBM data. For example, one of our best performing PWM/SVM models recognized 99% of the bound sequences with a 0.05% false positive rate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>It is clear from the dyad symmetry of the LuxR consensus binding site that LuxR, like other TetR-type proteins, binds DNA as a dimer. In order to learn more about the mechanism of LuxR binding from the PBM data, we used the SVM layer of the bioinformatics algorithm to probe the mechanism of LuxR binding. Starting with the consensus binding site obtained by the PWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>), which is also the site with the highest score according to our SVM algorithm, we calculated SVM scores for all possible single base substitutions in the 21 bp sequence. The five most deleterious mutations were G5T, A6C, A8G, T15C and A17C, confirming the importance of the regions of dyad symmetry, while the five most benign mutations were T3C, T12A, A14G, A18G and A20T. To address whether it was possible to &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; a deleterious mutation with a compensatory mutation elsewhere in the sequence, we selected the most deleterious mutation at each position and then obtained SVM scores for every possible additional substitution in the singly mutated sequences. Selecting for the highest scoring double mutants only revealed the same five most benign mutations of the consensus sequence, and these only marginally increased the SVM scores of their singly mutated parent sequences. In other words, we found no specific suppressors of the most deleterious mutations. Thus, according to our SVM model, for sequences similar to the consensus sequence, each base pair contributes independently to the overall binding affinity of LuxR.</p></sec><sec><title>Predicting binding sites at known LuxR-regulated genes</title><p>To test our ability to identify LuxR binding sites, we used the above two-layered procedure to scan the DNA sequences upstream of target genes with well-characterized direct regulation by LuxR, as a proof-of-principle. We found putative binding sites present in known LuxR binding regions upstream of <italic>aphA, luxC</italic> and <italic>luxR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, red boxes). Notably, previous binding studies with LuxR upstream of <italic>luxC</italic> relied on footprinting and EMSA analyses and could only confine LuxR binding to a rather large region of promoter DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Miyamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). Our analysis pinpoints the exact LuxR binding sites within this region. We also scanned the sequences upstream of other genes in the quorum-sensing regulon that had not previously been analysed for LuxR control. We confirmed that LuxR binds upstream of the Class III gene <italic>qrgB,</italic> encoding a GGDEF domain-containing protein involved in cyclic di-GMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Waters and Bassler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Waters <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Surprisingly, we also identified putative LuxR binding sites upstream of the genes encoding the sRNAs <italic>qrr</italic>2, <italic>qrr</italic>3 and <italic>qrr</italic>4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, red box shows the site for <italic>qrr</italic>4), suggesting a role for LuxR in the regulation of quorum-sensing sRNA gene expression. To examine whether LuxR controls <italic>qrr</italic> expression, we introduced a <italic>qrr</italic>4&#x02013;<italic>gfp</italic> promoter fusion into <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying a chromosomal copy of a phosphomimetic LuxO variant, <italic>luxO</italic> D47E.

Indeed, LuxR enhances phospho-LuxO-dependent activation of <italic>qrr</italic>4 transcription (discussed further below), indicating that an internal feedback loop exists in the <italic>V. harveyi</italic> quorum-sensing circuit in which LuxR activates transcription of the <italic>qrr</italic> genes.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>LuxR binding sites upstream of quorum sensing-regulated genes.

We selected the promoters for <italic>qrr</italic>4 (activated) and <italic>qrgB (</italic>repressed) because each appeared to contain only a single LuxR binding site with strong similarity to the consensus binding sequence. We did not study the <italic>luxC</italic> and <italic>luxR</italic> promoters because both are Class I targets, suggesting that they have low affinity for LuxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Waters and Bassler, 2006</xref>), and both contain multiple LuxR binding sites, which would have complicated our analysis. We also did not further examine the <italic>aphA</italic> promoter because, as mentioned, HapR binding to that promoter has already been well characterized and other factors are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kovacikova and Skorupski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2007</xref>). We note that in some <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates there exists a naturally occurring mutation (G-77T) that abolishes HapR regulation of <italic>aphA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). This transversion corresponds to position 5 of our consensus site, which is a G in 96% (77% if reverse complements are taken into account) of the bound sequences on the PBMs, indicating that a G in this position is critical for both HapR and LuxR binding.</p><p>To confirm that the <italic>qrr</italic>4 and <italic>qrgB</italic> promoters each contain only a single LuxR binding site, we performed EMSA with DNA fragments containing the 500 bp upstream of each transcription start site. As a control, we show that there was no shift of a DNA fragment containing an upstream region of the <italic>aphA</italic> promoter that is known not to be bound by LuxR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Svenningsen <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). By contrast, the upstream region of <italic>aphA</italic> containing the reported LuxR binding was shifted by LuxR. This region is known to bind a single dimer of LuxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). LuxR incubation with the <italic>qrgB</italic> and <italic>qrr</italic>4 fragments resulted in shifts identical to that produced by LuxR binding at the <italic>aphA</italic> fragment, confirming that LuxR binds to one site in these regions. In the right-most panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>, by way of comparison, we show that LuxR super-shifts the <italic>luxC</italic> promoter fragment that is predicted to contain multiple binding sites.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>LuxR binds one site within the <italic>qrgB</italic> and <italic>qrr</italic>4 promoters.

All possible single-nucleotide substitutions were made at each of the 21 positions in the <italic>qrgB</italic> and <italic>qrr</italic>4 LuxR binding sites, and the resulting sequences scored for the likelihood of LuxR binding using our SVM model, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref> (<italic>qrgB</italic>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref> (<italic>qrr</italic>4). In these panels, bars with lower heights (i.e. lower SVM scores) indicate sites where base changes are predicted to have the most deleterious effects on LuxR binding. In the case of LuxR binding at <italic>qrgB</italic>, we found the most deleterious alterations to be at positions 2, 6, 15 and 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>) (for comparison, recall that the most deleterious mutations in the consensus sequence are at positions 5, 6, 8, 15 and 17, indicating that as the sequences diverge sufficiently far from the consensus sequence, some context dependence arises for the contribution of each site to LuxR binding). To test the <italic>qrgB</italic> predictions, we engineered the A2C, A2T, A6C, T15C, A17C, A17T and A17G mutations into the <italic>qrgB</italic> promoter&#x02013;<italic>gfp</italic> fusion construct and measured repression by LuxR in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>). The wild-type <italic>qrgB</italic> promoter is repressed fivefold by LuxR. The A2C mutation reduced repression by LuxR to 1.6-fold, and all of the other mutations completely abolished LuxR-dependent repression. We also engineered sites containing combinations of the above mutations into the <italic>qrgB&#x02013;gfp</italic> reporter construct. As expected, LuxR did not repress any of the double-mutant constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>).

All of the sequences were tested in the context of 33 bp 5&#x02032;fluorescein-labelled DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5C</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the consequences of each mutation on the apparent LuxR binding affinity. In brief, LuxR bound to the wild-type <italic>qrgB</italic> sequence as avidly as it bound to the consensus fragment (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 27 &#x000b1; 3 nM). The construct containing the A2C mutation, which caused the most modest effect on repression <italic>in vivo</italic>, had the same dissociation constant for LuxR as the wild-type <italic>qrgB</italic> sequence did. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was nearly double for the A6C and A17C sequences, and the binding constant for LuxR to the doubly mutated A2C A17C fragment was an order of magnitude higher than for the wild-type sequence.</p><p>Regarding LuxR binding at the <italic>qrr</italic>4 promoter, our computational analysis revealed a significantly higher overall SVM score for the LuxR binding site in the <italic>qrr</italic>4 promoter than for the <italic>qrgB</italic> promoter. Therefore, single-base mutations are predicted to have less drastic consequences at <italic>qrr</italic>4. Indeed, the SVM scores of the singly substituted <italic>qrr</italic>4 binding sites were all potentially consistent with continued LuxR binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>). Nonetheless, we engineered single mutations into the <italic>qrr</italic>4 promoter&#x02013;<italic>gfp</italic> fusion construct (A6C, T7C, T15C and A17C) at positions predicted to be the most important for LuxR binding. We also constructed combinations of pairs of these mutations. We introduced these fusions into the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain harbouring <italic>luxO</italic> D47E. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref> shows that the wild-type <italic>qrr</italic>4 promoter is activated threefold by LuxR. Two single mutations, A6C and T15C, prevent LuxR activation as do double mutants containing these altered bases (A6C T15C and A6C A17C). The A17C single mutation retains wild-type LuxR activation, and the T7C mutation unexpectedly increases LuxR activation to 12-fold. Accordingly, all doubly mutated constructs that include the T7C transition remain activated by LuxR. Finally, the T15C A17C double mutant also remains capable of LuxR activation, presumably due to the contribution of the A17C change. Similar to our analysis of the <italic>qrgB</italic> promoter, we engineered a mutation at a central position of the <italic>qrr</italic>4 promoter, G12C, which was not predicted to be important for LuxR binding. As expected, LuxR continued to activate expression of this construct to wild-type levels.</p><p>Interestingly, according to our SVM model, single nucleotide substitutions at position 2 in the <italic>qrr</italic>4 LuxR binding site should have no consequence for LuxR regulation, despite the critical role of this nucleotide for LuxR binding at the <italic>qrgB</italic> promoter. To test this prediction, we made the T2C and T2A substitutions in the <italic>qrr</italic>4 binding site and analysed their regulation by LuxR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). Neither of these mutations affected LuxR activation at the <italic>qrr</italic>4 promoter. From these data, we conclude that although LuxR clearly exhibits sequence specificity, the sequence requirements depend on the context of the complete binding site.</p><p>Using fluorescence anisotropy, we determined the affinity of LuxR <italic>in vitro</italic> for the wild-type <italic>qrr</italic>4 binding site, and the A6C, T15C, A17C and double A6C A17C-mutated sites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref> and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, LuxR bound the wild-type sequence with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 35 &#x000b1; 4 nM. Mutating T15C or A17C had little or no effect on the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, with LuxR binding slightly better to the T15C fragment. The A6C mutation increased the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> twofold, and the double A6C A17C mutant sequence had a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 112 &#x000b1; 27 nM, roughly fourfold that of the wild-type sequence.

Quorum sensing is intensively studied in <italic>V. harveyi</italic> because the quorum-sensing network is viewed as a paradigm for understanding how sensory information is integrated, processed and transduced to control gene expression. Nonetheless, despite numerous screens, the complete <italic>V. harveyi</italic> quorum-sensing regulon is not known; in particular, we surmised that additional targets directly regulated by LuxR existed and remained to be identified. To discover these targets, we performed a PBM study to characterize the DNA binding specificity of LuxR. The resulting quantitative <italic>in vitro</italic> binding results allowed us to train a two-layered bioinformatics algorithm capable of identifying LuxR binding sites upstream of genes known to be directly regulated by LuxR, and capable of scanning the <italic>V. harveyi</italic> genome for additional, previously unknown LuxR binding sites. Five novel genomic LuxR binding sites were identified using this test strategy, and LuxR binding to them was confirmed with <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. This analysis puts us in the position to now identify all the genes in the regulon. While our model successfully predicts binding by LuxR, it does not make any predictions about promoter strength or whether other factors are required for transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. We suspect that <italic>in vivo</italic>, quorum-sensing information is integrated with other sensory cues for precise control of gene expression.</p><p><italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> LuxR is the founding member of a family of homologous proteins (e.g. OpaR, SmcR, VanT, HapR and LitR) in different Vibrio species. While analogous quorum-sensing pathways feed information to LuxR and its homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), the downstream regulon in each species diverges, allowing each communication circuit to carry out unique species-specific biology. The LuxR-type regulons are typically large, containing &#x0223c;100+ genes. The complexity and plasticity of these Vibrio quorum-sensing regulons requires a means to identify targets of LuxR-type proteins on a genome-wide scale. In the present work, we have demonstrated that a combination of PBM studies and bioinformatics provides a practical way to identify LuxR binding sites. PBM studies are particularly valuable for transcription factors, like LuxR, whose verified direct targets are too few in number to usefully train an algorithm to search for new binding sites. Furthermore, an important advantage of PBM studies is that they provide both a large number of positive examples of binding sites, and a large number of similar but negative examples. These two types of examples allow accurate discrimination of true binding sites from similar but non-binding sites, even for proteins such as LuxR with context-dependent binding specificities. Indeed, without the large number of both positive and negative examples provided by the PBM to train the final SVM layer of our bioinformatics algorithm, it would have been impossible to reduce the number of genome-wide false positives to a level practical for experimental verification. We note that an alternative hidden markov model has been successfully employed to identify binding sites of SmcR, the <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic> LuxR homologue. The hidden markov model was trained on 18 experimentally defined binding sites and used in a genome-wide search to identify new SmcR-regulated targets. Ten targets were experimentally verified to be regulated by SmcR. The 22 bp SmcR consensus sequence is similar to the 21 bp LuxR consensus sequence we find here. The SmcR and LuxR consensus sequences diverge in the outermost bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this and previous studies we and others have identified several genes for which LuxR functions directly as an activator. The majority of characterized TetR-type proteins are only known to act as repressors. This raises the question of whether some specific selection has driven LuxR to evolve a positive regulatory role. Typically, expression of genes under the control of a TetR-type repressor is activated when the TetR-type repressor binds a small-molecule ligand and releases the DNA. It seems possible that an ancestral LuxR originally carried out quorum sensing in this mode, de-repressing genes in response to binding of a small AI molecule that could enter the cytoplasm. In fact, AI binding by cognate cytoplasmic transcription factors is a common mode of operation in other quorum-sensing systems, such as those of <italic>V. fischeri</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> and <italic>Chromobacter violaceum</italic>. In contrast, the <italic>V. harveyi</italic>-type LuxR and its homologues in other Vibrio species are regulated indirectly by extracellular AIs. To maintain the regulatory logic that high AI concentration leads to de-repression (activation) of genes, LuxR, in addition to being capable of repression, would have been required to add a positive regulatory function. It will be interesting to determine if an evolutionary intermediate can be found in which a <italic>V. harveyi</italic>-type LuxR homologue continues to function by direct binding of a small-molecule AI.</p><p>Our discovery of LuxR binding sites upstream of the sRNAs <italic>qrr</italic>2&#x02013;4, along with experimental verification that LuxR directly positively regulates <italic>qrr</italic>4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) as well as <italic>qrr</italic>2 and <italic>qrr</italic>3 (not shown), implies that LuxR's ability to function as an activator has been exploited for its own autoregulation. In <italic>V. harveyi</italic>, the <italic>qrr</italic> sRNAs negatively regulate LuxR by binding to and preventing translation of the LuxR message. The activation of transcription of these same quorum-sensing sRNAs by LuxR is suggested to accelerate the internal transition of cells from high- to low-cell-density modes, a potentially rapid event in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Svenningsen <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Later, after the transition from high- to low-cell-density mode is complete, a more modest rate of sRNA production is likely sufficient to repress quorum sensing. If so, direct activation of the <italic>qrr</italic> genes by LuxR implies that transcription of the <italic>qrr</italic> genes is scaled back precisely when LuxR levels fall and high transcription rates of the <italic>qrr</italic> genes are no longer required.</p><p>It remains an open question why quorum-sensing regulation of LuxR is achieved by sRNAs rather than at the level of transcription. A potential advantage of sRNA-based regulation is that LuxR mRNA lifetime is decreased, reducing the number of proteins translated per message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Levine <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). This mechanism prevents protein bursts, which in bacteria can amount to &#x0223c;100 translated proteins per message, even for nominally repressed genes. Our measurement of LuxR dissociation constants in the range of 30 nM via fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) supports this interpretation. Within the typical cytoplasmic volume of a <italic>V. harveyi</italic> cell (&#x02248;1.6 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>), 30 nM corresponds to &#x0223c;30 proteins. Therefore, if LuxR were only transcriptionally regulated, even a single mistimed message produced at low cell density could inappropriately trigger a downstream signalling cascade, with a potentially large cost to fitness.</p><p>In the future, we intend to exploit the combined PBM-bioinformatics approach reported here to expand the recognized quorum-sensing regulons of <italic>V. harveyi</italic> and other Vibrio species. Appreciation of these full regulons will help us understand individual versus group behaviours as well as the individual ecologies and survival strategies of these species, including the human pathogen <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and conditions</title><p><italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> strain KM669 (<italic>luxR</italic>) was derived from wild-type BB120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bassler <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> strain S17-1 &#x003bb;<italic>pir</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">de Lorenzo and Timmis, 1994</xref>) was used for conjugation, cloning and <italic>gfp</italic> expression experiments. <italic>E. coli</italic> strain KT1190 (<italic>luxO</italic> D47E) was derived from S17-&#x003bb;<italic>pir</italic>.

Microarrays were synthesized by Agilent Technologies in the &#x02018;4 &#x000d7; 44K&#x02019; format. GST-LuxR was diluted to a final concentration of 500 nM in separate 175 &#x003bc;l protein binding reaction mixtures, which were applied to the individual chambers of a four-chamber gasket coverslip. GST-LuxR was applied to two of the four chambers on both of our two separate PBM designs. Protein-bound arrays were labelled with Alexa488-conjugated anti-GST antibody (Sigma). Microarrays were scanned (GSI Lumonics ScanArray 5000) at multiple laser power settings, and raw image files were quantified using GenePix Pro version 6.0 software (Molecular Devices). Protein binding signal was normalized according to the observed relative amounts of double-stranded DNA and adjusted for spatial non-uniformities.</p><p>Microarray signal intensities were averaged for identical probes in separate chambers of the same slide. For each of the 8-mer patterns covered in our universal PBM, we were able to score the relative preference of LuxR for all sequence variants by calculating the median signal intensity over all probes containing a match to the 8-mer. We further calculated an enrichment score for each 8-mer, which could be combined across both array designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Berger <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We attempted to derive a PWM to represent the LuxR binding specificity by using the highest-scoring 8-mer as a seed, as has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Berger <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>); however, we found the motif too long to be adequately initialized by eight informative positions. Therefore, we used more conventional motif finding approaches to identify sequence motifs that were overrepresented among the brightest probes on each microarray. We used MultiFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Huber and Bulyk, 2006</xref>) to identify motifs specific to the 50 brightest probes on each array design. We generated a single LuxR motif by pooling the 50 brightest probes from each array (100 sequences total) and choosing the motif exhibiting the most significant group specificity score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hughes <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>EMSA</title><p>The 500 bp double-stranded DNA probes were amplified from <italic>V. harveyi</italic> genomic DNA with 5&#x02032;fluorescein-labelled primers, and the probes were gel-purified using the Zymoclean gel DNA recovery kit (Zymo Research).
