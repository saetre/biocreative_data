This syndrome is characterized by the 'aspirin triad' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] syndrome of aspirin hypersensitivity, bronchial asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. A two-compartment model has been proposed in which both the augmentation of cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) production and the overexpression of the CysLT receptor on inflammatory cells occur within the respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The overproduction of CysLTs has been demonstrated in the airways and circulation of asthmatics who are intolerant to aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. CysLTs are important inflammatory mediators in the development of asthma, as they mediate bronchoconstriction while increasing mucus secretion, vascular permeability and cellular infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. CysLTs exert their biological actions by binding two types of G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors: cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1; MIM 300201), which is sensitive to the asthma drugs montelukast, zafirlukast and pranlukast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and CysLTR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. CysLTR2 has been documented to be expressed in lung interstitial macrophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], B and T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], raising the possibility that CysLTR2 may have an important role in allergic inflammation. Particularly, CysLTR2 may have important role in remodeling and fibrosis pathways in B lymphocytes. Furthermore, CysLTR2 is located on chromosome13q14.2-21.1, near a locus known to be associated with the risk of asthma in various population. CysLTR2 play a disease-regulating role in glands and epithelium of rhinosinusitis, particularly aspirin-sensitive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, Cysteinyl-LT signaling may provide a key balance between a release of endothelium-dependent relaxant and constricting factors in endothelium dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The endothelial CysLTR2 is rapidly down-regulated by pro-inflammatory stimuli in Myocardial Ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A role for CysLTR2 is mediated the coronary constriction in patients with coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. CysLTR2 may also contribute to neurological inflammation in the human brain and the adrenal glands of neuroendocrine system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We previously identified four sequence variants of the <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>gene: one in the promoter (<italic>c</italic>.-<italic>819G&#x0003e;T, rs7324991</italic>), two in the 3'-flanking region (<italic>c.2078C&#x0003e;T </italic>and <italic>c.2534A&#x0003e;G, novel and rs912278</italic>), and one downstream of the gene (<italic>c.2545+297A&#x0003e;G, rs2407249</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We also revealed that asthmatics having rare alleles for <italic>c</italic>.-<italic>819G&#x0003e;T</italic>, <italic>c.2078C&#x0003e;T </italic>or <italic>c.2534A&#x0003e;G </italic>exhibited a more pronounced drop in FEV<sub>1 </sub>by aspirin provocation than those who carried the common alleles (<italic>P </italic>= 0.03-0.009). In previously study, five haplotypes (GCAA, TTGA, TCGG, TCAA and others) were constructed. The frequencies of these five haplotypes in the Korean population (N = 642), African-American (N = 50) and Caucasian (N = 50) were: 0.495, 0.14, 0.44 (<italic>ht1</italic>), 0.346, 0.02, 0.23 (<italic>ht</italic>2), 0.083, 0.17, 0.23 (<italic>ht3</italic>), 0.07, 0.6, 0.09 (<italic>ht4</italic>) and 0.006, 0.07, 0.01 (<italic>others</italic>) in Korean, African-American and Caucasian, respectively. Significant differences in the frequencies of the SNPs and haplotypes were observed among the three ethnic groups. The linkage disequilibrium coefficients (|D'|) and <italic>r</italic><sup>2 </sup>among the SNPs were calculated for all of the study subjects. Strong LDs were noted between SNPs (|D'| &#x0003e; 0.97) in Korean. Complete LDs were observed between SNPs (c.-819 G&#x0003e;T, c.2078 C&#x0003e;T and c.2534 A&#x0003e;G) in Caucasian (|D'| &#x0003e; 0.90). In African-American, between SNPs (c.2534 A&#x0003e;G and c.2545+297A&#x0003e;G) were observed complete LDs (|D'| &#x0003e; 0.92) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Subjects with the ht2 haplotype, which is composed of the rare alleles for the three SNPs (<italic>TTG</italic>), were susceptible to aspirin intolerance. These results suggest that sequence variants on the promoter (<italic>c</italic>.-<italic>819G&#x0003e;T</italic>) of <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>may affect the efficiency of its transcription with tight linkage to 3'-UTR variations or that the SNPs themselves on 3'-UTR may affect the stability of its mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The functional effects of these SNPs on transcription should be identified. Here, we investigated the genetic effect of the promoter and the 3'-UTR polymorphisms of CysLTR2 at the transcriptional and translational levels of the gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Flow cytometric analysis of CysLTR2 expression between haplotypes 1 and 2</title><p>To investigate the effect of the SNPs on the production of CysLTR2 protein in the B cell lines, we measured CysLTR2 protein levels on the surface of B cell lines for ht1 homozygotes (<italic>ht1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, N = 8) and ht2 homozygotes (<italic>ht2</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, N = 9) using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometric analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

We previously identified three novel SNPs in the promoter and 3'-untranslated region of CysLTR2. Three SNPs (<italic>c</italic>.-<italic>819G&#x0003e;T</italic>, <italic>c.2078C&#x0003e;T</italic>, and <italic>c.2534A&#x0003e;G</italic>) and <italic>ht1 </italic>[<italic>G</italic>-<italic>C</italic>-<italic>A</italic>-<italic>A</italic>], <italic>ht2 </italic>[<italic>T</italic>-<italic>T</italic>-<italic>G</italic>-<italic>A</italic>] were strongly associated with the drop in FEV<sub>1 </sub>induced by aspirin challenge in asthmatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To identify the functional effects of these SNPs on transcription and translation of the <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>gene, we first measured the protein expression of the <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>gene. CysLTR2 is known to be expressed by lung interstitial macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These cells are difficult to obtain and maintain from our asthmatics subjects, so we used immortalized B cells induced by EB virus from subjects whose genotypes had been analyzed in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We demonstrated that the B cell lines having <italic>ht2</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>had a higher translational and transcriptional expression levels of CysLTR2 than those having <italic>ht1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, especially when stimulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that the greater response to aspirin challenge in asthmatics may be due to higher expression of CysLTR2 protein on the B cells and presumably on the other <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>gene-expressing cells, such as lung interstitial macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Next, we assessed the regulating mechanisms of the three SNPs (<italic>c</italic>.-<italic>819G&#x0003e;T</italic>, <italic>c.2078C&#x0003e;T </italic>and <italic>c.2534A&#x0003e;G</italic>) on CysLTR2 protein expression using promoter activity assays and 3'-UTR function analysis because the sequence variants on the promoter (<italic>c</italic>.-<italic>819G&#x0003e;T</italic>) of the <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>gene may affect the efficiency of its transcription and the SNPs on the 3'-UTR may affect the stability of its mRNA. Luciferase activity of the <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>promoter was higher in the <italic>T </italic>type transfected 293T cells than in the <italic>G </italic>type, which indicates that the sequence variants on the promoter are regulators for <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The genetic role of the promoter (<italic>c</italic>.-<italic>819G&#x0003e;T</italic>) was demonstrated by the nuclear protein binding assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The binding affinity of this DNA-binding factor was higher for <italic>c</italic>.-<italic>819T than for c</italic>.-<italic>819G </italic>with or without PMA/ionophore stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Moreover, PMA/ionophore-stimulated signaling may cause an increase in this binding factor on the promoter, which would induce greater <italic>CysLTR2 gene expression.

We performed a </italic>supershift assay for the candidate factors: SRY and HFH-2. Neither SRY nor FoxD3 (human homolog of HFH2) antibodies showed supershifts in EMSA.

The expression level of fluorescence containing the <italic>c.2078T </italic>type was significantly higher than that of <italic>c.2078C </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This indicates that mRNA degradation of the T type of <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>3'-UTR was much slower than that of the C type. Based on the results of our promoter and 3'-UTR functional study, the sequence variance of the two loci may influence <italic>CysLTR2 gene expression </italic>cooperatively. To validate the results of our promoter and 3'-UTR functional study, we performed the additional experiment using the vectors containing both promoter and 3'-UTR regions of CysLTR2. <italic>Ht1 </italic>(c. -819 G and c. 2078 C) and <italic>Ht2 </italic>(c. -819 T and c. 2078 T) were inserted into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter system, respectively.

These results indicate that the combined genetic differences affect the amount of protein and mRNA expression in CysLTR2 gene. In contrast to the extensive studies on the functions of the CysLT<sub>1 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the functional characterization of the CysLT<sub>2 </sub>receptor has been limited because of a lack of specific competitive antagonists. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated unanticipated functions for the cysLTs, acting nonredundantly through CysLTR2. CysLTR2, but not CystLTR1, is the receptor responsible for mediating the contribution of the CysLTs to experimental bleomycin-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and for the production of IL-8 by IL-4-primed cultured human mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, the impact of the receptor has not been revealed in chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma. In particular, any <italic>in vivo </italic>role for the CysLTR2 receptor remains unknown. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to clearly demonstrate the genetic relationship between the CysLTR2 receptor nucleotide polymorphism and aspirin hypersensitivity in asthmatics at the level of gene function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The sequence variants on the promoter and on the 3'-UTR of <italic>CysLTR2 </italic>affect the efficiency of its transcription and the stability of its mRNA, resulting in the alteration of protein expression of CysLTR2.

For the supershift assay, 200 &#x003bc;g of goat anti-human SRY Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or goat anti-human FoxD3 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with the nuclear extract for 30 min before the addition of the labeled probe.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM). The program SPSS (version 10.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all analyses. Differences between independent groups and samples were compared using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis <italic>H</italic>-test for continuous data. If significant differences were found, a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was applied to compare differences between two samples. Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test was used for two related samples.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AIA: Aspirin-intolerant asthma; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; CysLT: cysteinyl leukotriene; CysLTR: cysteinyl leukotriene receptor; FEV<sub>1</sub>: Forced expiratory volume in one second; SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism; LD: Linkage disequilibrium; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; EBV: Epstein-Barr virus; EGFP: Enhanced green fluorescent protein; EMSA: Electrophoretic mobility shift assays; SEM: Standard error of the mean.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JAS performed all the experimental steps, HSC provided experimental assistance, SMP drafted the manuscript, CSP provided analytic support and supervised the project.
