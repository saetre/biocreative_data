In the former mechanism the ribosome is directly recruited to a site within the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of the RNA and can initiate translation at the next downstream AUG codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c4">4</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA element responsible for this internal ribosome binding is referred to as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). IRES-mediated translation was first discovered in the naturally uncapped picornavirus RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c6">6</xref>), and later extended to some other viruses like the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c7">7</xref>) and a number of cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is an important human pathogen and has been implicated as the leading cause of virus induced myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c9">9</xref>). Myo carditis induced by CVB3 in humans is a biphasic disease in that an initial acute response occurs away from the heart (mainly in the pancreas), and later a more chronic disease spreads to the heart due to an autoimmune response against cardiac proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c11">11</xref>). The 741 nt 5&#x02032;-UTR of the CVB3 RNA is highly structured and contains eight AUG codons upstream of the initiator AUG. The 5&#x02032;-UTR contains an IRES that directs internal initiation of translation of the coding region of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c12">12</xref>).</p><p>Ribosome binding to the IRES is mediated by an unknown number of proteins, the majority of these being cellular cytoplasmic proteins, as the infecting viral RNA is translated prior to the production of any viral proteins. It is generally believed that internal initiation by picornavirus IRESs requires most of the canonical eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c14">14</xref>). However, as many picornaviruses (e.g. Poliovirus and Coxsackievirus) induce the cleavage of the eIF4G component of the tri-molecular eIF4F cap-binding complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c15">15</xref>), it is clear that the requirement of IRES-mediated translation for initiation factors is distinct from that of general cap-dependent protein synthesis. In addition to the canonical initiation factors, picornavirus IRES elements need additional <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors for efficient translation initiation. The proteins that have been found to interact with IRES elements and stimulate translation are the human La autoantigen (La), polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c17">17</xref>), poly (rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c18">18</xref>), unr and unrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c19">19</xref>).</p><p>The La protein was originally identified as an autoantigen that was recognized by sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj&#x000f6;gren syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c20">20</xref>). It is predominantly localized within the nucleus and functions in the maturation of RNA polymerase III transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c22">22</xref>) and the unwinding of double-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c23">23</xref>). It is present as 52 or 45 kDa isoforms in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c24">24</xref>). La antigen binds to a variety of RNA structures via its RNA binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c25">25</xref>). The viral targets of the La protein binding include the 5&#x02032;-UTR of some picornaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c26">26</xref>), HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c27">27</xref>), influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c28">28</xref>), sindbis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c29">29</xref>) and the HIV TAR element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c30">30</xref>). In the case of poliovirus, the La protein plays a functional role in internal initiation of translation where addition of purified La to rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) inhibits the accumulation of aberrant translation products in <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assays and also causes a modest stimulation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c32">32</xref>). La protein has also been demonstrated to stimulate translation directed by the IRES elements of Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c33">33</xref>) and HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c34">34</xref>). Sequestration of La protein by a small yeast RNA (I-RNA) has been shown to inhibit poliovirus and HCV IRES mediated translation, which could be rescued by exogenous addition of purified La protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c38">38</xref>). A similar inhibition of HCV IRES-directed translation in HeLa lysates has been demonstrated by sequestering La using a SELEX RNA specific for La (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c34">34</xref>).</p><p>The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of La protein in CVB3 IRES-mediated translation. We show that human La protein binds to the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR and demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of exogenously added recombinant La in stimulating CVB3 IRES-mediated translation <italic>in vitro</italic>. A 60 nt yeast RNA (I-RNA) which has been shown to bind to La protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c37">37</xref>) was used to sequester La in <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assays to inhibit CVB3 IRES-mediated translation which could be rescued by exogenous addition of La protein. In order to investigate the activity of La from a cellular source, abundance of La in various target tissues was probed using La antibodies. The highest abundance of La protein was found in the pancreas, a primary target organ of CVB3. Therefore, exogenous addition of pancreatic extract to <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions was carried out to explore its ability to stimulate CVB3 IRES mediated translation. These results constitute the first report of the role of La in Coxsackievirus B3 IRES-mediated translation and suggest the possibility of its involvement in the efficient translation of the viral RNA in the pancreas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The 5&#x02032;-UTR of CVB3 was amplified by PCR from the CVB3 full-length infectious cDNA (a generous gift from Prof. Nora Chapman, UNMC) using 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; primers containing <italic>Hin</italic>dIII and <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites, respectively, and cloned into the corresponding sites of vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen).

In order to determine the binding of cellular proteins to the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR, UV-crosslinking assay using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled CVB full-length 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA was performed with 9 &#x000b5;g HeLa S10 cellular extract. The CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR showed strong interaction with a number of cellular proteins from HeLa cytoplasmic extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f1">1</xref>A, lane 2) including a protein corresponding to &#x0223c;52 kDa. This band may be that of the La antigen, which is known to be abundant in HeLa cells. UV crosslinking between full-length CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA and purified, recombinant His-tagged La protein demonstrated a strong interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f1">1</xref>A, lane 3). To further confirm the specific interaction of La protein from HeLa cells with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR, immunoprecipitation of the nucleo&#x02013;protein complexes formed after UV crosslinking was performed using anti-La polyclonal antibodies.

The imunoprecipitated complex between CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA and the His-tagged La protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f1">1</xref>B, lane 3) showed slightly higher migration than the endogenous La as also seen in the UV-crosslinking experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f1">1</xref>A, lane 3). However, no bands were observed upon immunoprecipitation using rabbit pre-immune serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f1">1</xref>B, lane 2).

The supplementation of the reaction medium with HeLa cytoplasmic extract was necessitated by the very low basal levels of translation directed by the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR in RRL which is enhanced by addition of HeLa extract. It was observed that the translation of GFP directed by the CVB3 IRES was drastically reduced by the addition of I-RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f3">3</xref>C, lane 2). In order to examine the ability of La protein to rescue the I-RNA-mediated inhibition of translation, increasing concentrations (200 and 400 ng) of recombinant La protein were added to the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions in presence of the same quantities of I-RNA. It was observed that the CVB3 IRES-mediated translation was restored by La protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f3">3</xref>C, lanes 3 and 4) to the original level. The data suggest that inhibition of CVB3 IRES-mediated translation by I-RNA was primarily due to the sequestration of La protein and La is necessary for CVB3 IRES-mediated translation. Moreover, addition of La protein is sufficient to rescue the I-RNA-mediated inhibition of the CVB3 IRES-directed translation in RRL.</p></sec><sec><title>La protein is present at variable levels in different tissues</title><p>La is a cellular autoantigen that has been shown to be present in different tissues predominantly as 52 or 45 kDa isoforms. La antigen-encoding mRNA transcripts also exhibit a tissue-specific expression pattern, with a 1.9 kb transcript being ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and a 2.3 kb transcript which is expressed at high levels in spleen, PBL, brain, kidney and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c39">39</xref>). Although the extent of difference between the protein products of these transcripts is not known, it has been suggested that the 1.9 kb transcript is predominantly translated by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism while the 2.3 kb transcript undergoes internal initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c39">39</xref>). In order to detect the presence and relative abundance of La protein in various mouse tissues, western blotting of equal quantities of total cytoplasmic protein from these tissues was performed using polyclonal anti-La antibodies. Mouse tissue cytoplasmic extracts were used for the experiment because the course of CVB3 infection in the murine disease model is same as that in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c10">10</xref>). The immunoblot showed that the relative abundance of the La protein, corresponding to a band of &#x0223c;45 kDa, was highest in pancreas, followed by spleen, kidney and brain tissue extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f4">4</xref>). A corresponding faint band was detectable in the heart extract but was undetected in liver. A replica blot was also probed with anti-&#x003b2; actin antibody as internal control. These observations suggest that the abundance of the La protein is different in the different tissues tested and is relatively high in the pancreas.</p></sec><sec><title>CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR specifically interacts with La protein from the mouse pancreas</title><p>CVB3, like other enteroviruses, first enters through the small intestine and then infects adjacent organs, mainly the pancreas, and later spreads to other sites like the heart. The pancreas serves as the viral reservoir. The efficient propagation of CVB3 in the pancreas may be due to the presence of tissue-specific factors, like the La protein, which enhances virus translation&#x0002f;replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. As the La protein was found to be abundant in the pancreatic tissue, we investigated the ability of the cellular La protein to interact with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA by UV crosslinking assay followed by immunoprecipitation.</p><p>The UV crosslinking showed a number of proteins from the pancreas cytoplasmic extract binding to the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR. A prominent RNA&#x02013;protein complex, corresponding to &#x0223c;45 kDa was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f5">5</xref>A, lane 2). The other protein&#x02013;nucleotidyl complexes may correspond to various <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors including PTB (p57&#x0002f;p60) and PCBP2 (39 kDa), which may also interact with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR.</p><p>To confirm the interaction of the cellular La protein with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR, the UV-crosslinked CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA&#x02013; protein complex from pancreas was immunoprecipitated using anti-La antibodies. A complex of CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA and La was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f5">5</xref>B, lane 2) upon UV crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-La antibodies but not with pre-immune rabbit serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f5">5</xref>B, lane 1). However, immunoprecipitation of CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA&#x02013;protein complexes from liver extract of mouse, using anti-La antibodies, did not show any specific band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f5">5</xref>D, lane 2). These results were consistent with the observation in the western blot and suggest a specific interaction between the CVB3 IRES and La protein from mouse pancreas. Similar La protein&#x02013;nucleotidyl complexes were observed upon immunoprecipitation of spleen and brain tissue extracts after UV crosslinking with CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of exogenous addition of mouse pancreas cytoplasmic extract on CVB3 IRES-mediated translation</title><p>The pancreas serves as the primary site of infection by CVB3 and is also a major target organ for CVB3-mediated pathogenesis. As we found that the La protein was required for translation directed by the CVB3 IRES, and the abundance of La was greatest in the pancreatic tissue, we wanted to examine the ability of pancreatic tissue extract to stimulate the translation directed by the CVB3 IRES. Therefore, <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions in RRL using CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR&#x02013;GFP RNA as the template were supplemented by S10 extracts of the pancreas of Balb&#x0002f;c mice at two increasing concentrations. The results showed that addition of pancreas extract stimulated the translation of the reporter gene GFP in a concentration-dependent manner above the basal level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f6">6</xref>A). The higher concentration of the tissue extract was also added to translation reactions having capped-GFP RNA as the template. However, addition of the pancreatic extract did not exhibit an enhancement of cap-dependent translation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f6">6</xref>A, right), rather a slight reduction in the translation efficiency was observed. These observations suggest that the efficiency of the CVB3 IRES-mediated translation in pancreatic tissue is high and this may be correlated to the high concentration of La protein in the tissue.</p><p>In order to determine whether the stimulation in translation observed upon addition of pancreas extract could be abrogated by sequestering the La protein, 20- and 40-fold excess of I-RNA was added to the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions supplemented with pancreas cytoplasmic extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f6">6</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;6). A significant dose-dependent reduction in the translation efficiency was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f6">6</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that I-RNA can inhibit the translation mediated by the CVB3 IRES in presence of pancreas extract. Furthermore, to investigate whether the I-RNA mediated inhibition was due to the sequestration of the La protein from pancreas extract, 600 ng of recombinant La protein was added to the translation reaction supplemented with pancreas extract in presence of 40-fold excess of I-RNA. It was observed that the addition of La protein could restore the translation efficiency to original levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf583f6">6</xref>B, lane 6). Taken together, these observations suggest that La protein is required for CVB3 IRES-mediated translation and may be an important <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor present in the pancreas, which enhances the efficiency of Coxsackievirus IRES-mediated translation in the organ.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that internal initiation of translation by picornaviruses and cellular mRNAs is a phenomenon mediated by specific interactions between <italic>cis</italic>-elements on the RNA (the IRES) and various <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. These factors required for internal initiation are thought to be proteins from the host cell cytoplasm. However, the functional role of these proteins in IRES-mediated translation is not known although a function as RNA chaperones has been proposed. Studies on these IRES-interacting cellular proteins hold the promise of explaining the differential translation efficiency of the viral RNA in different tissues. It has been seen that in transient expression assays, the efficiency of different IRES elements varies greatly in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c41">41</xref>). Hence, the translational efficiency of these IRES elements must be influenced by cellular <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Indeed, the neurovirulence of wild-type poliovirus is dependent on recognition of poliovirus IRES within neuronal cells, whereas the IRES of vaccine strains function poorly in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c13">13</xref>). It has also been reported that tissue-specific expression of PTB and nPTB (neuronal isoform) is an important determinant of cell-specific translational control and neurovirulence of Theiler&#x02019;s murine encephalitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c42">42</xref>).</p><p>The CVB3 receptor (coxsackie and adenovirus receptor) is known to be present on most tissues in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c43">43</xref>) but the virus infects specific organs like the heart, pancreas, brain and spleen. Therefore, phenomena like host tissue specificity may be explained as a complex interplay of cellular surface receptors and intracellular <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors influencing translation&#x0002f;replication of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c44">44</xref>). The only protein that has been reported to interact with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR and influence the IRES-mediated translation is PCBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c45">45</xref>).</p><p>Our observations show that the human La antigen specifically interacts with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR containing the IRES element and stimulates CVB3 IRES-mediated translation, as is also seen in the case of poliovirus and HCV. The basal level of translation directed by the CVB3 IRES in RRL, which has limiting quantities of La, is low. Therefore, the stimulatory effect of La is quite pronounced. The slight reduction in the translation level on adding higher quantities of La may be due to the non-specific RNA&#x02013;protein interactions at high concentrations of added protein, which may prevent the binding of other canonical and non-canonical translation factors.</p><p>Our experiments with I-RNA, which has been reported to bind to the La protein, demonstrated that I-RNA can compete with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR for binding to La and can also inhibit CVB3 IRES-directed translation. This suggests that I-RNA sequesters the La protein from the HeLa S10 supplemented RRL and, thus, prevents its interaction with the CVB3 IRES. This inhibition could be abolished by exogenous addition of La protein, which restored the translation efficiency to the original levels. This indicates that La protein is necessary for efficient translation initiation directed by the CVB3 IRES. Although the I-RNA is known to bind to other cellular proteins and may also sequester them, addition of La protein alone was sufficient to rescue the I-RNA-mediated inhibition of translation directed by the CVB3 IRES. It is possible that the other proteins, which bind to the I-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c46">46</xref>), may not be as critical for the CVB3 IRES-mediated translation. Alternatively, the binding of La to the CVB3 IRES facilitates its interaction with other <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. This might also be the reason why a lower concentration of I-RNA (50-fold excess) is able to inhibit CVB3 IRES-mediated translation by sequestering La and preventing these interactions, although a larger amount (600-fold excess) is needed to compete out the binding of La with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR. This observation is consistent with earlier reports where I-RNA-mediated inhibition of poliovirus and HCV IRES-driven translation was reversed by the exogenous addition of purified La protein alone. Moreover, the amount of La protein required to rescue the CVB3 IRES mediated translation is comparable with the levels required for rescuing the translation directed by the poliovirus IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c35">35</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to identify the major cellular sources of La protein, immunblotting of various tissue cytoplasmic extracts from Balb&#x0002f;c mouse was performed using anti-La antibodies which demonstrated the presence of the protein at variable levels in various tissues. Interestingly, the maximum concentration of the La protein was found in the pancreas extract. La mRNA has been shown to be present at different levels in various organs and some of the organs exhibiting high levels of the La mRNA, like the pancreas, spleen and the brain, were also found to have high levels of the protein. These organs, most importantly the pancreas, also serve as target organs of CVB3. Moreover, it has been suggested that a specific spliced form of the La mRNA (La 1&#x02032;) is translated more efficiently in a cap-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c39">39</xref>) and will, therefore, continue to be translated upon CVB3 infection, when cap-dependent translation has been shut down due to the cleavage of cellular eIF4G. Surprisingly, the level of La protein was found to be very low in the heart tissue cytoplasmic extract in the immunoblot. However, it should be mentioned that La is predominantly a nuclear protein and, in the case of poliovirus infection, major amounts of the protein are localized to the cytoplasm only on cleavage of the nuclear localization signal by viral 3C-protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c47">47</xref>). The recruitment of the nuclear-localized La protein in heart tissue after infection by CVB3 may be of major importance to the propagation of the virus in the heart. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic levels of La would normally be crucial for viral translation because the viral genome has to be initially translated post-infection, in order to synthesize the virus-encoded proteins, and this translation would be dependent on the cytoplasmic pool of the La protein. It has also been reported that cells stably expressing the La 1&#x02032; mRNA showed a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of the La protein, whereas those expressing the alternately spliced La 1 mRNA showed a nuclear localization of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c48">48</xref>).</p><p>The La protein, demonstrated to be present in the pancreatic extract, was also found to interact specifically with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA. The pancreas is now thought to be the primary site of CVB3 infection and the viral reservoir. Therefore, the efficiency of translation of the viral RNA in the pancreas, post infection, would play a crucial role in the ability of the virus to propagate in the tissue. It has been demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing IFN-&#x003b3; under the influence of the insulin promoter in the pancreatic &#x003b2; cells does not allow CVB3 replication in the pancreas. These mice failed to develop myocarditis after being infected by the virus although there was no expression of IFN-&#x003b3; in the heart tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c10">10</xref>). Therefore, the translation&#x0002f;replication of CVB3 RNA within the pancreas will be of great importance to the survival and propagation of the virus. The translation efficiency in pancreatic tissue may be influenced by the presence of high amounts of La protein, which was found to be crucial for the enhancement of CVB3 IRES-mediated translation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Accordingly, it was observed that cytoplasmic extract from the pancreas was able to enhance the CVB3 IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner. Previously, it has been reported that the exogenous addition of liver cytoplasmic extract was able to enhance the translation mediated by the Hepatitis A virus IRES in RRL, although the stimulation was not attributed to any specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf583c49">49</xref>). However, the stimulation in CVB3 IRES-mediated translation, which is observed on addition of pancreas extract, is abrogated on addition of excess of I-RNA, which is known to bind to La protein and which can inhibit the translation driven by the CVB3 IRES in RRL medium supplemented with HeLa cytoplasmic extract. Moreover, the translation efficiency can be restored on addition of excess purified La protein to the reaction medium. This seems to reinforce the idea that La protein plays an important role in the stimulation of CVB3 IRES-mediated translation by pancreatic tissue extract and possibly in the virus proliferation in the tissue.</p><p>This study constitutes the first report of the involvement of La in CVB3 IRES-mediated translation. It demonstrates the necessity of La protein for the process of internal initiation by the CVB3 IRES and also forwards the possibility that the presence of an abundance of La protein is correlated to efficient viral translation in a major target organ, namely the pancreas. It would be of interest to see how the presence of specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors is able to regulate CVB3 IRES-mediated translation and virus proliferation in various tissues. Further studies involving identification of such tissue-specific factors will help elucidate the mechanism of IRES-mediated translation of the CVB3 RNA and may provide new targets for anti-viral therapeutics.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf583f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Specific interaction of La protein with the CVB3 5&#x02032;-UTR.
