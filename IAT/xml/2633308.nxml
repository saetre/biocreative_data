Chronic airway bacterial colonization, associated with neutrophilic inflammation and high levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) is also a common occurrence in these patients. The aim of this work was to determine the responsiveness of airway smooth muscle to IL-8 in CF patients compared to non-CF individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Experiments were conducted on cultured ASM cells harvested from subjects with and without CF (control subjects). Cells from the 2<sup>nd </sup>to 5<sup>th </sup>passage were studied. Expression of the IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 was assessed by flow cytometry. The cell response to IL-8 was determined by measuring intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), cell contraction, migration and proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 were expressed in both non-CF and CF ASM cells to a comparable extent. IL-8 (100 nM) induced a peak Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release that was higher in control than in CF cells: 228 &#x000b1; 7 versus 198 &#x000b1; 10 nM (p &#x0003c; 0.05). IL-8 induced contraction was greater in CF cells compared to control. Furthermore, IL-8 exposure resulted in greater phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC<sub>20</sub>) in CF than in control cells. In addition, MLC<sub>20 </sub>expression was also increased in CF cells. Exposure to IL-8 induced migration and proliferation of both groups of ASM cells but was not different between CF and non-CF cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ASM cells of CF patients are more contractile to IL-8 than non-CF ASM cells. This enhanced contractility may be due to an increase in the amount of contractile protein MLC<sub>20</sub>. Higher expression of MLC<sub>20 </sub>by CF cells could contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness to IL-8 in CF patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by defective Cl<sup>- </sup>secretion and enhanced Na<sup>+ </sup>absorption across the airway epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The airways become infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>influenzae</italic>, and respiratory syncytial virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Chronic bacterial infections and inflammation of the lung are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in CF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. With increasing age, CF patients develop airway obstruction and many of these patients also suffer from airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma-like symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, Tiddens et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] have shown that airway remodeling similar to that of asthma affects CF airways, including changes in airway smooth muscle. In addition, i<italic>n vivo </italic>studies with inhalation of bronchodilators improve the symptoms associated with bronchial responsiveness in CF patients indicating the presence of an asthma-like syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These findings suggest that the bronchial responsiveness observed in CF may be related to an increase in airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction.</p><p>Many inflammatory cytokines are produced in the airways in CF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Several studies have documented increased levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8; CXCL8) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum and increased expression of IL-8 by bronchial glands of patients with CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In CF affected lungs, IL-8 is produced by neutrophils, airway epithelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. IL-8 binds to the G-protein coupled receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It acts as a chemotactic agent for neutrophils, T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], basophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], NK cells and melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has also been shown that IL-8 stimulates the proliferation and migration of rat vascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. IL-8 inhalation provokes bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As IL-8 is increased in the airways of CF patients and its action is not restricted to immune effector cells, it is possible that IL-8 may be involved in the airway hyperresponsiveness of CF by increasing smooth muscle contraction. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that ASM from healthy individuals expresses CXCR1 and CXCR2 and that IL-8 increases intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and triggers contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that, given the prolonged exposure of CF ASM to IL-8 <italic>in vivo</italic>, IL-8 may evoke different contractile responses of ASM cells in CF. Thus we investigated the effects of IL-8 on the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>by ASM and on the contraction of ASM from CF-affected subjects and compared our findings to those of cells from CF non-affected subjects. We also examined the expression of CXCRs and the effects of IL-8 on cellular migration and on ASM cell proliferation in both control and CF-affected subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Fragments of lobar bronchi were obtained from donors and recipients from lung transplants.

A similar difference in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>regulation in response to histamine has been observed in tracheal gland cells and in nasal epithelial cells of CF patients but the reason for this abnormality was reported as unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Despite these alterations, neither migration nor proliferation was significantly different between the two groups. These results indicate that CF cells are hypercontractile to IL-8, an effect that is not observed in the proliferative and migratory responses.</p><p>Chronic infection and inflammation leads to loss of more than one third of the epithelium from both central and peripheral airways of CF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As a result, the ASM cells are exposed to various inflammatory mediators such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-8. Cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-5 and IL-13 may modulate the contraction of ASM by indirect mechanisms through effects on cellular phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However chemokines such as IL-8 derived from inflammatory cells such as neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and perhaps from residual epithelial cells, may have direct effects on ASM as bronchonconstrictors because they act through G-protein coupled receptors linked to phospholipase C. Indeed IL-8 is a significant contractile agonist for human ASM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the current study we focused on IL-8 because of its importance for airway neutrophilic inflammation, which is a prominent feature of CF and is present also in some asthmatic subjects. The finding of the hypercontractile response to IL-8 may therefore have significance for the regulation of airway tone in CF affected subjects.</p><p>We tested the possibility that altered signaling mechanisms could account for the enhancement of the contraction in response to IL-8 by measuring the expression of CXCRs and the effects of IL-8 on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Flow cytometry confirmed our previous report of CXCR 1 and 2 expression in control cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], albeit at a lower level than in neutrophils. Our current results demonstrated comparable levels of expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 between CF and control cells. This finding is not unexpected, given that the increase in responsiveness of CF cells to IL-8 was confined to its effect on the contraction whereas there were no differences in responsiveness as measured by migration and proliferation. We explored next the possibility that the enhanced ASM contraction in CF might be related to exaggerated increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Rather than the expected enhanced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients in CF cells, fluorescence imaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>showed that IL-8 evoked lower Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients compared to control cells. Next, we explored other mechanisms for the increased contraction of CF ASM cells, namely MLC<sub>20 </sub>phosphorylation. Our data showed that there was a greater increase in MLC<sub>20 </sub>phosphorylation in the CF cells compared to controls. However the increase in MLC<sub>20 </sub>phosphorylation was modest and less than the magnitude of the increased expression of MLC<sub>20 </sub>measured in the CF cells. In addition to its role in contraction, IL-8 can also trigger ASM to respond by proliferation or migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However the increased response of CF cells to IL-8 was not reproduced in relationship to other cellular functions such as chemotaxis and proliferation. The mechanistic link between the CFTR channel and the contractile properties of airway smooth muscle has not been established. However, Robert et al have reported that CFTR channels are present in rat vascular smooth muscle cells and that stimulation of the channels by specific CFTR agonists produces relaxation of pre-contracted vascular tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Data from our laboratory show that CFTR channels are present and have functional effects on calcium signaling in ASM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our findings show that the ASM cells of cystic fibrosis patients are more contractile than those of control subjects to stimulation by IL-8. This enhanced contractility appears to be attributable to phenotypic differences and could be responsible, at least in part, for the airway hyperresponsiveness and asthmatic diathesis observed in many of these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VG participated in the design of the study, carried out many of the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
