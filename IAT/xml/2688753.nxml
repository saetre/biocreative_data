Neither nuclear extracts nor intact nuclei exposed to aminomethylphosphonate, a SHMT inhibitor, exhibit thymidylate synthesis activity. Nuclei isolated from <italic>Shmt1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse livers retained 25&#x00025; of thymidylate synthesis activity exhibited by nuclei isolated from wild type mice.

Previously, zebrafish SHMT2 protein was shown to localize exclusively to mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005839-Chang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The zebrafish <italic>Shmt2</italic> gene lacks the second translation initiation site in exon 2 and thus can only encode a mitochondrial isozyme. Mammalian <italic>SHMT2</italic> genes, with the exception of the lagomorph gene, encode a translation initiation codon in exon 2 and therefore likely encode the cytoplasmic/nuclear SHMT2&#x003b1; isozyme. These data also provide evidence for tissue-specific expression of the SHMT2 isoforms. The SHMT2/SHMT2&#x003b1; ratio differs between liver and kidney, with SHMT2 being the predominant form in liver, whereas only the SHMT2&#x003b1; and the SHMT2 unprocessed protein precursor were observed in kidney. Mitochondria are a primary source of one-carbon units for cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism through the activity of SHMT2, and the SHMT2&#x003b1; protein lacks most of the mitochondrial targeting sequence and may not be imported into mitochondria efficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005839-Stover1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.
