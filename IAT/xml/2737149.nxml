In response to hypertonicity, NFAT5 translocates to the nucleus, binds to regulatory regions of osmoprotective genes and activates their transcription. Besides stimulus-specific regulatory mechanisms, the activity of transcription factors in cycling cells is also regulated by the passage through mitosis, when most transcriptional processes are downregulated. It was not known whether mitosis could be a point of control for NFAT5.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Using confocal microscopy we observed that NFAT5 was excluded from chromatin during mitosis in both isotonic and hypertonic conditions. Analysis of NFAT5 deletions showed that exclusion was mediated by the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). NFAT5 mutants lacking this domain showed constitutive binding to mitotic chromatin independent of tonicity, which caused them to localize in the nucleus and remain bound to chromatin in the subsequent interphase without hypertonic stimulation. We analyzed the contribution of the CTD, DNA binding, and nuclear import and export signals to the subcellular localization of this factor. Our results indicated that cytoplasmic localization of NFAT5 in isotonic conditions required both the exclusion from mitotic DNA and active nuclear export in interphase. Finally, we identified several regions within the CTD of NFAT5, some of them overlapping with transactivation domains, which were separately capable of causing its exclusion from mitotic chromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results reveal a multipart mechanism regulating the subcellular localization of NFAT5. The transactivating module of NFAT5 switches its function from an stimulus-specific activator of transcription in interphase to an stimulus-independent repressor of binding to DNA in mitosis. This mechanism, together with export signals acting in interphase, resets the cytoplasmic localization of NFAT5 and prevents its nuclear accumulation and association with DNA in the absence of hypertonic stress.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>NFAT5 is a transcription factor that belongs to the Rel family (NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Hogan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Aramburu1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of NFAT5 is regulated by sequences located within its amino-terminal region, preceding the Rel-like DNA-binding domain.

It is well established that transcriptional silencing during mitosis is a process that inactivates the basal transcription machinery, specific transcription factors, and chromatin structural proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Prescott1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Gottesfeld1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This event is not governed by a universal mechanism, but rather the exclusion of individual transcription factors from mitotic chromatin can be regulated by distinct means. Examples of transcription factors that are inactivated during mitosis are the large family of C2H2 zinc fingers and the POU family of homeodomain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Dovat1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Caelles1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this regard, mitosis can provide cells with a mechanism to shut down transcriptional processes that will no longer be needed in the next cell cycle, unless the triggering stimulus still persists. In a population of cycling cells exposed to a sustained source of stress, the equilibrium between resetting and reactivating stress-responsive factors must be finely regulated.</p><p>In this work, we describe that the subcellular localization of NFAT5 and its capacity to bind to chromatin are sensitive to the passage of cells through mitosis. We report that the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of NFAT5 causes its exclusion from mitotic chromatin in both isotonic and hypertonic conditions. NFAT5 mutants lacking this domain bound to mitotic chromatin, which in turn caused both their constitutive nuclear localization and association with chromatin in interphase in the absence of hypertonic stimulation. This regulatory mechanism was observed in different NFAT5 isoforms. Exclusion from mitotic chromatin was mediated by different parts of the CTD of NFAT5, some of which overlapped with transactivation domains. These results reveal a novel function of the CTD of NFAT5, which, by causing its dissociation from DNA in mitosis, regulates the subcellular localization and chromatin association of this protein in interphase. Therefore, our findings indicate that the mitotic resetting of NFAT5 contributes to ensure that its nuclear localization and binding to chromatin in the next cell cycle are induced in a stimulus-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of NFAT5 prevents its association with mitotic chromatin</title><p>As the distribution of many chromatin-binding proteins during mitosis can be readily visualized using cell imaging techniques by their exclusion from condensed chromatin between prophase and telophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Gottesfeld1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, our first approach consisted on analyzing whether NFAT5 was retained on, or excluded from, mitotic chromatin in cells growing in isotonic or hypertonic conditions. Confocal laser microscopy analysis of endogenous NFAT5 in HEK293 cells showed that it had a variable nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution in individual cells in asynchronous cultures in isotonic media (290&#x02013;310 mOsm/kg) and accumulated in the nucleus in response to hypertonicity (470 mOsm/kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007036-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Next, we determined the regions of NFAT5 involved in the exclusion from mitotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007036-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). GFP-tagged full-length NFAT5 (isoform a, FL5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-LopezRodriguez2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> exhibited the same behaviour as the endogenous protein in HEK293 cells, being excluded from mitotic chromatin regardless of hypertonic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007036-g001">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007036-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007036.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

This result indicated that the association of ND5 and DBD5 with mitotic chromatin was due to their direct binding to specific NFAT5-recognized DNA elements. Both FL5 and ND5 DNA binding mutants (FL5<sup>DB1</sup> and ND5<sup>DB1</sup>), which were comparably cytoplasmic in isotonic conditions, could translocate to the nucleus completely in response to hypertonicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007036-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, the subcellular localization of DBD5 was entirely dependent on its ability to bind DNA and insensitive to tonicity (see comparison of DBD5 and DBD5<sup>DB1</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007036-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007036.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Since this domain lacked import and export signals, we hypothesized that its access to DNA could occur in mitosis, and that the formation of the nuclear envelope after mitosis would keep it trapped in the nucleus in the subsequent interphase. To test this, we expressed the DBD5 in HEK293 and U2OS cells and, immediately after transfection, treated them with 2-hydroxyurea to cause their arrest at the G1/S transition so that they would not transit to mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007036-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

Nuclear envelope breakdown in mitosis makes DNA potentially accessible to the DBD of NFAT5. The carboxy-terminal domain inhibits the binding of NFAT5 to mitotic chromatin, contributing to localize NFAT5 in the cytosol after the nuclear envelope is formed in the next interphase.

That exclusion of NFAT5 from mitotic DNA also occurred in hypertonic conditions indicates that binding of this factor to regulatory regions of osmoprotective genes is subject to association/dissociation cycles in proliferating cells and has to be reactivated after mitosis. This scenario raises the question of whether NFAT5-dependent osmoprotective genes use bookmarking mechanisms to facilitate their reinduction if cells exiting mitosis remain exposed to osmotic stress. Gene bookmarking has been described in the regulatory regions of genes controlled by other transcription factors that are inactivated during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-BatonnetPichon1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Michelotti1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The relevance of NFAT5 using its carboxy-terminal domain to dissociate from mitotic chromatin is to ensure that the tonicity-sensitive import/export mechanisms may accurately control its subcellular localization and access to chromatin in the next interphase. This regulation is evident in cycling cells, since the breakdown of the nuclear envelope barrier in mitosis allows the access of NFAT5 to DNA, creating the need for preventing it from remaining bound to chromatin throughout the next interphase. Exclusion from mitotic chromatin would ensure that the subcellular localization of NFAT5 in interphase is properly controlled by nuclear import and export. It can be speculated that having various independent regulatory mechanisms might provide a finer control of its function. Although the signals regulating NFAT5 import/export have not been fully elucidated, at least one recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Xu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> has shown that CK1-mediated phosphorylation of the AED is important for its export function, and it is conceivable that other regulators might affect these processes. Such regulation could be hampered if NFAT5 was persistently associated with nuclear DNA as result of having been retained in chromatin during mitosis. It is also possible that sustained activity of this factor due to uncontrolled nuclear localization might be detrimental for the cell. For instance, it has been reported that overaccumulation of organic osmolytes in cells not subjected to osmotic stress can be toxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Lee2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Vikramadithyan1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, and thus limiting NFAT5 activity in the absence of stress might help to prevent such negative effects. In this regard, our comparison of a wild-type NFAT5 construct with a constitutively nuclear one suggested that nuclear localization alone without hypertonicity could cause a moderate transcriptional response. On the other hand, the significance of a complex control of NFAT5 subcellular localization in isotonic conditions might be found outside hypertonic stress responses, since this factor can also regulate osmotic stress-unrelated processes, such as integrin-induced migration, cell differentiation and viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Ranjbar1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Chen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The sustained association of NFAT5 with chromatin through mitosis and interphase caused by deletion of its CTD was consistent with the high stability of NFAT5-DNA complexes described previously in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Stroud1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, these I&#x003ba;B-like domains prevent the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in interphase in the absence of specific stimuli, whereas the carboxy-terminal domain of NFAT5 is inhibitory only in mitosis, and independently of whether NFAT5-activating conditions are present or not.</p><p>We observed an extensive overlapping of NFAT5 regions that caused its exclusion from mitotic chromatin (amino acids 547&#x02013;838 and 839&#x02013;1377 in NFAT5a) with those previously shown to induce its transcriptional activity (amino acids 960&#x02013;1397) or enhance it (amino acids 539&#x02013;876) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Lee1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007036-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). A relevant question is how these regions can switch NFAT5 from a transcriptionally active state, in which NFAT5 must be bound to chromatin, to another in which it is excluded from DNA. It can be proposed that mitosis-specific modifications of either NFAT5 or the chromatin, or a repressor protein interacting with NFAT5 in mitosis might disrupt the binding of this factor to DNA. On the other hand, the CTD of NFAT5 has a high content of serines (145 residues) and threonines (74 residues), which together comprise more than 22&#x00025; of this domain, suggesting the possibility of a complex phosphorylation-dependent regulation. The observation that different parts of the CTD of NFAT5 could independently inhibit its binding to mitotic chromatin also raises the question of whether these regions share a common feature or instead each of them uses a different mechanism. However, these regions do not display obvious sequence similarities between them, nor with other proteins known to be excluded from mitotic DNA, such as the C2H2 zinc finger or the POU families of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Dovat1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-Caelles1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides these questions, it remains to be known whether transactivation domains in other proteins can also play a dual role as activators of transcription in interphase and repressors of DNA-binding in mitosis, and whether they can reset the nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of transcription factors by controlling their association with mitotic chromatin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines, hypertonicity treatment, cell cycle arrest</title><p>The human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293), the osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cell line (American Type Culture Collection), the human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cell line, and NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007036-LopezRodriguez4">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 50 &#x000b5;M beta-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco) and the antibiotics penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 &#x000b5;g/ml) (Gibco) (complete medium).

In a first approach, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed sequentially with an anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) followed by a rabbit antibody (anti-NFAT5) specific for a carboxy-terminal peptide common to all NFAT5 isoforms (Affinity Bioreagents). However, the anti-NFAT5, which detected endogenous NFAT5 also in the transfected HEK293 samples, gave a much stronger signal than the anti-HA antibody and obscured the detection of the band corresponding to the transfected HA-tagged constructs in the same lanes. This problem occurred regardless of the order in which antibodies were used for Western blotting. To solve this, we added a lane with molecular weight markers between the samples of transfected and untransfected cells and used it as a guide to slice the membrane along the vertical axis.

Both halves of the membrane were probed separately with anti-HA or anti-NFAT5 antibodies respectively and, before developing them by ECL, were realigned following the markers of the sliced lane.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error of the mean (SEM) and statistical significance (t-Student test) were calculated using Microsoft Excel software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007036.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Association of NFAT5a mutants with mitotic chromatin.
