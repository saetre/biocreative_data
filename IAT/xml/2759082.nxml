Previous work demonstrated that strains lacking PTS, such as PB11, grow slow on glucose. PB11 has a reduced expression of glycolytic, and upregulates <italic>poxB</italic> and <italic>acs</italic> genes as compared to the parental strain JM101, when growing on glucose. The products of the latter genes are involved in the production of AcetylCoA. Inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> that codes for the RNA polymerase &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> subunit, reduces further (50&#x00025;) growth of PB11, indicating that &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> plays a central role in the expression of central metabolism genes in slowly growing cells. In fact, transcription levels of glycolytic genes is reduced in strain PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> as compared to PB11. In this report we studied the role of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> in the expression of the complete glycolytic pathway and <italic>poxB</italic> and <italic>acs</italic> genes in certain PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains and their <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivatives. We determined the transcription start sites (TSSs) and the corresponding promoters, in strains JM101, PB11, its derivative PB12 that recovered its growth capacity, and in their <italic>rpoS<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> derivatives, by 5&#x02032;RACE and pyrosequencing. In all these genes the presence of sequences resembling &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sites allowed the proposition that they could be transcribed by both sigma factors, from overlapping putative promoters that initiate transcription at the same site. Fourteen new TSSs were identified in seventeen genes. Besides, more than 30 putative promoters were proposed and we confirmed ten previously reported. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription experiments support the functionality of putative dual promoters. Alternatives that could also explain lower transcription levels of the <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivatives are discussed. We propose that the presence if real, of both &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> dependent promoters in all glycolytic genes and operons could allow a differential transcription of these central metabolism genes by both sigma subunits as an adaptation response to carbon limitation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="23"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phospohoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate transferase system (PTS), in conjunction with Crp and Cra, constitute the main regulatory system in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> involved in catabolite carbon repression that allows the utilization of glucose as the preferred carbon source. This system, composed of several proteins, is the major consumer of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) for the coupled translocation and phosphorylation of glucose into glucose-6P. Strains lacking this system (PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) have a significantly reduced transport rate of glucose and other sugars, resulting in permanent slow growth on glucose when it is the only carbon source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Postma1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> strains the presence of PTS makes it difficult to unveil the role of other mechanisms and modulators involved in carbon scavenging responses, such as &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>. In fact, in strains lacking <italic>crr</italic> that codes for the PTS EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> component, translation of the <italic>rpoS</italic> messenger is no longer repressed by EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, thus allowing higher levels of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>, even during the exponential growth phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Ueguchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

In a similar way when wild type cells are grown with glucose as a limiting nutrient, and in PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains that grow slowly on glucose, transcription of several central metabolism and especially glycolytic genes, turns out to be also under the control of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it has been proposed that &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> should be considered a second vegetative sigma factor because hundreds of genes are under its control when <italic>E. coli</italic> cells are exposed to stress conditions, including starvation and growing slowly on glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Ferenci1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Ferenci2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, these set of genes could have promoters for both sigma factors.</p><p>Differential DNA recognition specificities of the various sigma subunits allows promoter selectivity to the RNA polymerase core (RNAp). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the alarmone ppGpp modulates the binding affinity of different sigma subunits to the RNAp; high ppGpp concentrations favors binding of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> over &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Lengeler1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Artsimovitch1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, there are other factors such as DksA and Crl that apparently modulate the binding of different sigma subunits to the RNAp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Typas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> are very similar proteins; in fact, genes whose transcription is &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-dependent <italic>in vivo</italic> can often be transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and <italic>vice versa</italic>. The current view about the &#x0201c;selectivity paradox&#x0201d;, as mentioned by Weber <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, is that these two sigma factors recognize very similar promoters, and that minor differences at the &#x02212;10 region shift the specificity towards one or the other RNAp holoenzyme. Moreover, transcription initiation by the RNAp &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> holoenzyme is apparently less affected by deviations from the promoter consensus (e.g. degeneration of the &#x02212;35 sequence), which allows this holoenzyme to transcribe from &#x0201c;non-optimal&#x0201d; promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Typas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Becker1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Nystrm1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Some degree of promoter degeneration apparently allows both RNAp holoenzymes to use overlapping promoters that share transcriptional start sites (TSSs), giving plasticity to the transcription process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Typas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Nonaka1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Wade1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have been involved in the characterization of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains lacking PTS (PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), such as strain PB11 and its derivative strain PB12, which was selected for growth rate recovery in a chemostat with glucose fed at progressively faster rates. As expected, carbon flux analyses showed that PB11 has a reduced glycolytic capacity. Interestingly, the adaptive evolution process that gave rise to PB12 rendered an increase in its glycolytic capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores4">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with these results, transcriptome studies have shown that several glycolytic genes are downregulated in PB11; in contrast, they are upregulated in PB12, as compared to the parental wild type strain JM101.

In support of this proposition, <italic>poxB</italic> inactivation not only decreased 50&#x00025; the specific growth rate (&#x003bc;) of PB11 but carbon fluxes for the conversion of pyruvate into AcCoA were doubled in PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains as compared to the wild type parental strain JM101 and the expression of some glycolytic genes was downregulated in PB11<italic>poxB</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> as compared to PB11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores5">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the molecular details of this control and the type and disposition of the different promoters are still incomplete. In this work, we utilized a modified 5&#x02032;RACE methodology and a global genomic strategy by pyrosequencing to determine the TSSs, and subsequently the promoters of all these genes in strains JM101, PB11, PB12 and their <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivative strains. Both methodologies utilized as template total RNA extracted from the cells (Materials and methods, Mendoza <italic>et al</italic>, submitted to PLoS ONE). In the case of the 5&#x02032;RACE methodology, we utilized the same RNA that was previously used for quantitative detection of the mRNA of these genes by real time PCR (RTPCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. For the modified 5&#x02032;RACE analysis we designed oligonucleotide primers specific for each gene in order to recover from the RNA mixture only those cDNAs of interest, and extended the oligonucleotide primer till the end of the molecule, which normally corresponds to the 5&#x02032;end of the mRNA. In contrast, the global pyrosequencing strategy does not select for any particular gene and the results obtained normally correspond to the degree of expression of each gene (Mendoza <italic>et al</italic>, submitted to PLoS ONE). For each gene analyzed by the modified 5&#x02032;RACE we detected on PAGE at least one band corresponding to the gene-specific amplification product. For some genes we detected also nonspecific PCR products, arising from partial complementarity, coming mainly from the highly abundant rRNAs (Mendoza <italic>et al</italic>, submitted to PLoS ONE). In several cases, when the intensities of the bands in the gels were weak, DNA bands for the same size were mixed together and sequenced, resulting in the same TSSs.

Because the &#x02212;35 region is less conserved or even absent, especially in the &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Typas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Becker1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Nystrm1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, only the &#x02212;10 region was considered in our analyses. When putative superimposed promoters for both &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> were detected sharing the same TSS, an additional number was included in the promoter name to indicate this fact. In those cases we named as mentioned, these two putative overlapping promoters as &#x0201c;putative dual promoters&#x0201d;. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription experiments and DNA fusions of various promoters to a reporter gene of some of these genes were obtained as additional evidence to support the functionality of these promoters.

The sequence of the uppermost band corresponded to rRNA. The nucleotide sequences of the middle bands, clearly observed in JM101, PB12, and PB12<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> showed that in all strains transcription initiated at the same position as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Helling1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We named this putative dual promoter <italic>pfkA</italic>P1-P2 (see below). Very low intensity bands located at the same position in strains PB11 and PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> suggests that this promoter was utilized in all strains. The shorter band, which is clearly observed in strain JM101, produced a sequence that started at a C residue, 29 nucleotides from the ATG start codon.

It has been published that in the PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain PB11 which grows slowly on glucose, the transcription level of all glycolytic genes is reduced when <italic>rpoS</italic> was inactivated, indicating that their expression was partially controlled by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The evidence presented in this work strongly supports the proposal that in genes with previously reported &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters (<italic>glk</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pgi</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pfkA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>epd</italic>P1-P2, <italic>gapA</italic>P1-P1a, <italic>pdhR</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>aceE</italic>P1-P2), transcription could occur from two overlapping or putative dual promoters in each gene that included both &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> recognition sites and possible &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> binding sites, in which transcription initiation if directed by both sigma factors, occurred at the same site in all strains. Additionally, new possible &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> dependent putative dual promoters were described in this report for other glycolytic genes, (<italic>glk</italic>P3-P4, <italic>pfkA</italic>P3-P4, <italic>tpiA</italic>P2-P3, <italic>pgk</italic>P2, <italic>pgk</italic>P3, <italic>gpmA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>gpmA</italic>P3-P4, <italic>eno</italic>P4-P5, <italic>eno</italic>P6, <italic>eno</italic>P7-P8, <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pykF</italic>P3, <italic>pyk</italic>P4-P5, <italic>pykA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pykA</italic>P3-P4), in which possible &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and sequences resembling &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sites were also overlapped in most of them. No sequences resembling &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sites were found neither in <italic>pgk</italic> nor in <italic>fbaA</italic>. However, these two genes are part of the <italic>epd-pgk-fbaA</italic> operon and RTPCR data indicate that these three genes could be transcribed by both sigma factors from the <italic>epd</italic>P1-P2 putative dual promoter, in the PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains. PoxB and Acs play an important role in carbon metabolism in the convertion of pyruvate into AcCoA in cells growing slowly on glucose. <italic>pox</italic>B and <italic>acs</italic>, also could have putative dual promoters. We found that <italic>poxB</italic> is mainly transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> from the previously reported promoter; however, inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> did not abolish its transcription, in agreement with RTPCR results, indicating that this could also be dual promoter. Again, as for many glycolytic genes, a strong putative &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> recognition sequence was detected overlapping this reported &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> promoter. The <italic>acs</italic> gene was mainly transcribed by its originally proposed &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup><italic>acs</italic>P2 promoter. However, in the <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivative strains its expression, as detected by RTPCR, was reduced, implying that could be also controlled by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>. In agreement with this observation, we found a possible strong &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition element superimposed to the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter integrating the putative dual <italic>acs</italic>P2-P3 promoter. The experiments presented here, in agreement with RTPCR values indicate that in strain PB11, at least one of the putative dual promoters described for each gene or operon, could be transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>.</p><p>The majority of the TSSs detected in this work lay within the first 100 nucleotides upstream the ATG initiation codons, except for <italic>epd</italic> that initiated transcription 132 nucleotides, <italic>pykA</italic> in which two TSSs were located at 105 and 153 nucleotides, and for one of the three TSSs in <italic>eno</italic> that initiated 212 nucleotides upstream the ATG initiation codon. Remarkably, for those genes with previously reported promoters mapped less than 100 nucleotides from the ATG, we found the same TSSs (except for <italic>tpiA</italic>). On the other hand, for promoters previously described further apart of the ATG start codon (more than 100 nucleotides), as <italic>pykF</italic>, <italic>eno</italic> and <italic>pgk</italic>, we did not find transcription from these sites; instead we detected new promoters for all of these genes located within the first 100 nucleotides upstream the ATG codon. It is important to mention that some of the previously reported promoters (<italic>eno</italic>P1, <italic>eno</italic>P2, <italic>eno</italic>P3 and <italic>pgk</italic>P1) not detected in this report, were described in other metabolic conditions (growing on Luria broth), suggesting differential expressions from these promoters.</p><p>The existence and functionality of these new putative dual promoters is supported by the following results: a) most of the previously experimentally determined TSSs and two inferred promoters (<italic>gpmA</italic>P1 and <italic>acs</italic>P2) coincided with the ones obtained here, b) the presence of DNA sequences resembling &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sites overlapping the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> binding sites in all these genes, allowed the proposition that these genes could be transcribed from overlapping putative &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters, defined as putative dual promoters, c) TSSs for most of the genes identified by 5&#x02032;RACE were mapped in five, and in some cases six different strains. The same results were consistently obtained. In several cases, when the intensities of the bands in the gels were very weak, DNA bands of the same size from different strains were mixed together and sequenced, resulting in the same single TSS. For the majority of the analyzed genes two or more independent experiments were performed, obtaining identical results, d) two different methods for labeling the cDNA ends were employed: polyhomonucleotide tail incorporation and oligonucleotide ligation (developed for cDNA library construction in pyrosequencing, but also used to assess the results of the 5&#x02032;RACE TSSs mapping), and both methodologies were coincident, e) in most of the genes, the inactivation of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> reduced the amount of transcript detected in the gel (in agreement with RTPCR values), in at least one of the <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains as compared to their parental <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> strains, f) a global transcription initiation mapping experiment by pryrosequencing of a different <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain, in which random primers were utilized instead of gene-specific oligonucleotides (Mendoza <italic>et al</italic>, submitted to PLoS ONE), provided independent evidence for the existence of five previously reported TSSs (<italic>pgi</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pfkA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>gapA</italic>P1-P1a, <italic>epd</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>gmkA</italic>P1-P2) and seven TSSs mapped in this work by 5&#x02032;RACE (<italic>glk</italic>P3-P4, <italic>pfkA</italic>P3-P4, <italic>tpiA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pgk</italic>P3, <italic>eno</italic>P4-P5, <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2, and <italic>pykA</italic>P3-P4), g) promoter fusions of <italic>pgi</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pfkA</italic>P3-P4, <italic>tpiA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pgk</italic>P2, and <italic>eno</italic>P4-P5, with a reporter <italic>cat</italic> gene, demonstrated the functionality of these DNA sequences, h) <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments for several genes demonstrated that they were transcribed by both &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, and produced the same TSSs as the ones detected <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> are very similar proteins and in fact genes whose transcription is &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> dependent <italic>in vivo</italic> can often be transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and vice versa However, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription has been extensively used as evidence to support the expression capability of different sigma subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Ueguchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Grainger1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Transcription of the <italic>poxB</italic> gene clearly occurred <italic>in vitro</italic> when &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> was utilized, in agreement with the fact that a strong &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sequence is present in this promoter, but not by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, despite the fact that there is also a &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> recognition element in this dual promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g004">figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, the results obtained in this report demonstrated that this putative dual promoter was transcribed <italic>in vivo</italic> by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> in the PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains where transcription is clearly reduced as compared to their <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> parental strains, but the promoter is still functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g004">4a</xref>). It is not clear why &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> was unable to transcribe <italic>in vitro</italic> this promoter. Importantly, the same TSSs were detected in the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments as those reported by 5&#x02032;RACE, supporting the fact that obtained 5&#x02032;RACE results are real and not the result of processing. These results also indicate that both sigma subunits are apparently capable of recognizing their binding sites and produce the same transcript as <italic>in vivo</italic>, supporting the proposition that these putative dual promoters could be transcribed <italic>in vivo</italic> by both sigma subunits. It is important to emphasize, as mentioned that since &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> are very similar proteins this situation could allow the recognition of similar binding sites <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, in certain conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Remarkably, all glycolytic genes and operons as well as the <italic>poxB</italic> and <italic>acs</italic> genes could have functional putative overlapping dual &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> promoters, whose positions are at the typical distance from the TSSs. A possible differential utilization of these two sigma factors correlates with carbon availability: &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> plays a major role in the expression of these genes in carbon deprivation stress conditions, while &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is mainly used when cells are growing under carbon surplus conditions. This interpretation, as it will be explained below in more detail, is supported by two additional facts to those previously described in this discussion: 1) the observation that, as mentioned, inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> decreased transcription of all glycolytic genes in strain PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> as detected previously by RTPCR, and 2) its inactivation reduced also the growth rate in carbon deprived PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains, particularly in PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, but also to some extend in PB12<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> which as expected, is less stressed. Wild type JM101 growing exponentially on glucose is less dependent on &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>. The functionality of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> apparently could also hold for several genes previously reported as having &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters, indicating that their expression could be indeed also partially controlled by the former sigma factor. Several of these putative dual promoters have possible strong recognition elements for both &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, while others have possible weaker elements also for both &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g002">figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). However, it is known that other factors such as DNA structure or interaction with transcriptional regulators, influence the ability of sigma factors to recognize weak binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Bronwning1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. As it will be discussed below in detail, transcription plasticity, understanded as the capacity of a gene to be transcribed by more than one sigma factor, could have been selected, to allow permanent transcription of the genes involved in the transformation of glucose-6P into pyruvate in different metabolic conditions; remarkably, many of these genes work also as gluconeogenic and their expression is controlled by few general transcriptional regulators. Following, a comparative analysis of the proposed promoters is presented.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Comparative and detailed analysis of the identified proposed promoters</title><p>In the case of <italic>glk</italic> in which two TSSs were identified by 5&#x02032;RACE: <italic>glk</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>glk</italic>P3-P4; the former, found in PB12, has been previously reported as a &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> dependent promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Froman1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, while the latter used by strains JM101 and PB11, was also detected by pyrosequencing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). DNA sequences resembling poor &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> recognition elements were detected in these putative dual promoters of this gene, where inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic>, apparently increased transcription in the gel from the reported promoters, as detected by PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g002">2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). The use of a different promoter in PB12, as compared to JM101 and PB11, could be partially responsible for the higher (2&#x000d7;) level of <italic>glk</italic> transcription detected by RTPCR that correlates with higher (2&#x000d7;) Glk specific activity in PB12 as compared to JM101 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores5">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

The same type of phenomenon could explain the apparent increase in transcription levels in the gel of the PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain as compared to PB11 that are also not in agreement with RTPCR values. However, it should be taken into account that 5&#x02032;RACE is not a quantitative methodology and this could explain these differences. It is important to point out that <italic>glk</italic> is one of the few glycolytic genes whose transcription was not reduced as detected by RTPCR in strain PB11 as compared to JM101. In PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains, and probably in wild type strains growing very slowly on glucose, Glk is the enzyme that phosphorylates transported glucose into glucose-6P. Interestingly, the transcription of this gene was upregulated in a wild type strain grown on glucose as carbon limited nutrient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Hua1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Ferenci2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Apparently, all glycolytic genes could have more than one promoter, supporting this transcription plasticity proposal (see below). The fact that transcription is reduced as detected by RTPCR in both PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivatives as compared to their <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> parental strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>), suggests that both <italic>glk</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>glk</italic>P3-P4 could work as dual promoters recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>.</p><p>In the case of genes with only one detected TSS by 5&#x02032;RACE methodology, such as <italic>pgi</italic>, <italic>tpi</italic>A, <italic>gapA</italic>, <italic>epd</italic> (first promoter of the <italic>epd-pgk-fbaA</italic> operon), <italic>pdhR</italic> (first promoter of the <italic>pdhR-aceEF-lpd</italic> operon), <italic>aceEF</italic> (internal promoter of this operon), <italic>poxB</italic>, and <italic>acs</italic>, <italic>rpoS</italic> inactivation reduced the amount of transcription in these genes as detected by RTPCR and gel electrophoresis (with the exception of <italic>epd</italic> in the gel), suggesting that they are at least partially &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>-dependent.

However, only <italic>pfkA</italic>P1-P2 was transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> by both sigma subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g006">figure 6</xref>).</p><p>In the <italic>gpmA</italic> gene, two putative dual promoters <italic>gpmA</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>gpmA</italic>P3-P4 were described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003">figure 3a</xref>). Transcription from <italic>gpmA</italic>P1-P2 was also detected by pyrosequencing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). Apparently, in agreement with RTPCR values, inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> decreased transcription in strain PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> at least from <italic>gpmA</italic>P3-P4. For <italic>gpmA</italic>P1-P2 in this strain transcription seemed unchanged in the gel; however, possible strong superimposed &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>recognition elements were detected in both putative dual promoters <italic>gpmA</italic>P3-P4 and in <italic>gpmA</italic>P1-P2. Interestingly, in this gene and also in <italic>gapA</italic> and <italic>eno</italic>, inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> did not have any effect neither in the RTPCR value nor in the transcription level on the gel of strain PB12<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> as compared to PB12. These results suggest a more important role of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> in the transcription of these promoters in this strain with higher glycolytic flux, where RTPCR values were enhanced as compared to the parental strains JM101 and PB11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned earlier, transcription of the complete <italic>epd-pgk-fbaA</italic> operon initiated in all strains at the same <italic>epd</italic>P1-P2 putative dual promoter; repeated experiments confirmed these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g002">figures 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s001">S1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>).

Notice that transcription from <italic>epd</italic>P1-P2 was also detected by pyrosequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g002">figure 2f-1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). Two additional TSSs were detected by 5&#x02032;RACE for the <italic>pgk</italic> gene. Nevertheless, no sequences resembling &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition elements were detected in these <italic>pgk</italic>P2 and <italic>pgk</italic>P3 putative promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g002">figure 2f-2</xref>). Importantly, transcription from <italic>pgk</italic>P3 was also detected by pyrosequencing, and <italic>pgk</italic>P2 was able to promote transcription of the reporter <italic>cat</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s003">figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). In addition, no TSSs were detected in the intergenic region between <italic>pgk</italic> and <italic>fbaA</italic>. These results not only suggest that transcription of this last gene occurred from upstream promoters in this operon, but also that these three genes are apparently transcribed from the putative <italic>epd</italic>P1-P2 dual promoter, as a polycistronic mRNA in the analyzed growing conditions, since inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> decreased transcription of all three genes in the PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Three different new transcription products for the <italic>eno</italic> gene were detected in several independent 5&#x02032;RACE experiments. We have labeled the proposed promoters responsible for these expression events as <italic>eno</italic>P4-P5, <italic>eno</italic>P6 and <italic>eno</italic>P7-P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003">figures 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s001">S1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>).

Inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> decreased transcription from this gene especially in strain PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> as detected by RTPCR. Transcription levels in the gels were slightly reduced from the putative dual <italic>eno</italic>P7-P8 promoter in the PTS<italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains, but not apparently from the putative dual <italic>eno</italic>P4-P5 promoter. Interestingly, these two putative dual promoters carry sequences resembling poor &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003">figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). Again, as in several other cases, it is important to emphasize that 5&#x02032;RACE is not a quantitative methodology.</p><p>In the case of <italic>pykF</italic>, three different putative promoters <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pykF</italic>P3 and <italic>pykF</italic>P4-P5 were described. Inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> apparently decreased transcription levels in the gel of the two putative dual promoters <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>pykF</italic>P4-P5 that were functional in the PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003">figure 3c-1</xref>). Expression from <italic>pykF</italic>P4-P5 was not observed in the wild type strain. This putative dual promoter has strong overlapping possible &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> &#x02212;10 recognition elements. In this gene, transcription was performed in the three strains from the three different putative promoters. However, while in all the strains transcription from <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 was detected, transcription from <italic>pykF</italic>P3 was only observed in the wild type strain. Metabolic conditions in PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains allowed transcription mainly from the <italic>pykF</italic>P4-P5 apparently &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>-dependent promoter, probably inhibiting the utilization of the closely located <italic>pyk</italic>P3 that is functional in the wild type strain. Remarkably, transcription levels determined by RTPCR were slightly diminished in both PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains as compared to JM101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>). This could be explained by high transcription levels apparently occurring from the <italic>pykF</italic>P4-P5 putative dual promoter in the PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains as shown in the gel. No clear sequences resembling &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> recognition elements were found neither in <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 nor in <italic>pykF</italic>P3. However, a sequence resembling a very poor &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition element present in <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 could explain lower transcription levels from this promoter in the <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivative strains including JM101<italic>rpoS<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>).The absence of distinct &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> &#x02212;10 recognition elements upstream the <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>pykF</italic>P3 putative promoters allows the speculation that the two transcripts seen in the gel corresponding to these two promoters could be specific processing or degradation products from a larger mRNA produced from the non detected <italic>pykF</italic>P predicted promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Bledig1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no transcription was detected from this predicted promoter even when using oligonucleotides designed to prime closer to it, ruling out its expression at least in these growing conditions (data not shown). Cra, which recognition site is located 197 nucleotides upstream the ATG initiation codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Bledig1">&#x0005b;49, Regulon DB http://www.ccg.unam.mx&#x0005d;</xref> or some other factor, could play a role in the utilization of these putative promoters in which no clear &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> &#x02212;10 recognition elements were detected. As mentioned, certain factors can facilitate transcription of promoters with poor or no obvious sigma recognition sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Bronwning1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, <italic>pykF</italic>P4-P5 and <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 could be transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> since inactivation of this sigma factor reduced transcription in the gel of these two putative dual promoters in the <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivative strains. These experiments suggest that they could be real promoters and, as mentioned, the wild type strain transcribed this gene from both <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>pykF</italic>P3 promoters in the absence of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>, such that &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is apparently controlling their expression in this strain. In fact, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription indicates that the two putative dual promoters <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>pykF</italic>P4-P5 are recognized by both sigma factors and transcription initiation from <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 has been detected by pyrosequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g006">figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). Therefore, these two putative dual promoters seem to be functional in these strains. It is important to emphasize that in <italic>E. coli</italic> strains lacking PTS, the absence of this general regulator increases the carbon flux through the PykA and PykF enzymes, and apparently in these PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains the <italic>pykF</italic> gene seems to be preferentially transcribed from the <italic>pykF</italic>4-P5 putative dual promoter, which is not functional in the wild type strain when growing exponentially on glucose.</p><p>In <italic>pyk</italic>A, two putative dual promoters were detected in the three strains by 5&#x02032;RACE. Clearly, these two promoters were transcribed in JM101 indicating that &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is performing this expression. While inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> apparently decreased transcription in the gel from <italic>pykA</italic>P3-P4 putative dual promoter in PB12<italic>rpo</italic>S<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and possibly in PB11<italic>rpo</italic>S<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, it is interesting that this inactivation apparently increased transcription in the gel from <italic>pykA</italic>P1-P2 in both PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003">figure 3c-2</xref>). The same type of phenomenon of increased transcription detected in the gel for two promoters occurred in <italic>glk</italic>. Importantly, both <italic>pykA</italic> promoters have DNA sequences resembling poor &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> &#x02212;10 recognition elements and also DNA sequences resembling very poor &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sequences. However, inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> markedly decreased transcription levels (more than 50&#x00025;) of <italic>pykA</italic> in both PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains as compared to their respective parental <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> derivatives, as detected by RTPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>), suggesting an important role of this sigma factor in the expression of <italic>pykA</italic>. In fact, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription demonstrated that both putative dual promoters are transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g006">figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s002">S2</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of these two putative dual <italic>pykA</italic> promoters by both sigma fagctors, rendered weaker bands than those corresponding to other promoters, including the one in the plasmid responsible for RNA-I. These results suggest, as has been proposed for the <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2 promoter in which a DNA sequence resembling a poor &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> recognition site is present that <italic>in vivo</italic> some other factor could play a role in the utilization of these <italic>pykA</italic> putative dual promoters where DNA sequences resembling weak &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sites are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Bronwning1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Transcription from the putative <italic>pykA</italic>P3-P4 dual promoter has also been detected by pyrosequencing. Interestingly, higher RTPCR values were present in the transcription of this gene in PB12 as compared to PB11, while the same transcription level was exhibited in both strains in the <italic>pykF</italic> gene as detected by RTPCR. Therefore, it is possible that during the selection of PB12 for growth recovery on glucose the transcription of several genes, including <italic>pkyA</italic> was upregulated as compared to PB11, increasing in turn the glycolytic carbon flux. Clearly, there is a differential utilization of the <italic>pykA</italic> promoters in strain PB12 as compared to PB11. Apparently, this latter strain utilizes preferentially the putative dual promoter <italic>pykA</italic>P1-P2 whereas PB12 transcription of <italic>pykA</italic>P3-P4 is highly increased in comparison to the parental PB11 strain. Differential utilization of promoters is also apparently present in the <italic>glk</italic> gene and clearly upregulation of the expression of most glycolytic genes in PB12, as compared to PB11, as revealed by RTPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>) is also detected in several other genes (<italic>pgi</italic>, <italic>gapA</italic>, <italic>pfkA</italic>, <italic>tpiA</italic>, <italic>pdhR</italic>, <italic>aceE</italic>) in the gels. These results could explain in part, faster growth of PB12 over PB11.</p><p>In all strains, transcription of the <italic>pdhR-aceEF-lpd</italic> operon initiated at the same <italic>pdhR</italic>P1-P2 putative dual promoter, upstream of <italic>pdhR</italic>. In derivative strains lacking &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>, not only transcription levels of <italic>pdhR</italic> were diminished, as seen from the RTPCR values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>), but also the intensity of the bands in the gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003">figure 3d-1</xref>). These results suggest that this promoter region may include functional overlapping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> promoters and are in agreement with the report that &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> modulates the expression of <italic>pdhR</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Quail1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. As mentioned, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription provided additional evidence to support the fact that both sigma subunits recognize and transcribe this putative dual promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g006">figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s002">2S</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). Interestingly, possible poor &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and possible poor &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> overlapping recognition sites are present in this putative dual promoter. Independently from the results concerning the TSS in the <italic>pdhR</italic> gene, the data presented here also indicate that an <italic>aceEF</italic> internal putative dual promoter is apparently functional in all strains, and may work as a constitutive promoter because PdhR does not repress it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Quail1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. This is in agreement with the result that in all strains the TSS at the <italic>aceE</italic> gene coincided with the reported one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Spencer1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Again, transcription from this DNA region carrying both possible &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> superimposed boxes apparently depended on both &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and transcription was decreased in PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and more evidently in PB12<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains, as compared to their parental strains. Finally, upregulation of <italic>pdhR</italic> was detected in PB12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>) and in another wild type strain grown on Luria broth in different stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, less upregulation was detected in <italic>aceEF</italic> (1.4&#x000d7;) in PB12 whereas no upregulation of these two genes was reported in a wild type strain grown on Luria broth in different stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicate that a transcription termination mechanism could be present at the end of the <italic>pdhR</italic> structural gene allowing lower upregulation values of <italic>aceEF</italic> in PB12 and in other <italic>E. coli</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> as compared to <italic>pdhR</italic>, since these genes are mainly transcribed as part of a polycistronic mRNA. In this regard, a possible terminator sequence has been described at the end of <italic>pdhR</italic> structural gene that could explain these differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Spencer1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Quail1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results show that <italic>rpoS</italic> inactivation decreased transcription in several previously reported &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters in glycolytic genes and operons: <italic>pgi</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pfkA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>gap</italic>AP1-1a, <italic>epd</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pdhR</italic>P1-P2, <italic>aceE</italic>P1-P2. In fact, in these six genes which have the same reported transcription initiation sites and are mainly transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, six new proposed putative &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> promoters superimposed to &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> recognition sequences, were described in these putative dual promoters. Several of these new possible &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> sites are strong recognition sequences. In addition, new dual putative promoters were described: <italic>tpiA</italic>P2-P3, <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pykF</italic>P4-P5, <italic>pykA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pykA</italic>P3-P4 and possibly <italic>glk</italic>P1-P2, <italic>glk</italic>P3-P4, <italic>pfkA</italic>P3-P4, <italic>gpm</italic>AP1-P2, <italic>gpmA</italic>P3-P4, <italic>eno</italic>P4-P5, and <italic>eno</italic>P7-P8 that all seem to include both &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> superimposed possible recognition elements. Importantly, some of these putative dual promoters in this last group carry DNA sequences resembling poor &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sequences especially <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pykA</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pykA</italic>P3-P4, <italic>pfkA</italic>P3-P4, and <italic>eno</italic>P7-P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g002">figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). However, inactivation of <italic>rpoS</italic> in strain PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> reduced the transcription levels of all these genes detected by RTPCR, suggesting, as previously mentioned that at least one of the putative dual promoters in each gene or operon could be transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>). In addition, the independent global transcription mapping experiment allowed the identification by pyrosequencing of the same TSSs detected for twelve of these proposed dual promoters, and fusion of chromosomal DNA fragments carrying one or more of these promoters to a reporter gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s003">figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>), corroborated the functionality of some of these promoters. Finally, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments confirmed that several proposed dual promoters are transcribed in these experiments by both sigma subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g006">figure 6</xref>). These results indicate that &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> plays a central role in the regulation of all glycolytic genes and operons and at least in two other important central metabolism genes -<italic>poxB</italic> and <italic>acs</italic>- that could be at the transcription level since possible superimposed &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> putative dual promoters were detected in all these genes when <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown slowly on glucose, as occurred in the PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains, specially in PB11. The presented results allowed the identification of fourteen new TSSs by 5&#x02032;RACE and the proposal of more than 30 putative promoter sequences in 17 central metabolism genes and operons not previously described. The majority of these putative promoter sequences could be recognized by both &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> sigma factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). Certainly as mentioned, some of these putative promoters carry poor &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> binding sites. If these promoters are real and they are transcribed by both sigma subunits, other factors such as DksA, Crl, Cra, Fis, H-NS and IHF, could modulate the binding capacities and selectivities of these sigma subunits in these promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Typas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Lengeler1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Grainger1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Bronwning1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Alternative scenarios that could also explain the low transcription levels in the PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup></title><p>It is important to emphasize that some of the proposed dual promoters have possible poor &#x02212;10 &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sequences especially those located in <italic>pfkA</italic>P3-P4, <italic>eno</italic>P7-P8, <italic>pykF</italic>P1-P2, <italic>pykA</italic>P1-P2 and <italic>pykA</italic>P2-P3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007466-t001">table 1</xref>). Therefore, if any of the putative &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition elements that have been described in this report are really not functional <italic>in vivo</italic>, then an alternative explanation for the decreased RTPCR values in <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivatives as compared to their <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> parental strains, could be that the transcription of these genes in these PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains must depend indirectly on &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>. This hypothesis entails that some other factor(s) of the &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> regulon could modulate transcription by directly interacting with the transcription machinery or indirectly, allowing differential exposure of certain DNA regions required for transcription. Weber <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, have proposed that &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> containing RNAp holoenzyme has the ability to cooperate with additional regulatory factors, similar as &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> RNAp does. Therefore, some of these regulatory factors that interact with the vegetative &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> RNA polymerase could be part of the sigma &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> modulon. Hence the absence of one or some of these factors could have a negative impact on the transcription of certain &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters. An additional alternative possibility that could also explain, at least partially, lower transcription levels in glycolytic genes in strain PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> as compared to PB11 is the fact that the lack of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> may decrease the levels of acetic acid produced by PoxB in these strains, which is used as carbon source through the activity of Acs; this could reduce gluconeogenic and glycolytic fluxes that in turn may decrease both growth rate and the transcription of glycolytic genes in the PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain. We have published that inactivation of <italic>poxB</italic> reduced 50&#x00025; the specific growth rate of PB11<italic>poxB</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> as compared to PB11. We have proposed that less acetate should be produced in the PB11<italic>poxB</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain, as well as in the PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain, since <italic>poxB</italic> is transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>, to be recycled as a carbon source and therefore this situation could be as mentioned, at least partially, responsible of a decrease in the transcription of glycolytic genes. In fact, transcription of some glycolytic genes is reduced in PB11<italic>poxB</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> when compared to PB11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores5">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, we compared the expression levels of glycolytic genes in the <italic>poxB</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> derivative strains with the goal of determining the possible roles of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and acetate in their expression. As mentioned, the transcription values of two of the analyzed glycolytic genes <italic>glk</italic> and <italic>pgi</italic>, are reduced roughly at the same levels in the PB11<italic>poxB</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains as compared to PB11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores5">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, allowing the possibility that, low acetate levels could play a role in the expression of at least these two genes. However, since the reported transcription values of other glycolytic genes (<italic>aceEF</italic>, <italic>lpd</italic>, <italic>pykA</italic>, <italic>pykF</italic>), in the PB11<italic>poxB</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain are not modified in comparison with PB11, this result indicates that at least in these five genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores5">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, lower acetate levels are apparently not responsible of reducing their expression in the PB11<italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain. In addition, the expression of the seven analyzed glycolytic genes in the PB12<italic>poxB</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain is not modified in comparison to the PB12 strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores5">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. These results support the proposition that &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> could play a role in the expression of these genes. Therefore, if these putative dual promoters really function <italic>in vivo</italic> and if several of them are transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup>, this may indicate that transcription initiation by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> is in fact less affected by different deviations from the proposed promoter consensus sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

It appears that this could also occur in the &#x02212;10 region of the promoter because some of the proposed &#x02212;10 regions in some of the analyzed genes have relatively poor &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> recognition sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Transcription plasticity in central carbon metabolic genes and operons could allow differential expression of these genes by &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> subunits</title><p>Transcription plasticity, defined here as the capacity of a gene or an operon to be transcribed by more than one sigma subunit, could be present in all the analyzed genes and operons. This capability could allow differential expression of those genes by the two sigma subunits. Accordingly, in several cases the strength of a specific promoter in one gene was diverse in the various strains with different genetic backgrounds and in different metabolic conditions. Importantly, most of these different sigma possible recognition sites described in this report that could allow transcription plasticity, are superimposed as putative dual promoters. Therefore, transcription plasticity could be present not only at the gene level, but also at the promoter level. Thus, RNAp with different &#x003c3; factors holoenzymes could perform transcription, depending on the metabolic conditions and as suggested in this report, as an adaptation response to carbon limitation in cells lacking PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> growing slowly on glucose in which as mentioned, due to the absence of PTS, higher levels of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Ueguchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Certainly, other factors such as DksA and Crl, modulate the binding capacities of the different sigma subunits to the RNA polymerase core and also transacting transcriptional regulators such as Fis, IHF and H-NS contribute to promoter plasticity and selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Typas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Lengeler1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Grainger1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Wade1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results suggest that the cells can modulate the expression of different promoters in the same gene by allowing the preferential utilization of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> over &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> for transcription in cells growing in non optimal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Grainger1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement, the presence of both &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> putative dependent promoters in all genes and operons of the glycolytic pathway studied and in other important central metabolism genes such as <italic>poxB</italic> and <italic>acs</italic>, could allow the transcription of these central metabolic genes by the cells in both high (optimal) and low (starvation) glucose growing conditions. As mentioned earlier in most cases promoter plasticity could be achieved by selecting superimposed dual promoter sequences for both &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and in other cases, not superimposed promoters could be selected. In the first instance, the cell could have selected this type of superimposed promoters to ensure that transcription initiation is the same in different metabolic conditions; whereas transcription initiation from different promoters could allow a differential postranscriptional regulation. As an example of this case, a new putative dual promoter apparently appeared in the <italic>pykF</italic> gene in cells lacking PTS. This promoter is preferentially used in these strains in this metabolic node where carbon flux is increased due to the absence of PTS. Importantly, most glycolytic genes are upregulated in PB12 as compared to PB11 as the result of the selection process. As proposed, at least in some of these upregulated genes (<italic>glk</italic>, <italic>gapA</italic>, <italic>tpiA</italic>, <italic>pykA</italic>) in PB12, higher transcription could be the result of the differential utilization of &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>.

When wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> grows fast aerobically on glucose, such as strain JM101, Cra whose DNA binding activity is modulated by sugar catabolites (fructose-1-P and fructose-1-6P), does not significantly repress glycolytic genes.

These results can be explained by the fact that sugar catabolites present at higher concentrations when growing rapidly on glucose, bind to Cra and displace it from the operator sites in target genes. However, in gluconeogenic conditions these sugar catabolites are present in relatively lower concentrations thus allowing Cra to repress glycolytic and activate gluconeogenic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Bledig1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Saier2">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Perrenoud1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nevertheless, downregulation of these genes may be due in part to Cra repression; however, <italic>pykF</italic> and <italic>epd-pgk-fbaA</italic> transcription in both PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains was only slightly downregulated as compared to JM101, suggesting, a minor role of Cra in the expression of these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Saier2">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Perrenoud1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref> in the tested conditions.

In fact, the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways work simultaneously in PTS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains that grow slowly on glucose. The apparent absence of regulation at the level of transcription of most glycolytic genes involved in the transformation of glucose-6P into pyruvate, except the ones mentioned above, may indicate that the modulation of the expression of the genes coding for this critical reversible pathway is being performed by a different strategy. Apparently, <italic>E. coli</italic> could have selected a less transcriptional regulated glycolytic pathway at least in the initial part of the pathway, in which typical repressors or activators are less involved, in order to allow permanent transcription of the genes involved in these reactions in different metabolic conditions.

These results support the metabolic carbon flux diversion proposed at the pyruvate node. In conclusion, <italic>E. coli</italic> has two alternative routes to produce AcCoA from pyruvate that are differentially utilized in distinct growing conditions.</p><p>Diversion of metabolic flux from Pdh to PoxB is also apparently involved in decreasing oxidative stress during glucose metabolism in non growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells under aerobic phosphate starvation conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Moreau1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact in PB11, <italic>soxS</italic> is upregulated as compared to JM101 (unpublished results). Therefore, it appears that this carbon flux diversion is a more general strategy to deal with different stress conditions including slow growth on glucose. We emphasize that &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> is directly involved during growth on non optimal conditions, in two aspects: 1) in the regulation, possibly by transcription of the <italic>pdhR</italic> gene whose product decrease the expression of the Pdh operon in the absence of pyruvate, and, 2) in the transcription that allows upregulation of <italic>poxB</italic>, which allowed carbon flux diversion, during carbon limitation, from Pdh to PoxB. This metabolic adaptation may allow cells growing slowly on glucose the possibility of preserving carbon atoms by reducing CO<sub>2</sub> production at the TCA, probably by recycling higher amounts of AcCoA into the glyoxalate shunt and the gluconeogenic pathways for carbon preservation purposes. Remarkably, strong superimposed &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>38</sup> putative dual promoters were also located in the <italic>poxB</italic> and <italic>acs</italic> genes that code for the enzymes that perform this important &#x0201c;Pox-Acs-shunt&#x0201d; involved in the transformation of pyruvate into acetate, with concomitant generation of reducing power at the membrane and the recycling and incorporation of acetate into AcCoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g001">figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Ferenci1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Hua1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Flores5">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Wise1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Sigala1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Moreau1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007466-Wolfe1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Comments on the differential expression of some of these genes in the evolved strain PB12 as compared to PB11</title><p>During the selection process performed to isolate PB12, several mutations occurred and one (or more) of them allowed the upregulation of glycolytic genes that permitted faster growth on glucose (3, 11, unpublished results).

As can be seen in several panels, the same TSSs were obtained from different strains. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g002">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007466-g004">4</xref> show the proposed and reported promoters for each one of the detected TSSs.</p><p>(7.58 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007466.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007466.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Detailed experimental strategy and complete set of results of in vitro transcription with purified E-sigma38 or E-sigma70. a; schematic representation of the promoter and terminator regions of the pSR plasmid used for in vitro transcription. This figure presents the way DNA fragments carrying each specific promoter region were cloned in plasmid pSR as EcoRI-HindIII fragments. As an example the nucleotide sequence of the EcoRI-HindIII fragment carrying the poxB promoter region, inserted into pSR, is presented. This vector has a rho-independent terminator, depicted in its stem and loop structure, such that the transcripts terminate at 88 nucleotides from the HindIII site marked by an asterisk. In the case of the poxB gene an RNA transcript of 88 nucleotides plus the size of the transcript from the &#x0002b;1(G) to the HindIII site (62 nucleotides), resulted in a transcript of 150 nucleotides (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s002">figure S2h</xref>). b; nucleotide sequence of the pgi promoter region inserted into pSR.

Chromosomal DNA regions were constructed carrying these promoters of the selected genes together with the first 20 bp of the structural gene. Nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides that were utilized for amplifying the selected specific DNA fragments are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007466.s004">table S1</xref>. Each experiment utilized one forward (Fw) and one reverse (Rv) fragments to produce the PCR amplified products. Selected amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the SmaI site of plasmid pKK238; this site is in front of the cat reporter gene of this plasmid. The sizes of recombinant molecules in the inserts, were assayed by digesting plasmids with PstI. As can be seen in the gel, we were able to clone all the &#x0201c;promoter or dual promoters closest to the ATG initiation codon&#x0201d; of the analyzed genes. DNA fragments carrying these promoters: pgiP1-P2 (PCR size of 171 bp and 1127 bp after PstI digestion, respectively), pfkAP3-P4 (140 and 1096), tpiAP1-P2 (117 and 1073), enoP4-P5 (105 and 1064), and pgkP2 (108 and 1064), are presented in the figure and in the gel. The agarose gel exhibits PstI digested DNA from the different recombination molecules, including the vector digested with the same enzyme that generates a band of 953 bp (column B). All cloned DNA fragments had higher molecular weights than 953 bp after PstI digestion, indicating that the insert is present. The gel also includes molecular weight markers (column A).
