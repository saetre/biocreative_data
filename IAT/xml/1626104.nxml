Pathogens modulate host cell apoptosis to establish a successful infection. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Chlamydia trachomatis</named-content> (Ctr) are obligate intracellular bacteria that are shown to be a major causative of sexually transmitted diseases in humans. Here the authors unveil the molecular mechanisms behind resistance to apoptosis in the infected cells. They suggest that Ctr-mediated apoptosis resistance requires a special group of proteins called inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP). IAPs block the very last step in the apoptotic pathway by preventing the activation of effector proteases (caspases) responsible for killing the cells. Although Ctr infection leads to the up-regulation of one of the IAPs, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP)-2, X-linked IAP (XIAP), and cIAP-1 are still required to maintain apoptosis resistance. These data suggested that IAPs work in unison to modulate cell survival. In addition, the authors identified that IAP proteins are constitutively organized into heteromeric complexes in tumor cells to modulate their stability and cell survival. In particular, the authors detected that cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP exist in a high-molecular-weight &#x0201c;IAPosome&#x0201d; complex, which interacts with caspases to resist apoptosis.

The study of cell culture models has gained more insights into possible principles of infection-induced apoptosis inhibition, which might also be relevant in vivo. One of these findings is that infection of host cells by obligate intracellular bacteria like <named-content content-type="genus-species">Rickettsia rickettsii</named-content> might initially start the intrinsic cell death program but is then counteracted by bacteria-induced antiapoptotic nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAPs) constitute an important class of apoptosis regulators functioning at the level of caspases. The prototype IAP contains a baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) and the RING domain. The BIR domains are essential for the antiapoptotic function of IAPs and are involved in the direct binding to caspases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Some of the IAPs have been shown to contain ubiquitin transferase activity, which is associated with the C-terminal RING domain of these proteins. However, not all of the eight human IAP members identified so far contain a RING domain and their potency to prevent apoptosis also differs significantly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, the mechanisms underlying IAP regulation are still poorly understood.</p><p>Here we show that inhibition of apoptosis in cells infected with Ctr depends on cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP. Infection induced the up-regulation of cIAP-2, and the recruitment and stabilization of other IAPs leading to apoptosis resistance. Apart from cIAP-2 silencing, blocking the expression of cIAP-1 and XIAP also sensitized Ctr-infected cells to apoptosis induced by TNF receptor. In addition, depletion of IAPs affected the stability of other IAPs. We have detected that IAPs are constitutively organized in several heteromeric complexes and function in concert in regulating the stability of each other and the survival of the cell. In particular, we have detected cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP in a constitutive high-molecular-weight complex of around 400 kDa at endogenous levels in the HeLa cell cytosol, suggesting the presence of a constitutive IAP-IAP complex and revealing a thus far undiscovered mechanism of IAP regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Processing of Caspase-3 Is Blocked in Infected Cells</title><p><italic>Chlamydia-</italic>infected cells exhibit an extensive resistance to various stimuli of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

Rajalingam, and T. Rudel, unpublished data), suggesting that TNF-induced apoptosis is independent of these mitochondrial effectors. To unravel the molecular basis for resistance of infected cells for TNF-induced apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, the activation of caspases was investigated in detail. Caspase-3 is cleaved at aspartic acid residue D175 generating the small subunit and the p19 N-terminal fragment containing the prodomain. The prodomain is then cleaved autocatalytically to generate the p17 fragment indicative of fully active caspase-3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Standard caspase-3 blots revealed that activation of caspases is blocked at the level of caspase-3 as the processing of the p19 fragment of caspase-3 to the active p17 fragment is ablated in the infected cells treated with TNF and cycloheximide (CHX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). However, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection did not block the activation of caspase-8 as the full-length caspase is processed into the mature p18 fragment and the caspase-8 substrate BID is similarly processed in the control and in the infected cells treated with TNF/CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In addition, we made use of Biotin-VAD-fmk to detect active caspases present in treated and infected cells. Biotin-VAD-fmk binds to active caspase dimers in an irreversible manner and facilitates their precipitation using streptavidin resin. Infected and noninfected HeLa cells were treated with TNF/CHX and active caspases were precipitated with Biotin-VAD-fmk. To avoid the nonspecific degradation of host cell proteins observed in lysates of infected cells (unpublished data), a special protocol for sample preparation was used (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>) and the amount of caspases in lysates of infected cells was always controlled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">1</xref>D). Precipitates were then separated and tested by immunoblot analysis for the presence of active caspase-8 and caspase-3. Initiator caspase-8 was present in reduced amounts in the precipitate of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), suggesting only a partial activation in infected cells. The partial activation of caspase-8 was verified by a second assay that exploits the activation-dependent binding of fluorescently labeled substrates which can then be quantified under a fluorescent microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">Figures 1</xref>E and S1; for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). Consistent with the previous observations, caspase-3 was not detected in biotin-VAD-fmk precipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), suggesting that effector caspase-3 downstream of caspase-8 is not activated in infected cells. Further, to evaluate the effects of infection time and apoptosis induction time on chlamydial inhibition of caspase-3, activation time-course experiments were performed. These analyses revealed that the appearance of the active p17 fragment of caspase-3 decreased with time postinfection irrespective of the time of apoptosis induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). As expected, caspase-8 processing was not altered at later time points postinfection, suggesting that caspase-8 is activated in the infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g001">Figure 1</xref>G).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Transcriptional and Posttranscriptional Regulation of IAPs in Infected Cells</title><p>The lack of active effector caspase-3 in infected cells indicated that Ctr infection may prevent caspase activation by IAPs, which inhibit caspases by direct binding and/or the induction of their proteasomal degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. To test whether chlamydial infection may cause increased expression of inhibitors of apoptosis, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was established for mRNA quantification of the IAPs. mRNAs of neither <italic>cIAP-1</italic> and <italic>XIAP</italic> nor <italic>survivin</italic> were significantly increased in cells infected with Ctr at 24 h postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g002">Figure 2</xref>A)<italic>.</italic> Only the mRNA level of cIAP-2 was increased 6- to 8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The expression of IAPs was also monitored by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The levels of cIAP-2 and, unexpectedly, that of survivin were clearly increased in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Moreover, time-course experiments over 48 h revealed a steady increase in cIAP-2 and survivin protein levels in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Since survivin has been shown to play a role in cell cycle control, up-regulation of survivin could depend on the cell cycle status of infected cells. FACS analysis, however, revealed no such difference between infected and noninfected cells (unpublished data). These data suggested that IAP expression is controlled by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>IAPs Are Required for Infection-Induced Apoptosis Resistance</title><p>To test if IAPs are required for the inhibition of apoptosis in infected HeLa cells, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed to specifically interfere with IAP expression. Silencing of the <italic>cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP,</italic> and <italic>survivin</italic> genes was tested by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). Functional siRNAs were then transfected, and infected and treated cells were analyzed. Interestingly, interfering with cIAP-2 expression sensitized infected cells to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g003">Figure 3</xref>) as revealed by TUNEL analysis. We therefore analyzed whether suppression of cIAP-2 expression influenced the activation of effector caspases. The generation of the caspase-3 p17 fragment was reduced by 57.8&#x00025; in infected treated cells compared to treated cells as was analyzed by densitometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) suggesting that the processing of the caspase-3 p19 fragment to the p17 fragment is controlled by cIAP-2. This assumption is in agreement with only 28.8&#x00025; reduction of the p17 fragment in infected treated cells versus treated cells in which cIAP-2 expression was reduced by siRNA transfection to the level of noninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), demonstrating a 50.17&#x00025; rescue of p19 to p17 processing by cIAP-2 silencing.</p><p>When the expression of cIAP-1 and XIAP was suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi), the infected cells were sensitized to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis despite the up-regulation of cIAP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). To confirm these unexpected results, the same experiment was repeated with a second set of siRNAs to rule out unspecific off-target effects of the first set of siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). It is important to note that irrespective of the cell type and multiplicity of infection (MOI) used, sensitization depended on the size of the inclusions. Cells carrying very large inclusions were resistant to sensitization, suggesting different mechanisms of apoptosis inhibition during the early and late phases of infection, respectively (unpublished data). Sensitization did not correlate with the infection-induced changes in the expression levels of IAPs since the transfection of siRNA directed against <italic>survivin</italic> completely prevented the strong up-regulation but had no sensitizing effect on TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). These results suggested that multi-BIR&#x02013;containing IAPs are involved in apoptosis resistance of cells infected with Ctr.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>IAPs Interact with Each Other</title><p>A possible explanation for the sensitization of infected cells to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis by silencing of <italic>cIAP-1, cIAP-2, </italic>or <italic>XIAP</italic> was that all IAPs whose ablation sensitized infected cells are organized in functional complexes. Therefore, we attempted to isolate endogenous IAP complexes from control and apoptotic cells. When we precipitated cIAP-2, XIAP was coprecipitated and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), suggesting the interaction of cIAP-2 and XIAP in a complex in these cells. The amount of these IAPs was reduced in apoptotic cells probably due to cleavage or degradation during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Since silencing of cIAP-1 also sensitized infected cells to apoptosis, we investigated whether cIAP-1 was present in the cIAP-2&#x02013;XIAP complex. cIAP-1 was detected in the cIAP-2&#x02013;XIAP precipitates by immunoblot analysis (unpublished data) and immunoprecipitates of cIAP-1 contained cIAP-2 and XIAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), confirming cIAP-1 as part of the cIAP-2&#x02013;XIAP complex. Consistent with our sensitization data, we could not detect survivin in the cIAP-2 and XIAP immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B). These data also suggested that the antibodies we used to immunoprecipitate IAPs did not exhibit cross-reactivity with all BIR domain&#x02013;containing proteins. Active caspase-3 was detected in all IAP complexes precipitated from apoptotic cells, indicating a role of these IAPs in the activation of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). These data suggested that the &#x0201c;sensitizing&#x0201d; IAPs interact with each other either directly or indirectly in a single or multiple complexes to modulate cell survival. Interestingly, increasing amounts of XIAP coprecipitated with endogenous cIAP-2 from infected cells compared to noninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Since XIAP is not up-regulated in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g002">2</xref>B), coprecipitation of XIAP and cIAP-2 indicated that both were recruited to the same complex. Thus, the infection-induced increase in cIAP-2 levels may initiate the recruitment of the strong caspases inhibitor XIAP to a complex regulating caspase-3 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>IAPs Are Organized in Large Heteromeric Complexes</title><p>To prove the existence of native IAP-IAP complexes, we isolated the cytosol of HeLa cells by subcellular fractionation and separated the proteins by gel filtration. cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP were found together in fractions containing protein complexes of around 400 kDa, and the fractions representing the monomeric forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). While low amounts of cIAP-2, XIAP, and cIAP-1 were also present in several of the high-molecular-weight fractions, survivin was mainly detected in the low-molecular-weight fraction reflecting the monomeric size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Similar high-molecular-weight IAP-IAP complexes could also be detected in the cytosol of HecIB cells and Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg005">S5</xref>A). To check if the 400-kDa complex is disrupted during apoptosis, gel filtration experiments were performed with HeLa and Jurkat cells induced to apoptosis with TNF/CHX and anti-CD95 antibody, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figures 4</xref>E and S5B). Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and S3), only low amounts of IAPs were detected in the fractions from apoptotic cells, suggesting that IAPs are possibly cleaved or degraded during cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figures 4</xref>E and S5B). However, we have also detected a small amount of cIAP-1 in a high-molecular-weight fraction of around 850 kDa in HeLa cell fractions, suggesting that cIAP-1 is possibly recruited to a different complex during apoptosis. It was already known that Smac binds to IAPs and inactivates them during apoptosis. To investigate if the interaction of Smac with the IAP-IAP complex occurs during apoptosis, we probed the same blots for Smac. Interestingly, Smac was detected in all the IAP-containing fractions of high but not of low molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figures 4</xref>E and S5B), suggesting an interaction and a possible inactivation of these IAP complexes by Smac during apoptosis. Similar results were obtained when these cells were induced to apoptosis with cisplatin (unpublished data). Consistent with a role of the heteromeric IAP complex for the activation of caspases, caspase-3 copurified with the Smac-enriched fractions in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figures 4</xref>E and S5B). This, and the exclusive presence of Smac and active caspase-3 in the high-molecular-weight fractions, may suggest that a heteromer rather than a monomer is probably the functional IAP unit. Taken together, these data confirmed that &#x0201c;sensitizing&#x0201d; IAPs are organized in heteromeric complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>IAPs Stabilize Each Other</title><p>In addition to transcriptional regulation, IAP stability is posttranslationally controlled by phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. As we have detected IAP-IAP complexes at endogenous levels in these cells, we tested if loss of individual IAPs influences the stability of other IAPs. siRNAs were transfected in HeLa cells and the amount of IAPs was measured by immunoblot analysis. The specificity of the different siRNAs, e.g., the lack of any cross-inhibition on other IAPs, was confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). To avoid potential unspecific degradation of host proteins by chlamydial proteases during lysis, infected cells were resuspended in gel loading buffer on ice followed by boiling. This procedure preserved host proteins of lysed infected cells and was used in all experiments. Surprisingly, silencing of XIAP expression had a pronounced effect on the amount of up-regulated cIAP-2 and survivin in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Down-regulation of cIAP-2 led to a mild reduction of cIAP-1 and survivin but had no influence on XIAP levels. However, suppression of cIAP-1 expression had no negative effect on cIAP-2 or XIAP, and repression of survivin by RNAi did not alter cIAP-1, cIAP-2, or XIAP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g005">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that some of the &#x0201c;sensitizing&#x0201d; IAPs exert a stabilizing activity on other IAPs. All these data suggested that IAPs can influence the stability of each other.</p><p>Among the &#x0201c;sensitizing&#x0201d; IAPs, the most evident observation was the regulation of IAP-2 stability by XIAP. To understand the possible mechanisms, we have established the permanent silencing of XIAP by lentiviral transfer of shRNA (shXIAP) into HeLa cells. Chlamydial infection induced the up-regulation of cIAP-2 mRNA levels in vector control and shXIAP-transduced cells (unpublished data). To check if the loss of XIAP disrupts the formation of the IAP-IAP complex, we performed gel filtration experiments with the cytosol of XIAP-silenced cells. Immnunoblot analysis revealed that cIAP-1 and most of the cIAP-2 were no longer detected in the 400-kDa fractions of XIAP-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, a portion of cIAP-2 was consistently present in the high-molecular-weight fraction of around 1 to 1.5 MDa, suggesting that cIAP-2 is recruited to a different complex in the absence of XIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g004">Figure 4</xref>). As cIAP-2 has an inherent destructive capability by autoubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, we checked if the loss of the infection-induced up-regulated fraction of cIAP-2 can be rescued by pretreatment of these cells with proteasome inhibitors. As expected, infection of the control (empty vector-carrying) cells leads to an increase in cIAP-2 protein levels. Consistent with the previous observations, we could not detect the up-regulated fraction of cIAP-2 in the infected cells expressing shXIAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg007">Figure S7</xref>A). When the cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors, the up-regulated fraction of cIAP-2 was indeed rescued in the infected XIAP-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg007">Figure S7</xref>A). Since proteins are degraded not only in the proteasomes but also in the lysosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, we checked if the turnover of cIAP-2 protein levels in these cells is also influenced by the degradation by lysosomes. Surprisingly, pretreatment of cells with the lysosomal H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin also inhibited the degradation of cIAP-2 in the control and XIAP-silenced cells in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg007">Figure S7</xref>A), suggesting that the degradation of cIAP-2 in these cells is mediated by both proteasomes and lysosmes. To investigate whether cIAP-2 overexpressed by transfection of a eukaryotic expression vector behaves similarly to cIAP-2 up-regulated during infection, cIAP-2 was transfected into XIAP-silenced cells and treated with proteasome and lysosome inhibitors. The inhibitors failed to prominently increase the amounts of cIAP-2 in transfected control and XIAP-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg007">Figure S7</xref>B). Interestingly, cIAP-2 transfected control cells contained reduced amounts of XIAP, which was partially rescued by proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg007">Figure S7</xref>B). These data showed that, different than in infection-induced up-regulation, overexpression of transfected cIAP-2 could not be rescued by either proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors but rather caused the proteasomal degradation of endogenous XIAP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many obligate intracellular bacteria have been shown to actively inhibit apoptosis in their host. However, functional data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptosis block in infected cells are rare. We show here that the activity and stability of IAPs are regulated by chlamydial infection causing resistance to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate here the existence of large heteromeric native IAP complexes involved in the control of caspase activation.</p><p>HeLa cells infected with Ctr resisted TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis in an IAP-dependent fashion. A possible explanation for the marked apoptosis resistance observed in infected cells was therefore the infection-induced up-regulation of cIAP-2 specifically blocking the activation of effector caspase-3. Although cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 are also part of the TNF-receptor complex potentially modulating the activity of caspase-8 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, a direct inhibition of caspase-8 activity by IAPs has not been demonstrated yet. We found the levels of active caspase-8 slightly reduced in infected cells. The caspase-8 substrate BID was, however, cleaved as efficiently as in noninfected cells, suggesting the effector caspases as major targets for apoptosis inhibition by IAPs. We have detected increased amounts of coprecipitating XIAP in the cIAP-2 immunoprecipitates from the infected cells. Since XIAP has been found to tether mature caspase-3 to the apoptosome and release of caspase-3 required the XIAP-antagonizing protein Smac &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, the IAP complex formed in cells infected with Ctr may thus favor the association of IAPs and recruitment of caspase-3 in a way refractory to activation. Consistent with this, neither cytochrome <italic>c</italic> nor Smac is released from the mitochondria of infected cells (unpublished data), although BID is similarly processed in the infected and control cells treated with TNF/CHX, suggesting that chlamydial infection employs multiple strategies to resist host cell apoptosis.</p><p>Mammalian IAPs have been reported to form homodimers and heterodimers, which raises the possibility that they can cross-regulate each other. It was shown that cIAP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells have increased levels of cIAP-2 protein consistent with the down-regulation of cIAP-2 by cIAP-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Silke et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrated a direct interaction of XIAP with overexpressed cIAP-1 via their RING domains to modulate the stability of XIAP in melanoma cells. In addition, it was shown that in response to cell death stimuli, survivin associated with XIAP via the BIR domain to promote the stability of XIAP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Apoptosis resistance of infected cells required cIAP-2 up-regulation but also XIAP and cIAP-1, as depletion of the latter two sensitizes the cells to apoptosis despite cIAP-2 up-regulation. The most likely explanation was therefore that all these IAPs are organized in a functional complex. We could indeed confirm the direct association of cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP in these cells by immunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments, suggesting that they function in unison to modulate the activation of caspases in vivo. We found no effect of survivin on apoptosis of infected cells, although survivin-depleted cells underwent mitotic catastrophe and formed giant cells (unpublished data) as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that the depletion by RNAi was effective. Consistent with this, although survivin is stabilized in the infected cells, loss of survivin did not influence the resistance of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells to cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).</p><p>By applying gel filtration assays,we could demonstrate the existence of a high-molecular-weight heteromeric complex in the range of 400 kDa containing cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP. However, we have also detected IAPs in other high-molecular-fractions, suggesting the existence of several IAP-containing complexes. In support of our sensitization data, we could not detect survivin in the IAP-containing high-molecular-weight fractions.</p><p>Since depletion of XIAP by siRNAs affected the stability of cIAP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), we asked whether loss of XIAP led to disintegration of IAP complexes. Gel filtration experiments with XIAP-silenced cells revealed that this is indeed the case as cIAP-1 was detected only in the monomeric fractions. However, apart from the monomeric fractions and trace amounts in the 400-kDa fractions, a significant portion of cIAP-2 was also found in a high-molecular-weight fraction of around 1 MDa, which may reflect the recruitment to a different complex possibly involved in the fate of cIAP-2 under these conditions. These results are in contrast to what was reported from XIAP knockout MEFs which contained larger amounts of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 than wild-type MEFs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Besides species-specific differences, it may also reflect differences between the knockdown and knockout conditions.</p><p>If IAPs are organized into stable complexes, what is their role during apoptosis? Several studies have demonstrated that all the IAPs can bind to caspases directly to inhibit cell death. However, we found a direct role only for cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP in maintaining apoptosis resistance under these conditions. Silencing any one of the IAPs removes the blockade in the processing of caspase-3 to the active p17 fragment in response to TNF/CHX in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020114-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and unpublished data). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that a heteromeric IAP-IAP complex is more potent to block caspases than individual IAPs in vivo.</p><p>As we have detected IAPs in heteromeric complexes, we addressed the question if Smac directly associates with these complexes during apoptosis. Interestingly, gel filtration experiments with apoptotic cells revealed the presence of Smac and active caspase-3 in all the IAP-containing high-molecular-weight fractions, irrespective of the apoptosis inducer, suggesting that Smac indeed binds and inactivates IAP-IAP complexes in vivo to induce effector caspase activation and cell death.</p><p>The role of ubiquitination in sorting the proteins for proteasomes and lysosomes is well established. While polyubiquitination of substrates frequently leads to the degradation of proteins by the proteasome, monoubiquitination or multimonoubiquitination (one ubiquitin on several lysine residues within the substrates) could target the substrate for a different subcellular compartment like the lysosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we revealed that cIAP-2 levels in the infected cells are regulated by both lysosomes and proteasomes. Treatment of the cells with proteasome and, surprisingly, with lysosomal inhibitors could rescue cIAP-2 in control and XIAP-silenced cells suggesting different ubiquitin modifications in cIAP-2. However, when we overexpressed cIAP-2 by transfection of expression constructs, we could not rescue XIAP, in the presence of neither MG132 nor Bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg007">Figure S7</xref>B). Consistent with results described by Silke et al. (2005), overexpression of cIAP-2 by transfection caused the degradation of endogenous XIAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020114-sg007">Figure S7</xref>B). Because we did not observe degradation of XIAP in infected cells with high cIAP-2 levels, it suggests that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection interferes with this process, or that NF-&#x003ba;B targets other factors, which influence relative stabilities of IAPs. Loss of cIAP-1 has also been described to result in the increase of cIAP-2 but not XIAP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020114-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. While we did not observe these effects in our siRNA experiments, it appears that a general theme of posttranscriptional regulation by IAPs among themselves is emerging.</p><p>We are currently investigating the effect of overexpressed IAPs on the native IAP complexes demonstrated here. Taken together, our data of a constitutive &#x0201c;IAPosome,&#x0201d; where IAPs positively affect the stability of other IAPs important for their apoptosis-inhibiting activity, are a new aspect of how these proteins function.
