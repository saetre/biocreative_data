We show here that c-Fos accumulation within the extraction-resistant nuclear fraction (ERNF) and its interaction with lamin A are reduced and enhanced by gain-of and loss-of ERK1/2 activity, respectively. Moreover, hindering ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of c-Fos attenuates its release from the ERNF induced by serum and promotes its interaction with lamin A. Accordingly, serum stimulation rapidly releases preexisting c-Fos from the NE via ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation, leading to a fast activation of AP-1 before de novo c-Fos synthesis. Moreover, lamin A&#x02013;null cells exhibit increased AP-1 activity and reduced levels of c-Fos phosphorylation. We also find that active ERK1/2 interacts with lamin A and colocalizes with c-Fos and A-type lamins at the NE. Thus, NE-bound ERK1/2 functions as a molecular switch for rapid mitogen-dependent AP-1 activation through phosphorylation-induced release of preexisting c-Fos from its inhibitory interaction with lamin A/C.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AP-1, activator protein 1; c-Fos, cellular homologue of the Finkel-Biskis-Jinkins osteosarcoma virus gene; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ERNF, extraction-resistant nuclear fraction; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; NE, nuclear envelope; pERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; SNF, soluble nuclear fraction.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>c-Fos is a member of the dimeric activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor family that regulates key cellular processes, including cell proliferation, death, survival differentiation, and oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shaulian and Karin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>). <italic>c-fos</italic> is an &#x0201c;early response&#x0201d; gene that undergoes rapid transcriptional activation in response to multiple pathophysiological stimuli (e.g., growth factors, chemical and physical stress, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shaulian and Karin, 2002</xref>). Fine regulation of c-Fos activity is achieved via its interaction with regulatory proteins that can either enhance or inhibit AP-1 activity, and through posttranslational processing of preexisting or newly synthesized c-Fos protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piechaczyk and Blanchard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shaulian and Karin, 2002</xref>). For example, c-Fos can be phosphorylated by protein kinases C and A, cdc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abate et al., 1991</xref>), FRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng and Karin, 1994</xref>), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 7 (ERK7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abe et al., 1999</xref>), and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monje et al., 2003</xref>) and p38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanos et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, c-Fos transcriptional activity is modulated through reversible phosphorylation by some of these kinases, including ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter and Karin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hill and Treisman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monje et al., 2003</xref>). Phosphorylation of c-Fos by ERK1 and RSK occurs soon after serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1996</xref>). Moreover, a docking site for ERK in c-Fos facilitates its sequential phosphorylation in multiple C-terminal sites upon prolonged ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>). The binding of growth factors, differentiation stimuli, and cytokines to cell surface receptors promotes the activation of the small GTPase Ras and dual phosphorylation (activation) of ERKs. Active ERK1 and ERK2 translocate into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate several transcriptional regulators (e.g., c-Fos) that cause a rapid induction of immediate early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharrocks, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In addition to fulfilling structural functions at the nuclear envelope (NE), A-type lamins (lamin A and C) play important roles in the control of gene expression via their interaction with histones, transcription factors (e.g., SREBP1, MOK2, BAF, GCL, Mel18, and c-Fos), and cell cycle regulators (e.g., the retinoblastoma protein [pRb] and cyclin D3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taniura et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruenbaum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mariappan and Parnaik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heessen and Fornerod, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vlcek and Foisner, 2007</xref>). We have recently shown that lamin A/C&#x02013;dependent sequestration of c-Fos at the NE reduces AP-1 DNA-binding activity and cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivorra et al., 2006</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms controlling this interaction remain unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that ERK1/2 is a critical regulator of the interaction between lamin A/C and c-Fos. We show that active ERK1/2 directly interacts with lamin A and colocalizes with c-Fos at the NE. Therein, mitogen-induced ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of c-Fos releases it from the inhibitory interaction with lamin A/C before de novo synthesis of c-Fos, thus allowing a rapid induction of AP-1 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>c-Fos accumulation at the extraction-resistant nuclear fraction is regulated by lamin A/C expression and the level of c-Fos phosphorylation</title><p>We first examined by Western blot the consequences of altering lamin A/C expression on the amount of c-Fos within the soluble nuclear fraction (SNF) and extraction-resistant nuclear fraction (ERNF) of cultured cells. Lamin A/C&#x02013;null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited decreased ERNF-associated and increased SNF-associated level of c-Fos compared with wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and ectopically expressed CFP-Lamin A increased the presence of both endogenous c-Fos and recombinant YFP&#x02013;c-Fos within the ERNF of HEK293 and COS7 cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Consistent with our previous confocal microscopy studies in MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivorra et al., 2006</xref>), CFP-lamin A overexpression in NIH-3T3 and COS7 cells recruited YFP&#x02013;c-Fos to the perinuclear rim (unpublished data). These results demonstrated that c-Fos accumulation at the NE and ERNF is dependent on lamin A/C expression.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Hypophosphorylated c-Fos preferentially accumulates in the ERNF.</bold> Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts and subcellular fractions.

Although two main species of c-Fos with different electrophoretic mobilities were detected in the SNF of NIH-3T3 cells restimulated with serum after a period of starvation, the faster migrating band predominated in the ERNF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Incubation of the SNF with alkaline phosphatase increased c-Fos mobility (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lane 1 vs. 2), but this change was not seen in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the SNF of serum-stimulated cells accumulates hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated c-Fos, whereas the ERNF predominantly accumulates the hypophosphorylated form of c-Fos. These results suggested that mitogen-dependent phosphorylation of c-Fos facilitates its release from the NE.</p><p>We then focused our attention on ERK1/2-dependent signaling, the main transduction pathway implicated in the rapid and transient phosphorylation and subsequent activation of c-Fos elicited by mitogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monje et al. 2003</xref>). As expected, Western blot analysis of the SNF of NIH-3T3 cells revealed the activation (phosphorylation) of ERK1/2 after serum stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Compared with serum-starved cells, the level of c-Fos protein was up-regulated in cultures stimulated for 90 min, which was markedly reduced after 180 min of serum stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Moreover, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abrogated c-Fos down-regulation at 180 min after serum stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lane 5 vs. 3). These findings are in agreement with the concept that mitogen stimulation leads to de novo c-Fos expression, which then undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bossis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2005</xref>). In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monje et al., 2003</xref>), we found that preincubation of serum-starved cells with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 greatly reduces c-Fos level in cells stimulated with serum for 90 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Therefore, to circumvent the possible influence of ERK1/2 inhibitors on c-Fos synthesis and/or degradation, the effects of U0126 and PD98059 on c-Fos expression and subnuclear localization was investigated using the protocol schematized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>. In brief, mitogen-depleted cells were stimulated with serum for 150 min in the presence of MG132 to avoid proteasome-dependent degradation of c-Fos. To prevent further protein synthesis after reaching a high level of c-Fos expression, cycloheximide was added at 90 min. Finally, U0126 or PD98059 was added at 100 min after serum stimulation. In agreement with the results of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, the ERNF and SNF of NIH-3T3 cells manipulated as described above predominantly contained the fastest migrating hypophosphorylated and the two migrating forms of c-Fos, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, ERNF: lanes 1 and 3; SNF: lanes 5 and 7). Treatment with either PD98059 or U0126 inhibited ERK1/2 activation, as revealed by the reduced amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) in the SNF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, PD98059: lane 5 vs. 6; U0126: lane 7 vs. 8), and caused the accumulation of hypophosphorylated c-Fos both in the ERNF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, PD98059: lane 1 vs. 2; U0126: lane 3 vs. 4) and SNF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, PD98059: lane 5 vs. 6; U0126: lane 7 vs. 8). The pattern of expression of Sp1 and nucleoporin-50 &#x0002b; Npap60 (NUP50) suggested the absence of cross-contamination in these studies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The results presented thus far indicated that the amount of c-Fos in the ERNF and perinuclear rim is regulated by the level of lamin A/C expression. They also suggested that inhibition of ERK1/2 activity reduces the extent of c-Fos phosphorylation and promotes its accumulation within the ERNF.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>ERK1/2 inhibition increases the amount of c-Fos associated to the ERNF.</bold> (A) Scheme of the protocol used to study the effects of post-transductional modifications of c-Fos on its accumulation within the ERNF and SNF, and on its interaction with lamin A.

In the present study we provide evidence that disruption of lamin A/C constitutively activates AP-1&#x02013;dependent DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. We also demonstrate that the interaction of c-Fos with lamin A/C is a reversible process controlled by mitogenic stimuli through ERK1/2-dependent signaling. First, we show that mitogen-dependent ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of c-Fos releases it from the inhibitory interaction with lamin A/C, allowing the rapid activation of AP-1 before de novo c-Fos protein synthesis. Second, we demonstrate that phosphorylated (active) ERK1/2 can interact with lamin A/C in vitro and in vivo, and colocalize with c-Fos at the NE. This scaffold role of lamin A/C appears to facilitate the phosphorylation of c-Fos elicited by ERK1/2 in cells stimulated with serum.</p><p>It is generally accepted that mitogen-dependent activation of ERK1/2 in fibroblasts is a biphasic process consisting of a rapid and strong burst of kinase activity peaking at 5&#x02013;15 min, followed by a second wave of lower activity that persists throughout the G1 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kahan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meloche et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meloche, 1995</xref>). c-Fos is expressed minimally in most nongrowing cells as well as during the initial phase of mitogen-induced ERK activation, with a peak of de novo c-Fos protein synthesis and AP-1 activation occurring between 1&#x02013;2 h after stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruijer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerr et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monje et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivorra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy and Blenis, 2006</xref>). In line with this notion, we observed maximum c-Fos protein expression at 60&#x02013;90 min after serum stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>), coinciding with a peak of AP-1 DNA-binding activity that could be attenuated by inhibitors of either protein synthesis or ERK1/2 activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Our novel observation is the induction of AP-1 DNA-binding activity as early as 15 min after serum addition concomitantly with maximum ERK1/2 activity and the release of c-Fos from the ERNF to the nucleoplasm in a manner dependent on ERK1/2 activation but independent of de novo protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Based on these findings and the observations that gain-of and loss-of ERK1/2 activity reduces and enhances, respectively, c-Fos accumulation within the ERNF and its interaction with lamin A, and that regulation of these processes is impaired by hindering ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of c-Fos, we propose the model depicted in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>. In serum-deprived cells, sequestration of c-Fos at the NE via its interaction with lamin A/C limits transcription of AP-1 target genes. Subsequent to mitogen stimulation, lamin A&#x02013;bound active ERK1/2 phosphorylates c-Fos and releases it from the NE, thus allowing the rapid transcriptional activation of AP-1&#x02013;responsive genes before de novo c-Fos protein synthesis. This mechanism permits the continuous existence in the cell of a certain level of inactive c-Fos (e.g., in quiescent cells) that can be rapidly activated by mitogen stimulation via ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation without requiring de novo protein synthesis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for the rapid activation of AP1 upon mitogen stimulation.</bold> In serum-deprived cells, the c-Fos protein is expressed at low level predominantly in a hypophosphorylated state and associated to the NE through its interaction with A-type lamins. Under these conditions, transcription of AP-1 target genes is off. Upon mitogen stimulation, phosphorylated (active) ERK1/2 bound to lamin A/C phosphorylates c-Fos, causing its release from the NE. Hyperphosphorylated nucleoplasmic c-Fos can then heterodimerize with AP-1 family members (e.g., c-Jun), thus allowing the transcriptional activation of AP-1&#x02013;responsive genes before de novo c-Fos synthesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830653f10"></graphic></fig><p>Intracellular compartmentalization through interactions among MAPKs and scaffold proteins plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morrison and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolch, 2005</xref>).

On the other hand, the association between ERKs and structural nuclear proteins, such as kinetochores, may serve anchoring purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shapiro et al., 1998</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, we show here for the first time that A-type lamins function as a nuclear docking platform for EKR1/2, and that NE-bound ERK1/2 contributes to the rapid activation of AP-1 via releasing c-Fos from the interaction with A-type lamins (see above). Indeed, AP-1&#x02013;dependent DNA-binding and transcriptional activity were significantly higher in lamin A/C&#x02013;null versus wild-type MEFs and in U2OS cells in which lamin A/C expression was silenced with miRNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Our results also suggest that the efficiency of serum-inducible activation (phosphorylation) of the small preinduction levels of c-Fos elicited by ERK1/2 is aided by their colocalization at the NE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). We are currently investigating whether ERK1/2&#x02013;lamin A/C complex formation may help prolong the activation state of ERK1/2 by maintaining these signal transducers in a reservoir out of the reach of soluble nuclear phosphatases.
