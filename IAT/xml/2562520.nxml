Errors to any one of these processes can lead to zygotic aneuploidy with the potential for developmental abnormalities. During prophase I of <italic>Drosophila</italic> male meiosis, each bivalent condenses and becomes sequestered into discrete chromosome territories. Here, we demonstrate that two predicted condensin II subunits, Cap-H2 and Cap-D3, are required to promote territory formation. In mutants of either subunit, territory formation fails and chromatin is dispersed throughout the nucleus. Anaphase I is also abnormal in <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutants as chromatin bridges are found between segregating heterologous and homologous chromosomes. Aneuploid sperm may be generated from these defects as they occur at an elevated frequency and are genotypically consistent with anaphase I segregation defects. We propose that condensin II&#x02013;mediated prophase I territory formation prevents and/or resolves heterologous chromosomal associations to alleviate their potential interference in anaphase I segregation. Furthermore, condensin II&#x02013;catalyzed prophase I chromosome condensation may be necessary to resolve associations between paired homologous chromosomes of each bivalent. These persistent chromosome associations likely consist of DNA entanglements, but may be more specific as anaphase I bridging was rescued by mutations in the homolog conjunction factor <italic>teflon</italic>. We propose that the consequence of condensin II mutations is a failure to resolve heterologous and homologous associations mediated by entangled DNA and/or homolog conjunction factors. Furthermore, persistence of homologous and heterologous interchromosomal associations lead to anaphase I chromatin bridging and the generation of aneuploid gametes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Some of the processes that ensure proper chromosome segregation take place upon the chromosomes themselves. The chromosomes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> males undergo an interesting and relatively enigmatic step before entering meiosis, where each paired homologous chromosome becomes clustered into a discrete region of the nucleus. In this article, we provide evidence that improper chromosomal associations are resolved and/or prevented during this &#x0201c;chromosome territory&#x0201d; formation. This was uncovered through the study of flies mutant for <italic>Cap-H2</italic>, which have abnormal territory formation and improper chromosomal associations that persist into segregation. Another important process that chromosomes undergo in meiosis is the pairing and physical linking of maternal and paternal homologs to one another. Linkages between homologs are essential to ensure their proper segregation to daughter cells. In contrast to meiosis in most organisms, linkages between homologs in male <italic>Drosophila</italic> are not recombination mediated. Here, we provide evidence that Cap-H2 may function to remove <italic>Drosophila</italic> male specific linkages between homologous chromosomes prior to anaphase I segregation. When chromosomal associations persist during segregation of <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutants, the chromosomes do not detach from one another and chromatin is bridged between daughter nuclei. The likely outcome of this defect is the production of aneuploid sperm.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are several critical steps that chromosomes must undergo as they transition from their diffuse interphase state to mobile units that can be faithfully transmitted to daughter cells.

The necessity of top2's &#x0201c;decatenation&#x0201d; activity to chromosome individualization becomes clear from fission yeast <italic>top2</italic> mutants and vertebrate cells treated with a top2 inhibitor, where mitotic chromosomes appear associated through DNA threads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Uemura1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-GimenezAbian1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Another step that occurs prior to chromosome segregation is chromosome &#x0201c;condensation,&#x0201d; entailing the longitudinal shortening from the threadlike interphase state into the rod like mitotic chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Swedlow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Condensation is necessary due to the great linear length of interphase chromosomes that would be impossible to completely transmit to daughter cells.</p><p>Because chromosome individualization and condensation appear to occur concurrently, it has been inferred that both are promoted by the same catalytic activity. In support of this idea, the condensin complexes have been implicated in chromosome individualization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Chan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and condensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Hirano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a molecular coupling of both processes. The condensin I and II complexes are thought to be conserved throughout metazoa, each utilizing ATPases SMC2 and SMC4, but carrying different non-SMC subunits Cap-H, Cap-G, Cap-D2 or Cap-H2, Cap-G2, and Cap-D3, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Hirano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Yeong1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, condensin I is known to induce and trap positive supercoils into a circular DNA template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Hagstrom1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Kimura2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

While the effect of condensin mutations or RNAi knockdown on chromosome condensation is variable depending on cell type and organism being studied, in most if not all cases, chromatin bridges are created between chromosomes as they segregate from one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Hirano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This likely represents a general role of the condensin complex in the resolution of chromosomal associations prior to segregation.</p><p>While the second cell division of meiosis is conceptually similar to mitotic divisions where sister chromatids segregate from one another, the faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I requires several unique steps. It is essential for homologous chromosomes to become linked to one another for proper anaphase I segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Li1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and most often this occurs through crossing over to form chiasmata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Carpenter1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. As recombination requires the close juxtaposition of homologous sequences, homologs must first &#x0201c;identify&#x0201d; one another in the nucleus and then gradually become &#x0201c;aligned&#x0201d; in a manner that is DNA homology dependent, but not necessarily dictated by the DNA molecule itself. Eventually, the homologous chromosomes become &#x0201c;paired,&#x0201d; which is defined as the point when intimate and stable associations are established. The paired state is often accompanied by the laying down of a proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex between paired homologous chromosomes, often referred to as &#x0201c;synapsis&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Page1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Gerton1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, the recombination mediated chiasmata can only provide a linkage between homologs in cooperation with sister chromatid cohesion distal to the crossover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Petronczki1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> male meiosis is unconventional in that neither recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Morgan1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> nor synaptonemal complex formation occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Meyer1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, yet homologous chromosomes still faithfully segregate from one another in meiosis I. Two proteins have been identified that act as homolog pairing maintenance factors and may serve as a functional replacement of chiasmata. Mutations to genes encoding these achiasmate conjunction factors, <italic>MNM</italic> and <italic>SNM</italic>, cause homologs to prematurely separate and by metaphase I, they can be observed as univalents that then have random segregation patterns. It is likely that MNM and SNM directly provide conjunction of homologs as both localize to the X&#x02013;Y pairing center (rDNA locus) up until anaphase I and an MNM-GFP fusion parallels this temporal pattern at foci along the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Thomas1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. While MNM and SNM are required for the conjunction of all bivalents, the protein Teflon promotes pairing maintenance specifically for the autosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Arya1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Tomkiel1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggests that Teflon, MNM, and SNM constitute an autosomal homolog pairing maintenance complex.</p><p>A fascinating aspect of <italic>Drosophila</italic> male meiosis is that during prophase I, three discrete clusters of chromatin become sequestered to the periphery of the nuclear envelope's interior. Each of these &#x0201c;chromosome territories&#x0201d; corresponds to one of the major chromosomal bivalents, either the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> or X&#x02013;Y <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Cooper1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Vazquez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. A study of chromosomal associations within each prophase I bivalent demonstrated that the four chromatids begin in close alignment. Later in prophase I, all chromatids seemingly separate from one another, but the bivalent remains intact within the territory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Vazquez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. It has therefore been proposed that chromosome territories may provide stability to bivalent associations through their sequestration into sub-nuclear compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Vazquez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we document that <italic>Drosophila</italic> putative condensin II complex subunits, Cap-H2 and Cap-D3, are necessary for normal territory formation. When they are compromised through mutation, chromatin is seemingly dispersed throughout the nucleus. We propose that the consequence of this defect is failure to individualize chromosomes from one another leading to the introduction and/or persistence of heterologous chromosomal associations into anaphase I. This underscores the role of chromosome territory formation to prevent ectopic chromosomal associations from interfering with anaphase I segregation. Cap-H2 is also necessary to resolve homologous chromosomal associations, that like heterologous associations, may be mediated by DNA entanglements and/or persistent achiasmate conjunction as anaphase I bridging is rescued by <italic>teflon</italic> mutations. This highlights condensin II mediated chromosome individualization/disjunction in meiosis I and its necessity to the creation of haploid gametes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Predicted Condensin II Subunits Cap-H2 and Cap-D3 Are Necessary for Male Fertility</title><p>Faithful chromosome segregation is necessary to organismal viability, therefore it is not surprising that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, homozygous lethal alleles exist in the following condensin subunits: SMC4/gluon, SMC2, Cap-H/barren, and Cap-G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Bhat1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Steffensen1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Dej1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, the reciprocal event of incorrect cosegregation of homologs during meiosis I is one daughter cell completely lacking that particular chromosome. Similarly, nullo sperm can be created from meiosis II defects where sister chromatids cosegregate. To address whether meiotic I and or II segregation defects occur, males in the 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome assays were bred to be heterozygous for the 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome marker <italic>brown</italic> (<italic>bw<sup>1</sup></italic>). If both 2<sup>nd</sup> homologous chromosomes mistakenly cosegregate in meiosis I, then a normal meiosis II will generate diplo-2 sperm that are heterozygous for the paternal male's 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosomes (<italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic>). Additionally, a normal meiosis I followed by a faulty meiosis II where sister chromatids cosegregate would generate diplo-2 sperm homozygous for the paternal male's 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosomes (<italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/bw<sup>1</sup></italic> or &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;). There was a trend toward an elevated level of the <italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> exceptional class from both <italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-0019</sup></italic>/<italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-5163</sup></italic> and <italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-0019</sup></italic>/&#x0002b; males. This suggested meiosis I nondisjunction that possibly occurs even in <italic>Cap-H2</italic> heterozygous males. Furthermore, there may also be a slight increase in meiosis II nondisjunction as the <italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/bw<sup>1</sup></italic> class is elevated in the <italic>Cap-H2 trans</italic>-heterozygous and heterozygous males.</p><p>The <italic>Cap-H2</italic> allelic combination utilized in these genetic nondisjunction assays is likely weak in comparison to others where males are completely sterile. Therefore, the elevated frequency of exceptional progeny from 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome assays relative to the sex and 4<sup>th</sup> may only represent a heightened sensitivity of these chromosomes rather then a role for Cap-H2 specifically in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome segregation. In fact, defects in sex and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome segregation were observed in stronger male sterile <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutants (see below). One possible explanation for a major autosome bias in our nondisjunction assays may be related to the greater amount of DNA estimated for the 2<sup>nd</sup> (60.8 Mb) and 3<sup>rd</sup> (68.8 Mb) relative to the X, Y, and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes (41.8, 40.9, and 4.4 Mb, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Ashburner1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, perhaps larger chromosomes require more overall condensin II function to promote their individualization or condensation and are therefore more sensitive to Cap-H2 dosage. While plausible, if sensitivity to Cap-H2 mutation were purely due to chromosome size, it is difficult to explain why a more significant level of XY nondisjunction did not occur given that they are &#x0223c;70&#x00025; the size of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis involves the fact that 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome conjunction may occur at several sites or along its entire length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-McKee1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas XY bivalent pairing is restricted to intergenic repeats of the rDNA locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-McKee2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-McKee3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that more total DNA is utilized for conjunction of the 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome relative to the sex bivalent. Assuming the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes maintain homolog pairing like the 2<sup>nd</sup>, then the relative amount of DNA utilized in conjunction is as follows: 3<sup>rd</sup>&#x0003e;2<sup>nd</sup>&#x0003e;4<sup>th</sup>&#x0003e;XY. Given that this closely parallels the trend of sensitivity to <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutation in the nondisjunction assays, it suggests that chromosomes which utilize more overall DNA in pairing/pairing maintenance activities require a greater dose of functional Cap-H2 for their proper anaphase I segregation. This points toward a role for Cap-H2 in the regulation of homolog conjunction/disjunction processes. We next addressed this hypothesis through cytological analyses of meiotic chromosome morphology in <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutant backgrounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Cap-H2 Mutants Are Defective in Prophase I Chromosome Territory Formation</title><p>In prophase I stage S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), nuclei appear to commence the formation of chromosome territories.

One is to gather or condense bivalent chromatin into an individual cluster. The second is to sequester each bivalent into a discrete pocket of the nucleus. Condensin II may perform one or both tasks, for example, perhaps chromatin is dispersed throughout the nucleus in the <italic>Cap-H2/Cap-D3</italic> mutants because of faulty condensation.

This stage, referred to as M1 of meiosis I, may be morphologically abnormal in strong <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutants because it was not detected in our studies (n&#x0003e;50 testes). This is likely because these mutants fail to form normal chromosome territories. Proceeding further into meiosis, metaphase I is signified by the congression of the three bivalents into one cluster at the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Although subtle changes to chromosome morphology would not be detectable, it can be concluded that by metaphase I, gross chromosomal condensation occurs at least somewhat normally in <italic>Cap-H2</italic> strong mutant males. This raises the interesting possibility that a gradual prophase I chromosome condensation is catalyzed by condensin II components in the course of chromosomal territory formation and culminates at M1.

Perhaps interphase chromosomes are naturally entangled with one another and the Cap-H2/Cap-D3 mediated nuclear organization steps that occur during territory formation effectively detangle and individualize them into discrete structures.

Heterologous associations involving the 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome may also be entanglements that persist and/or were initiated through failure in territory formation.

These may also be the consequence of associations between heterologous chromosomes that lead to one being dragged to the incorrect pole.

This is a surprising result given that Teflon has been described as a mediator of associations between homologous chromosomes. One plausible explanation is that Teflon can exacerbate heterologous chromosomal associations. This may occur when Teflon establishes autosomal conjunction in a prophase I nucleus where territory formation had failed. Cap-H2 may also antagonize a Teflon mediated autosomal conjunction complex that might mistakenly establish conjunction between heterologs when territories do not form.</p><p>As described above, completely male sterile <italic>Cap-D3</italic> and <italic>Cap-H2</italic> allelic combinations exist and <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutant males lack mature sperm in their seminal vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>).

We speculate that these associations likely consist of DNA entanglements that naturally become introduced between interphase chromosomes due to their threadlike nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). The studies herein identified a function for condensin II during prophase I, when paired homologous chromosomes become partitioned into discrete chromosomal territories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Cooper1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Vazquez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. We propose that condensin II either promotes this partitioning, by actively sequestering bivalents into different regions of the nucleus, or functions to perform prophase I chromosome condensation. It is important to stress that in both scenarios, the role of condensin II mediated territory formation is to ensure the individualization of heterologous chromosomes from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g008">Figure 8B, large arrows</xref>). When sequestration into territories and/or condensation of the bivalents do not take place, i.e. in the condensin II mutants, individualization does not occur, heterologous entanglements persist into anaphase I, and chromosomes may become stretched to the point where variable sized chromosomal portions become lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Persistent heterologous entanglements may also lead to one chromosome dragging another to the incorrect pole (not shown).</p><fig id="pgen-1000228-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000228.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>A working model for the function of condensin II in the resolution of DNA entanglements between homologous and heterologous chromosomes prior to <italic>Drosophila</italic> male meiotic anaphase I.</title><p>(A) In interphase nuclei, heterologous chromosomes intermingle and can naturally become entangled with one another because of their threadlike structure. Homologous chromosomes are also entangled as the pairing process likely leads to their raveling around one another. (B) In early prophase I, condensing II functions to promote territory formation. This either entails partial condensation of each bivalent into compact clusters of chromatin and/or the active sequestration of each bivalent into discrete chromosomal territories. In the course of condensing II mediated territory formation, DNA entanglements between heterologous chromosomes are resolved and/or their introduction is prevented (both depicted by large arrows). Paired homologs may also be individualized from one another during condensing II mediated chromosome organizational steps that occur during prophase I (depicted by small arrows). (B) Condensin II successfully promotes territory formation by late prophase I and heterologous chromosomes are individualized from one another. It is unclear whether condensin II functions after territory formation to further individualize homologs. In condensin II mutants, failure in the chromosome organizational steps during territory formation leads to entanglement persistence. (C) In wild-type metaphase I, little to no entanglements between chromosomes still exist. It is unclear, but feasible that condensin II mediated individualization is still present during metaphase I or at the transition into anaphase I. When condensin II is not functional, entanglements between homologous and heterologous chromosomes still exist. (D) In wild-type anaphase I, homologous chromosomes segregate from one another to daughter cells. When condensin II is mutant, persistent entanglements between heterologous and homologous chromosomes that were not resolved prior to anaphase I become revealed as chromatin bridges. Persistent entanglements may also lead to improper cosegregation of homologs or heterolog dragging to one pole (not shown). Note that our data cannot distinguish between the two following possible mechanisms: Condensin II resolves DNA entanglements prior to anaphase I and/or condensin II antagonizes another type of chromosomal association. In fact, mutations in <italic>teflon</italic>, a factor that promotes male autosomal conjunction, were capable of rescuing anaphase I bridging in <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutants. While this may be because Teflon protein induces and/or exacerbates DNA entanglements between heterologous and homologous chromosomes, it is plausible that Cap-H2 can antagonize a Teflon mediated homolog conjunction complex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000228.g008"/></fig><p>Despite what appears to be failed chromosome condensation in prophase I of <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutants, by metaphase and anaphase I no obvious defects in chromosome condensation were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g007">7</xref>).

We suggest that the paired state of homologs initiates or introduces the opportunity for DNA entangling between homologs and that condensin II functions to resolve these prior to segregation. A likely scenario is that this occurs during prophase I, where chromosome condensation appears abnormal in <italic>Cap-H2</italic> and <italic>Cap-D3</italic> mutants. Perhaps condensin II mediated prophase I condensation functions to individualize intertwined homologous chromosomes prior to segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g008">Figure 8B, small arrows</xref>). It is also plausible that condensin II homolog individualization continues up until anaphase I.</p><p>We have found that mutations in <italic>teflon</italic>, a gene required for autosomal pairing maintenance, were capable of suppressing anaphase I bridging in <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutant males. Specifically, both homologous and heterologous chromosomal bridging were decreased in the <italic>teflon/Cap-H2</italic> double mutant. This may occur because Teflon is capable of exacerbating DNA entanglements, if for example persistent homolog conjunction provides more opportunity for entanglements between homologs to be introduced. Teflon may also exacerbate entanglements between heterologous chromosomes. This might be especially true in a Cap-H2 mutant background with failed territory formation, as Teflon mediated autosomal conjunction may augment the extent of entangling.</p><p>It is also plausible that Cap-H2 acts as an antagonist of Teflon mediated autosomal conjunction. Perhaps autosomal homologous associations persist into anaphase I of <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutants because a homolog conjunction complex was not disabled prior to the metaphase I to anaphase I transition. However, Cap-H2 as an antagonist of Teflon cannot explain persistent heterologous associations into anaphase I, unless Teflon is capable of mistakenly introducing conjunction between heterologous chromosomes. The opportunity for this might exist in a <italic>Cap-H2</italic> mutant prophase I nucleus where heterologs continue to intermingle because of failed territory formation.</p><p>An interesting result in our course of studies was the heightened amount of chromosome 2 and 3 nondisjunction in weaker male fertile Cap-H2 allelic combinations, whereas the sex and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes were unaffected.

However, given that sex and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome segregation defects were observed in the stronger male sterile Cap-H2 mutant background, we propose that condensin II functions upon all chromosomes, yet the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> require the greatest functional Cap-H2 dose for their proper segregation. This sensitivity of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomes may be due to their greater total amount of DNA utilized in homolog pairing and pairing maintenance activities. For example, perhaps longer stretches of paired DNA are more prone to entanglements or require more achiasmate conjunction factors and therefore necessitate higher levels of Cap-H2 individualization or disengagement activity. As an interesting corollary to support this theory, weak <italic>teflon</italic> mutations only lead to 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome missegregation, while the other autosomes segregate normally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Arya1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

The fact that Teflon mutations do rescue Cap-H2 anaphase I bridging defects is an especially intriguing result as it points toward a molecular mechanism for Cap-H2 as an antagonist of achiasmate associations. While three genes have been found to promote achiasmate conjunction (<italic>teflon</italic>, <italic>MNM</italic>, and <italic>SNM</italic>), no factors have been identified that act to negatively regulate conjunction and allow homologs to disengage at the time of segregation. Interestingly, one conjunction factor, SNM, is orthologous to the cohesin subunit Scc3/SA that appears to be specialized to engage achiasmate homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Thomas1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

To score hatch rates, the percent of eggs that hatched (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;200 total eggs/plate) was scored from randomly selected regions of each plate 48 hours after parents were removed.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>4<sup>th</sup> Chromosome Nondisjunction Tests</title><p>Five <italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-0019</sup>/Cap-H2<sup>Z3-5163</sup></italic>; <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> males were crossed to fifteen <italic>C(4)EN</italic>, <italic>ci ey</italic> females at 25&#x000b0;C on standard fly food. As controls, the same experimental design was carried out with <italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-0019</sup></italic>/<italic>TM6B</italic>, <italic>Hu</italic>; <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup></italic>/&#x0002b; or <italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-5163</sup></italic>/<italic>TM6B</italic>, <italic>Hu</italic>; <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup></italic>/&#x0002b; males. Males and virgin females were 2&#x02013;3 days old and the experimental cross was done in replicate, while the controls were only performed once. Parents were twice flipped into a new bottle after three days and then discarded from their final bottle after three days. Progeny were scored on the 13<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> day after parents were placed into the bottle. Because the 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome in these females is attached, they produce eggs that either carry the compound <italic>C(4)EN</italic>, <italic>ci ey</italic> chromosome (diplo-4) or no 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome (nullo-4). The fertilization of nullo-4 eggs by normal haploid sperm creates nullo-4/&#x0002b; and nullo-4/<italic>spa<sup>pol</sup></italic> progeny. Both of these will develop into very small flies (Minute) from only carrying one 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome, with the latter also <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup></italic>. When normal haplo-4 sperm fertilize <italic>C(4)EN</italic>, <italic>ci ey</italic>/0 eggs, <italic>C(4)EN</italic>, <italic>ci ey</italic>/&#x0002b; or <italic>C(4)EN</italic>, <italic>ci ey</italic>/<italic>spa<sup>pol</sup></italic> progeny are produced. These both appear wild-type from the wild-type alleles of <italic>ci</italic> and <italic>ey</italic> on the paternal 4<sup>th</sup> and wild-type <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup></italic> on the <italic>C(4)EN</italic> chromosome. There are two exceptional classes from male chromosome missegregation events that are detectable with this assay. The first is when nullo-4 sperm fertilize <italic>C(4)EN</italic>, <italic>ci ey</italic>/0 eggs to produce <italic>ci ey</italic> offspring. The second are sperm diplo-4 and homozygous for <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup></italic> fertilizing nullo-4 eggs to create <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup></italic> offspring. The following exceptional classes go undetected with this assay because they are phenotypically wild-type: &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic>, <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup>/spa<sup>pol</sup></italic> sperm that fertilize <italic>C(4)EN</italic> eggs or &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, <italic>spa<sup>pol</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> and all triplo-4 and tetra-4 sperm possibilities that fertilize nullo-4 eggs. Therefore, the &#x00025; 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome nondisjunction is likely an underestimate. This assay was adapted from that described in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Tomkiel1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Sex Chromosome Nondisjunction Tests</title><p>Ten males, that were 2&#x02013;3 days old, were crossed to 17 virgin females that were 0&#x02013;3 days old at 25&#x000b0;C. Males each carried a Y chromosome with an X translocation containing the wild-type <italic>yellow</italic> gene. Females carried an attached X chromosome: <italic>C(1)RM</italic>, <italic>y<sup>2</sup> su(wa)wa</italic>. In this assay, the viable offspring from sperm bearing the normal sex chromosome content, either one X or one Y, will be <italic>y<sup>1</sup>w<sup>1</sup></italic>/<italic>nullo-X</italic> (<italic>yw</italic>, XO male) or <italic>y&#x0002b;Y</italic>/<italic>C(1)RM</italic>, <italic>y<sup>2</sup> su(w<sup>a</sup>)w<sup>a</sup></italic> (<italic>y&#x0002b;</italic>, XXY female) (nullo-X/Y and triplo-X are lethal combinations). If exceptional classes of sperm are created that are diplo-X, XY, XXY, or lack either sex chromosome entirely (nullo-X or nullo-Y), then <italic>yellow white</italic> females, <italic>white</italic> males, <italic>white</italic> females, or <italic>yellow</italic> females will be produced, respectively. With this assay it cannot be determined whether offspring carry an extra Y chromosome. This experiment is adapted from that detailed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Bickel1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>2<sup>nd</sup> Chromosome Nondisjunction Tests</title><p>The line <italic>C(2)EN</italic>, <italic>b pr</italic> carries second chromosomes that are fused, referred to as &#x0201c;compound&#x0201d; chromosomes, that segregate together as a unit and therefore gametes are created that are either nullo-2 or diplo-2. Because any chromosome 2 content other than diplo-2 is lethal, viable offspring only occur from the fertilization of nullo-2 eggs by diplo-2 sperm or diplo-2 eggs by nullo-2 sperm. Therefore, if any offspring are created when crossing males to <italic>C(2)EN</italic>, <italic>b pr</italic> virgin females, then chromosome mis-segregation had occurred in the generation of male gametes. The males used in this experiment were heterozygous for a mutant allele of <italic>brown</italic> (<italic>bw<sup>1</sup></italic>) that is an insertion of a 412 retrotransposable element into the <italic>brown</italic> gene. In this assay, there are four classes of sperm that can successfully fertilize eggs from <italic>C(2)EN</italic> bearing females that can then develop into adult flies: nullo-2, diplo-2 (<italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/bw<sup>1</sup></italic>), diplo-2 (<italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic>), and diplo-2 (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;). Progeny from nullo-2 sperm fertilizing diplo-2 eggs have the <italic>b pr</italic> phenotype. Those from <italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/bw<sup>1</sup></italic> sperm fertilizing nullo-2 eggs have the <italic>bw</italic> phenotype. Progeny from <italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> and &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; sperm fertilizing nullo-2 eggs both appear wild-type. To distinguish between these two wild-type phenotypic classes, a PCR test was developed that could detect the presence of the <italic>bw<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant allele by utilizing the 412 element insertion in the <italic>brown</italic> gene. Thus, with forward primer <named-content content-type="gene">tattatctgagtgagttttctcgag</named-content> that anneals to the 412 element and reverse primer ttcacccacatcatcctcat that anneals to the <italic>brown</italic> gene, a 874 bp PCR product is generated only from <italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> and never from &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; flies. Furthermore, with forward primer <named-content content-type="gene">ggtgatctgcaattagggat</named-content> and the same reverse primer as above (<named-content content-type="gene">ttcacccacatcatcctcat</named-content>), an &#x0223c;571 bp fragment amplifies from the wild-type <italic>brown</italic> locus within both <italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> and &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; flies, and serves as a positive control. Wild-type in these assays was the parental line from the <italic>Z3-0019</italic> and <italic>Z3-5163</italic> backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Koundakjian1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> crossed to Oregon R (<italic>bw<sup>1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic>; <italic>st<sup>1</sup></italic>/&#x0002b;). Similarly, <italic>Cap-H2</italic> heterozygous males were generated from a cross to Oregon R. Ten 1&#x02013;3 day old males were crossed to twenty 1&#x02013;5 day old virgin <italic>C(2)EN</italic>, <italic>b pr</italic> females at 25&#x000b0;C.

The parents were kept in the original vial for a total of 5 days, flipped to a new vial for 5 more days, and then discarded.

This experiment was therefore set up in the same way as the 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome nondisjunction tests, except that <italic>C(3)EN</italic>, <italic>st cu e</italic> females were used, three replicates were performed, parents were kept in vials for 3 days and flipped twice, and these crosses were done at room temperature (21&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C). In this assay, there are four classes of sperm that can successfully fertilize eggs from <italic>C(3)EN</italic> bearing females that can then develop into adult flies: nullo-3, diplo-3 (heterozygous for paternal 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomes), diplo-3 (homozygous for one of the paternal 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomes) and diplo-3 (homozygous for the other paternal 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome). The <italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-0019</sup></italic> chromosome is marked with <italic>ru</italic>, <italic>h</italic>, <italic>st</italic>, <italic>sr</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, and <italic>ca</italic>, while the <italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-5163</sup></italic> chromosome is marked with only <italic>st</italic>. Using Cap-<italic>H2<sup>Z3-0019</sup>/Cap-H2<sup>Z3-5163</sup></italic> males as an example, the following describes how nullo-3 and the three different diplo-3 progeny classes were distinguished.

Additionally, anaphase I chromosomes quickly decondense upon entry into telophase I, reducing the overall frequency of anaphase I figures where chromosomes can be observed. Thus, the stronger <italic>Cap-H2<sup>Z3-0019</sup></italic>/<italic>Cap-H2<sup>TH1</sup></italic> allelic combination was analyzed to increase the likelihood of visualizing interpretable bridged figures. Bridges were scored as homologous when they appeared to connect morphologically similar chromosomes, based on size and centromere location (see text) that appeared to be segregating away from one. It was concluded that the 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome was involved in a heterologous association during meiosis I when a DAPI staining thread extended to another non-4<sup>th</sup> chromosome. Thus, images were only scored when this thread clearly was connected to a heterolog, or the other 4<sup>th</sup> was present and it was clear that it did not participate in the thread. In the wild-type figures where 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome threads were observed, it could not be concluded whether the thread extended to another 4<sup>th</sup> or a heterolog. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000228-g007">figure 7C</xref> for the wild-type may therefore be an overestimate of 4<sup>th</sup>-to-heterolog threads because threads may actually connect homologs.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Fly Stocks</title><p><italic>bw</italic>; <italic>st Z3-0019</italic>/<italic>TM6B</italic>, <italic>Hu Tb e ca</italic> and <italic>bw</italic>; <italic>st Z3-5163</italic>/<italic>TM6B</italic>, <italic>Hu Tb e ca</italic> were obtained from Charles Zuker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Koundakjian1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> and were identified in a previously detailed genetic screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000228-Sweeney1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.
