This activity co-eluted with activities toward adenine paired with guanine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) as a single peak corresponding to a 55 kDa molecular mass on gel filtration chromatography. Further co-purification was then done. Western blotting revealed that these activities also co-purified with a 52 kDa polypeptide which reacted with antibodies against human MYH (anti-hMYH). Recombinant hMYH has essentially similar activities to the partially purified enzyme. Thus, hMYH is likely to possess both adenine and 2-OH-A DNA glycosylase activities. In nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells, a 52 kDa polypeptide was detected with a small amount of 53 kDa polypeptide, while in mitochondrial extracts a 57 kDa polypeptide was detected using anti-hMYH. With amplification of the 5&#x02032;-regions of the hMYH cDNA, 10 forms of hMYH transcripts were identified and subgrouped into three types, each with a unique 5&#x02032; sequence. These hMYH transcripts are likely to encode multiple authentic hMYH polypeptides including the 52, 53 and 57 kDa polypeptides detected in Jurkat cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8a54728.0x8bf33d0" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos AB032920&#x02013;AB032929</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Among many classes of DNA damage caused by oxygen radicals, an oxidized form of the guanine base, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), is considered to be pertinent to mutagenesis and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c3">3</xref>), because 8-oxoG can pair with adenine as well as cytosine with almost equal efficiency during DNA replication and thus has the potential to cause a high frequency of mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c5">5</xref>). Accumulation of 8-oxoG in DNA is due to either incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP, an oxidized form of dGTP, into DNA as a precursor or direct oxidation of the guanine base in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Studies on mutator mutants of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> revealed that <italic>E.coli</italic> has several error avoiding mechanisms to minimize the deleterious effects of 8-oxoG, in which MutT, FPG (MutM) and MutY play important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c8">8</xref>). MutT hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP and pyrophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c5">5</xref>), thus avoiding the spontaneous occurrence of A:T&#x02192;C:G transversion mutations. FPG (MutM), originally identified as a formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase, removes 8-oxoG paired with cytosine and introduces a single strand gap as a result of the accompanying apurinic&#x0002f;apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c10">10</xref>). MutY, with its DNA glycosylase activity, excises adenine paired with guanine or 8-oxoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c12">12</xref>). The rate of spontaneous occurrence of G:C&#x02192;T:A transversion mutations in <italic>fpg(mutM)</italic>- or <italic>mutY</italic>-deficient strains is 10&#x02013;50 times higher than that in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c14">14</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that mammalian cells also come equipped with similar error avoiding mechanisms. MTH1 (MutT homolog-1) and MYH (MutY homolog) are likely to play roles as mammalian orthologs of <italic>E.coli</italic> MutT and MutY, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c20">20</xref>). An ortholog for yeast 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase, Ogg1, a functional homolog of <italic>E.coli</italic> FPG (MutM), has also been identified in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c27">27</xref>). We found that hMTH1 is mostly localized in the cytoplasm with some in the mitochondria of human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c28">28</xref>) and that the <italic>hOGG1</italic> gene produces more than seven transcripts by alternative splicing, one of which encodes a nuclear form of 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase while another encodes its mitochondrial form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c29">29</xref>). Therefore, oxidation of nucleotides as well as DNA in mitochondria is indeed a crucial event.</p><p>hMTH1 hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates such as 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-GTP, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-dATP (8-oxo-dATP) and 2-hydroxy-dATP (2-OH-dATP), while MutT hydrolyzes only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c31">31</xref>). It has been shown that 2-hydroxyadenine (2-OH-A) in plasmid DNA causes various base substitutions and deletion mutations in <italic>E.coli</italic> and in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c33">33</xref>) and that introduction of 2-OH-dATP into <italic>E.coli</italic> cells induces mostly G:C&#x02192;T:A transversion mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c34">34</xref>). The mutagenic potential of 8-oxoadenine (8-oxoA) is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c36">36</xref>). The existence of hMYH and hOGG1 suggests that cells may come equipped with an enzyme with 2-OH-A-specific DNA glycosylase activity to excise 2-OH-A incorporated into DNA.</p><p>In the present study, we detected and purified a repair enzyme for 2-OH-A in DNA from human cells. The enzyme was co-purified with authentic hMYH and recombinant hMYH has the same repair activity, as well as adenine DNA glycosylase activity. In human cells at least three isoforms (p52, p53 and p57) of hMYH were identified. p52 and p53 are localized in the nucleus and p57 locates in the mitochondria. Ten different forms of cDNA for hMYH were isolated, hence multiple forms of hMYH are present in human cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP and prepacked columns for FPLC were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

The enzyme activity in the partially purified fraction gradually decreased during storage at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C, indicating that hMYH is rather unstable. Adenine DNA glycosylase activity was inhibited neither by preincubation with anti-hMYH nor with adenine or 2-OH-A free base (data not shown). We also detected DNA-binding activity in the fraction, which preferentially binds to oligonucleotides containing &#x0002a;A:GO and very weakly to those containing &#x0002a;A:G (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant hMYH possesses repair activitiy for 2-OH-A paired with guanine</title><p>hMYH encoded by an open reading frame of hMYH cDNA starting at the second ATG was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells.

The hMYH extract also contained an activity introducing nicks into substrates containing &#x0002a;AO:G, which were not evident in the control extract from 14-3-3-expressing cells. However the reaction products from the &#x0002a;AO:G substrate were heterogeneous in size, even with heating at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min in the presence of 0.17 N NaOH, a condition yielding a single nucleotide gap flanked by 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-phosphate termini by &#x003b4;-elimination, as seen in the product from the &#x0002a;A:GO substrate. This result suggests that exonuclease activities in crude extracts degrade only the reaction products from the &#x0002a;AO:G substrate. Thus, we propose that hMYH has DNA glycosylase activity excising 2-OH-A as well as adenine.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunological detection of multiple forms of hMYH polypeptides in human cells</title><p>The molecular weight of the hMYH predicted from its cDNA sequence is 59 034 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c18">18</xref>) and it has been reported that a 65 kDa polypeptide was identified as a mammalian homolog of MutY by western blotting using antibodies against <italic>E.coli</italic> MutY (amino acids 192&#x02013;211) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c44">44</xref>).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f5">5</xref>A, two bands corresponding to 47 and 53 kDa polypeptides were detected, thus confirming that hMYH mRNA encodes three polypeptides translated from the first and second initiation codons and possibly also from the third initiation codon, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>We prepared thin sections from fixed mitochondrial pellets prepared from Jurkat cells and examined the localization of p57 by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, using anti-hMYH in combination with protein A&#x02013;gold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f5">5</xref>B).

We identified four clones with different sequences: one corresponds to the cDNA sequence reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c18">18</xref>) and the other three are likely to be alternatively spliced variants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f6">6</xref>). To confirm these findings, we further performed 5&#x02032;-RACE using a cDNA library from Jurkat cells as template and obtained two new forms of cDNA clones with novel 5&#x02032; sequences. Based on the cDNA sequences, three sets of type-specific primers were synthesized and at least 10 forms of hMYH cDNAs amplified from HeLa S3 cells were subcloned and their sequences determined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f6">6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f7">7</xref>B). We classified hMYH mRNA into three types (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;) based on their 5&#x02032; sequences. Type &#x003b1; has the same 5&#x02032; sequence as does the cDNA reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c18">18</xref>) and there are four subtypes of type &#x003b1;, namely type &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;4. Type &#x003b1;3 corresponds to the cDNA sequence previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c18">18</xref>), &#x003b1;2 has an insertion sequence, CAG, while &#x003b1;1 has a much longer insertion sequence (33 bp) with the CAG, between exons 2 and 3, which is derived from the intron 2 sequence just in front of exon 3. Type &#x003b1;4 is missing 64 bases of the 5&#x02032;-region of exon 3. Types &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; have novel 5&#x02032; sequences, both of which differ from each other, indicating that the <italic>hMYH</italic> gene has at least three independent transcription initiation sites. There are also several splicing variants of type &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; hMYH mRNAs; &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;5 and &#x003b3;2, &#x003b3;3 and &#x003b3;4. The common sequence of the 5&#x02032;-ends of type &#x003b2; cDNAs was identical to that reported by Takao <italic>et al</italic>.

In type &#x003b1;4 mRNA there is a termination codon in the open reading frame from the first initiation codon commonly used for the type &#x003b1;1&#x02013;3 polypeptides. There is a polypeptide with MW 47 000 which may be translated from an open reading frame initiating at the third AUG and which may correspond to the p47 translation product from a plasmid carrying an open reading frame from the third initiation codon of the hMYH&#x003b1;3 cDNA shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f5">5</xref> (lane &#x003b1;3-2).

Thus, types &#x003b2;3, &#x003b2;5 and &#x003b3;3 may encode the same polypeptide with MW 57 410, type &#x003b2;1 one with MW 58 407, while type &#x003b3;2 may encode a polypeptide with MW 57&#x000a0;481 and type &#x003b3;4 one with MW 47 000.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of hMYH mRNAs in various human tissues</title><p>We then examined levels of hMYH mRNA in various human tissues and cell lines using northern blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f7">7</xref>A). Radioactive bands corresponding to mRNAs with sizes from 1.3 to 2.3 kb were detected. The largest amounts of hMYH mRNA, the size of which was mostly 1.8 kb, were detected in Jurkat cells. HeLa cells express much smaller amounts of the 1.8 kb mRNA. Two major bands corresponding to 1.8 and 2.3 kb mRNAs were detected in almost all tissues examined; however, the radioactivity of the bands was lower than that in Jurkat cells and varied considerably. Among various human tissues, the largest amounts of hMYH mRNAs were found in the thymus, then in adult brain, testis and kidney. The amounts of hMYH mRNA in the heart, salivary gland, liver and pancreas were low compared to amounts in other tissues. It is interesting that adult brain, a post-mitotic tissue, has large amounts of hMYH mRNA, but liver and pancreas have small amounts.</p><p>RNAs from HeLa S3 cells, human fetal brain, adult brain and kidney were also analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR, using three sets of type-specific primers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f7">7</xref>B). Three bands (210, 275 and 310 bp) were amplified from all samples with the set of primers for type &#x003b1; mRNAs and sequence analysis of cloned fragments obtained from HeLa S3 cells revealed that type &#x003b1;3 mRNA (274 bp) was the major form among the four type &#x003b1; hMYH mRNAs, based on the number of clones identified by sequencing. Type &#x003b1;4 mRNA (210 bp) was minor in HeLa S3 cells and kidney; however, in brain tissues its relative amount was higher than that of type &#x003b1;1 mRNA (307 bp). With the set of primers for type &#x003b2; mRNAs, four or more bands were amplified from all samples, and a 245 bp fragment corresponding to the PCR product from type &#x003b2;3 (245 bp) was major in all cases. In samples from human tissues, substantial amounts of a 180 bp fragment, which may correspond to the PCR product from type &#x003b2; mRNAs missing 64 bases in the 5&#x02032;-region of exon 3, as do types &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b3;4, was amplified. For type &#x003b3; mRNAs, a 315 bp fragment which may correspond to type &#x003b3;2 (316 bp) or &#x003b3;3 (313 bp) was the major form in all samples analyzed. Again, a 250 bp fragment corresponding to the PCR product from type &#x003b3;4 mRNA (249 bp) was evident in brain tissues, but much less so in samples from HeLa S3 cells and kidney.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Among many oxidized bases, 8-oxoG has been intensively studied as it is implicated in various diseases, such as cancer, neuronal degeneration and teratogenicity. 8-oxoG has mutagenic potential and various enzymes specifically act on the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c46">46</xref>). In the present study, we propose that 2-OH-A, an oxidized form of adenine, must also be involved in biological responses, as 2-OH-A in DNA can be efficiently excised by a DNA glycosylase encoded by the <italic>hMYH</italic> gene.</p><p>2-OH-A, also known as isoguanine, has been detected in DNA from isolated human tissues and from experimental animals and its amount was increased by exposure to various sources of reactive oxygen species, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c49">49</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that in certain human cancerous tissues, amounts of 2-OH-A are increased several-fold compared to findings in normal non-cancerous tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c50">50</xref>). Concerning the origin of 2-OH-A, the extent of oxidation of the 2 position of the adenine base by hydroxyl radicals is higher in its free nucleotide form than in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c47">47</xref>), thereby indicating that misincorporation of 2-OH-dATP from the nucleotide pool is the major source of 2-OH-A in DNA. 2-OH-A in DNA thus incorporated forms with a relatively stable base pair with thymine and cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c52">52</xref>), and may also pair with the <italic>syn</italic> forms of guanine and adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c47">47</xref>).</p><p>We reported that 2-OH-dATP is efficiently hydrolyzed to 2-OH-dAMP by hMTH1, originally identified as 8-oxo-dGTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c31">31</xref>), indicating that organisms come equipped with an enzyme to eliminate 2-OH-dATP from their nucleotide pools. Since hMTH1 has the lowest <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value with 2-OH-dATP among its substrates and <italic>E.coli</italic> MutT, a prototype of 8-oxo-dGTPase, has little ability to hydrolyze 2-OH-dATP, one could argue that human and mammalian cells are exposed to a higher risk of incorporation of 2-OH-dATP into their genome than are <italic>E.coli</italic> cells, thus they eliminate the precursor from the nucleotide pool. Since 2-OH-A in DNA forms a stable Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair with thymine, it has been speculated that 2-OH-A paired with thymine in DNA may escape repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c51">51</xref>). However, Jaruga and Dizdaroglu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c53">53</xref>) reported that 2-OH-A detected in DNA of human cells after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure is repaired within 4 h to background level, indicating that human cells possess repair activity for 2-OH-A in DNA.</p><p>In the present work, we examined an enzyme activity that introduces an alkali-labile site into 2-OH-A-containing oligonucleotides and found evidence for such a DNA repair activity that is likely to act as a DNA glycosylase. Furthermore, we showed that the repair activity is co-purified with hMYH and that recombinant hMYH itself has such activity. hMYH lacks AP lyase activity, thus we suspect that one could not detect the repair activity for 2-OH-A without alkaline treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c54">54</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that hMYH (2-OH-A&#x0002f;adenine DNA glycosylase) recognizes 2-OH-A paired with 8-oxoG or purines as well as adenine paired with guanine or 8-oxoG. hMYH in partially purified fractions preferentially acts on adenine paired with guanine in DNA rather than that paired with 8-oxoG; however, it binds more efficiently to substrates containing the latter. These characteristics of authentic hMYH are the same as those of calf MYH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c44">44</xref>). However, recombinant hMYH in crude extracts exhibited strongest activity for oligonucleotides containing adenine paired with 8-oxoG, as reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c20">20</xref>), but substantially less nicking activity for oligonucleotides containing adenine or 2-OH-A paired with guanine. Thus, the partially purified fraction of hMYH from Jurkat cells may contain some other factors which modify its substrate specificity.</p><p>It has been shown that the C-terminal region of <italic>E.coli</italic> MutY (amino acids 227&#x02013;350), the sequence of which is homologous to hMYH (amino acids 352&#x02013;535 in hMYH&#x003b1;3) and partly to MutT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f8">8</xref>), specifically binds 8-oxoG opposite adenine or an abasic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c55">55</xref>). hMYH binds strongly to oligonucleotides containing adenine paired with 8-oxoG and to a lesser extent when paired with guanine, but it is likely that hMYH quickly dissociates from those with 2-OH-A paired with guanine after excising 2-OH-A. This may explain why the 2-OH-A-containing oligonucleotides but not the others were degraded by <italic>E.coli</italic> nucleases after incubation with the recombinant hMYH extract, as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f4">4</xref>B.</p><p>In crude extracts from <italic>E.coli</italic> cells, we found no activity on substrates containing 2-OH-A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f4">4</xref>B). We then asked whether purified MutY acts on 2-OH-A, but no such activity was detected (T.Ohtsubo, H.Kamiya, H.Kasai and Y.Nakabeppu, unpublished results). Thus, hMYH but not MutY has a novel repair activity for 2-OH-A in DNA, as does hMTH1 for 2-OH-dATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c31">31</xref>). Interestingly, we found that there are significantly conserved residues between hMYH (amino acids 369&#x02013;499 in hMYH&#x003b1;3) and the entire hMTH1 molecule, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd246f8">8</xref>. Thirty-nine residues in hMTH1 (156 amino acids) are identical to those in the hMYH C-terminal region and 18 of them are also conserved in <italic>E.coli</italic> MutT and MutY, suggesting that the 18 residues are involved in binding to 8-oxoG. The 21 residues conserved only between hMYH and hMTH1 may determine the specificities of the two proteins for 2-OH-A and 2-OH-dATP, in addition to 8-oxoG and 8-oxo-dGTP.</p><p>In human cells, authentic hMYH was detected in nuclei and mitochondria by western blotting and their molecular weights differed, thereby indicating that there are multiple forms of hMYH. Based on 5&#x02032;-RACE and RT&#x02013;PCR of hMYH transcripts, we conclude that there are three major hMYH transcripts, namely hMYH &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;, with a different 5&#x02032; sequence or first exon, and further that each transcript is alternatively spliced, thus forming over 10 mature transcripts. A major transcript, hMYH&#x003b1;3, essentially corresponds to the hMYH cDNA originally reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c18">18</xref>) and encodes two polypeptides, p54 and p53, the former translated from the first and the latter from the second AUG.</p><p>It has been reported that the translation product of the hMYH&#x003b1;3 transcript is exclusively localized in mitochondria and that the N-terminal sequence of hMYH translated from the first AUG functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c56">56</xref>); however, the authentic hMYH polypeptide detected in mitochondria is p57. The hMYH&#x003b1;1 transcript has a 33 nt insertion into hMYH&#x003b1;3 and thus encodes a polypeptide with an expected molecular mass of 60 031; this may be the p57 detected in mitochondria. Moreover, the nuclear form of hMYH, p52, partially purified from Jurkat cells, is likely to correspond to p53 translated from the second AUG and the hMYH &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b3;2 transcripts, which are missing the first AUG, may encode the nuclear form of p52 hMYH. Of course, it is also possible that the hMYH&#x003b1;3 transcript produces p53 and p54 by alternative translation initiation, and one of them may correspond to the p52 detected in nuclei of Jurkat cells. Determination of the primary sequences of purified hMYH will reveal which polypeptide is encoded by each hMYH transcript. It is likely that hMYH in mitochondria associates with the inner membrane structure, as does hOGG1-2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c29">29</xref>), suggesting that the machinery needed for base excision repair in mitochondria generally associates with the inner membrane to achieve efficient repair of mitochondrial DNA.</p><p>To date, human cells have been found to be equipped with a repair enzyme, hMYH, for 2-OH-A, as well as hMTH1 for 2-OH-dATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd246c31">31</xref>). We will now extend our search for 2-OH-A DNA glycosylase and 2-OH-dATPase activities to other mammalian cells in order to determine whether MYH and MTH1 have the same activities in other mammalian cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd246f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Co-purification of repair activities for 2-OH-A and adenine paired with guanine or 8-oxoG.
