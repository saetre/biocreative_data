The TLRs are expressed mainly on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and activate these cells after binding to their ligands. The activation of TLRs has been shown to induce proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), and also to cause the upregulation of costimulatory molecules which activates the adaptive immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Whereas the TLRs play a key role for host defense, they also play important roles in inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by synovial inflammation and destruction of cartilage and bone. Recently, TLRs have been shown to play an important role in arthritis both in humans and in experimental animal models. In RA, it has been shown that TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 are upregulated in the synovium and synovial macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Some of these TLRs are upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines and, in turn, have a costimulatory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The endogenous ligands of TLRs, such as heat shock proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], hyaluronan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], or degradation product of fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], are expressed in joints, and it is considered that they can activate DCs or macrophages via the TLR, thus leading to the progression of arthritis in joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In experimental animal models, the critical roles of the TLRs and their adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in the development of arthritis have been demonstrated in various models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The data that the injection of TLR3 and TLR9 ligands into the joints induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and that TLR9 ligand CpG immunization induces arthritis in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] further support an arthritogenic role of TLRs. On the contrary, systemic TLR3 activation has been shown to suppress antibody-induced and TCR-transgenic mouse serum-induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], thus suggesting the different effect in arthritis between the local and systemic activation of TLRs.</p><p>RP105, expressed on B cells, macrophages, and DCs, is a TLR homolog that lacks a conserved intracellular signaling domain (Toll-IL-1 receptor domain) and forms a complex with soluble protein MD-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It has been shown that RP105 can provide proliferation and activation signals in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and that B cells from RP105-deficient mice were hyporesponsive to TLR4 and TLR2 stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We have been working on RP105 on B cells in patients with autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus. We previously reported that B cells lacking RP105 expand in the peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and that these cells can produce anti-double-stranded DNA antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. On the other hand, Divanovic and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] showed that RP105 directly interacts with TLR4 and negatively regulates TLR4 signaling by experiments using transfectant cells and RP105-deficient mice-derived DCs.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the role of RP105 in the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) using RP105-deficient mice. CIA is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the joints which is induced by immunization with type II collagen (CII). Our data show that RP105-deficient mice exhibit an accelerated onset of more severe arthritis, with an increased cytokine production of T cells and attenuated development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). These results suggest that RP105 plays a regulatory role in cell-mediated immunity and the development of CIA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice and experimental conditions</title><p>RP105-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] were backcrossed into the DBA/1 background for six generations and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction using ear biopsy-derived DNA. In all experiments, only RP105<sup>-/-</sup>, RP105<sup>+/-</sup>, and RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>littermates were used. All mice were 12 to 16 weeks of age at the time of immunization. The animals were maintained at the Saga Medical School animal facility. The care of the animals was in accordance with the guidelines for animal experimentation of the Saga Medical School. All animal experiments were approved by the local ethical committee (University of Saga, numbers 07-015-4 and 07-015-5).</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of collagen-induced arthritis</title><p>Mice were immunized intradermally at the base of the tail with 150 &#x003bc;g of bovine CII (Cosmo Bio Co.

Mice were boosted by an intradermal injection of 150 &#x003bc;g of bovine CII in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (Difco Laboratories Inc) on day 21. Arthritis development was monitored by physical examination three times per week and the inflammation in each of the four paws was graded from 0 to 3, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The four scores were added, with the maximum score per mouse being 12. The arthritis index was calculated by dividing the total score of the experimental mice by the number of total mice or arthritic mice. In the additional experiment, CIA was induced without CFA; the mice were immunized with 200 &#x003bc;g of bovine CII emulsified with IFA on days 0 and 21.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology</title><p>The ankle joints of the mice were excised 5 weeks after immunization and fixed in 10% buffered formalin, decalcified in 10% EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The intensity of synovial hyperplasia, cellular infiltration, and pannus formation was examined and arthritis was graded in a blinded fashion on a scale of 0 to 4, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of the serum anti-CII antibody levels</title><p>The levels of serum antibodies to CII were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Briefly, serial dilutions of serum samples were added to the microtiter plates (Maxisorp; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), coated with native bovine CII at 10 &#x003bc;g/mL, and incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. After washing, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) was added and incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. Antibody binding was visualized using orthophenylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A standard serum composed of a mixture of sera from the arthritic mice was added to each plate in serial dilutions and a standard curve was constructed. The standard serum was defined as 100 U and antibody titers of serum samples were calculated from the standard curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of cytokine production by spleen cells</title><p>Interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;), TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-2 and IL-4 production was examined on day 28 in the spleen cells. The cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 2% autologous mouse serum, seeded at 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>per wells in 24-well plates (Nunc), and stimulated with denatured CII (dCII) or Con A (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 hours. The cytokines produced in the culture supernatant were measured by the cytometric beads assay system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) using FACSCalibur, except for the measurement of IL-17, which was done by ELISA (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation and functional analysis of splenic dendritic cells</title><p>The splenic DCs were purified by magnetic cell sorting using CD11c microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the spleens from two or three mice immunized with CII 8 days before were digested with collagenase D (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). The spleen cells were incubated with anti-CD16/32 antibody for blocking, labeled with CD11c magnetic-activated cell sorting beads, and applied to magnetic column. After washing the column, the CD11c<sup>+ </sup>DCs were obtained by flushing them out using a plunger. The resultant cell purity was greater than 92% by flow cytometry. The conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) were determined by staining with anti-CD11c plus anti-B220 and anti-PDCA-1 plus anti-B220 (Miltenyi Biotec). For functional analysis, the splenic DCs (50 or 12.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells) from RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>or RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice were mixed with pooled adherent cell-removed lymph node cells (LNCs) (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells) from RP105<sup>+/- </sup>mice, which were immunized with CII 8 days before. The cells were resuspended in DMEM with 2% mouse serum and stimulated with dCII for 3 days. The IFN-&#x003b3; produced in the culture supernatant was measured using ELISA kits (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of cytokine production by splenic dendritic cells</title><p>The splenic DCs from RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>and RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice separated as described were resuspended at 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>per well in 96-well microtiter plates and stimulated with various concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (OB111; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours. The cytokines produced in the culture supernatant were measured by the cytometric beads assay system (BD Biosciences) using FACSCalibur. The lower detection limit of cytokines was 3.0 pg/mL in these experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation and functional analysis of regulatory T cells</title><p>The Tregs were purified from the spleens by magnetic cell sorting using the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>regulatory T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the spleens from three mice, immunized with CII 4 weeks before, were digested with collagenase D (Roche Diagnostics). The spleen cells were incubated with a biotin-labeled antibody cocktail and further incubated with anti-biotin microbeads and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD25 antibody. After washing, the cells were applied to the LD (lymphocyte depletion) column, and the T cells that passed through the column were collected. Thereafter, the T cells were incubated with anti-phycoerythrin microbeads, washed, and applied to the LS (lymphocyte separation) column. After washing the column, the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells were obtained by flushing them out with a plunger. The resultant cell purity was greater than 90% by flow cytometry, and the contaminating cells were mainly non-T non-B cells. Foxp3 staining was performed to compare the purity and its expression in recovered cells as well as whole spleen cells using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Foxp3 antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). More than 95% of the recovered CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells were positive for Foxp3, which was not different between cells from RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>or RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice. For a functional analysis, Tregs (1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells) from RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>or RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice were added to the pooled LNCs (1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells) from RP105<sup>+/- </sup>mice, which were immunized with CII 8 days before, resuspended in DMEM with 2% mouse sera, and stimulated with dCII or anti-CD3 antibody (BD Biosciences) for 3 days.

Three days later, 10 or 50 &#x003bc;g of LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected intraperitoneally, and the mice were examined daily for signs of arthritis. In addition, the serum TNF-&#x003b1; levels after LPS challenge were determined. One hour after an intraperitoneal injection of LPS, the sera were collected and the TNF-&#x003b1; levels were measured using ELISA kits (Biosource International).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analyses of the incidence of arthritis were performed using the chi-square analysis.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice showed an earlier onset of disease, and a significantly higher incidence was observed from day 31 to day 42 than in RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>mice. After that period, the incidence of arthritis in RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>mice increased and no more differences were observed. The final rates of incidence of arthritis were 85.2% and 73.1% in RP105<sup>-/- </sup>and RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>mice, respectively. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, the arthritis index increased gradually, thus indicating the chronic progression of the disease in a similar manner; however, the arthritis index in RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice was significantly higher than that in RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>mice. To histologically determine the grade of arthritis, the ankle joints were excised, and the degree of cellular infiltration and synovial hyperplasia was examined. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>, the ankle joints of RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice showed more severe synovitis, especially more inflammatory cell infiltration, than those of RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>mice at an early stage (day 35). We also compared the histology of arthritis at a late stage (7 to 8 weeks). Although RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice showed a relatively severe degree of arthritis, the difference was not statistically significant (data not shown). To assess the humoral immune response to CII in RP105-deficient mice, the IgG1 and IgG2a anti-CII antibody levels in the sera of mice were determined on days 28 and 42. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>, although the anti-CII antibodies of both IgG subclasses seemed to be slightly higher in RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice, they were not significantly different. The anti-CII antibody levels increased from day 28 to day 42 in RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>and RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice. These results indicate that RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice showed an accelerated onset of CIA and a more severe CIA and suggest that the RP105 molecule may therefore regulate the development of CIA.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The development of collagen-induced arthritis in RP105-deficient mice. <bold>(a-d) </bold>RP105<sup>+/+ </sup>(n = 26, 13 males and 13 females) and RP105<sup>-/- </sup>(n = 27, 13 males and 14 females) mice were immunized with type II collagen (CII), and signs of arthritis were monitored as described in Materials and methods.

These results indicate that cell-mediated immune responses to immunized collagen are enhanced in RP105-deficient mice, thus suggesting RP105 to be a negative regulator of the immune system in this model.</p><p>RP105 was originally found as a molecule that induces B-cell activation after its ligation, but it has been shown to be expressed also on macrophages and DCs. The role of RP105 on these cells, however, has not yet been clearly determined. Recently, Divanovic and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] showed that the expression of RP105 by gene transfection suppressed TLR4 signaling in HEK293 cells and that DCs and the macrophages from RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice produced a higher amount of cytokines in response to LPS. These data indicate that RP105 is an attenuator of TLR4-induced signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We demonstrated here that DCs from RP105-deficient mice induced a larger amount of IFN-&#x003b3; production from LNCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>), thus indicating the augmented T-cell-activating function of DCs lacking RP105. On the other hand, we did not see any significant differences between DCs from RP105-deficient mice and those from control mice in cytokine production in response to LPS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These data are in contrast to those of Divanovic and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The difference might be due to the purity of the LPS because the conventional LPS that we used might have been contaminated with a lipopeptide, the TLR2 ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Alternatively, the different DC preparation, splenic DCs versus bone marrow-derived DCs, may have produced different results.</p><p>In the anti-CII antibody and LPS-induced arthritis model, arthritis development and TNF-&#x003b1; production were enhanced in RP105-deficient mice when a reduced dose of LPS was administered. Although the difference in the arthritis index between wild-type and RP105-deficient mice was small in comparison with that when they were actively immunized, these results nevertheless support a regulatory role of RP105 in the development of arthritis induced by TLR ligands. On the other hand, these <italic>in vivo </italic>results cannot be explained by the <italic>in vitro </italic>data of splenic DCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We therefore need to conduct more experiments using specific ligands and cells other than DCs, such as macrophages or synovial cells, to solve these problems.</p><p>TLRs have been shown to play a role in the acquired immune responses by promoting cytokine and chemokine production and costimulatory molecule expression. In addition, a recent report showed that MD1, a molecule that forms a complex with RP105, regulated the development of Tregs induced by LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We also observed the impaired Treg function in RP105-deficient mice. The Tregs play key roles in the maintenance of immunologic self-tolerance and negative control of a variety of physiological and pathological immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The administration of a Treg-depleting anti-CD25 antibody induced an accelerated onset of arthritis and a more severe arthritis in murine CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In our experiment, the suppressive function of RP105<sup>-/- </sup>Tregs was impaired when the cells were stimulated with collagen, but not with anti-CD3 antibody. These data suggest that reduced Treg function is not intrinsic but instead is due to insufficient activation when triggered by antigen presented by APCs. Alternatively, the number of CII-specific Tregs is decreased in RP105-deficient mice. It has been shown that the suppressive effect of Tregs is blocked by DCs activated by TLR ligands, such as LPS or CpG, via IL-6 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that impaired antigen-specific Treg induction in RP105-deficient mice is due to an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines by APCs activated by immunization with CII and CFA.</p><p>Next, we tried to elucidate whether the regulatory role of RP105 in the development of arthritis is exerted only when the disease was induced by active immunization using CFA. If enhanced arthritis development in RP105-deficient mice is CFA-dependent, it can be speculated that the activation signal through TLRs evoked by CFA, which contains heat-killed mycobacteria, is augmented in APCs lacking RP105. However, RP105-deficient mice showed a higher incidence even when arthritis was induced using IFA only, thus indicating that the enhancing effect in arthritis development does not depend solely on CFA. To explain these results, we hypothesized that the signals provided by endogenous TLR ligands other than CFA also made the difference between RP105-deficient and wild-type mice. Recently, various endogenous ligands of TLR4 and TLR2 have been reported. These molecules include fibrinogen degradation products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], hyaluronan fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], fibronectin fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], heparan sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], high-mobility group box-1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and heat shock proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These molecules have been shown to induce the activation or the release of proinflammatory cytokines from DCs or macrophages. In addition, heat shock proteins, fibrinogen, and degraded hyaluronan are commonly found in inflamed joints. Therefore, it is possible that DCs and synovial macrophages lacking RP105 might be highly activated by these endogenous ligands, thus resulting in the enhanced development of arthritis. However, this hypothesis has yet to be investigated.</p><p>This study has a limitation regarding the specificity of TLRs. Because we used conventional LPS, which might have been contaminated with TLR2 ligands, we could not determine the precise role of TLR4 in our studies. As such, it remains to be investigated which TLR is regulated by RP105 in these models using more specific ligands and whether the <italic>in vitro </italic>activation and cytokine production from various cells (for example, macrophages and synovial cells) are altered in the absence of RP105.</p><p>RP105 is also expressed in B cells. B cells from RP105-deficient mice are hyporesponsive to LPS, in contrast to DCs, and to lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our observation that RP105-deficient mice developed severe arthritis in response to anti-CII antibody and LPS and produced more TNF-&#x003b1; in response to LPS indicated that the hyporesponsiveness of RP105<sup>-/- </sup>B cells might be overcome by other cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, RP105-deficient mice were not impaired with respect to T-cell-dependent antibody production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In keeping with this, we observed that RP105<sup>-/- </sup>mice showed comparable levels of anti-CII antibody in CIA.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of TLRs in arthritis models. The intra-articular triggering of TLRs led to the joint inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and TLR2 and TLR4 have been shown to play a critical role in bacterial cell wall-induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In human RA, TLRs, including TLR2 and TLR4, are expressed in synovial cells and are upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. RA synovial cells have been shown to produce various chemokines after the stimulation with TLR2 ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and inflammatory cytokines after triggering TLR2 or TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In addition, the suppression of MyD88 or Mal/TIRAP by transfecting the dominant negative form downregulated the production of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases from synovial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Although these studies emphasize the proinflammatory roles of TLRs and adaptor molecules, the regulatory or anti-inflammatory role of TLR family members is not known. Our data suggest that a potential regulatory mechanism exists in the TLR-TLR ligand system in inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study demonstrated that RP105 regulated the cell-mediated immune response by the suppression of APC function and regulatory T-cell development and, as a result, attenuated the development of CIA.
