At least two introns were present in the primordial bilaterian Runx gene.

The Runt domain is named after the first member of the family to be discovered, the regulatory gene <italic>runt </italic> from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Runx genes have also been discovered and functionally characterized in mammals, sea urchins and nematodes, and in general are involved in the transcriptional control of developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In humans, mutations in each of the three Runx genes are associated with disease caused by defective control of cell proliferation and/or differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Most studies of Runx gene function and regulation have been carried out in mammals and in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, each of which has multiple Runx genes. It is not currently known how the Runx gene family evolved, nor is it known how many Runx genes the first animal possessed. Answering these questions will facilitate identification of primitive (general) and derived (specialized) aspects of Runx gene structure, function and regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>The collection of Runx gene sequences from phylogenetically diverse model organisms</title><p>Sequence similarity searches of public databases using the BLAST program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] were used to collect a set of currently available Runx gene sequences (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>) from phylogenetically diverse species with complete or nearly complete genome sequences. Previously undescribed Runx genes collected in our BLAST searches include two genes from the puffer fish (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>) genome, a single gene from the sea squirt (<italic>Cionia intestinalis</italic>) genome, three genes from the mosquito (<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>) genome, and two new Runx genes from the fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)genome. Also collected in the set for comparison were the previously-described Runx genes from <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>(<italic>runt </italic>and <italic>lozenge </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>(<italic>run </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), sea urchin (<italic>SpRunt </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]), <italic>T. rubripes </italic>(<italic>TrRunx2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]), and mouse (<italic>Runx1</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic>, and <italic>Runx3</italic>; the three human RUNX genes, which have been extensively characterized previously, are highly similar to their mouse orthologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and hence were not included in the collected set). The collected set of sequences thus contains representatives of several major bilaterian phyla within both deuterostomes (Chordata and Echinodermata) and protostomes (Nematoda and Arthropoda). Runx sequences from lophotrochozoans and from basal (non-bilaterian) metazoans (e.g., Cnidaria and Porifera) are not found in the database, and it is not yet known whether non-bilaterian Runx genes exist. Extensive BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches of the public databases failed to recover any sequences with significant similarity to the Runt domain from non-metazoan organisms with completed or nearly completed genomes, suggesting that Runx genes may be a metazoan invention. The closest amino acid sequence similarity of any part of the Runt domain to sequences outside of metazoa is found in the motif GRSGRGKSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which matches the nucleotide binding P-loop sequence in various bacterial and archaeal ATP-binding proteins with diverse functions. This Runx sequence is functionally involved in minor groove interactions and DNA bending by the Runt domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. An important difference between it and <italic>bona fide </italic>P-loops is that the latter are invariably followed by an &#x003b1;-helix, whereas the structure of the Runt domain is all beta (see below). Thus, although the Runx P-loop-like motif is capable of binding ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], it is unclear whether this local sequence similarity is indicative of homology to the prokaryotic P-loop.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative structure of Runx genes collected from genome sequences of phylogenetically diverse model organisms. </bold>Diagram of Runx genes from selected species.

The black bar at the end of all the genes represents the VWRPY (or IWRPF in the case of <italic>CeRun</italic>) Groucho recruitment motif that is at the C-terminus of proteins encoded by all Runx genes, which facilitated mapping of the previously uncharacterised genes. Exon sequences representing 5' and 3' untranslated regions are not depicted in the diagram. For the vertebrate Runx genes, only exons downstream of the proximal promoters (P2) are shown.

Screens of genomic libraries using the Runt domain sequence as probe indicate that the same is also apparently true of the sea urchin <italic>S. purpuratus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although final verification of this awaits the completion of the sea urchin genome. In contrast, the model organisms in which most functional studies of Runx genes have been performed (i.e. <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and mouse) each contain multiple Runx genes. Both of the vertebrate species surveyed (mouse and <italic>T. rubripes</italic>) were each found to contain three Runx genes, as was the mosquito <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, whereas <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>contains four.</p><p>The simplest explanation of such a gene distribution is that possession of a single Runx gene is the primitive condition for bilaterians, i.e., that the multiplicity of Runx genes in the vertebrate and arthropod lineages resulted from independent gene duplications within those respective lineages. The results of a phylogenetic analysis of Runt domain sequences are consistent with this hypothesis (see below). Since fruit flies and mice each contain multiple Runx genes, it is probable that each of those genes has acquired specialized (e.g., region- or tissue-specific) functions that were derived subsequent to the duplications, and hence peculiar to the taxonomic group to which each of those model organisms belong. Experimental studies of invertebrates that contain only a single Runx gene (sea urchin, tunicate, and nematode) are therefore likely to highlight primitive (general) functions of this family of transcription factors in the control of cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation during metazoan development.</p></sec><sec><title>Exon and intron positions among Runx genes</title><p>The gross structural features of the collected Runx genes, including positions of exons and introns (excepting those upstream of the proximal promoter of the vertebrate Runx genes &#x02013; see below), are depicted schematically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Supplemental Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). To locate exon-intron positions in previously uncharacterised genes (or predicted genes) that have not yet been associated with cDNAs, we performed spliced alignment, maintaining maximum similarity between homologues, as described in Methods. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, all of the Runx genes contain a central, highly conserved exon, which encodes the C-terminal third of the Runt domain (black box in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The N-terminal end of this exon is bounded by an intron whose position is absolutely conserved among all Runx genes except <italic>DmRunt </italic>and <italic>AgRunt </italic>(which have apparently lost the intron), while the C-terminal end is bounded by an intron that is conserved among all deuterostome species in our collection, and shifted but a few nucleotides downstream in the insect genes and upstream in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>gene. The existence and locations of all of the other introns are variable, but some of them are characteristic of specific clades.</p><p>All of the chordate Runx genes (including <italic>CiRunt</italic>) contain an intron within the N-terminal half of the Runt domain, the position of which is invariant with respect to nucleotide sequence. This intron is missing in the other Runx genes, including the sea urchin representative (<italic>SpRunt</italic>), and is therefore likely to be a chordate-specific feature of Runx genes that arose prior to the Runx gene duplications in the vertebrate lineage. Upstream of the Runt domain, <italic>TrRunx1 </italic>is predicted to have two short introns that are not found in its mouse orthologue (<italic>MmRunx1</italic>) or in any of the other chordate Runx genes. The mammalian Runx genes have longer introns than their counterparts in <italic>Takifugu</italic>, as might be expected based on relative genome sizes. With the exception of <italic>DmRunt</italic>, all of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>Runx genes contain one (<italic>DmLozenge </italic>and <italic>DmRunxB</italic>) or two (<italic>DmRunxA</italic>) introns separating exons N-terminal to the Runt domain, but all of these have different positions, and were thus likely to have been incorporated subsequent to the divergence of these genes. The position of the first intron in <italic>DmLozenge </italic>is conserved in one of the mosquito genes (<italic>AgLozenge</italic>), indicating that these two genes are orthologues, which is confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis of sequences (see below). <italic>CeRun </italic>contains an intron within the N-terminal half of the Runt domain that is not found in any other Runx gene, and contains the largest number of exons of any of the genes in our collection. In general, the structure of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>gene is the most divergent of all of the Runx genes.</p><p>A variable number of exons are found 3' of the Runt domain among different species, and these reveal group-specific patterns. Except for the <italic>lozenge </italic>orthologues, which contain two such exons, all of the insect genes for which complete sequences are available contain only a single exon downstream of the Runt domain. The same is apparently true for the single sea urchin gene (although this is provisionally based on the fragmentary evidence of a single small BAC clone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]), suggesting that a single exon downstream of the Runt domain may be the primitive condition for bilaterians. In vertebrates (from the proximal promoter), the <italic>Runx3 </italic>orthologues each contain 2 exons downstream of the Runt domain, while the <italic>Runx2 </italic>orthologues contain 4 and the <italic>Runx1 </italic>orthologues contain 3. <italic>CiRunt </italic>contains 5 exons downstream of the Runt domain, while <italic>CeRun </italic>contains 4. In vertebrates at least, the multiplicity of downstream exons is reflected in a large variety of alternatively spliced transcripts that give rise to multiple protein isoforms that differ in the C-terminal sequences appended to the Runt domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is important to note that the C-terminal exon of all Runx genes identified to date encodes the amino acid sequence VWRPY (or the functionally equivalent IWRPF in the case of <italic>C. elegans</italic>), which acts as a recruitment motif for the co-repressor Groucho/TLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This motif is at the C-terminus within the 3'-most exon of all of the genes, possibly with the exception of <italic>CiRunt </italic>(where the open reading frame apparently continues beyond the VWRPY in the genome sequence), and was used in our analysis to identify the C-terminal exons of previously uncharacterised Runx genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Runt domain sequences across phylogeny</title><p>The amino acid sequences of the Runt domains of all each of the collected genes, together with two previously described sequences from the spider <italic>Cupiennius salei </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], a sequence from the crayfish <italic>Pacifastacus leniusculus</italic>, and one from the nematode <italic>Meloidogyne hapla</italic>, were aligned using Clustal W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Functionally, the Runt domain is required both for DNA binding and for interaction with its heterodimeric partner (the beta subunit), which serves to allosterically enhance the DNA binding of the Runt domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Superposition of the alignment and the known crystal structure of mouse Runx1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reveals that residues that make either direct or indirect contact with DNA are invariant (marked by asterisks in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Sequence motifs that interact with the beta subunit are also highly conserved.</p><p>The alignment of Runt domain amino acid sequences was used to construct unrooted trees by several complementary approaches (neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood, and maximum-parsimony, described in Methods). We also employed Bayesian inference of phylogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This analysis was performed using 137 aligned amino acids with no gaps (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and included all of the sequences shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> except for the incomplete sequences from a spider (<italic>C. salei run-2</italic>) and from the root-knot nematode (<italic>M. hapla</italic>). The consensus topology produced by each method was largely consistent with accepted phylogenies for all nodes with significant bootstrap values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>); the main observations derived from each method are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The consensus of phylogenetic approaches strongly indicates the monophyly of the deuterostome Runx genes in the collection, with the expected relationships (echinoderms(urochordates(vertebrates))). The trees also suggest that the gene duplications that produced the three vertebrate Runx genes occurred early in the chordate lineage leading to vertebrates, but subsequent to its divergence from urochordates.

Among the insect representatives, each of the mosquito genes can be confidently assigned orthologues from <italic>Drosophila </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), as was also suggested by intron positions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Beyond that, low bootstrap values prohibit a confident assessment of evolutionary branching order of the arthropod Runx paralogues, and it is not clear whether they are monophyletic (although the position of the crayfish gene suggests a deep duplication event within in the insect/crustacean clade at least). Resolution of the evolutionary relationships among the protostome Runx genes will require a broader sampling of Runx genes from Arthropods as well as from protostomes in general.</p><p>The occurrence of three Runx genes in vertebrates, each on a different chromosome, is consistent with a scenario of multiple gene duplications, or two successive rounds of genome duplications that may have occurred near the base of the vertebrate branch of chordates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In contrast, the multiple Runx genes in <italic>Drosophila </italic>are all physically linked to <italic>runt </italic>on the X chromosome, and were almost certainly generated by local gene duplication events (for the location of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>genes, see FlyBase Genome Browser: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bdgp.org/cgi-bin/annot/gbrowse"/>). The two newly discovered <italic>Drosophila </italic>Runx genes both contain a complete open reading frame encoding the Runt domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and conserved exon-intron structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>), suggesting that they are probably not pseudogenes. This is further supported by our finding that each of the three mosquito Runx genes has an orthologue in <italic>Drosophila </italic>(Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative promoter usage among vertebrate runx genes</title><p>All of the vertebrate Runx genes are transcribed from two alternative promoters, P1 (distal) and P2 (proximal). We found no evidence (as would be indicated by cDNA clones or ESTs) in the database for alternative promoter usage among any of the invertebrate Runx genes examined, suggesting that alternative promoters may have evolved in the chordate lineage leading to vertebrates, subsequent to its divergence from urochordates. All known invertebrate Runx gene products begin with long 5'UTRs and N-terminal amino acid sequences that are more like those of the products from the proximal promoter (P2) of the vertebrate genes, suggesting that P2 is the primitive promoter. Definitive resolution of these issues awaits a more comprehensive database of genomes and expressed sequences in appropriate invertebrate systems. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> depicts the transcript structures generated by alternative promoter usage and splicing in the vertebrate Runx genes, and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> shows the N-terminal amino acid sequences derived from each promoter. It is clear from these data that the usage of alternative promoters evolved prior to the gene duplication events in the vertebrate lineage, since all three genes in both mouse and <italic>Takifugu </italic>utilize alternative promoters that give rise to similar alternative N-termini within the respective orthologues.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Alternative transcripts and N-termini produced by transcription from proximal and distal promoters of vertebrate runx genes. </bold>(A) Diagram of alternative transcripts from distal (P1) and proximal (P2) promoters in vertebrate Runx genes.

This suggests that it may be a metazoan (and possibly a bilaterian) invention, and that the genomic regulatory networks through which Runx genes control the fate, proliferation and differentiation of cells are unique to animals.</p><p>(2) The primitive condition in bilaterians is most likely a single Runx gene, represented in the deuterostomes of our collection by the sea urchin <italic>S. purpuratus </italic>and the tunicate <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>, and in the protostomes of our collection by <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Runx gene duplications appear to have occurred independently in the lineages leading to vertebrates (which have at least three Runx genes) and insects (which have three or four Runx genes), suggesting that Runx genes in these latter organisms have probably acquired a number of specialized, taxon-specific regulatory functions (e.g., segmentation in arthropods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], bone development in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], etc.). Thus, studies of Runx genes in sea urchins, tunicates, and nematodes are likely to highlight primitive, pan-bilaterian regulatory functions of this family of genes in the cell biology of animal development.</p><p>(3) The ancestral bilaterian Runx gene was apparently assembled from three exons and contained two introns, one within the sequence that encodes the Runt domain, and a second that borders the sequence encoding the C-terminal end of the Runt domain.</p><p>(4) The ancestor of all three vertebrate Runx genes utilized two alternative promoters that generate alternative N-terminal sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Collection and assembly of previously uncharacterised runx genes</title><p>The <italic>Ciona intestinalis </italic>Runx gene was assembled with sequence files obtained from the Trace Archive database. A "seed" sequence was found in <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>gDNA, Ti 119616831 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>), by a MegaBLAST search using nucleotide sequence encoding exon 3 of <italic>SpRunt </italic>in the NCBI Trace server site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/mmtrace.html"/>. A translation of the seed sequence also showed significant similarity to the Runt domain. The seed sequence showing Runx homology was in turn used as the query to obtain overlapping sequence and those obtained replaced the query. This repetitive BLAST process was continued such that the seed sequence was extended 25 kb in both the 5' and 3' direction relative to the coding orientation of the seed. The intron position assignments were aided by an alignment of the acquired <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>Runx gene with partial cDNA sequences obtained from a TBLASTN search using the <italic>S. purpuratus </italic>SpRunt-1 protein sequence to query the <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>cDNA project site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/indexr1.html"/>. Introns in those regions of the gene upstream of the Runt domain, not found in any cDNA, were manually assigned by spliced alignment, maintaining maximum homologue similarity. Specifically, putative introns were located by searching for the termini of open reading frames, and then positioned in such a way that the resulting open reading frame had maximum similarity to that of a homologous gene while the intron-exon junctions had the expected consensus 5'GT/-AG-3' sequence. A known intron in a similar position in an orthologous gene was considered a validation of correct position assignment. Highly conserved sequence blocks or residues, such as the Runt domain or the C-terminal Groucho-binding site VWRPY, served as anchoring reference points. Multiple overlapping sequences in the <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>contig provided a confidence in the final sequence assembly. Close inspection of the sequence alignments showed no variation among high confidence regions of the sequence where high confidence regions means at least 40&#x02013;50 nucleotides from the end of the read or with few unassigned base calls near the region. The complete absence of sequence variation, the multiple sequence coverage, and the high sequence quality all indicate that no additional Runx genes are present in the <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>genome, which was confirmed by inspection of the recently completed genome at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ciona4/ciona4.home.html"/>.</p><p>Three Runt domain genes in the <italic>A. gambiae </italic>genome and two previously unidentified Runt domain genes in the <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>genome were found by TBLASTN search using the <italic>S. purpuratus </italic>Runt protein sequence as the query. The newly identified <italic>Drosophila </italic>Runx gene sequences (CG1379 and CG15455) are present in a single sequence file (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>) and with opposite coding orientation and were named for this study <italic>RunxA </italic>(CG1379) and <italic>RunxB </italic>(CG15455). No cDNAs specific for the mosquito Runx genes or for the <italic>Drosophila RunxA </italic>or <italic>RunxB </italic>genes was found despite an extensive search, so putative intron positions were manually located in these genes by spliced alignment as described above. Unlike all of the deuterostome genes, the positions of introns among the insect genes were not conserved to the nucleotide, and were thus assigned with less confidence and should hence be considered provisional.</p><p>Three Runx genes were identified in the recently completed <italic>T. rubripes </italic>genome sequence by a TBLASTN search using the <italic>S. purpuratus </italic>Runt protein sequence as the query sequence at the <italic>Fugu </italic>BLAST Server of the UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/blast/"/>. cDNA sequences from the zebrafish (<italic>D. rerio</italic>) were used to place the start of the coding region in the distal promoter of <italic>TrRunx1 </italic>and <italic>TrRunx3</italic>, and cDNA sequences from the teleost <italic>O. laptipes </italic>were used to place the start of the coding region in the distal promoter of <italic>TrRunx2 </italic>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).

Specifically, 100 bootstrap replicates of the alignment were constructed using the SEQBOOT program, and the distances between sequences were computed by the PROTDIST program using the PAM substitution model. Neighbour joining trees were built using the NEIGHBOR program, and the consensus tree was derived using the CONSENSE program. For the maximum-likelihood trees, the experimental versions of the programs PROML (no assumption of molecular clock) and PROMLK (molecular clock assumed) from PHYLIP version 3.6a3 were used with the JTT evolutionary model and with the assumption of constant change rate between sites. The maximum parsimony trees were constructed using the PROTPARS program.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>J.R. performed most of the sequence analysis and drafted early versions of the Figures under the direction of A.J.R.
