These factors are thought to initiate downstream signaling events regulating chromatin structure and function. We identified CDYL1 as an interaction partner of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3). CDYL1 belongs to a family of chromodomain factors found in vertebrates. We show that three different splicing variants of CDYL1, a, b, and c, are differentially expressed in various tissues with CDYL1b being the most abundant variant. Although all three splicing variants share a common C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase-like domain, only CDYL1b contains a functional chromodomain implicated in H3K9me3 binding. A splicing event introducing an N-terminal extension right at the beginning of the chromodomain of CDYL1a inactivates its chromodomain. CDYL1c does not contain a chromodomain at all. Although CDYL1b displays binding affinity to methyl-lysine residues in different sequence context similar to chromodomains in other chromatin factors, we demonstrate that the CDYL1b chromodomain/H3K9me3 interaction is necessary but not sufficient for association of the factor with heterochromatin. Indeed, multimerization of the protein via the enoyl-CoA hydratase-like domain is essential for H3K9me3 chromatin binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and heterochromatin localization <italic>in vivo</italic>. In agreement, overexpression of CDYL1c that can multimerize, but does not interact with H3K9me3 can displace CDYL1b from heterochromatin. Our results imply that multimeric binding to H3K9me3 by CDYL1b homomeric complexes is essential for efficient chromatin targeting. We suggest that similar multivalent binding stably anchors other histone modification binding factors on their target chromatin regions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For packaging the chromosomes of an eukaryotic cell into the nucleus the negatively charged DNA is wrapped around a positively charged octamer of histone proteins consisting of two H2A&#x02013;H2B dimers and one (H3&#x02013;H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer. 147 bp of DNA are wound around one histone octamer forming the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome. N- and C-terminal tails of the histones are protruding out of this structural entity.</p><p>Histones are subject to a plethora of post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Among these methylation of lysine residues plays a special role. Specific sites of lysine methylation as well as distinct stages of lysine methylation are associated with different nuclear processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). For example, trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is found in euchromatic structures, which are open for transcription and are early replicating during S-phase. In contrast trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me3) is accumulated at heterochromatic regions. These are densely packed, mostly transcriptional silent and late replicating in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Whereas histone modifications might directly affect chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), a number of protein domains have been identified that specifically bind certain histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These factors are thought to read-out and translate the effects of individual histone modifications or combinations thereof. Different proteins containing chromodomains have been implicated in binding methylated histone lysine residues preferentially when in higher (tri- and dimethylated) states. For example, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>4</sup></xref> was shown to recognize H3K9me, whereas Polycomb binds H3K27me (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Structural analysis of a number of binding domains has identified aromatic cages of at least three residues as central elements in histone methyl-lysine binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Although the interaction of different protein domains with histone modifications has been well studied <italic>in vitro</italic> using isolated histone tail peptides, the exact parameters by which these proteins are recruited to their target sites on chromatin have not been worked out.</p><p>Recently, a new chromodomain containing group of proteins was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The <italic>cdy</italic> (chromodomain on the Y) family represents a set of related genes in higher eukaryotes. In humans the <italic>CDY</italic> family comprises two autosomal genes, namely <italic>CDYL1</italic> and <italic>CDYL2</italic> as well as multiple gene copies of <italic>CDY</italic> on the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Evolutionary, a common ancestor of the <italic>cdyl</italic> gene appeared first in deuteriostomia. This predecessor was later duplicated to yield the <italic>cdyl1</italic> and <italic>cdyl2</italic> genes. A very recent multiplication of the <italic>cdyl1</italic> gene in the primate lineage lead to multiple <italic>cdy</italic> copies on the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>CDY family proteins have a N-terminal chromodomain, a central hinge region, and a C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase-like (ECH) domain in common (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Recently, we could show that the chromodomains of CDY and CDYL2, which have high sequence similarities with HP1 and Polycomb chromodomains, can recognize di- or trimethylated histone and non-histone lysine residues. The strongest interaction was found for the H3K9me3 modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In contrast, CDYL1 was not able to recognize H3K9me3 because of subtle sequence differences at the very beginning of the chromodomain affecting the first of three aromatic cage residues. Mutagenesis of a few residues at the N terminus of the CDYL1 chromodomain lead to restored binding activity to H3K9me3 peptides <italic>in vitro</italic> and partial relocalization to heterochromatic regions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Other studies indicated that CDYL1 binding to H3K9me3 might be increased after methylation by the histone methyltransferase G9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Interestingly, biochemical pull-down experiments identified CDYL1 as the binding protein of automethylated G9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The exact reasons for the different methyl-lysine binding behavior of CDYL1 are not understood.</p><p>Biochemically, CDYL1 was found in the CoREST complex where it bridges the repressor REST and the histone methyltransferase G9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The ECH-like domain of CDYL1 was shown to interact with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 likely via CoREST association thereby acting as corepressor during transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Conflicting results have suggested that the ECH-like domain of CDY and CDYL1 might constitute a histone acetyltransferase activity in elongating spermatids during hyperacetylation and replacement of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In peroxisomes and mitochondria, trimeric enoyl-CoA hydratases accomplish the hydration of the double bond of fatty acids during &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The functional impact of putative multimerization of ECH-like domains onto the CDY family protein function has not yet been investigated.</p><p>In this study we present results that clarify the different binding abilities reported for CDYL1 to methylated lysine residues. CDYL1 exists in three different splicing variants, a, b, and c. The b form is not only the most abundant splicing variant but is also exclusively able to recognize H3K9me3 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We further demonstrate that the chromodomain of CDYL1 alone is not sufficient to stably bind to H3K9me3 chromatin <italic>in vitro</italic> and to mediate localization to DNA-dense heterochromatic regions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Besides a functional chromodomain multimerization of the ECH-like domain is necessary to bring CDYL1b to heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmids for expression of hCDYL1a were described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). cDNAs corresponding to the open reading frame of hCDYL1b or hCDYL1c were amplified from an EST clone (IMAGE: 6140263) using PCR and cloned into a derivative pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) generating C-terminal fusion to a 2&#x000d7; FLAG-2&#x000d7; HA epitope tag.

Specific proteins were assigned with an arbitrary cut-off of at least three sequenced peptides per protein where at least two peptides had to be unique in sequence (not shown). According to gene ontology analysis, out of the 25 factors 18 have functions in nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide, and nucleic acid metabolic processes. Among these 18 proteins 10 are involved in chromatin maintenance and architecture. The identified chromatin-related factors include the three mammalian HP1 isoforms (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;), CAF1, and surprisingly CDYL1. A total of 12 peptides covering 45.6% of the amino acid sequence of CDYL1 could be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). None of the sequenced peptides could be assigned to the very N-terminal region of the CDYL1 polypeptide (originally described by Lahn <italic>et al.</italic>) (<italic>blue</italic> sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Also, no precursor could be detected in the MS analysis of this particular molecular weight region of the SDS-PAGE gels that matched any tryptic peptide derived from the very N-terminal region. Recent studies have reported a new exon acquisition in the mammalian <italic>cdyl1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Also, we reported that the chromodomain of the originally described CDYL1 polypeptide sequence does not bind to H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). These observations lead us to hypothesize that alternative splicing might generate different CDYL1 protein species with different functionality.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CDYL1 is an H3K9me3 binding factor.</bold><italic>A</italic>, the indicated histone H3 peptides were used in pulldown experiments of HeLa S3 cell nuclear extract.

Similarly, HP1&#x003b2; was found highly enriched in the H3K9me3-associated protein fraction.

The <italic>CDYL1</italic> gene locus contains 10 exons. The previously known CDYL1 mRNA is generated by splicing the first three to the last six exons. From here on, we will refer to this mRNA as CDYL1a as also suggested by Li <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The second splice variant CDYL1b mRNA emerges from exons 4&#x02013;10 and a third variant originates from splicing of exon 4 to exons 6&#x02013;10 of the <italic>CDYL</italic> gene locus (CDYL1c).</p><p>Sequence analysis and domain comparison indicate that the polypeptides corresponding to CDYL1 variants a and b both connect a N-terminal chromodomain via a 238-aa long linker region to a C-terminal ECH-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Due to the described splicing events the CDYL1a protein contains a prolonged N-terminal part. Sequence comparison of the chromodomain of CDYL1 splicing variants a and b with the canonical chromodomain of HP1&#x003b2; reveals high sequence homology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>). However, splicing eliminates the first of three aromatic cage residues from the CDYL1a sequence, as the splicing site is located to the very N terminus of the CDYL1 chromodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>). Mutagenesis of any of the three HP1 aromatic cage residues in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> HP1&#x003b1; protein results in loss of H3K9me interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Mutation of the CDYL1a residues at this position to the corresponding residues in CDY restores H3K9me3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). We therefore conclude that alternative splicing of CDYL1 generates two proteins containing a chromodomain signature with differential H3K9me3 interaction potential. In contrast, CDYL1c lacks the chromodomain region and a 175-aa long part of the linker region altogether.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>CDYL1b is the major splicing variant.</bold><italic>A</italic>, schematic representation of the protein domain structure of CDYL1 splicing variants a, b, and c. <italic>CD</italic>, chromodomain. <italic>B</italic>, mRNA levels of CDYL1 splicing variants a, b, and c in human cell lines HEK293 and HeLa S3 as well as in the indicated human tissues were analyzed using real time PCR.

Although the CDYL1a chromodomain had very little affinity for the H3K9me3 peptide over the unmodified counterpart, the CDYL1b chromodomain displayed significant affinity to H3K9me3 but discriminated against the unmodified H3 peptide. In agreement with the results from the pulldown assays, the chromodomain of CDYL1b was found to interact the strongest with the H3K9me3 peptide (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic> for a summary of all binding data).

Similar to HP1, weaker interaction with the dimethylated (1.5-fold) and monomethylated (4-fold) forms of this site as well as with the H3K27 methylation marks was seen. The chromodomain of CDYL1b recognized H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 peptides with much lower affinity.</p><p>A phosphate on serine 10 (H3S10) next to H3K9me3 abolished the affinity of the CDYL1b chromodomain for this modification.

We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) have shown previously that this phosphorylation event delocalizes HP1 from heterochromatin during M-phase. In agreement with a putative regulation of CDYL1b chromatin association by a &#x0201c;methyl-phos switch&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), immunofluorescence analysis of CDYL1b during mitosis showed the absence of the protein from condensed chromatin during M-phase (data not shown).</p><p>Previous studies had identified CDYL1 as the binding partner of automethylation of the G9a histone methyltransferase on lysine 185.

In contrast, the chromodomain of CDYL1a showed no interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>).

Because 15&#x02013;20-aa long peptides do not represent the targeting and binding situation of CDYL1 in the cell, we wanted to analyze H3K9me3 binding of CDYL1b in the context of chromatin. Therefore, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin reconstitution system that makes use of uniformly K9me3-modified H3 obtained by native protein ligation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.052332/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).

Suv3&#x02013;9h1 and Suv3&#x02013;9h2 are known as main enzymes establishing the H3K9me3 modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Therefore, MEF Suv3&#x02013;9h1/h2 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) double knock-out cells show a strongly reduced amount of H3K9me3.

Although the absence of Suv3&#x02013;9h1/h2 neither impacted CDYL1a nor CDYL1c subnuclear localization, distribution of CDYL1b was significantly different compared with the wild type situation. CDYL1b did not localize to the DNA-dense heterochromatic areas, but showed a diffuse appearance in the nucleus.

Also, the chromodomain connected to the following hinge region of the CDYL1 protein (chromohinge) showed no overlap with the DNA-dense regions enriched in H3K9me3. As predicted due to the absence of an H3K9me3 binding domain, the CDYL1b construct missing the chromodomain (hingeECH) showed no preferential localization to heterochromatin. In contrast, the chromodomain connected to the CDYL1c splicing variant (chromoCDYL1c) displayed a dotted localization within the nucleus overlapping with H3K9me3-dense areas. When this chromoCDYL1c construct lacks the very C-terminal part, the spotted distribution is abolished. This 73-aa region at the very C terminus of CDYL1c is necessary for multimerization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>D</italic>). From this analysis we conclude that the chromodomain of CDYL1b is necessary but not sufficient to localize the protein to H3K9me3 chromatin. Additionally, multimerization of the protein is required to anchor CDYL1b to heterochromatic regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of CDYL1c Can Displace CDYL1b from H3K9me3 Heterochromatin</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref><italic>D</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref><italic>A</italic>, CDYL1c can interact with itself forming multimers but is not able to localize to H3K9me3 chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>. We reasoned that CDYL1c could form complexes with CDYL1b thereby negatively regulating CDYL1b chromatin association. Therefore, we transfected myc-tagged CDYL1c and HA-tagged CDYL1b into MEF WT cells at different plasmid ratios. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic> shows coexpression of CDYL1c at a 1:1 ratio did not impair CDYL1b localization to the DNA-dense foci of pericentric heterochromatin. In contrast, 80&#x02013;90% of MEF cells transfected with CDYL1c:CDYL1b at a 100:1 plasmid ratio showed delocalization of CDYL1b from heterochromatin displaying a diffuse CDYL1b signal in the nucleoplasm. Importantly, coexpression of CDYL1c&#x00394;Cterm, which is neither able to localize to H3K9me3 nor to multimerize with full-length CDYL1b (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>D</italic>), did not have a similar negative effect on CDYL1b localization to heterochromatin. These experiments further sustain the interpretation that an intact chromodomain and multimerization is required for CDYL1b heterochromatin localization.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our detailed analysis of CDYL1 function in the context of H3K9me binding has the following implications: (i) different splicing variants a, b, and c of CDYL1 bind differentially to methylated lysine residues in histones and other proteins. (ii) CDYL1b chromodomain/H3K9me3 interaction is not sufficient for association of the factor with heterochromatin. (iii) Multimerization of CDYL1b is necessary for stable H3K9me3 chromatin association <italic>in vitro</italic> and for H3K9 heterochromatin localization <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The originally described CDYL1 polypeptide corresponds to the less abundant CDYL1a splicing variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). CDYL1 was identified and described in different experiments interacting with methylated lysine residues in histones and G9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Although the CDYL1 splicing variant was not specified, interaction in the case of methylated G9a could not be verified using recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We think that it is likely that CDYL1a and not CDYL1b was used in these studies. Indeed, the chromodomains of both CDYL1b and CDYL1a after restoration of the aromatic cage by mutagenesis bind a methylated G9a peptide with affinity comparable with methylated histone peptides <italic>in vitro</italic> (this study and see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). At present, it is unclear whether the N-terminal extension of CDYL1a compared with CDYL1b brings additional functionality to the protein, potentially establishing a different role for the methyl-lysine binding deficient chromodomain.</p><p>Biochemical evidence has been provided that places CDYL1 as a bridge between G9a and REST in a WIZ and histone modifying enzymes containing corepressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Although direct interaction of CDYL1 and G9a could be demonstrated using recombinant proteins, it is tempting to speculate that this interaction is <italic>in vivo</italic> further controlled by G9a automethylation and CDYL1b chromodomain binding. Methylation of CDYL1 might also play a role because <italic>in vitro</italic> G9a can target CDYL1 for methylation at a lysine residue C-terminal to the chromodomain. It has been suggested that this post-translational modification might negatively regulate the CDYL1/H3K9me3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, as the observed effect was only 2-fold and as CDYL1a was used for these studies, the exact relation of G9a, CDYL1, and their methylation within the REST-CoREST complex needs further investigation. In any case, it has to be noted that a large fraction of CDYL1b exists outside of the REST-CoREST complex, likely targeting other methyl-lysine residues (see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>Besides the chromodomain the ECH-like domain is likely central to CDYL1 and CDY protein family function. These regions show a very high degree of conservation, whereas the linking hinge region is more variable. It was originally suggested that the ECH-like domain of CDY and CDYL1 might have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, structural analysis and modeling makes it unlikely that acetyl-CoA is indeed a substrate of the CDYL1 ECH-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Indeed, we have failed to reproduce histone acetyltransferase activity of CDY family proteins.<sup>5</sup> Nevertheless, it was found that the CDYL1 ECH-like domain interacts with CoA. Although CoA can indeed be modeled onto the structure of CDYL1 it remains to be determined whether CoA is a substrate, substrate carrier, or possibly an allosteric regulator.</p><p>Our studies indicate that a major function of the ECH-like domain resides in multimerization. Indeed, only CDYL1 that can interact with itself is directed to H3K9me3 heterochromatin, but a functional chromodomain on itself is not capable of this targeting. Although the CDYL1b chromodomain/H3K9me3 interaction at 2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> is comparable with other chromodomain methylhistone peptide interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), it is nevertheless, weak. We hypothesize that CDYL1b protein multimerization generates a multivalent binding mode that significantly enhances interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Similar behavior has been suggested for HP1, which dimerizes via a C-terminal chromoshadow domain. Mutations that affect HP1 dimerization as well as overexpression of the chromoshadow domain alone cause dissociation of HP1 from heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Further studies are required to directly analyze and quantify the impact of ECH-like domain multimerization onto CDYL1b/H3K9me3 chromatin binding.</p><p>Our results also show that multimerization of CDYL1 might not be limited to the ECH-like domain, but could also be mediated by additional regions of the protein. Although it is currently unclear how many CDYL1 polypeptides do associate to form chromatin binding complexes, structural analysis of the homologous CDY has found evidence for hexamerization beyond trimerization (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2fw2">2fw2</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Obviously, stronger chromatin interaction will result from the presence of extra H3K9me3 binding sites if additional associations are sterically possible. Indeed, multiple histone modification binding domains in complexes or multimerization of individual chromatin readout factors could be key in reading and translating histone modifications by establishing robust interaction. Enhancement of binding via multimerization could possibly explain the obvious strong targeting of CDYL1b to sites of H3K9me3 <italic>in vivo</italic> compared with not much weaker binding to H3K27me3 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Another aspect of CDYL1b multimerization besides generating binding strength could be affecting chromatin structure and behavior by binding multiple regions simultaneously. Although multivalent binding of chromatin factors to histone modifications has not yet been demonstrated and whereas effects of multiple binding events have not been analyzed, we wonder whether such interaction could be involved in establishing or maintaining higher order chromatin structures. In this sense CDYL1 might act as a chromatin architectural protein enhancing the transition of 10-nm fibers to 30-nm structures and higher order chromatin arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported in whole or in part by the Max Planck Society and the European Union FP6, Network of Excellence, &#x0201c;The Epigenome.&#x0201d;</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN2"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.052332/DC1">supplemental Figs.
