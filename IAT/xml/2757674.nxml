As protein synthesis is a dynamic process that is under the control of multiple translational mechanisms, however, it is still elusive how these mechanisms are recruited in response to learning for memory consolidation. Here we found that eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) was dramatically dephosphorylated within 0.5&#x02013;2 hr in the hippocampus and amygdala of mice following training in a fear-conditioning test, whereas genome-wide microarrays did not reveal any significant change in the expression level of the mRNAs for translational machineries or their related molecules. Moreover, blockade of NMDA receptors with MK-801 immediately following the training significantly impeded both the post-training eEF-2 dephosphorylation and memory retention. Notably, with an elegant sophisticated transgenic strategy, we demonstrated that hippocampus-specific overexpression of eEF-2 kinase, a kinase that specifically phosphorylates and hence inactivates eEF-2, significantly inhibited protein synthesis in the hippocampus, and this effects was more robust during an &#x0201c;ongoing&#x0201d; protein synthesis process. As a result, late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the hippocampus and long-term hippocampus-dependent memory in the mice were significantly impaired, whereas short-term memory and long-term hippocampus-independent memory remained intact. These results reveal a novel translational underpinning for protein synthesis pertinent to memory consolidation in the mammalian brain.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The process of learning and memory may be divided into several sequential steps, including acquisition, consolidation, storage, and retrieval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Abel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Mayes1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. As the initial step, acquisition requires the brain to be at a higher arousal level in order to acquire new information as much as possible. However, only a very small portion of the acquired information may be further processed in the brain for long-term storage, a process that is called memory consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-McGaugh1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Consolidated memory traces are then transferred to certain brain regions such as the cortex for long-term storage. As consolidated information is retrievable over hours, days, months, and even up to the whole lifetime, this type of memory, called long-term memory, plays an essential role in human intelligent life. In contrast, information that does not undergo a consolidating process can only last for seconds or minutes. This type of memory is called short-term memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Richardson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Bourtchuladze1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Without any doubt, to explore the molecular and neuronal mechanisms underlying memory consolidation is not only fundamental for our understanding of how acquired information is encoded in the brain but also insightful for disclosing how long-term memory formation could be impaired even though the acquisition is normal. This is of particular interest, as this kind of mnemonic dysfunction is often observed in many pathological conditions and clinical entities such as abnormal aging, mental retardation, and an early stage of neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Germano1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Lombroso1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A milestone over the past century for the studies of learning and memory is the demonstration that <italic>de novo</italic> new protein synthesis is required for memory consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Davis1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Gold1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, although recent evidence indicates that post-translational modifications of certain existing proteins may also be important for early consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Holahan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This milestone has been established based essentially on the studies with the use of pharmacological/neurosurgical approaches. For example, post-training infusion of a protein synthesis inhibitor such as anisomycin into the hippocampus, amygdala, and motor cortex of the animals significantly impairs hippocampal, emotional, and motor memory, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Quevedo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Schafe1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. An important advantage of the use of those approaches is the feasibility for both the temporal-specificity (within a special time window during the process of learning and memory) and spatial-specificity (targeting on a particular brain region), both of which allow a real-time/on-site coupling analysis of learning behavior in free-moving animals. However, as protein synthesis itself is a series of complicated biochemical reactions, it is still unclear how a neuronal process (learning) bridges to these biochemical reactions in the brain.</p><p>In mammalian cells, protein synthesis is mediated by interactions between a target mRNA and translational machineries including ribosomal proteins, eukaryote initiation factors (eIFs), and eukaryote elongation factors (eEFs). Upon mRNAs available, eIFs such as eIF4E recognize and bind to a target mRNA, and then eEFs such as eEF-2 mediate the polypeptide elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Gingras1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Browne1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, the activities of these translational machineries are regulated by many other molecules such as eEF-2 kinase (eEF-2K), eIF-binding proteins, etc. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Gingras1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Browne1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, all of which are called &#x0201c;translational machinery-related molecules&#x0201d; here. An important regulatory mechanism for most of these molecules is phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein-1 by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), for example, activates eIF4E, and consequently, promotes protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Raught1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Schalm1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation of eEF-2 by eEF-2K inactivates eEF-2 and therefore, significantly inhibits protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Ryazanov1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, although the effect of eEF-2K might depend on certain condition in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Dorovkov1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is therefore reasonably to speculate that an alteration in either the expression level or the phosphorylation state of these translational machineries or their related molecules including eEF-2K may significantly change the process of protein synthesis, which in turn may facilitate or impede a particular long-lasting biological process such as memory consolidation.</p><p>In this report, we provide compelling evidence at the molecular, pharmacological, genetic, and behavioral levels that post-training dephosphorylation of eEF-2 is a key translational mechanism for protein synthesis pertinent to memory consolidation in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Post-training expression of mRNAs for translational machineries and their related molecules in brains of mice following training in a fear-conditioning test (FCT)</title><p>The FCT is the most commonly used behavioral paradigm for the studies of long-lasting fear memory in the rodent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-LeDoux1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to determine whether training in the FCT altered the expression of translational machineries or/and their related molecules in the brain regions that are critically involved in consolidating fear memory, genome-wide cDNA microarrays were used to screen gene expression profiles in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex.

After normalization to the NC level, about 25&#x02013;35&#x00025;, 24&#x02013;38&#x00025;, and 3&#x02013;7&#x00025; of eEF-2 was dephosphorylated in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), and cortex (data not shown), respectively, and an ANOVA revealed a significant difference in dephospho-eEF-2 between trained and control mice in either the hippocampus &#x0005b;F(1,4)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7.39; p&#x0003c;0.01&#x0005d; or amygdala &#x0005b;F(1,4)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9.07; p&#x0003c;0.01&#x0005d;, but not in the cortex. Post-hoc tests revealed significant differences (p&#x0003c;0.05 or 0.01) between trained group and every control group, but not between any two control groups. For the total eEF-2 level (phospho-eEF-2 and dephospho-eEF-2), neither an observable difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2A and D</xref>) nor a statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2C and F</xref>) was noted in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2A and C</xref>), amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2D and F</xref>), or cortex (data not shown) between trained and control mice. Moreover, at 2 hr after the training, a very similar pattern of dephopho-eEF-2 and the total eEF-2 level to those observed at 30 min after the training was found in both the hippocampus and amygdala, together with no any significant change in both of the dephopho-eEF-2 and total eEF-2 level in the cortex (data not shown). Four hours after the training, the dephospho-eEF-2 in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2G and H</xref>) and amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2G and I</xref>) returned to the pre-training level, indicating that there was a time window for the dephosphorylation. Similarly, the phospho-eEF-2 in the cortex and the total eEF-2 level in all these three brain regions were not significantly different between trained and control mice. All these results indicated that the dephospho-eEF-2, but not the change in its expression level, in both the hippocampus and amygdala was temporally but significantly associated with post-training while this change was not noted in the cortex.</p><fig id="pone-0007424-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007424.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Dephospho-eEF-2 in both the hippocampus and amygdala is temporally associated with post-training.</title><p>A.

Accordingly, a Cre/loxP recombination system and a transcriptional silencing strategy were used to generate hip-eEF-2K-tg mice. Two independent transgenic mouse strains, eEF-2K transgenic mice and Cre transgenic mice, were needed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007424.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The eEF-2K transgenic mice were featured by Cre recombination-dependent deletion of a transcriptional stop signal that located upstream of the eEF-2K transgene so that the transgene would only express in the cells or brain region where Cre expressed. Fortunately, as the Cre expression in our Cre transgenic mice was limited to neurons in most parts of the hippocampus, Cre/eEF-2K double transgenic mice exhibited hippocampus-specific eEF-2K overexpression, which was evidenced by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g004">Figure 4A to D</xref>).

The use of MK-801 then revealed that both post-training dephospho-eEF-2 and memory consolidation were neuronal activity-dependent, and that there was a functional link between these two events. At the last, by using a unique transgenic mouse model, we have documented that the post-training dephospho-eEF-2 is a molecular underpinning for protein synthesis pertinent to memory consolidation.</p><p>New protein synthesis is required for various forms of long-lasting synaptic plasticity. Although the exact mechanisms might be different in different forms of plasticity, protein synthesis itself is basically under the control of both the transcriptional and translational actions. At the transcriptional level, the expression of mRNAs may directly affect protein synthesis at a number of ways. For example, a changed expression level of the translational machineries or their related molecules such as a up-regulation of mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Chenal1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> or a down-regulation of eEF-2K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Diggle1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> may facilitate the overall translational activity. However, our genome-wide screening study did not reveal any evidence to support that this is the case for memory consolidation. Another way is that the expression of certain mRNAs may directly lead to new protein synthesis. We indeed found that the expression of certain genes such as c-fos and BDNF was up regulated following the behavioral training, which is consistent with many other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-DAgata1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Vecsey1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Because the expression of c-fos and BDNF is critically involved in memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Reijmers1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Miyashita1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, and because most of these up-regulated transcripts may be further processed for protein synthesis, the expression of these genes may certainly contribute to memory consolidation. However, evidence indicates that the expression of these non-translational machinery-related molecules is unable to fully explain how protein synthesis is regulated for memory consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Richter1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Allison1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The finding that the training facilitates dephospho-eEF-2 sheds light on a new translational mechanism, which has been validated from several angles in this study. First, the dephospho-eEF-2 is coincided in the hippocampus and amygdala, both brain regions are importantly involved in consolidating fear memories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-LeDoux1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the post-training antagonism of NMDA receptors is able to concurrently block the dephosphorylation and memory consolidation, indicating a functional link between them. Third, as the NMDA receptor is the most important excitatory machinery in the brain, this concurrent effect indicates that both the post-training dephospho-eEF-2 and memory consolidation are neuronal activity-dependent, which is also supported by other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Carroll1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Fourth, blockade of the dephospho-eEF-2 by the eEF-2K transgene dramatically inhibits protein synthesis, and this effect is more robust during an ongoing protein synthesis process that is associated with neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Given that both neuronal activity and protein synthesis are critically involved in memory consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Schafe1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-LeDoux1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, a stronger effect during an ongoing protein synthesis process than during the general conditions provides a basis to identify whether a dynamic process of protein synthesis is more importantly required for memory consolidation. Indeed, we found that while these transgenic mice looked undistinguishable from their wild-type littermates at the overall level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007424.s002">Figure S2</xref>), both L-LTP and long-term hippocampus-dependent memory were significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g008">Figure 8</xref>). All these results indicate that the post-training dephospho-eEF-2 plays a critical role in triggering memory consolidation-associated protein synthesis.</p><p>It should be mentioned that previous studies have found that the phospho-eEF-2 occurs within 15 min following the activation of NMDA receptors, and this phosphorylation is accompanied by protein synthesis inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we found here that the antagonism of NMDA receptor led to phospho-eEF-2 at 2 hr after the treatment. Therefore, we suggest that there might be two distinct phases, an early phase of phospho-eEF-2 and a late phase of dephospho-eEF-2, following the activation of NMDA receptors. Indeed, a late phase of dephospho-eEF-2, together with an enhanced overall protein synthesis, was found in those previous studies too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. This &#x0201c;two-phase theory&#x0201d; may explain why the phospho-eEF-2 and inhibition of protein synthesis were observed within 1 hr after LTP production in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Chotiner1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, while in our study, it is supposingly that the L-LTP (after 3 hr) should be featured by an increase in dephospho-eEF-2. Another issue is about the effect of phospho-eEF-2. Although the overall protein synthesis is inhibited after the phospho-eEF-2, the expression of several specific molecules including Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK-II) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, Arc, and c-Fos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Chotiner1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> is up-regulated, which is inconsistent to our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Given that (1) the increase of CaMK-II is found at the synaptic level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>; (2) the expression of Arc and c-Fos may facilitate transcriptions of other genes; and (3) the increase of the translation of Arc and c-Fos occurs at the early phase of the phospho-eEF-2, a &#x0201c;synaptic competition&#x0201d; theory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> might explain for this discrepancy, that is the up-regulation of Arc and c-Fos in their studies may represent a competitive mechanism for a late phase enhancement of protein synthesis. In our transgenic mice, as the transgene is constitutively expressed and as the phospho-eEF-2 is persistently higher, this compensative mechanism no longer exists, and thus the translation of Arc and c-Fos is inhibited. Regarding why a protein synthesis inhibitor could block early-phase LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-KelleherRJ1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Banko1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, while the deficit in our transgenic mice was only observed at the L-LTP, it might be due to a different neuronal activity between these different conditions. The use of a protein synthesis inhibitor is generally accompanied by a higher synaptic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Fonseca1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, while in our transgenic mice, the synaptic function may be persistently lower due to the constitutive transgene expression and thus, we could not identify a significant effect on the early-phase LTP.</p><p>Another important insight from the current study is that our study has demonstrated the requirement of new protein synthesis for memory consolidation from different angles. As described above, the role of protein synthesis in memory consolidation was originally established based on pharmacological studies with protein synthesis inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Luft1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Schafe1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Debiec1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Because the inhibitors are able to break the &#x0201c;chain&#x0201d; of the protein synthesis reaction, protein synthesis cannot be completed, which, in turn, renders the process of consolidation impaired. Virtually, all of those studies were essentially looking at the &#x0201c;consequences after the chain is broken&#x0201d;, but could not look into &#x0201c;how the chain works under the normal condition&#x0201d;. Recently, studies focusing on translational mechanisms have revealed some new insights. For example, either pharmacologically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Blundell1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Helmstetter1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> or genetically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Hoeffer1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref> blocking mTOR in the animals impairs memory consolidation. However, those studies are essentially similar to the pharmacological studies described above since those studies could not identify an active process that triggers protein synthesis for memory consolidation. In contrast, dephospho-eEF-2 following the behavioral training represents an active molecular process in the brain, and blocking this process leads to impairments in both L-LTP and long-term memory formation.</p><p>Why eEF-2 is dephosphorylated following the behavioral training is still unclear. Based on the findings that dephospho-eEF-2 is neuronal activity-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Scheetz1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Carroll1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Steward1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, together with our findings that antagonism of NMDA receptors prevents both dephospho-eEF-2 and memory consolidation, we have reasons to speculate that this dephosphorylation is learning-triggered neuronal activity-dependent. Previous studies did find that phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6 kinase was increased following training, but they could not demonstrate whether the phosphorylation itself was essential, since they did not have an approach to specifically block the phosphorylation in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Bekinschtein1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the role of both eIF and eEF in protein synthesis, the dephospho-eEF-2 might not be the only mechanism. Recent evidence indeed indicated that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of eIF was importantly involved in memory consolidation, while the results were inconsistent. Reduced phosphorylation of eIF2a by point mutation or by knocking out GCN2 (an eIF2a inhibitor) enhanced and impaired long-term memory, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Sutton1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-CostaMattioli1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-CostaMattioli2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that either the role of eIF is still unclear or that there may be a bi-directional role for phosphorylation of eIF in regulating protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-CostaMattioli1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, our studies have consistently shown the role of post-training dephospho-eEF-2 in memory consolidation from the behavioral, pharmacological, and genetic levels. Importantly, as eEF-2K-mediated phospho-eEF-2 is a major mechanism for the control of the rate of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Ryazanov2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, post-training dephospho-eEF-2 may represent a fundamental mechanistic process that leads other translation mechanisms to promote protein synthesis for consolidation of newly learned information.</p><p>We need to point out that the effects of the transgene in the current study do not actually indicate the role of a single gene in memory consolidation, and do not essentially explore the role of a genetic basis for learning and memory in this study, as many other studies did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Flint1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Crawley1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. The high expression level of the transgene should not be a &#x0201c;physiological condition&#x0201d; in anyway. However, this high expression level could be used as a tool to prevent training-induced dephospho-eEF-2 in a specific brain region&#x02013;the hippocampus. The results of this blockage suggested that there might be a mechanism that works at the network level to control the process of learning and memory, especially memory consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Flint2">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>.

The total RNA was extracted from the hippocampi and amygdalae with Trizol (Invitrogen) and was purified with RNEasy columns (Qiagen). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using the SuperScript&#x000ae; III First-Strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). All samples were hybridized in duplicate to Affymetrix 420 2.0 Array Chips, which was conducted by the Core Facility at the University of Chicago.

To exclude any non-specific effects, four control conditions were designed: na&#x000ef;ve control (NC; mice were sacrificed without any treatment), shock control (SC; mice were sacrificed immediately after receiving the US), contextual control (CC; mice were sacrificed 30 min, 2 hr, or 4 hr after being exposed to the shock chamber for 5 min but without shock), and tone control (TC; mice were sacrificed 30 min, 2 hr, or 4 hr after being exposed to the CS). A total of 100 &#x000b5;g of protein lysates from each sample was separated by an SDS-PAGE (8&#x00025;) and then was transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with either anti-phospho-eEF-2 antibody (1&#x02236;2,000) or anti-total eEF-2 antibody (1&#x02236;2,000; all from Cell Signaling and Technology Laboratories), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1&#x02236;4,000; Jackson ImmunoReseach). Blotting signal was visualized with the ECL detection system (Pierce). The same membranes were re-probed to anti-&#x003b2;-actin antibody (1&#x02236;10000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc). Densitometry was performed using Image J Analysis software (version 1.39c). The phosphorylation ratio (&#x00025;) was calculated as: (total eEF-2 - phospho-eEF-2)/total eEF-2 X 100. In order to minimize the artificial signal, the exposure time was the same for the membranes used to detect the total eEF-2 and phospho-eEF-2. The dephospho-eEF-2 ratio (&#x00025;) after the training was calculated as: &#x0005b;phospho-eEF-2 of naive hippocampus (or amygdala) - phospho-eEF-2 of trained hippocampus (or amygdala)/phospho-eEF-2 of naive (or amygdala) X 100&#x00025;&#x0005d;.

The expression level in each sample was normalized to the expression level of &#x003b2;-actin before the calculation.

Both contextual and cued conditionings were examined at 2 hr or 24 hr after the MK-801 treatment with two separate sets of mice. The procedures for memory retention test are described below. Another three groups of mice (na&#x000ef;ve/vehicle, training/MK-801, and training/vehicle) were used for immunoblotting experiments, in order to determine the phospho-eEF-2 level as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Generation of hip-eEF-2K-tg mice</title><p>An advanced transgenic approach was used in this study. Two independent transgenic mouse strains were needed. One was Cre transgenic mouse strain, in which the expression of the Cre recombinase was under the control of &#x02202;-CaMK-II promoter. An 8.5 kb of &#x02202;-CaMK-II promoter was used to drive a 2.6 kb of <italic>Not I</italic> transgene cassette that consisted of a 0.6 kb exon-intron splicing signal, a 0.4 kb element encoding a nuclear localization signal (pBS317), a 1.029 kb Cre cDNA, and a 0.6 kb poly-A signals (pNN265). All these components were subcloned into a pBS(&#x02212;) vector. Due to some locus effects, the random insertion of &#x02202;-CaMK-II promoter into the mouse genome could generate different expression patterns of the transgene. In our Cre transgenic mice, the expression of Cre was exclusively observed in most parts of the hippocampus. The other mouse strain was eEF-2K transgenic mice, in which the expression of the eEF-2K transgene was under the control of a chicken &#x003b2;-actin promoter so that the transgene would express in all types of cells. However, a transcriptional silencer (stop sequence) was put upstream of the eEF-2K cDNA to silence its transcription. Moreover, this stop sequence was flanked by two loxP elements. A recombination by the Cre recombinase led to the deletion of the stop sequence so that the expression of the eEF-2K transgene occurred in the brain regions where Cre expressed. The eEF-2K cDNA was cloned from the total RNA extracted from a brain of a B6/CBA F1 mouse with the primers of <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCA ACA TGG CAG ACG AAG ACC TCA TC-3&#x02032;</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; GGG GCA GTT ATT CCT CCA TCT GGG CC-3&#x02032;</named-content>. The cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. The eEF-2K cDNA was flanked by an artificial intron and SV-40 poly-A signal, all from pNN265, in order to ensure a correct translation and to make the transgene distinguishable from the endogenous eEF-2K gene. Embryo donors and foster mothers were all from B6/CBA F1 mice (Jackson Laboratory), in order to (1) have a similar genomic background between transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates, (2) have a better genetic background for behavioral analysis, and (3) have a comparable genetic background to the non-transgenic studies as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007424-g002">Figure 2</xref>. After being linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes, the expression cassette was injected into the pro-nuclei of B6/CBA F1 zygotes to produce transgenic founders. The transgene copy number in the founders was determined by Southern blots (data not shown). In order to have a higher expression level of the eEF-2K transgene, a founder with a gene copy number of about 12 of the eEF-2K transgene was bred into Cre transgenic mice to produce double transgenic mice. The genotypes of mice were determined by PCR analyses of the genomic DNA from the tails, which respectively detected the Cre transgene and the eEF-2K transgene.</p><p><italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.

Coronal brain sections (40 &#x000b5;m) were made with the Cryostat and were then used for Nissl (cresyl violet) staining. For Golgi-impregnated staining, mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 0.9&#x00025; saline followed by 4&#x00025; PFA. Brains were kept in Golgi-Cox solution with light-tighten for 6 days and then in 30&#x00025; sucrose for another 2&#x02013;3 days. Brains were mounted on sectioning stages with cyanocacrylic glue. A vibratome (Leica, VT1200) was used to make brain sections (200 &#x000b5;m), which were then mounted onto 2&#x00025; gelatinized microscope slides. Once mounted, the blotted slides were kept in a humidity chamber until ready to be stained.

Behavioral responses were observed in their homecages and these five groups of mice were then sacrificed at a time-course of 5, 30, 60 120, and 180 min after the KA-treatment. The total RNA and protein lysates were extracted from the whole hippocampi of mice. Real-time RT-PCR (Applied Biosystem, 7900th) was used to determine the mRNA expression level for Arc and c-fos. Two customized fluorescence-labeled probes that recognized Arc and c-fos, respectively, were used. After RT, each reaction contained 5 &#x000b5;l Taqman Universal PCR Mastermix in a total volume of 10 &#x000b5;l containing 1.25 &#x000b5;l RT production. PCR reactions were conducted under the condition of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 30 sec at 95&#x000b0;C and 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C. The expression levels for both Arc and c-fos were normalized with 18S rRNA level. Final quantitative analysis was based on two measures (duplicate samples) in each mouse with a total of at least 4 mice in each group. Western blots were used to determine the expression of Arc and c-Fos at the protein level as described above. The concentrations of the anti-Arc antibody and anti-c-Fos antibody were both at 1&#x02236;2000 and these antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. The amount of protein loading was normalized by &#x003b2;-actin immunoblotting. Quantitative analysis was based on two measures in each mouse and in each group at least 5 mice were examined.

For the FCT, both wild-type and hip-eEF-2K-tg mice (2&#x02013;3 months old, with both female and male mice mixed) were trained with a one-trial protocol. For short-term memory, a retention test was conducted 30 min after the training. Both contextual and cued conditionings were examined. For contextual conditioning, mice were individually put back into the chamber where they received CS/US pairing, and freezing responses were recorded for 5 min with a sampling method at an interval of 5 sec. For cued conditioning, mice were individually put into a novel chamber and 3 min later, the same tone that was used during the training session was delivered for 3 min. Freezing responses were recorded in both pre-tone and during-tone periods. Freezing was defined as no movement of any part of the body, except for respiration. For long-term memory, every test was the same as described above, except for that the intervals between the training and retention test were 1 day and 10 days, respectively, with the use of two separate sets of animals. For the Morris water-maze test, a water tank with 1 meter in diameter and a computerized video-tracking system were used. A training protocol of 5 training sessions was used. Each training session per day contained 4 trials, with each trial lasting for 60 sec. The order of the quadrants for each mouse being released into the water tank was randomly designed for each session. The interval between each two trials was about 1 hr. After each trial, mice were towel dried and were immediately returned to their homecages. Escape latency to the platform, swimming speed, and swimming path were automatically recorded and the data were analyzed by a Nodel navigation tracking system (EthoVision, Pro-Noldus). One probe test was conducted 24 hr after the completion of all training sessions. During the probe test, the platform was removed, and mice were individually allowed to swimming in the pool for 60 sec. Time spent in each quadrant and times crossing over the place that the platform was previously located during the training sessions were recorded to determine long-term spatial memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Open-field behaviors in hip-eEF-2K-tg mice</title><p>Open-field behaviors were examined by using an automatic-recording open-field working station (MED Associates, Georgia, VT) as described in our previous publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007424-Chen2">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>.
