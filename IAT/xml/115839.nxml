Its major biological role in the bacterial cell is the removal of excessive negative supercoils from DNA to maintain the DNA at optimal superhelical density along with DNA gyrase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 97 kDa and the active site tyrosine responsible for DNA cleavage is found in the 67 kDa N-terminal transesterification domain. The structure of this 67 kDa domain has been determined by X-ray crystallography to be torus-like, indicating the need for protein conformational change for strand passage to take place after DNA cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Relaxation activity requires the presence of the Zn(II) binding tetracysteine motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] found between the 67 kDa N-terminal domain (Top67) and the 14 kDa C-terminal single-stranded DNA binding domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The three tetracysteine motifs do not form a stably folded structure on its own, but when combined with the 14 kDa C-terminal domain, forms a stably folded 268 amino acid DNA binding domain (ZD domain) that has higher affinity for single-stranded DNA than the 121 amino acid 14 kDa C-terminal region by itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent sequence and structural analysis suggests that the 14 kDa domain is evolutionarily related to the three tetracysteine motifs and belongs to the zinc ribbon family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The ZD domain in <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I probably evolved from a domain that binds five Zn(II) originally.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Domain organization of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA topoisomerase I.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-3-13-1"/></fig><p>Removal of negative supercoils from DNA by bacterial type IA topoisomerase involves the following steps: (1) binding of the enzyme to the junction of double-stranded and single-stranded DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; (2) cleavage of a single-strand of DNA near the junction with cleavage sequence preference of a cytosine in the -4 position to form the covalent intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; (3) conformational change of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex to result in physical separation of the 5' phosphate covalently linked to the active tyrosine, and the 3' hydroxyl of the cleaved DNA; (4) passage of the complementary single strand through the break; (5) enzyme conformational change to bring the 5' phosphoryl end back into the proximity of the 3' hydroxyl group of the cleaved DNA; (6) religation of the phosphodiester bond. Although it is known that the ZD domain can function as a DNA binding domain, its exact role in these individual steps of removal of a negative superhelical turn from DNA by <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I remains to be defined. Using purified 67 kDa transesterification domain and 30 kDa ZD domain, results from experiments described here provide new insight into the action of these two individual domains in the enzyme mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Partial restoration of relaxation activity from mixing of Top67 and ZD domains</title><p>As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the N-terminal transesterification domain Top67 by itself did not exhibit any relaxation activity when assayed with negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). The 30 kD C-terminal ZD domain also had no relaxation activity by itself, as expected. Partial relaxation of the input supercoiled DNA was detected when Top67 was mixed with the ZD domain prior to addition of DNA. A ratio of 2 ZD molecules added for each Top67 was found to be sufficient for maximum relaxation activity, with no increase in activity when higher ratio of ZD/Top67 was used (data not shown). The specific activity observed under this optimized condition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) was still about 10 fold lower than that of the intact enzyme. Analysis of the time course of relaxation with 6 pmoles of topoisomerase I or top67 reconstituted with ZD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>) showed that negative supercoils were removed at a much slower rate by the reconstituted activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Partial restoration of relaxation activity by complementation of Top67 and ZD domains.</bold> (a).

The half maximal binding values based on the average of results from three different experiments were 0.02 &#x003bc;M for Top67 and 0.04 &#x003bc;M for the ZD domain. However, with the same oligonucleotide in a duplex form (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), Top67 exhibited much higher affinity (half maximal binding value = 0.07 &#x003bc;M) than the ZD domain (half maximal binding value &#x0003e; 5 &#x003bc;M).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Binding of Top67 and ZD to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA.</bold> The gel mobility shift assay was used to compare the binding affinities.

Several different 5'-end labeled substrates were prepared and used in cleavage assays to compare the cleavage sites selected by Top67 versus topoisomerase I. The results showed that with single-stranded substrates, Top67 also preferred cleavage sites with a C nucleotide base at the -4 position as reported for most of the type IA topoisomerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There were some differences from topoisomerase I in the relative distribution of cleavage products among the potential cleavage sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,4b</xref>). Top67 appeared to be more non-discriminatory in selection of the possible cleavage sites with the C nucleotide in the -4 position. Addition of the ZD domain had no effect on the cleavage selectivity of Top67. A substrate with both single-stranded and double-stranded regions was constructed to mimic such junction in negatively supercoiled DNA. Top67 and topoisomerase I recognised the same cleavage site on this substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Maximal yield of cleavage products was obtained for both Top67 and topoisomerase I within seconds after mixing of the enzyme and DNA so any potential difference in cleavage rates between the Top67 and topoisomerase I is unlikely to account for the difference in relaxation efficiency.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Cleavage selectivity of topoisomerase I and Top67.</bold> This was analyzed using single-stranded 32mer (a), 31mer (b), or substrate with both single- and double-stranded regions (c).

Sodium chloride concentration was then increased to 1 M to induce reversal of cleavage and dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA. We observed that more complete and consistent reversal of cleavage was obtained with both topoisomerase I and Top67 if a low concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (4 mM) was also added with the NaCl. This is consistent with an early observation of dissociation of the enzyme-DNA complex in high salt upon addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] that addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was apparently not required for observation of this reversal of cleavage. However, it is possible that some enzyme preparations may contain bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the low concentration of bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> might have been sufficient for reversal of cleavage, as postulated previously to explain the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The results of this cleavage reversal experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) indicated that the ZD domain was not required for efficient reversal of cleavage and Top67 could carry out religation of cleaved DNA. Again the reversal of cleavage was complete for both Top67 and topoisomerase I within seconds after the addition of high salt and Mg<sup>2+</sup> even when the reactions were carried out on ice (data not shown) so the lack of relaxation activity by Top67 is unlikely to be due to deficiency in religation.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Reversal of DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I and Top67.</bold> A 5'-end labeled 61mer was used as substrate.

To test if the Top67 can carry out double-stranded DNA passage at enzyme cleavage sites across from the DNA nicks, the yield of DNA catenanes were compared with that obtained with topoisomerase I. In contrast to the relaxation activity, the catenating activity of Top67 shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> was as efficient as that of full-length topoisomerase I, and the addition of the ZD domain had no effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). The rate of catenane formation for Top67 alone was similar to that of topoisomerase I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). This catenation activity observed with topoisomerase I and Top67 was unlikely to be due to contaminating topoisomerase III activity since it was not observed with the ZD domain purified under almost identical procedures and a site-directed mutant with substitution of the active site Tyr319 by phenylalanine also did not exhibit this activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Catenation of nicked double-stranded DNA circles by topoisomerase I and Top67</bold>.

Topoisomerase III has potent DNA decatenating activity for resolution of plasmid DNA replication intermediates, but much weaker relaxation activity than topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To exhibit maximal relaxation activity, topoisomerase III requires high temperature (52&#x000b0;C) along with low magnesium and monovalent ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I was not active in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for resolution of plasmid DNA replication intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Removal of the C-terminal 49 amino acids from the 653 amino acid topoisomerase III protein resulted in drastic reduction of catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Fusion of the carboxyl-terminal 312 amino acid residues of <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I, which includes the entire ZD domain, onto the 605 N-terminal amino acids of topoisomerase III generated a hybrid topoisomerase that has relaxation activity resembling topoisomerase III along with weak decatenating activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although preferring single-stranded DNA as binding substrate, topoisomerase I had been shown to also bind double-stranded DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but there is no data available to indicate which domain in the enzyme is responsible for this interaction.</p><p>The experiments described here measured directly the interaction of the ZD domain with both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA substrates. ZD domain was found to bind to single-stranded DNA, but not double-stranded DNA, with high affinity. This result indicated that with regard to the mechanism of <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I, the ZD domain was likely to function as a single-stranded DNA binding domain instead of having double-stranded DNA binding function as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Even though Zn(II) binding transcription factors that recognise specific double-stranded DNA are well represented in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], there are also numerous examples of Zn(II) coordination being required for interaction with single-stranded nucleic acid or damaged DNA with single-strand characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The effect of removal of the ZD domain on the individual step of enzyme action was also investigated using Top67. The results indicated that Top67 was effective in binding to both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. As a result, Top67 could position itself in the absence of ZD domain at the junction of double- and single-stranded DNA for subsequent DNA cleavage, as previously observed for intact topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Reversal of DNA cleavage also took place readily with Top67 upon addition of 1 M NaCl and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The ZD domain also was not required for selectivity of a cytosine in the -4 position relative to the cleavage sites.</p><p>Despite its ability to recognise the DNA substrate and carry out DNA cleavage-religation, Top67 by itself cannot catalyze change of linking number in the relaxation of supercoiled DNA. The single-strand DNA substrate designated for the ZD domain in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme may be the strand of DNA complementary to the strand first cleaved by the enzyme to form the covalent complex. This interaction with the passing strand of DNA would not be needed for the first two steps of enzyme mechanism up to the formation of the covalent complex. Our results showed that adding the purified ZD domain partially restored the relaxation activity. Therefore the ZD domain can supply the function that is missing in Top67 even when the two domains are not covalently linked. However, the resulting relaxation activity is much less efficient than that of the intact enzyme, suggesting that coordinated actions of the two domains are required for efficient removal of negative supercoils from DNA. The requirement of specific protein-protein interactions between the two domains could also account for the weak relaxation activity observed for the hybrid topoisomerase with ZD linked to topoisomerase III sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>This proposed role for the ZD domain in interacting with the passing single-strand of DNA is also supported by the observation that there is no difference between Top67 and intact topoisomerase I in the formation of catenanes. This reaction involves passage of another double-stranded DNA circle, instead of the complementary DNA strand through the break generated by DNA cleavage so the ZD domain would not be expected to play any significant role. High concentration of DNA substrate is required to favor formation of catenanes catalyzed by topoisomerase I, and the enzyme also has to be present in higher concentration compared to the relaxation reaction. The double-stranded DNA-binding activity in <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase III required for highly efficient decatenation activity is attributed to a 17-amino-acid residue with no counterpart in <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It may be required for interaction with the passing double-strand of DNA in the decatenation mechanism. The presence of this decatenation loop instead of the Zn(II) binding ZD domain in topoisomerase III may account for the dominance of the decatenation activity over the relaxation activity.</p><p>Based on these results, we propose a model for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA by <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) modified from previous versions that have a number of common features but differ most significantly in the role of the Zn(II) binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In this model, the subdomains in Top67 is responsible for interacting with the G-strand of DNA both upstream and downstream of the cleavage site. The ZD domain interacts with the passing single-strand DNA to be transported (T-strand). After cleavage of the DNA gate strand which becomes covalently linked to Tyr319 on Top67 (step 2), protein conformational change involving both Top67 and the ZD domain increases the distance between the covalently bound 5' phosphate and non-covalently bound 3' hydroxyl of the cleaved DNA gate strand while the passing DNA strand (T-strand) is guided through the "gate" via interaction with the ZD domain (step 3) to lead to change in linking number. A second enzyme conformational change positions the cleaved DNA ends for religation (step 4). The ZD domain can still interact with the T-strand of DNA even when not linked to Top67 in the same polypeptide, but efficiency of catalysis is reduced as a result, probably due to loss of coordinated action by the two domains. The presence of the ZD domain may enhance the transition of Top67 from a closed conformation to a more open conformation so that strand passage can take place through the "DNA gate". Previous data showed that although Zn(II) binding is not absolutely required for formation of the cleaved complex, it increased the amount of cleaved complex that can be isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. When linked to Top67, the ZD domain also has some influence on the cleavage site selections. It has previously been observed that a mutation in the Zn(II) binding motif can affect the cleavage site selectivity of topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] even though Top67 by itself can recognize both the cytosine in the -4 position and the junction of single- and double-stranded DNA. To gain further details for this model of enzyme action, we are characterizing the protein-protein interactions between the Top67 transesterification domain and the ZD domain, as well as the protein conformational changes that can take place when the enzyme interacts with DNA substrate.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Model for removal of a negative supercoil by <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA topoisomerase I.</bold> Subdomains I, II, III, IV found in the crystal structure of Top67 (4) are illustrated schematically along with the potential site for ZD domain (Z).

The sequence of this unique tetracysteine motifs is somewhat different from those present in other type IA topoisomerases in that the other tetracysteine motifs always had at least two amino acids separating the pairs of cysteines (Cys-X<sub>2-11</sub>-Cys), instead of just one amino acid (Cys-X-Cys) in <italic>T. maritima</italic> topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore the structure and function of the single Zn(II) binding motif in <italic>T. maritima</italic> may differ from the multiple Zn(II) binding motifs in <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I. Direct interaction between DNA and the <italic>T. maritima</italic> Zn(II) binding motif has not been demonstrated. It has been suggested that the mechanisms of these two enzymes may be different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Direct interaction between the enzyme and the passing strand may not be necessary for the <italic>T. maritima</italic> topoisomerase I activity. The relaxation and decatenation activities of <italic>T. maritima</italic> topoisomerase I appear to be significantly more efficient than those of the <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Based on their primary sequences, a number of bacterial topoisomerase I enzymes do not appear to coordinate any Zn(II) with tetracysteines motifs while other type IA topoisomerase has up to 4 tetracysteine motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The topoisomerase I from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> has been demonstrated biochemically not to bind Zn(II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In contrast, mutation disrupting the fourth Zn(II) motif of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> topoisomerase I abolished enzyme function <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore there may be significant differences in the mechanisms of type IA topoisomerases from different organisms with respect to requirement of Zn(II) binding for relaxation activity.</p><p>There is also another possible explanation for the varied number of tetracysteine motifs and requirement of Zn(II) for relaxation activity found in different type IA topoisomerases. The 14 kDa C-terminal region of <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I has been classified based on its structure to be in the Zn-ribbon superfamily [SCOP release 1.50, 7] even though it does not bind Zn(II). It also has high affinity for binding to single-stranded DNA on its own when separated from the three tetracysteine motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Based on the structural and DNA-binding properties of the <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I 14 kDa domain, one can conclude that it is possible for a subdomain in topoisomerase I to lose the Zn(II) binding cysteines during evolution and still maintains the Zn-ribbon structure and single-strand DNA binding properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the <italic>in vivo</italic> catalytic activities of eukarytotic type IA topoisomerases, the topoisomerase III from various higher organisms may be related to their sequences. The transesterification domains of these eukaryotic enzymes have high degrees of identity to <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA topoisomerase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, the decatenation loop is not present in the eukaryotic topoisomerase III sequences and to date the decatenation activity has not been demonstrated for these enzymes. The number of potential Zn(II) binding cysteine motifs range from none in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> DNA topoisomerase III to four highly conserved tetracysteine motifs in the beta family of the topoisomerase III enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The Zn(II) domain formed by these tetracysteine motifs may be required for interaction with single-strand DNA in removal of hypernegative supercoils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] or disruption of early recombination intermediates between inappropriately paired DNA molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that the ZD domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA topoisomerase I is not required for the substrate recognition and DNA cleavage-religation action of the enzyme. We propose that the ZD domain interacts with the passing single-strand of DNA in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by this enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Enzyme and DNA</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> DNA topoisomerase I and the ZD domain were expressed and purified as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. To express the 67 kDa N-terminal transesterification domain (Top67), a stop codon at amino acid 598 was introduced into plasmid pJW312 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] used for topoisomerase I expression by site-directed mutagenesis employing the Chameleon-Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.
