All patients (14 males and 10 females) underwent radical tumor resection. The median patient age was 56.8 years with a range from 36.9 to 72.5 years. In all cases surgery was followed by radiotherapy that consisted of fractionated focal irradiation at a dose of 1.8&#x02013;2 gray (Gy) per fraction given once daily five days per week over a period of 6 weeks, for a total dose of 60 Gy. Radiotherapy was delivered to the gross tumor volume with a 2 cm margin volume for the clinical target volume based on a preoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI). In 17 cases patients additionally underwent chemotherapy treatment consisting of temozolomide (marketed as Temodal&#x000ae; in Europe and Canada and Temodar&#x000ae; in the United States; Schering-Plough). In nine cases chemotherapy was applied concomitant to radiotherapy at a dose of 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d, given 7 days per week from the first day of radiotherapy until the last day of radiotherapy, but for no longer than 49 days. After a 4-week break, patients received up to six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide every 28 days according to the standard 5-day schedule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Stupp1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In the remaining cases the radiotherapy regime was followed by an adjuvant chemotherapy that was administered at a dose of 150 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d on day 1&#x02013;5 in the first cycle. The following cycles were done at a dosage of 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day. Treatment cycles were repeated every 28 days.</p><p>The baseline examination included computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), full blood counts and blood chemistry tests, and a physical examination.

We analyzed the serostatus of 24 glioblastoma patients from the time prior to surgery throughout the further development of their disease.

As shown by this figure, the average seroreactivity increases shortly after surgery. We found the lowest overall frequency after surgery and prior to radiation. The highest average seroreactivity was found during radiotherapy and subsequent to radiotherapy. The only statistically significant difference between two consecutive measurement points was between prior to radiation and during radiation (p-value of 0.014).</p><p>For each time point we also calculated the percentage of patients with GLEA2 ELISA values above the chosen threshold.

Radiation of a melanoma cell line lead to increased peptide production and antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Reits1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Immunotherapy allowed eradication of a murine colon adenocarcinoma only when preceded by radiotherapy of the tumor tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Reits1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These results lead us to ask how radiation influences the seroreactivity of antigens in human tumor patients. We chose to analyze glioblastoma patients that have a very poor prognosis despite surgery and radiotherapy. In addition, immunotherapy for tumors located in the CNS has generally not achieved the results reported for some peripherally located tumors. The relative paucity of glioma-associated antigens that can be targeted by the immune system may partially account for this situation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Sahin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Pallasch1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results provide first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that radiation may increase the frequency of the autologous antibody response against human tumor antigens. Without further experimental evidence, we can, however, not rule out that the increased GLEA2 values are due to other factors but radiation. We were not able to compare the GLEA2 values between patients with and without radiation. The majority of glioblastoma patients undergoes radiotherapy after surgery even in clinical trials like the phase III NOA-8 trial and patients who are not treated by radiation generally showed a Karnofsky Performance Score lower 60.</p><p>However several observations lead us to conclude that the increase in GLEA2 autoantibodies is likely due to radiation. In general we found an increase of GLEA2 values during radiation and a subsequent decrease of GLEA2 values after radiation. It appears unlikely that these GLEA2 values are due to tumor growth pattern: The median residual tumor volume after gross-total removal is reduced to 12&#x00025; as shown by quantitative radiological analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Schneider1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Provided the mean tumor doubling time of glioblastoma is 24 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Burnett1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, the GLEA2 measurements prior to radiation were performed after 0.13 doubling times. The measurements during and after radiation were performed after 2.0 and 5.5 doubling times. The resulting increase of tumor volume does not readily explain the strong increase of GLEA2 autoantibodies during radiation and the slight decrease after radiation.</p><p>It is also conceivable that radiation can elicit an antibody response against novel antigens that are not immunogenic in glioma patients without radiation. Our finding is in keeping with this idea since GLEA2 was immunogenic in some patients only during or after but not prior to radiation. In the future, radiation may significantly improve the results of immunotherapy for tumors located in the CNS. Modulating the tumor immunoresponse can contribute to overcome the current shortcomings of immunotherapy.</p><p>Our results provide also evidence that the analysis of antigen seroreactivity may be useful for monitoring tumor development under treatment. The immune system may be ideally suited to identify even subtle changes in tumor development that cannot be picked up by other approaches. Future developments can combine the power of imaging technology and the sensitivity of approaches that utilize the immune system for tumor detection. Detection and monitoring of human tumors by seroreactivity of antigens is, however, still in its infancy. Out of the over 2000 antigens known to be immunogenic in human tumor patients, only very few have been analyzed for the course of their seroreactivity during tumor progression under treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Smorodin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. There are no studies that follow the antigen reactivity during the progress of human brain tumors. Surpassing the scope of our study, an optimized monitoring of brain tumor development under treatment would require an extended number of immunogenic antigens that yet need to be identified.</p><p>Our study does not focus on the question why radiation results in increased GLEA2 seroreactivity. One obvious explanation is the release of GLEA2 as the result of cell destruction due to radiation. The increased GLEA2 seroreactivity found in glioblastoma patients at the time of surgery may also be caused by necrosis that is typically associated with human glioblastoma. Alternatively, GLEA2 may also be presented via MHC class I on the surface of glioblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002164-Reits1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, MHC class I antigen presentation is remarkably inefficient. This may be overcome by radiation that both enhance degradation of cellular proteins and MHC class I expression.</p><p>Independent of the molecular mechanisms, the study indicates that radiation increases the antibody response against GLEA2 in glioma patients. Although obtaining blood at defined time points after surgery may be difficult for a larger number of glioblastoma patients, our study provides strong evidence that it is worthwhile (a) to identify further antigens that are immunogenic in glioblastoma patients and (b) to follow the course of their seroreactivity during glioma development under treatment. Only the analysis of seroreactivity over longer periods can fully reveal the value of immunogenic antigens for tumor monitoring.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
