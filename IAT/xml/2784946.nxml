However the underlying factors of this effect are unclear. It has been hypothesized that water-soluble components of cigarette smoke can directly promote oxidative stress in vasculature and blood cells. Aim of this study was to study the relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation in a group of young smokers. To do this we evaluated: 1) the oxidation products of phospholipids (oxPAPC) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC); 2) their role in causing PBMC reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and changes in GSH; 3) the expression of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and of related antioxidant genes (ARE); 4) the activation of NF-kB and C-reactive protein (CRP) values. We studied 90 healthy volunteers: 32 non-smokers, 32 moderate smokers (5&#x02013;10 cigarettes/day) and 26 heavy smokers (25&#x02013;40 cigarettes/day). OxPAPC and p47phox expression, that reasonably reflects NADPH oxidase activity, were higher in moderate smokers and heavy smokers than in non-smokers (p&#x0003c;0.01), the highest values being in heavy smokers (p&#x0003c;0.01). In <italic>in vitro</italic> studies oxPAPC increased ROS generation via NADPH oxidase activation. GSH in PBMC and plasma was lower in moderate smokers and heavy smokers than in non-smokers (p&#x0003c;0.01), the lowest values being in heavy smokers (p&#x0003c;0.01). Nrf2 expression in PBMC was higher in moderate smokers than in non-smokers (p&#x0003c;0.01), but not in heavy smokers, who had the highest levels of NF-kB and CRP (p&#x0003c;0.01). In <italic>in vitro</italic> studie<italic>s</italic> oxPAPC dose-dependently increased NF-kB activation, whereas at the highest concentrations Nrf2 expression was repressed. The small interference (si) RNA-mediated knockdown of NF-&#x003ba;B/p65 increased about three times the expression of Nrf2 stimulated with oxPAPC. Cigarette smoke promotes oxPAPC formation and oxidative stress in PBMC. This may cause the activation of NF-kB that in turn may participate in the negative regulation of Nrf2/ARE pathway favouring inflammation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Ross1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Hansson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> with enormous epidemiological relevance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Murray1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Mathers1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to change the oxidation-reduction (redox) state of the exposed cells and it is known that several inflammatory genes and the related transcription factors are regulated through redox-sensitive mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Ross1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Nuclear factor (NF)-kB was the first eukaryotic transcription factor shown to respond directly to oxidative stress. A huge amount of experimental data supports the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB as a key redox-sensitive event associated with vascular dysfunction (reviewed in 7). NF-kB intervenes in the transcription of a large number of inflammatory genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-DeMartin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cigarette smoking is the worldwide leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality and constitutes a major risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease, including stroke and coronary artery disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Howard1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Cigarette smoke can be divided into two phases: tar and gas-phase smoke.

However the underlying factors of this deleterious effect are not fully understood. In this study we showed for the first time that in healthy young smokers, cigarette smoking is associated with increased PGPC, POVPC and PEIPC levels in PBMC. Our results are in line with a series of other studies demonstrating that cigarette smoking induces systemic oxidative stress (reviewed in 27). The increase of these oxPAPC in PBMC was associated with the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, that is involved in the induction of genes coding for a number of antioxidants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Motohashi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The activation of this pathway, however, was evident only in moderate smokers, i.e. in subjects smoking no more than 10 cigarettes per day, while in heavy smokers, i.e. in subjects smoking more than 25 cigarettes per day, the Nrf2/ARE pathway was not activated or even repressed. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but these results are supported by our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings showing that at the highest concentrations of PGPC, the Nrf2/ARE pathway was no longer stimulated or even reduced. OxPAPC were previously found to increase ROS production via NADPH-oxidase activation when added to cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Rouhanizadeh1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>in vitro</italic> studies we too showed that PGPC, POVPC and PEIPC singly and dose-dependently rose the generation of ROS in PBMC derived from healthy donors and that this increase was related to the activation of NADPH-oxidase. The oxPAPC-induced increase of ROS was associated to an induction of Nrf2 expression that was inhibited when the cells were incubated with NADPH-oxidase inhibitors and with siRNA-mediated knockdown of p47phox. It is likely that this mechanism is operating also <italic>in vivo</italic> since the expression of p47phox, that reasonably reflects the activity of NADPH-oxidase, was much higher in the PBMC of heavy smokers who had the highest concentrations of cellular PGPC, POVPC and PEIPC, than in moderate smokers or non-smokers. Furthermore the fact that the concentration of GSH in PBMC was much lower in heavy smokers than in moderate smokers indicates that oxidative stress was at the most in the former group. Since it has been suggested that the Nrf2/ARE pathway is crucial for the regulation of intracellular redox state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Ma1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and oxidative stress is one of the most potent stimuli for Nrf2/ARE pathway activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Itoh1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, a first conclusion of this study is that heavy smokers, contrary to moderate smokers, do not appropriately react in terms of Nrf2/ARE activation to the intracellular oxidative stress. This inadequacy of response was also seen in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies where the highest degree of oxidative stress did not cause the activation of Nrf2/ARE pathway. Under different experimental conditions our results agree with a series of recent studies showing a decline of Nrf2 expression in whole lung tissue and alveolar macrophages of patients with pulmonary emphysema <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Goven1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and in pulmonary macrophages of current smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Malhotra1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> a pathological situation in which oxidant-antioxidant imbalance is strongly implicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Barnes1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Rahman1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The results of this study also demonstrate that contrary to the Nrf2/ARE pathway, there was a progressive activation of NF-kB in the PBMC of moderate smokers and heavy smokers compared to non-smokers and that this activation was associated to a functional consequence, i.e. the increase of circulating and PBMC IL-6. A huge amount of experimental data supports the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB as a key redox-sensitive event associated with vascular dysfunction (reviewed in 7). So the progressive increase of NF-kB from non-smokers to heavy smokers may be related to the oxPAPC-induced generation of ROS. Since NF-kB intervenes in the transcription of a large number of inflammatory genes and in particular of IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-DeMartin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, that induces CRP in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Rattazzi1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, the increase in CRP of smokers may be related to NF-kB activation. The levels of CRP, even though in the normal range, were much higher (about three times) in heavy smokers than in moderate smokers. Of course this may derive from the higher number of cigarettes the group of heavy smokers smoked per day and therefore from the greater oxidative stress. In moderate smokers, but not in heavy smokers however, there may be the counteracting effect of the Nrf2/ARE apparatus. Nrf2's regulation of cellular GSH and other antioxidants has been shown to be critical for a correct modulation of NF-kB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Thimmulappa1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover it has recently been shown that Nrf2 is a critical regulator of NF-kB activation both by modulating Ik-B degradation and MyD88-dependent and -independent signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Thimmulappa1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> results on NF-kB are in line with the data we obtained <italic>in vivo</italic>. Increasing amounts of PGPC, in fact, dose-dependently increased the activation of NF-kB in PBMC derived from healthy donors, while at the highest concentrations Nrf2 was no longer stimulated. Vitamin C was found to attenuate this phenomenon suggesting that oxidative stress plays a major role in NF-kB activation and in inappropriate Nrf2 expression. Even though these results have to be confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> and therefore do not allow any conclusion, they are in line with the findings of Waltenberger et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Stadler1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> who found that vitamin C reversed smoking-induced monocyte dysfunction <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The reasons for this unexpected result on Nrf2 are unclear. Recent data have shown that NF-kB p65 subunit repressed the Nrf2/ARE pathway at transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Liu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, in the cells where NF-kB and Nrf2 were simultaneously activated, p65 unidirectionally antagonized the transcriptional activity of Nrf2. In our study in order to determine why NF-kB activation caused a fall in Nrf2 expression, we used siRNA to knockdown the expression of NF-kB/p65. With the highest concentration of PGPC added (32 &#x000b5;M), p65 siRNA increased about three times the expression of Nrf2 suggesting that the Nrf2 repression may be related to the p65 antagonism. Of course on the basis of these results we cannot exclude that Nrf2 decline in heavy smokers may also be related to other mechanisms and in particular to decreased Nrf2 protein stability as recently demonstrated in patients with COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008225-Malhotra1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion the results of this study show that cigarette smoking is associated with increased oxPAPC in PBMC of young healthy smokers with no additional risk factors for atherosclerosis. This means that water-soluble components of cigarette smoke reach the systemic circulation and can promote oxidative stress not only of blood cells but probably also of vasculature cells. Increased oxPAPC and in particular PGPC, POVPC and PEIPC were associated with the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway only in moderate smokers and not in heavy smokers, while NF-kB was progressively more activated from non-smokers to heavy smokers. This investigation revealed that NF-kB p65 may participate in the negative regulation of Nrf2/ARE signalling, and might provide a new insight into a possible role of NF-kB in suppressing the expression of antioxidant genes, favouring inflammation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0008225-Ross1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation
