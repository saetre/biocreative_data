SNAP-25 plays a central role in neuroexocytosis by bridging synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane during regulated exocytosis. The SNAP-25 polypeptide is encoded by a single copy gene, but in higher vertebrates a duplication of exon 5 has resulted in two mutually exclusive splice variants, SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b. To address a potential physiological difference between the two SNAP-25 proteins, we generated gene targeted SNAP-25b deficient mouse mutants by replacing the SNAP-25b specific exon with a second SNAP-25a equivalent. Elimination of SNAP-25b expression resulted in developmental defects, spontaneous seizures, and impaired short-term synaptic plasticity. In adult mutants, morphological changes in hippocampus and drastically altered neuropeptide expression were accompanied by severe impairment of spatial learning. We conclude that the ancient exon duplication in the <italic>Snap</italic>25 gene provides additional SNAP-25-function required for complex neuronal processes in higher eukaryotes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In evolution, duplication of genes or gene segments appears to be an efficient way to add diverse functions in more complex organisms. The SNAP-25 protein plays an important role in mediating the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. SNAP-25 exists as two variants: SNAP-25a, which is present in early development, and SNAP-25b, which is most abundant from early adulthood and onwards. We have developed mouse mutants that only express SNAP-25a, but retain normal SNAP-25 levels by replacing the SNAP-25b segment in the <italic>Snap</italic>25 gene with an additional SNAP-25a copy. We show that SNAP-25b is required for early postnatal development and that a balanced expression of the two proteins is a prerequisite for maintaining an operational neuronal network during adulthood. Mice that only have SNAP-25a develop seizures, and show learning deficits and anxiety. Synaptic plasticity is impaired, and structural changes are observed in areas that are connected to such behavioral functions. In man, SNAP-25 function has been linked to behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD. Our present findings using genetic elimination of SNAP-25b suggest that even small alterations in the regulation of the <italic>Snap</italic>25 gene, resulting in a disturbed balance between SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b, lead to nervous system dysfunction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolution of more advanced organisms has required adaptation of genomes to be able to generate new gene functions. The original genome sequence analyses of different organisms surprisingly revealed that the number of genes in the human genome is only around 30,000, versus 20,000 in much simpler organisms such as the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-International1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-The1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a closer examination of these 30,000 identified human genes suggested that as many as one third of them might be false and the number of protein-coding genes in humans are close to the 19,000 found in the domestic dog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Clamp1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-LindbladToh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead the increased protein complexity of higher eukaryotes appears to be the consequence of the same gene encoding several functional proteins. This has been accomplished by duplication of genes or gene segments and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The major contribution to protein diversity is alternative splicing and some 40&#x02013;60&#x00025; of all mammalian genes generate more than one protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Brett1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Modrek1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, as many as 10&#x00025; of all genes in mammals contain tandemly duplicated exons, suggesting that exon duplication followed by functionally diverging mutations have been a fast and successful evolutionary mechanism to increase protein variety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Kondrashov1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Letunic1">8</xref>.

One of the final steps prior to vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is the formation of a trans-membrane <italic>s</italic>oluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) <italic>a</italic>ttachment protein <italic>re</italic>ceptor (SNARE) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Sllner1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Sllner2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This specialized SNARE complex is bridging vesicles to the plasma membrane during regulated exocytosis and consists of three compartmentally defined proteins: The vesicle-associated VAMP2/synaptobrevin, a protein with a plasma membrane anchor syntaxin 1a, and the cytoplasmic <italic>s</italic>y<italic>n</italic>aptosomal-<italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>p</italic>rotein of 25 kD, SNAP-25, that associates with membranes through palmitoylation. The three SNARE proteins are held together by strong protein-protein interactions, whereby the cytoplasmic domains form a four &#x003b1;-helix coiled-coiled bundle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Sutton1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The detailed mechanisms mediating regulated exocytosis are still not fully elucidated but the current hypothesis is that SNARE proteins operate at the actual fusion event and have intrinsic capabilities to perform membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Giraudo1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Pobbati1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. A possibility is that the SNARE proteins are candidates for adjusting thresholds for synaptic plasticity in more advanced neuronal systems. They form the central fusogenic core at the plasma membrane. It is notable that the number of SNARE proteins, and alternative isoform variants, have increased through evolution and their expression is strictly regulated both anatomically and temporally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Kloepper1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Bark1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In higher vertebrates SNAP-25 is expressed as two developmentally regulated and complementary distributed splice variants termed SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Bark1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The alternative splicing is an obligate choice between two closely spaced tandemly arranged exon 5 sequences, and nine of 206 amino acids in the two polypeptides differ. The alternative splicing modifies a domain of the SNAP-25 protein spanning a quartet of cysteine residues that are substrates for post-translational palmitoylation and required for membrane targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Lane1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Gonzalo1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Separate overexpression of the two SNAP-25 isoforms in embryonic adrenal chromaffin cells from these SNAP-25 knock-out (KO) mice showed that the SNAP-25b isoform had a higher capability to stabilize the pool of primed vesicles than SNAP-25a, since the burst of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-evoked catecholamine release differed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Srensen1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based on results from electrophysiological, behavioral and immunohistochemical experiments we conclude, that under physiological conditions, mice deficient in SNAP-25b have developmental defects, impaired short-term synaptic plasticity, a seizure-prone phenotype and malfunctioning cognitive performance. We suggest that the ancient duplication in the <italic>Snap25</italic> gene followed by regulated alternative splicing between two similar but distinct exon 5 sequences is required for accurate synaptic function during development.

Only the exon 5b sequence was changed to encode the exon 5a amino acids, and the original splicing signals for expression of the downstream exon 5 were kept intact. Three independent mouse lines were backcrossed on C57BL/6NCrl (B6) mice for at least ten generations, thus establishing fully congenic strains. After intercrossing of heterozygous animals we found a mendelian distribution of genotypes (24&#x00025; homozygous mutants of 125 mice), strongly indicating that our introduced genetic changes did not give rise to a prenatal lethal phenotype.

Although bony fish appear to have rather immature brain structures, the sensory and motor coordinating functions are well developed. After the original duplication event, subsequent accumulation of mutations, presumably in both exon 5a and 5b, have resulted in the two similar but distinct SNAP-25 proteins present in all higher vertebrates.</p><p>We asked ourselves if the ancient duplication of exon 5, followed by mutually exclusive splicing, and resulting in increased protein diversity of the SNAP-25 protein was a prerequisite for the development of more intricate neuronal functions found in higher vertebrates.

Moreover, genetic elimination of SNAP-25b results in progressive morphological and neurochemical changes in CNS and impairment of cognitive function in adult animals. However, in brains of homozygous <italic>neo</italic>-containing SNAP-25b deficient mutants SNAP-25 protein levels were reduced by 20&#x00025;, indicating that the <italic>Tkneo</italic> gene suppressed gene expression.

In this respect our attention was drawn to a SNAP-25b mouse mutant named the &#x0201c;blind-drunk mouse&#x0201d; (Bdr) with retinal degeneration (caused by choice of the background strain) and a mild phenotype with ataxia and impaired sensorimotor gating due to a dominant mutation in SNAP-25b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Jeans1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

In agreement with our assumption the mutants only had around 80&#x00025; of the SNAP-25 protein levels found in WT plasma membrane fractions. Instead, in mutant brain more SNAP-25 was detected in low-density fractions, representing soluble protein and/or protein associated with small intracellular organelles. This difference in subcellular localization of the two SNAP-25 isoforms might contribute to the phenotype of the mutants. Whether that depends on the ability of the two isoforms to associate with membranes due to the altered organization of the cysteine residues that are substrates for palmitoylation, or, whether SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b reside in complex with additional secretory factors that guide the subcellular localizations needs to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity Is Impaired in SNAP-25b Deficient Mice</title><p>To explore a possible effect on presynaptic mechanisms we studied PPF at Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal synapses.

The <italic>neo</italic>-containing SNAP-25b mutants are most severely affected with frequent attacks debuting around PN12-13, whereas in <italic>neo</italic>-excised SNAP-25b deficient mutants seizure activity is rare prior to young adulthood. These behavioral impairments were paralleled by increasingly pronounced anatomical and immunohistochemical changes, which are only observed after the debut of seizure activity. In <italic>neo</italic>-excised SNAP-25b deficient mice, mossy fibers appear notably enlarged and swollen with certain areas almost devoid of synaptophysin immunoreactivity, suggesting a locally decreased density of functional nerve endings. Increased NPY expression in mossy fibers after seizures is believed to be neuroprotective by dampening excitatory activity, while BDNF can regulate NPY expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Koyama1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Vezzani1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

The functions of SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b appear to complement each other in tuning the presynaptic exocytotic machinery towards different modes of release. For complex neuronal circuitries this modulation of release is necessary, and is also instrumental in protecting highly plastic brain areas from accumulating degenerative morphological changes with age. The development of higher brain functions during evolution has been complemented with expanding number of gene products, sometimes by gene duplications but primarily by increasing protein diversity and complexity via alternative splicing. The importance of alternatively spliced isoforms from other genes has previously been extensively analyzed <italic>in vivo</italic>, by hindering expression of selected exons using gene targeted mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Mry1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. This is the first time an exon knock-out/knock-in of tandem duplicated exons has been performed. We specifically investigated the physiological importance of removing one isoform while preserving total expression levels of the protein by a simultaneous knock-in of an extra copy of the remaining exon variant.</p><p>Interestingly, a growing amount of reports are connecting SNAP-25 function with a wide variety of behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as linking it with cognitive capability in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Faraone1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000278-Gosso2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.
