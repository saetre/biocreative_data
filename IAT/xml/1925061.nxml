The FABP2 gene encodes intestinal FABP protein (IFABP), and is only expressed in the absorptive simple columnar epithelial cells of the intestine (enterocytes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Several functions of IFABP protein have been proposed, these include the facilitation of cellular uptake and/or transport of long-chain fatty acids within enterocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The IFABP protein contains two beta-sheet structures surround a cavity into which the ligand binds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The major conformational adjustment between the structure of free IFABP and IFABP bound to fatty acid, occurs at a tight turn containing residues 54 and 55. These residues shift position when long-chain fatty acids are bound to the protein. Therefore, even a subtle change in the amino acid sequence of this turn could affect the structural properties of IFABP in such a way as to alter its ligand affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>A polymorphism at codon 54 in exon 2 of the human FABP2 gene exchanges an Alanine (Ala) in the small helical region of the protein for Threonine (Thr). Different studies suggest that the Ala-to-Thr substitution is in fact a functional mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is reasonable to speculate that if the FABP2 gene polymorphism in any way modifies the absorption of fatty acids, it could in turn affect the lipid metabolism and/or correlate with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Earlier studies have shown that the IFABP Thr54 allele is significantly associated with higher total cholesterol, with stroke incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], elevation of fasting and postprandial triglyceride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and higher nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There are many contradicting studies, however, that have found non-significant association with these parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the light of the potential physiological role of the FABP2 polymorphism, we assessed the local population frequency of the Thr54 allele and analyzed its possible associations with five selected markers, i.e. glycemia, total cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), hypertension and cardiovascular risk index (CVR index). Our results reveal a similar population polymorphism frequency as in previous European studies and a not significant association with none of the tested markers in the context of our argentine nutritional and cultural habits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>We recruited 202 volunteers (mean age 53 years) from various Public Administration Offices, including 86 men (aged between 35 and 75 years, mean age 51) and 116 women (aged between 45 and 75 years, mean age 56). The means in the sample were: cholesterol level 198,34 (190,52 for men and 204,27 for women), diastolic blood pressure: 79,38 (82,93 for men and 76,96 for women), systolic blood pressure: 127,22 (131,15 for men and 124,26 for women) and BMI: 28,45 (28,86 for men and 28,13 for woman). In the 202 subjects, there were only 11 diabetics. On receiving written informed consent from all participants included in this population screening study, a drop of blood was collected for total cholesterol and glycemia analysis using commercial kits (Accu-Chek Instant Plus, Roche Diagnostic). A second drop of blood was collected on a DNAase free paper (Nucleic Paper, Biodynamics S.R.L, Buenos Aires, Argentina) for DNA extraction. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured by a physician. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). The ethical committee of the Public Health Care Program for Government Employees (OSEP, Obra Social del Empleado Publico) approved the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiovascular risk assessment by calculation of the Framingham Risk Index</title><p>The cardiovascular risk was calculated for each individual by the Framingham Index according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This index takes into account the following variables: sex, age, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL and smoking status. The HDL measure was excluded from this study because of its low impact on the total score for the risk calculation. The total score was obtained by summing the partial scores for each of the variables mentioned.

We therefore decided to carefully analyze our genotype composition results in order to detect whether our sample could be affected by endogamic behaviour. The cluster of inhabitants around the city could lead to inbreeding and consequently reduce the number of observed homozygous, and affect the allele frequency. In order to assess whether this was interfering with our population sample, the amount of observed heterozygous and homozygous for the Ala54Thr polymorphism was used in the formula F = He-Ho/He (where He and Ho are expected and observed heterozygous).

In the sample tested, the observed Thr54 frequency (q = 0,277) is similar to that reported in eleven different European countries (0.276) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggesting that the colonising European populations, mainly from Italy and Spain, introduced the same original allele frequency in this continent and that this frequency has remained conserved. The fact that the proportion of carriers has not changed and that the polymorphism is in a Hardy Weinberg equilibrium suggests that there is no significant natural selection pressure acting against individuals with the Thr54 FABP2 variant living in Mendoza, Argentina. Other South American frequency analysis of Thr54 were reported by a Chilean group, who found a q = 0.4 in 63 obese and not obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and a Brazilian study that reported a q = 0.25 in 1042 diabetes type 2 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Even though both analyses are performed on specific study sample, i.e. obese and diabetic individuals, the Brazilian frequency in 1042 individuals is similar to that observed by our group in Argentina.</p><p>It is well known that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 54 is a missence variant that has a definite effect on the primary structure of the protein and affects its fatty acid binding properties. It is not known, however, whether this change can affect the lipid metabolism of carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Many earlier studies have reported associations between this polymorphism and insulin resistance, BMI, dyslipidemia, stroke, metabolic syndromes and hypertriglyceridemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, other studies report no association with the same parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Part of the discrepancy among the studies may come from the different dietary habits of the analyzed populations. For example, the lack of association found in a Finnish population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] could be related to its prevailing fish diet where the Thr54 variant may not cause any phenotypical manifestation. Therefore, it was important to assess some of these associations in Argentina, characterized by the consumption of significant amounts of beef (i.e. 68 kg of beef/year/habitant). This diet is rich in proteins and fats and poor in fibres and fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, it was relevant for the local RCP Program to develop health prevention strategies based on educational programs of life style and nutritional habits.</p><p>Our results indicate that in the assessed population, the allele Thr54 does not influence the glycemia levels nor the blood pressure (odds ratio approaching 1).</p><p>The Cholesterol levels, BMI and CVR index are not significantly influenced by the Thr54, but show ORs &#x0003e;1. These tendencies for increased risk are better manifested when BMI and Cholesterol are analysed in a combination. This observation does, however, not prove association or causality. The sample size was small, and these observed tendencies require further investigation in order to reveal whether the influences become significant and whether it could be related to the meat and fat-rich diet prevailing in Argentina.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present the first study investigating the Thr54 allele frequency in Argentina and its association with five cardiovascular risk markers. The population frequency of the Thr54 allele in Argentina does not differ from previously reported frequencies in European populations. Moreover, we found no association between the Thr54 allele and any of the five selected markers. Although the observed tendency for increased total cholesterol and elevated BMI in Thr54 carriers was not significant, this will require further investigation to establish whether the Thr54 variant should be taken into consideration in cardiovascular prevention strategies in our country.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LCG performed the DNA sampling, the molecular assays, the frequency analysis, the phenotypic association studies and the revision of the manuscript.
