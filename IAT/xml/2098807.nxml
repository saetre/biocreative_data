In parallel, using mouse and human metastasis gene expression data it was observed that extracellular matrix (ECM) genes are common components of metastasis predictive signatures, suggesting that ECM genes are either important markers or causal factors in metastasis. To investigate the relationship between ECM genes and poor prognosis in breast cancer, expression quantitative trait locus analysis of polyoma middle-T transgene-induced mammary tumor was performed.

Our laboratory has previously shown that host germline-encoded variation modifies primary tumor metastatic capacity. Here, we detail how germline-encoded <italic>Rrp1b</italic> variation likely modulates metastasis. In mice, constitutional <italic>Rrp1b</italic> variation correlates with ECM gene expression, which are genes commonly differentially regulated in metastasis prone tumors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that <italic>Rrp1b</italic> expression levels are modulated by germline variation in mice with differing metastatic propensities, and that variation of <italic>Rrp1b</italic> expression in a highly metastatic mouse mammary tumor cell line modifies progression. Differential <italic>RRP1B</italic> functionality also appears to play an important role in human breast cancer progression. Specifically, we demonstrate that a microarray gene expression signature indicative of differential <italic>RRP1B</italic> expression predicts breast cancer-specific survival. Furthermore, we show that germline-encoded <italic>RRP1B</italic> variation is associated with markers of outcome in two breast cancer populations. In summary, these data suggest that <italic>Rrp1b</italic> may be a germline-encoded metastasis modifier in both mice and humans, which leads to the possibility that knowledge of <italic>RRP1B</italic> functionality and variation in breast cancer might facilitate improved assessment of prognosis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Crawford NPS, Qian X, Ziogas A, Papageorge AG, Boersma BJ, et al.

Yeast two-hybrid assays and functional genomic studies addressed the first question, which identified Rrp1b as binding to the polymorphic PDZ domain of Sipa1. The second question probed the origins of metastasis-predictive gene expression signatures. ECM genes are components of all metastasis-predictive gene expression signatures in both humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; and mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, a finding that may well be explained in part by constitutional variation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. To test this question, we examined whether ECM eQTLs and metastasis modifiers might be the same entities by analyzing ECM gene expression in a RI mouse panel. This led to the identification of several eQTLs, with a locus on proximal chromosome 17 displaying the strongest linkage. The peak linkage region of this locus encompasses both <italic>Rrp1b</italic> and a tumor growth and progression QTL &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, and rather remarkably, when we examined expression of transcripts within the peak eQTL linkage region, <italic>Rrp1b</italic> was highly correlated with metastasis-predictive ECM gene expression. Taken together, these data suggest that <italic>Rrp1b</italic> is a potential dual ECM and tumor progression candidate.</p><p>Further experimentation demonstrated that ectopic expression of <italic>Rrp1b</italic> in two highly metastatic mammary tumor cell lines and a mouse fibroblast cell line modulates ECM gene expression, a finding concurrent with our initial hypothesis that <italic>Rrp1b</italic> is indeed the chromosome 17 ECM eQTL. It should be noted however, that the directionality of the ECM expression changes observed in response to <italic>Rrp1b</italic> activation in these cell lines are not directly comparable to the changes in ECM expression observed in metastasis-predictive gene expression signatures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Primary tumors are composed of a variety of cell and tissue types, and this cellular and microenvironmental heterogeneity is not accurately reflected by in vitro growth conditions of single cell types. Nevertheless, we do argue that our in vitro experimentation demonstrates that <italic>Rrp1b</italic> modulates the expression of metastasis-predictive ECM genes in a variety of individual cell lines. It is also evident that further work will be necessary to define the complex microenvironmental relationships that modulate ECM gene expression in bulk tumor tissue and their relationship to overall levels of <italic>Rrp1b</italic> activation.</p><p>In addition, it should be noted that eQTL analysis is most commonly associated with expression changes in normal tissues, and not the neoplastic tissues analyzed in this study. However, eQTLs owe their existence to germline polymorphism, and such variation will be present in tumor tissue in addition to normal tissues. With this in mind, it is therefore not unreasonable to assume that the phenotypic effects of eQTLs will be observed in tumors as well as normal tissue. Yet neoplastic tissues possess an inherent genomic instability, and it is therefore possible that variations in tumor gene expression patterns could also arise from somatic mutation. However, we have demonstrated that eQTLs can be genetically mapped in tumors, which suggests either that similar somatic mutations consistently occur in the majority of the tumor tissue in a subset of the RI strains, or that the observed eQTLs result from inherited polymorphisms. Our previous demonstration that the same ECM genes used to define tumor eQTLs are differentially expressed in normal mammary tissues derived from high- and low-metastatic mouse genotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; suggests that such differential expression may be partially regulated by germline polymorphism. At this stage, however, we cannot formally dismiss a role for somatic mutation in ECM gene expression variation within RI mammary tumors.</p><p>We also described a number of important functional differences in <italic>Rrp1b</italic> between the progenitors of the AKXD RI panel, the high metastatic AKR/J, and low metastatic DBA/2J genotype mice. Specifically, the proximal promoter of <italic>Rrp1b</italic> in AKR/J mice contained polymorphisms that may reduce <italic>Rrp1b</italic> expression. This difference in promoter activity is one possible explanation for the observed differences in <italic>Rrp1b</italic> expression in the normal mammary tissue of these mice, with the high metastatic capacity AKR/J mouse having significantly lower levels of <italic>Rrp1b</italic> activity than the low metastatic DBA/2J mouse. Furthermore, ectopic expression led to reduced metastatic potential and primary tumor growth following tumor cell implantation into mice. In combination, these observations suggest, at least in this mouse model that increased <italic>Rrp1b</italic> expression correlate with a better outcome.</p><p>We have used a dual approach to try to address the importance of <italic>RRP1B</italic> in human breast cancer progression. The first of these approaches was to use data derived from microarray expression analysis of the Mvt-1/<italic>Rrp1b</italic> cells to address one of the central goals of our research: the translation of experimental data from mouse models of human breast cancer into potentially clinically relevant observations.

Whether the <italic>RRP1B</italic> signature proves of clinical value in this respect is at present unclear, and further testing of its prognostic value in different cohorts will be required to address this possibility. The significance of this study, however, is not the identification of yet another prognostic signature, but the fact that the underlying casual element is known. Identification of other genetic elements that drive the predictive gene expression patterns may provide a more robust means of complementing currently available tests used for the assessment of prognosis in breast cancer. Furthermore, this type of study also provides us with potentially novel and important insights into the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process.</p><p>Further supportive evidence for the role of <italic>RRP1B</italic> in human breast cancer progression was evident in the two pilot epidemiological studies, both of which found an inverse relationship between the variant A allele of the 1421G&#x02192;A <italic>RRP1B</italic> SNP and poor outcome markers. These consistent findings indicate that 1421G&#x02192;A is a marker for disease progression, and patients who carry the A allele are less likely to present with advanced disease than homozygous carriers of the more common G allele. These data are consistent with the results of functional analysis of <italic>Rrp1b</italic>, and associate <italic>RRP1B</italic> with disease outcome in human breast cancer. It should be noted that the variant 1421G&#x02192;A allele was associated with improved outcome in those individuals with ER positive tumors, which may permit better stratification of patients who are currently thought to be in a low risk category. A particularly intriguing question is if and how a patient's 1421G&#x02192;A genotype affects expression of the 33-gene <italic>RRP1B</italic> expression signature, and whether polymorphisms in the promoter of <italic>RRP1B</italic> in linkage disequilibrium with the 1421G&#x02192;A SNP are more important in this respect. These studies are currently ongoing in this laboratory. Indeed, a link between constitutional polymorphism and bulk tumor gene expression would be particularly significant given the technical difficulties associated with tumor gene expression profiling and the relative ease of SNP genotyping. These results, while consistent between the studies and in support of our hypothesis, must be considered only as preliminary. Further investigations in larger epidemiology studies specifically designed to address tumor progression and outcome, rather than tumor incidence, will be necessary to gain further support for the role of germline polymorphism in <italic>RRP1B</italic> in breast cancer progression.</p><p>Several differences were evident between the epidemiology study cohorts, the most notable of which was that the 1421G&#x02192;A SNP was associated with breast cancer-specific survival only in the Baltimore cohort, a discrepancy that is likely due to several factors. First, both cohorts are relatively small (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003c; 300), thus some differences might arise from statistical power issues. More importantly, the study population compositions differed: the Orange County cohort was derived from a population-based case-cohort study, including all cancer patients, regardless of stage, with more than 10 years of follow up, whereas the Baltimore cohort is a surgical breast cancer population, and therefore is biased against patients with metastatic disease at presentation. Furthermore, unlike the Orange County cohort, the Baltimore cohort contained African-American and Caucasian women. Differences in race/ethnicity influence allele frequency and disease outcome, and some variability in results is therefore expected. While the participation of patients from different race/ethnicities also strengthens study design, stratification is required. Stratification on race/ethnicity in the Baltimore cohort indicated that race/ethnicity was not a significant confounding factor. It is interesting to note, however, that the variant allele distribution is different in African-Americans and Caucasians in the Greater Baltimore cohort (0.099 in African-Americans versus 0.411 in Caucasians). It is known that African-American women have a poorer prognosis compared to other breast cancer patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, and given the protective effect exerted by the variant 1421G&#x02192;A, it is interesting to speculate that polymorphisms in genes such as <italic>RRP1B</italic> may be driving these ethnicity-specific differences in outcome. Thus, further characterization of this SNP in larger and ethnically diverse cohorts is required to determine the influence of race/ethnicity upon the association between this SNP and breast cancer survival.</p><p>The function of <italic>Rrp1b</italic> and its exact role in metastasis remain unclear at this time. <italic>Sipa1</italic> was originally cloned as a mitogen-inducible protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; that was subsequently shown to be a negative regulator of Rap1 by serving as a GAP for Rap1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Sipa1</italic> has significant effects on cellular adhesion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, primarily related to its effects on Rap1, which has been implicated in maintaining the integrity of polarized epithelia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; and intercellular adherens junctions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, and potentially integrating signaling between cadherins and integrins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Rrp1b may therefore mediate tumor cell adhesion properties by altering intercellular and cell&#x02013;ECM contacts in a Sipa1-dependent and Rap1-dependent manner. It should be noted, however, that the human polymorphism in <italic>RRP1B</italic> falls outside of the domain that directly interacts with the PDZ domain of Sipa1. Whether this polymorphism impacts the enzymatic function of Sipa1 or mediates metastatic potential through some other mechanism is unclear and currently under investigation. Similarly, it is unclear whether the amino acid substitution in human RRP1B directly affects function. Based on the mouse model, where increased expression confers protection against malignant progression, the variant leucine in the human ortholog may phenocopy the mouse situation by activating some function of <italic>RRP1B.</italic> Further in vitro analysis will be required to clarify the different situations in the two species and is currently under investigation in our laboratory.</p><p>In addition to the negative regulatory role on <italic>Sipa1</italic> function, there is some evidence to suggest that <italic>Rrp1b</italic> may be involved in RNA metabolism.

Probands were ascertained through the population-based Hereditary Breast Cancer Study funded by the National Cancer Institute. A description of the study and details of data collection methods have been reported previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030214-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, there were two case groups: cases with localized disease (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 130), and cases with regional/metastatic disease (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 139). The average age at diagnosis of this cohort was 55.9 &#x000b1; 13.4 years, and the average body mass index was 25.7 &#x000b1; 4.9.</p><p><italic>Greater Baltimore, Maryland.</italic> Surgical breast cancer cases were recruited at the University of Maryland Medical Center, the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Union Memorial Hospital, Mercy Medical Center, and the Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland between February 15, 1993 and August 27, 2003. We collected blood, tissue specimens, and survival information from 248 patients. These patients had pathologically confirmed breast cancer, were of African-American or Caucasian descent by self-report, were diagnosed with breast cancer within the last six months prior to recruitment, and had, by self-report, no previous history of the disease. Patients were excluded if they were HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus carriers, were intravenous drug users, were institutionalized, or were physically or mentally unable to sign consent and complete the questionnaire. Of the eligible patients that were identified through surgery lists, 83&#x00025; participated in the study. The subjects signed a consent form and completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Additional information to determine the ER-&#x003b1; status, disease stage, treatment, and survival was obtained from medical records and pathology reports, the Social Security Death Index, and the National Death Index. Disease staging was performed according to the TNM system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/ the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (AJCC/UICC). The Institutional Review Boards at the participating institutions approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4r"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Student's t-tests were used to compare means for continuous variables and Wilcoxon's sum rank test to compare medians. Variables that were not normally distributed, such as tumor size, were log transformed. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact tests were used to test for differences between categorical variables and to test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Unconditional logistic regression adjusting for multivariate covariates, such as age at diagnosis, was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios. We used likelihood ratio tests to calculate <italic>p-</italic>values comparing a model with covariates to a model without them. We used Cox regression models to perform survival analysis. All <italic>p-</italic>values presented are two-tailed and were considered to be statistically significant if they were below 0.05. The Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test were used for univariate survival analysis and Cox regression models were used to perform multivariate survival analysis. For the Baltimore cohort, survival was determined for the period from the date of hospital admission to the date of the last completed search for death entries in the Social Security Index (August 18, 2004) for the 248 case patients. The mean follow-up time for breast cancer survival was 55 months (range: 12 to 140 months). A total of 59 (24&#x00025;) of these 248 patients died during this period. We obtained death certificates of the deceased case patients and censored all causes of death that were not related to breast cancer, such as accidents, violent crimes, stroke, heart attack, and liver cirrhosis, in our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4s"><title>Haplotype analysis.</title><p>The genotype data of the 90 HapMap CEPH trio in the 250 kb flanking region of rs9306160 was downloaded from the HapMap database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hapmap.org">http://www.hapmap.org</ext-link>).
