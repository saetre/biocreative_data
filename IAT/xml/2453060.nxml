However, the molecular mechanisms linking MRN activity to ATM are not fully understood. Here, using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract we show that MRN-dependent processing of DSBs leads to the accumulation of short single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ssDNA oligos). The MRN complex isolated from the extract containing DSBs is bound to ssDNA oligos and stimulates ATM activity. Elimination of ssDNA oligos results in rapid extinction of ATM activity. Significantly, ssDNA oligos can be isolated from human cells damaged with ionizing radiation and injection of small synthetic ssDNA oligos into undamaged cells also induces ATM activation. These results suggest that MRN-dependent generation of ssDNA oligos, which constitute a unique signal of ongoing DSB repair not encountered in normal DNA metabolism, stimulates ATM activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ATM</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>Mre11</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomal breakage induces a robust cellular response that leads to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or under some circumstances, apoptosis. The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, a member of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-like kinase (PIKK) family, is central to this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Shiloh, 2006</xref>). Essential to full ATM activation, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, is the heterotrimeric Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Nbs1 (MRN) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Uziel <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Falck <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Lee and Paull, 2005</xref>). The effect of MRN on ATM and its activity is likely to happen on multiple levels, as well as recruitment of ATM by Nbs1 to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Falck <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), the MRN-dependent DSB unwinding and tethering activities are essential for efficient ATM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Lee and Paull, 2005</xref>). MRN complex also possesses nucleolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Paull and Gellert, 1998</xref>), and interestingly, Mre11-deficient cells complemented with an Mre11 allele carrying a mutation in the nuclease catalytic site exhibit defective ATM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Uziel <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). These observations support the hypothesis that MRN nuclease activity is required for ATM activation and are consistent with the recent report showing that Mirin, an inhibitor of MRN nuclease activity, suppresses ATM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The MRN complex has both exo- and endonuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Paull and Gellert, 1998</xref>). MRN endonucleolytic activity is important for DSB resection and is enhanced by CtIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Sartori <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), which also has nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Takeda <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, although MRN has a major function in DSB resection it is unclear whether this is linked to ATM activity. In budding yeast, continuous DNA resection, recruitment of DNA repair proteins and chromatin remodelling at the site of a DSB is required to maintain an active checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ira <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This suggests that DSB processing is linked to the activation of the DNA damage response. One aspect of DSB processing that has not been investigated is that endonucleolytic processing of DSBs should lead to the generation of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ssDNA oligos) as by-product. The role and the fate of these ssDNA oligos inside the nucleus are currently unknown. Recently, the presence of ssDNA oligos derived from a yet unidentified DNA-processing event has been linked to the chronic activation of the ATM-dependent DNA damage response in cells deficient for Trex1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), which is an exonuclease that degrades ssDNA to mononucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Mazur and Perrino, 2001</xref>). In addition, ATM activation has been shown to require hSSB1, a novel ssDNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Richard <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that ssDNA molecules have an important function in promoting and sustaining ATM activity. Here, using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract we have investigated how DNA ends are processed and how this processing influences the MRN- and ATM-dependent DNA damage response. The <italic>Xenopus</italic> system is ideal to study the rapid activation process of ATM following addition of DNA templates to the cell-free extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004b</xref>). Using this approach, we found that double- and single-stranded DNA templates inducing ATM activation are extensively processed. Surprisingly, we discovered that DNA resection leads to the production of ssDNA oligos that associate with the MRN complex and influence ATM activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA end processing leads to formation of ssDNA oligos in Xenopus laevis egg extract</title><p>Synthetic DNA molecules such as annealed oligonucleotides consisting of 70 bases of random complementary sequences (rDSBs) or poly-dA<sub>70</sub>/poly-dT<sub>70</sub> (pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub>) induce ATM-dependent DNA damage response in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Guo and Dunphy, 2000</xref>). We monitored the fate of different DNA molecules in the extract. Equal amounts of double-stranded rDSBs and pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> or single-stranded pA<sub>70</sub> and pT<sub>70</sub> DNA molecules were labelled with <sup>32</sup>P at the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; ends and incubated in egg extracts. DNA was then isolated and ran on sequencing gels. All DNA molecules were resected very rapidly in the extract resulting in the accumulation of mononucleotides and of ssDNA oligos ranging from 4 to 12 nucleotides in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Native gel electrophoresis of DNA derived from the extract treated with DSB molecules confirmed that these ssDNA oligos were present as single-stranded DNA as there was no difference in their molecular weight compared with denaturing gels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). ssDNA oligos could also be detected from internally labelled DNA, indicating that they arise from unwinding of DSBs followed by the resection of single-stranded DNA throughout its entire length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although all DNA molecules underwent resection, there were significant differences in their stability. Double-stranded DNA molecules exhibited the highest stability, whereas single-stranded DNA molecules were completely degraded after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is notable that although resection of rDSBs and pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> also led to the generation of ssDNA oligos, we did not observe a reduction in the molecular weight of these DNA molecules. This is probably due the fact that nucleolytic processing is balanced by ongoing DNA repair, as in contrast to single-stranded molecules, resected double-stranded DNA molecules could undergo fill-in DNA synthesis and end joining. Indeed, the appearance of DNA molecules with higher molecular weight than rDSBs and pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> confirmed this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Activation of ATM by different DNA structures</title><p>Activation of ATM can be monitored by detection of serine 1981 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>), and ATM kinase activity can be measured by phosphorylation of a histone H2AX carboxy-terminal peptide containing the serine 139 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>). We measured ATM activity triggered by different DNA molecules at increasing concentrations. rDSBs and pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> induced phosphorylation of histone H2AX and ATM serine 1981 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Surprisingly, single-stranded poly-dT<sub>70</sub> (pT<sub>70</sub>) and to a much lesser extent poly-dA<sub>70</sub> (pA<sub>70</sub>) induced significant ATM activity. However, circular single-stranded M13 phage DNA could not induce ATM activation even at high doses, suggesting that DNA ends are necessary for the activation of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). In these conditions, H2AX phosphorylation is mostly dependent upon ATM as shown by the suppression of H2AX phosphorylation induced by the ATM inhibitor KU55933 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hickson <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and, to a similar extent, by ATM depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2A and B</xref>). The phosphorylation status of ATM serine 1981 was consistent with H2AX phosphorylation levels and was inhibited by the ATM inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). ATM activation can be induced by ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Stiff <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, depletion of ATR from the egg extract did not affect the induction of ATM activation by single- and double-stranded DNA molecules, indicating that ATM was directly activated by these DNA structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3A and B</xref>). pT<sub>70</sub>-induced ATM activation might be due to the conversion of single-stranded pT<sub>70</sub> into double-stranded DNA in the extract. To rule out this possibility, we monitored pT<sub>70</sub> replication at different concentrations. We observed efficient pT<sub>70</sub> replication at concentrations higher than the ones already capable of inducing ATM activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). This indicated that pT<sub>70</sub> molecules were able to induce ATM activation in the single-stranded form. pT<sub>70</sub> replication at high doses might be due to the saturation of the enzymes responsible for pT<sub>70</sub> degradation resulting in subsequent stabilization of a fraction of pT<sub>70</sub> molecules, which then become available to the single-stranded DNA replication machinery. Replicated pT<sub>70</sub> molecules contribute to the induction of DNA damage response to DSBs in the egg extract as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Guo and Dunphy, 2000</xref>). We also measured ATM activity in response to low concentration of pT<sub>70</sub> in the presence of high amounts of aphidicolin, which inhibits DNA polymerases and single-stranded DNA synthesis in the egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>, ATM activation by pT<sub>70</sub> is refractory to aphidicolin treatment. Activation of ATM by pT<sub>70</sub> was also observed after gel purification of pT<sub>70</sub> oligos and was suppressed by pretreating pT<sub>70</sub> oligos with DNAse, confirming that it was not due to contaminants of pT<sub>70</sub> synthesis (data not shown). These data suggest that double as well as some single-stranded linear DNA molecules can stimulate ATM activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ssDNA oligos and ATM activity</title><p>We then correlated the stability of DNA templates to the persistence of ATM activity. To this end, rDSBs, pA<sub>70</sub>, pT<sub>70</sub> and single-stranded DNA molecules with random DNA sequence (R<sub>70</sub>) were incubated in the egg extract. ATM activity was monitored at various time points from DNA addition. Incubation of rDSBs, pT<sub>70</sub>, R<sub>70</sub> and to a lesser extent of pA<sub>70</sub> molecules in the extract resulted in stimulation of ATM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Significantly, ATM activity reached its peak and was maintained at time points when most of the single-stranded DNA templates such as pT<sub>70</sub> and pA<sub>70</sub> were degraded into smaller ssDNA oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2C</xref>). Further degradation of ssDNA oligos to mononucleotides correlated instead with the complete loss of ATM activity. In contrast, no significant loss of ATM activity was observed with rDSB molecules, whose stability was not affected over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2C</xref>). ssDNA oligos derived from pA<sub>70</sub>, which, compared with pT<sub>70</sub>-derived ssDNA oligos were more rapidly degraded to mononucleotides, were less effective at promoting sustained ATM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further probe the role of ssDNA oligos, we measured H2AX phosphorylation after the removal of pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> from the extract. To this end, biotinylated pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> oligos were incubated in the extract and removed after 30 min with streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). To verify that ssDNA oligos had been generated from pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> before its removal, we labelled pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> on the 3&#x02032; end of the DNA complementary to the biotinylated strand. After 30 min of incubation in the extract, ssDNA oligos were generated from pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> processing and could not be eliminated by the removal of biotinylated pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). ATM activity was then measured in the pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub>-depleted extracts. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), removal of pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> did not affect ATM activity, indicating that once the signal has been initiated the kinase is able to maintain its activity even in the absence of pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub>. To demonstrate a role for ssDNA oligos in maintaining ATM activity, we tested different nucleases for their ability to eliminate ssDNA oligos. We found that phosphodiesterase I (PDEI), which is known to preferentially degrade single-stranded DNA to mononucleotides as terminal products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Razzell and Khorana, 1959a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">1959b</xref>), was able to efficiently degrade small ssDNA oligos in the egg extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>) and to suppress ATM activity after removal of pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Although PDEI could also degrade RNA or poly-ADP ribose polymers (PARP), we found no effect of RNA degradation or PARP synthesis inhibition on ATM activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, we could demonstrate that PDEI in the conditions used for these experiments specifically degraded small ssDNA oligos and not larger double-stranded DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the ssDNA oligos generated from linear DNA processing sustain ATM activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The MRN complex mediates the effects of ssDNA oligos on ATM activity</title><p>As ATM activation requires the MRN complex in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract at low doses of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), we were intrigued to know whether the MRN complex was promoting ATM activity induced by ssDNA oligos. Biotinylated pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> molecules were incubated in the extract for 30 min and then removed. The MRN complex was subsequently immunoprecipitated from the extract with polyclonal antibodies raised against Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Depletion of the MRN complex led to the loss of ATM activity, suggesting that it was required to sustain ATM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). As the MRN complex tethers DNA fragments resulting in an increase in the local concentration of ATM and DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), we postulated that the MRN complex might bind to ssDNA oligos. To test this possibility, biotinylated pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> labelled with <sup>32</sup>P at the 3&#x02032; end was incubated in the egg extract for 30 min and then removed. Following immunoprecipitation of Mre11, we could detect the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-labelled ssDNA oligos in the immunoprecipitated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Treatment of the immunoprecipitated Mre11 with PDEI led to degradation of labelled ssDNA oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). To verify whether the MRN&#x02013;ssDNA oligos complexes were able to stimulate ATM activity, we incubated immunoprecipitated Mre11 derived from pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub>-treated extracts in fresh extracts containing pA<sub>70</sub>/pT<sub>70</sub> or rDSB at concentrations not sufficient to induce ATM activation. The presence of high molecular weight DNA facilitated the formation of DNA&#x02013;protein complexes with increased local concentration of MRN and ATM molecules as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In this case, the MRN&#x02013;ssDNA oligos complexes led to partial activation of ATM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Significantly, MRN&#x02013;ssDNA oligos complexes pretreated with PDEI, which was then washed away, were unable to induce ATM activation, suggesting that ssDNA oligos associated with MRN were active intermediates capable of promoting ATM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). To further confirm the role of ssDNA oligos in ATM activation, we incubated synthetic poly-dT<sub>5</sub> (pT<sub>5</sub>) and poly-dT<sub>10</sub> (pT<sub>10</sub>) oligonucleotides in the extract and measured ATM activity. However, these synthetic oligonucleotides failed to activate ATM in the extract (data not shown). This was likely due to the rapid degradation of exogenous pT<sub>5</sub> and pT<sub>10</sub> oligonucleotides in the egg cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). ssDNA oligos generated from processed ends were instead stable for more than 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that ssDNA oligos are stabilized by the rapid association with protein complexes such as MRN immediately after their generation. Notably, ssDNA oligos did not interfere with the ability of the MRN complex to promote end-to-end bridging of linear double-stranded DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), indicating that ssDNA oligos interact with parts of the MRN complex that are not involved in DNA tethering.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ssDNA oligos formation from chromosomal DSBs is MRN dependent</title><p>To show that ssDNA oligos generation is a physiologically relevant phenomenon, we sought to establish whether ssDNA oligos could be generated following induction of chromosomal breakage. Strikingly, <italic>Eco</italic>RI treatment of sperm nuclei induced the accumulation of ssDNA oligos that were efficiently degraded by PDEI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). ssDNA oligo formation over time was impaired by depletion of the MRN complex and restored by supplementing the egg extract with recombinant human MRN complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). This indicates that ssDNA oligo generation is due to MRN-dependent processing of DNA ends produced by <italic>Eco</italic>RI. The fact that human MRN complex restored the formation of ssDNA oligos in the egg extract confirmed that the ability to promote DSB processing is a conserved feature of the MRN complex. <italic>Eco</italic>RI-dependent chromosomal breakage induced ATM activation in the egg extract as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Yoo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Consistent with the data obtained with synthetic DNA templates, the degradation of ssDNA oligos by PDEI also led to the suppression of ATM activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>) induced by chromosomal breakage. Importantly, ATM activation by <italic>Eco</italic>RI-induced breaks was MRN dependent as it was abolished in Mre11-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ssDNA oligos induce ATM activation in human cells</title><p>To demonstrate that generation of ssDNA oligos at chromosomal breaks is a conserved phenomenon, we developed a protocol to isolate DNA oligos from human cells after induction of DSBs. Using this protocol, we could isolate ssDNA oligos from human U2OS cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). ssDNA oligos were also isolated from G1-arrested cells, suggesting that ssDNA oligo production as ATM activation is not restricted to S phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). We then tested the effect of ssDNA oligos on ATM in mammalian cells. To this end, we microinjected pT<sub>5</sub> oligonulceotides into human U2OS cells. This procedure allowed reaching a high nuclear concentration of ssDNA oligos overcoming ssDNA degradation that usually occurred with alternative methods based on liposome-mediated transfer (data not shown). To identify the injected cells, we used anti-goat IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluro 488 as injection marker. ATM activation in the injected cells was monitored by detecting ATM phospho-serine 1981 (pSerine 1981). The DNA&#x02013;injection marker mixture was injected in proximity to the nuclear periphery. Microinjection of cells with pT<sub>5</sub> led to activation of ATM in the injected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). This response was completely inhibited when cells were pre-incubated with the ATM inhibitor KU55933 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, microinjection of pA<sub>5</sub> or a mixture of random 5-mers also led to ATM activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). Injecting cells with the injection marker alone, dTTP or circular DNA did not lead to detectable ATM activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). ATM activation by small ssDNA oligos was observed in the majority of the injected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 10A</xref>). Quantification of the immunofluorescence intensity obtained with anti-phospho-ATM also revealed a robust activation of ATM induced by ssDNA oligos in the injected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 10B</xref>). ATM activation was detected immediately after oligo injection to exclude the interference of ssDNA oligos with DNA metabolic processes such as DNA replication or transcription. ssDNA oligos-induced ATM activation resulted in small and diffuse foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B and C</xref>) that were different from the large DNA damage foci typical of chromosomal breakage induced by IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). The absence of genomic DSBs in cells injected with various ssDNA oligos was confirmed by the absence of DNA damage foci containing phosphorylated histone H2AX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>MRN-dependent ssDNA oligo generation at DSBs</title><p>Here, we have shown that DNA molecules with free DNA ends triggering ATM activation are rapidly processed resulting in the generation of ssDNA oligos. These molecules are not simple by-products of DNA resection as they participate in the ATM-dependent DNA damage response. We have demonstrated that generation of ssDNA oligos from chromosome breaks requires the MRN complex. In addition, we have shown that the MRN complex bound to ssDNA oligos promotes ATM activity, indicating that ssDNA oligos function as allosteric cofactors activating the complex. It is known that the MRN complex containing nuclease-inactive Mre11 fails to promote ATM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Uziel <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). In addition, Mirin, a chemical that inhibits Mre11 nuclease activity without affecting MRN and ATM binding to DSBs, suppresses ATM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Our findings are consistent with the requirement for the MRN complex nuclease activity in the ATM activation process. Once ssDNA oligos have been generated, they remain associated with the MRN complex and probably promote a stable conformation capable of inducing continuous stimulation of ATM molecules. This process, likely, requires the generation of a limited amount of ssDNA oligos bound to MRN complex and does not require extensive resection to activate a large number of ATM molecules. This model is compatible with the lack of extensive resection in G1-arrested cells in which ATM can be activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Jazayeri <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Sartori <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In addition, we show that ssDNA oligo formation can take place also in G1-arrested cells after treatment with IR. This is consistent with the recently reported resection of &#x02018;ragged' DNA ends induced by IR in G1-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barlow <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). ssDNA oligos produced at DSBs could interact with one or more subunits of the MRN complex that have DNA-binding domains. The binding of dinucleoside polyphosphates to the MRN complex through the Rad50 subunit has recently been demonstrated and suggests that the activities of the MRN complex are regulated by different nucleotide metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bhaskara <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, it is also possible that the MRN complex is not the only mediator of ssDNA oligos' effect on ATM. ssDNA oligos might also influence ATM activity binding other targets such as the recently discovered ssDNA-binding protein hSSB1, which has high affinity for small ssDNA oligos and is required for ATM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Richard <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Overall, these observations are consistent with reports showing the existence of a multiple step activation mode of ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Berkovich <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and suggest that ssDNA can trigger an initial activation of ATM, which can be amplified and maintained by ssDNA oligos generation. ssDNA oligos may increase the activity of ATM molecules already bound to DSBs or facilitate the activation of inactive ATM molecules that have not yet engaged DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the absence of ATM-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX triggered by ssDNA oligos alone suggests that ssDNA oligos are not sufficient to enable ATM-dependent phosphorylation of chromatin-bound targets. This event probably requires the presence of double-stranded DNA ends onto which ATM can load. This is also suggested by the fact that, differently from linear DNA, single-stranded circular DNA is unable to trigger any ATM activity.</p><p>As far as the mechanism of ssDNA oligo generation is concerned, the detection of ssDNA oligos from internally labelled DNA indicates that they are produced by the combined actions of endo- and exonuclease activities described for the MRN complex. The MRN complex might exert an effect on single-stranded DNA generated by helicase-mediated unwinding of DSBs. Interestingly, we found that generation of ssDNA oligos from chromosomal DSBs is entirely dependent upon MRN, whereas small amounts of ssDNA oligos generated from synthetic DNA templates can still be detected in the absence of MRN (data not shown). This indicates that MRN complex activity is specific for DSB processing that arise in the context of the chromatin, consistent with its chromatin-remodelling activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Tsukuda <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ssDNA oligos turnover is linked to ATM activation status</title><p>An important aspect of ssDNA oligo metabolism is their turnover as the persistence of ssDNA oligos is correlated with the activation status of ATM. We showed that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract, exogenous synthetic small ssDNA oligos are rapidly degraded, whereas ssDNA oligos derived from the resection of larger DNA templates are more stable. This is likely due to their association with factors involved in DNA resection such as the MRN complex or other ssDNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, the ssDNA-binding protein hSSB1, which is highly conserved in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, has a higher binding affinity for poly-pyrimidine than for poly-purine containing ssDNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Richard <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The association of ssDNA oligos to proteins such as hSSB1, if proven, might explain the higher intrinsic stability and efficiency at stimulating ATM activity of poly-pyrimidine pT<sub>70</sub> compared with poly-purine pA<sub>70</sub> oligos in the egg extract.</p><p>Predictably, the elimination of ssDNA oligos would be required for efficient inactivation of ATM once DSBs have been repaired, whereas the persistence of ssDNA oligos would maintain ATM active. ssDNA oligos elimination could be mediated by an exonuclease capable of degrading ssDNA oligos. Among known nucleases, Trex1, which has an activity similar to PDEI, can degrade ssDNA oligos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Mazur and Perrino, 2001</xref>). Mutations in Trex1 are responsible for the Aicardi&#x02013;Goutieres syndrome, a complex human disease that recapitulates the effects of an embryonic response to a viral DNA infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Crow <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The deficiency of Trex1 activity leads to the accumulation of free ssDNA oligos and this correlates with chronic stimulation of the ATM-dependent DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Therefore, Trex1 is an ideal candidate for the regulation of ssDNA oligos stability and, indirectly, ATM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, Trex1 is confined to endoplasmic vesicles and ssDNA oligos need to be exported from nuclei for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In our experiments, direct injection of ssDNA oligos into cells bypasses this degradation pathway reaching a nuclear concentration able to stimulate ATM. Taken together, these findings indicate an important and unexpected role for the ssDNA oligos metabolism in the DNA damage response.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ssDNA oligos as an alarm signal</title><p>The creation of ssDNA oligos during the resection of DNA undergoing repair, either from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; processing of DSBs or possibly from enlarging gaps in other forms of DNA repair is a unique signal of DNA damage. Whereas mononucleotides are produced by normal DNA metabolism, these ssDNA oligos are only present when DNA damage is being processed. ssDNA oligos could function as an alarm signal that promotes full activation of the DNA damage response. Thus, whereas DSB ends and ssDNA are necessary to establish a platform to assemble factors required for the localized activation of the checkpoint and for the repair of the damage, a widespread and efficient DNA damage response&#x02014;which should be turned off when repair is complete&#x02014;takes advantage of DNA species that are only produced while repair is ongoing. The fact that single-stranded circular DNA, which is not degraded, is unable to trigger sustained ATM activation is consistent with the hypothesis that ssDNA in the absence of DNA processing is not sufficient to activate ATM. In budding yeast, where repair can be carefully monitored, resection continues at a rate of 4 kb/h from DSB ends for as long as it takes the process of repair to be completed, and the checkpoint is turned off soon after repair is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Vaze <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Keogh <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In the absence of yeast Mre11, the DNA damage checkpoint is initiated, but not maintained as in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">D'Amours and Jackson, 2001</xref>), indicating a role for Mre11 in sustaining the checkpoint. Importantly, ssDNA oligos can also be observed following induction of DSBs in human cells, indicating that this is a conserved physiological phenomenon. The introduction of ssDNA oligos in cancer cells could be therapeutically exploited to enhance DNA damage response without producing further damage to the genome.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Xenopus egg extract</title><p>The egg extracts were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costanzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>).
