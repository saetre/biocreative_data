Here, we have characterized the efficiencies of different acceptors using baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with human ABCG1 cDNA, which is inducible upon treatment with mifepristone. When normalized on particle number and particle surface area, the acceptor efficiency for FC efflux was as follows: small unilamellar vesicles (SUV)&#x0003e;LDL&#x0003e;reconstituted HDL&#x0003e;HDL<sub>2</sub> = HDL<sub>3</sub>. Based on phospholipid content, the order was reversed. ABCG1 also mediated phospholipid efflux to human serum and HDL<sub>3</sub>. ABCG1-mediated FC efflux correlated significantly with a number of HDL subfractions and components in serum collected from 25 normolipidemic individuals: apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.7), apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.5), HDL-C (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.4), HDL-PL (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.4), &#x003b1;-2 HDL (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.4), and pre&#x003b2; HDL (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2). ABCG1 did not enhance influx of FC or cholesteryl oleyl ether (COE) when cells were incubated with radiolabeled HDL<sub>3</sub>. ABCG1 expression did not increase the association of HDL<sub>3</sub> with cells. Compared with control cells, ABCG1 expression significantly increased the FC pool available for efflux and the rate constant for efflux. In conclusion, composition and particle size determine the acceptor efficiency for ABCG1-mediated efflux. ABCG1 increases cell membrane FC pools and changes its rate of desorption into the aqueous phase without enhancing the association with the acceptor.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apolipoproteins</kwd><kwd>ATP binding cassette transporter G1</kwd><kwd>BHK cells</kwd><kwd>binding</kwd><kwd>high density lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>influx</kwd><kwd>phospholipid efflux</kwd><kwd>time course</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Published, JLR Papers in Press, September 30, 2008.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>The release of cholesterol from cells in the vessel wall, primarily macrophage-derived foam cells, is the first step in the process termed &#x0201c;reverse cholesterol transport&#x0201d; (RCT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). It is believed that in RCT, the excess cholesterol present in peripheral cells is incorporated into HDL, which then, either directly or indirectly by transfer to LDL, delivers the excess cholesterol to the liver for excretion. A number of different mechanisms have been shown to participate in the movement of cholesterol from cells to extracellular acceptor lipoproteins. These pathways for cholesterol efflux include unmediated diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) or protein-mediated transport linked to the presence in cells of scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). These pathways have been discussed in detail in a number of recent reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). More recently, another cell protein, ATP binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), has been shown to influence the efflux of cholesterol from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Whereas much is known about the nature of the efflux process mediated by aqueous diffusion, SR-BI, and ABCA1, little has been established about the nature of the efflux process mediated by ABCG1. It has been established that this protein is present in a variety of tissues, where it can enhance the efflux of cell cholesterol and oxysterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and it is very promiscuous in terms of the particles that can serve as cholesterol acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). However, in contrast to the situation with ABCA1, lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) does not serve as an acceptor of cell cholesterol provided by ABCG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Based on this broad array of potential acceptors and the distribution of ABCG1 throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), it has been proposed that the protein may not serve as a direct transporter of membrane cholesterol to acceptors, but rather play a role by enriching the cell membrane with cholesterol that can then be incorporated into a variety of acceptor particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the present investigation was to study in detail the role of different acceptors in mediating cell cholesterol efflux, and in this way to gain further understanding of the ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux process. The experimental cell system used in the present study has been previously described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Briefly, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were stably transfected with an N-terminal FLAG-tagged human ABCG1 cDNA that was inducible by treatment with mifepristone. This inducible system allows for the direct assessment of the impact of ABCG1 expression on cell cholesterol flux and was used for a detailed study characterizing a number of aspects of ABCG1 and its role in cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Tissue culture plastic wares were obtained from Falcon (Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln, NJ) and from Corning Inc.

BSA was obtained from Cellianxe (Toronto, Canada). [<sup>3</sup>H] cholesterol and [<sup>3</sup>H] cholesterol oleyl ether (COE) were from Perkin-Elmer Analytical Sciences (Boston, MA). Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase inhibitor (ACAT inhibitor), compound CP113, 818 was kindly provided by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals (Groton, CT).

Although mifepristone is a progesterone antagonist and progesterone has been shown to inhibit cellular cholesterol trafficking, the concentration of mifepristone used in our studies was 3,000-fold lower than those that affect cholesterol trafficking and had no effect on cholesterol metabolism in BHK control cells. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that even these low levels of mifepristone may have some effect on ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux. Cells were grown and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS except during experimental treatments. ABCG1 was induced by incubating cells for 18 h in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA and 10 nM mifepristone. Studies were carried out on standard 12-well tissue-culture plates unless otherwise stated.</p></sec><sec><title>Phospholipid vesicle preparation and HDL phospholipid modification</title><p>HDL<sub>2</sub> (d, 1.066&#x02013;1.125 g/ml) and HDL<sub>3</sub> (d, 1.125&#x02013;1.210 g/ml) were isolated from human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). ApoA-I was purified from delipidated HDL as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Prior to use, apoA-I, HDL<sub>2</sub>, HDL<sub>3</sub>, and LDL were extensively dialyzed against 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.4) and sterilized by filtration using a 0.45 &#x003bc;m Millipore filter. Egg PC small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were made as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>Enrichment of HDL<sub>3</sub> with phospholipid, DMPC, or SM, multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) was done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). For DMPC enrichment, 1&#x02013;2 mg of HDL<sub>3</sub> protein/ml was incubated with increasing amounts of DMPC MLVs (1.5-, 2-, and 4-fold the amount of native HDL<sub>3</sub> phospholipid) for 2 h at the gel to liquid crystal phase transition temperature of 24&#x000b0;C. For SM enrichment, MLVs were added at increasing amounts (5-, 10-, and 20-fold the SM content of native HDL<sub>3</sub>, which is estimated to be 12% of total HDL<sub>3</sub> phospholipid), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Because SM has broad phase transition temperature, the mixture was warmed to 42&#x000b0;C and then allowed to cool slowly to 25&#x000b0;C over 5 h. During DMPC or SM enrichment of HDL<sub>3</sub>, as a control, native HDL<sub>3</sub> was also incubated similarly but without addition of MLVs. After incubation of HDL<sub>3</sub> with MLVs, any unreacted MLVs were removed by sequentially filtering the HDL<sub>3</sub>-MLV mixture through 0.45 and 0.22 &#x003bc;m filters. The mixture was then stored at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, and any remaining MLVs were removed from HDL<sub>3</sub> by centrifugation for 30 min at 3,000 <italic>g</italic>. Phospholipid and protein concentrations were measured by phosphorus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) and a modified Lowry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>) assays, respectively. At the end of the phospholipid enrichment procedure, the phospholipid to protein ratio of enriched HDL<sub>3</sub> particles used in these experiments ranged from 0.48&#x02013;2.05 in case of DMPC and 0.45&#x02013;1.25 in case of SM. The HDL particles having the maximum enrichment of either DMPC or SM were fractionated by fast-protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using a Superdex HR200 column. No difference in elution volume was observed indicating that the enrichment with phospholipid had no significant effect on HDL particle size.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of discoidal reconstituted HDL particles</title><p>Reconstituted HDL (rHDL) discs containing human apoA-I or apoA-II and egg PC were prepared by the cholate dialysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).

The egg PC was vortexed in TBS (pH 7.4) to generate MLVs and incubated with sodium cholate at 37&#x000b0;C for 1.5 h to generate detergent-PC mixed micelles. ApoA-I (egg PC to apoA-I weight ratio of 2:1 and egg PC/protein mole ratio of 79:1) or apoA-II (egg PC to apoA-II weight ratio of 2.6:1 and egg PC/protein mole ratio of 58:1), freshly dialyzed from 6 M guanidine-HCl in TBS, was added to the lipid-detergent mixture. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C followed by extensive dialysis against TBS at 4&#x000b0;C to remove sodium cholate. ApoA-II-containing discs were fractionated by FPLC using a Superdex HR200 column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), and particles having the same size as that of apo A-I rHDL discs were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of HDL<sub>3</sub> association to ABCG1</title><p>HDL<sub>3</sub> particles were dialyzed against PBS, 0.25 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and iodinated with Na [<sup>125</sup>I] using the modified iodine monochloride method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).

The cells were then washed three times with MEM-HEPES medium containing 1% BSA and were incubated for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C with the iodinated HDL<sub>3</sub> particles (0.5 ml) at different concentrations. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed from the cells while the plates were on ice and the cell monolayers were washed three times with ice cold MEM-HEPES containing 1% BSA, followed by three washes with ice cold PBS.

Cells were later treated with or without mifepristone for 18 h in DMEM medium containing 0.2% BSA. Efflux of FC was induced by incubation with respective acceptors for 4 h. Efflux was calculated by measuring the release of radiolabeled FC into the medium, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). All the experiments were performed in the presence of the ACAT inhibitor CP113, 818 unless otherwise mentioned.

The incubation media were removed, and the amount of label cholesterol and cholesterol mass were determined. Cholesterol mass in the media was quantitated flourimetrically using the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Molecular probes, Eugene, OR).</p><p>To measure influx of HDL cholesterol in to cells, HDL<sub>3</sub> particles were labeled by incubation with [<sup>3</sup>H] FC (100 &#x003bc;Ci/mg HDL<sub>3</sub> protein) or with CETP (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) and [<sup>3</sup>H] COE (100 &#x003bc;Ci/mg HDL<sub>3</sub> protein) that had been dried on the glass wall of a test tube under N<sub>2</sub>.

The different acceptors included HDL<sub>2</sub>, HDL<sub>3</sub>, LDL, rHDL discs, and egg PC SUVs at a range of concentrations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). Because these acceptors differ in composition, efflux data are normalized on the basis of their protein content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), phospholipid content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), particle number concentration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), and particle size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). All of these particles, with the exception of lipid-free apoA-I (data not shown) act as cholesterol acceptors. The most efficient acceptor when normalized on the basis of protein was rHDL, and HDL<sub>2</sub> and HDL<sub>3</sub> were equally effective (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), while HDL<sub>3</sub> proved to be the best acceptor when normalized on phospholipid concentration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).

In the present study we have collected data that aid in the elucidation of the mechanism by which ABCG1 enhances the removal of FC from cells.</p><sec><title>Acceptor effects</title><sec><title>Particle size</title><p>The effects of acceptor particle size on the efflux of cellular FC have been studied previously in this laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Generally, when different types of acceptor particles are compared on the basis of their phospholipid contents, smaller particles are more efficient at a given phospholipid concentration. The results in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> show that this finding also applies to ABCG1-mediated FC efflux whereby HDL particles are much more effective than SUV. This effect occurs with fibroblast-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) whereby FC efflux occurs primarily by the aqueous diffusion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and with cells whereby efflux involves diffusion that is facilitated by SR-BI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). These observations, combined with the results in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> showing that larger particles are better acceptors at a given particle number concentration, are consistent with the aqueous diffusion mechanism being involved in ABCG1-mediated efflux.</p><p>From considerations of colloid theory and the aqueous diffusion mechanism of cellular FC efflux, it can be shown that the collision frequency between acceptor particles and cholesterol molecules that have desorbed from the plasma membrane of cells into a given volume of extracellular medium is a function of acceptor concentration and particle size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Thus, the relative efflux of cellular cholesterol to different acceptors should be normalized when expressed in terms of the product (particle number concentration x particle radius). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, in agreement with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), this prediction holds for SUV, LDL, and the rHDL disc, supporting the notion that the ABCG1-mediated efflux proceeds via the aqueous diffusion mechanism. Interestingly, the HDL<sub>2</sub> and HDL<sub>3</sub> efflux curves in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> do not coincide with the curves for the other types of acceptor particles. The higher collision frequency required with the HDL<sub>2</sub> and HDL<sub>3</sub> particles to achieve a given efflux may be due to their high protein surface coverage&#x0003b; the lower amount of phospholipid surface could reduce the number of productive collisions by which cholesterol molecules diffusing in the aqueous phase are absorbed into the acceptor particle.</p></sec><sec><title>Acceptor composition</title><p>To address further the role of phospholipid in ABCG1-mediated efflux, we conducted an assay using HDL<sub>3</sub> particles that had been enriched with either SM or PC using a published protocol in which the HDL is incubated with multilamellar phospholipid vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). As can be seen from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, keeping the particle number constant (i.e., constant HDL protein concentration) and increasing the phospholipid to protein ratio increased efflux from the control BHK and the ABCG1-upregulated cells, as has been seen with other cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). However, the difference between control and mifepristone-treated cells, which represents the ABCG1 contribution to efflux, is essentially unchanged&#x0003b; this is in marked contrast to SR-BI-facilitated FC efflux, which is highly sensitive to HDL phospholipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Thus, increasing the phospholipid content of the medium stimulated ABCG1-mediated efflux (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), but changing the phospholipid content of HDL<sub>3</sub> while maintaining a constant particle number, had no effect on ABCG1-mediated FC efflux (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The enrichment with phospholipid would primarily affect the surface of the HDL and did not significantly change lipoprotein size and therefore collision frequency with desorbed cholesterol molecules&#x0003b; these results are also consistent with ABCG1 promoting efflux by an aqueous diffusion mechanism.</p><p>Because ABCG1 is capable, to varying degrees, of releasing cellular cholesterol to all phospholipid-containing extracellular acceptors, we determined if there are specific HDL components or subfractions that are preferential acceptors of cell cholesterol provided via the ABCG1 pathway. Because apoA-II is present in HDL subfractions that also contain apoA-I (apoA-I/A-II particles), the results illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> suggest that these particles, when present in whole serum, are efficient acceptors of cholesterol supplied by ABCG1. It should also be noted that &#x003b1;-2 particles carry the majority of apoA-II, and previously we have found that this particle has an important role in ABCA1 and SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). We further determined if there is an intrinsic difference between apoA-I and apoA-II in mediating ABCG1 cholesterol efflux by preparing reconstituted discs containing phospholipid and either apoA-I or apoA-II. Though the apoA-II had higher fractional of FC efflux compared with apoA-I at concentration &#x0003e;8 &#x003bc;g/ml, the catalytic efficiencies of both rHDL discs were the same (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Association of HDL with ABCG1</title><p>The binding of extracellular acceptor particles plays a role in cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1 and SR-BI.

As can be seen from <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, there is a linear increase in the association of the radiolabeled HDL with the cells as the concentration of the HDL is increased&#x0003b; however, there is no difference in this association between control and ABCG1-expressing cells. Our finding of no association of HDL with ABCG1 disagrees with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), whereby they have shown that reduced ABCG1 expression diminishes HDL binding with the RAW264.7 cell.

The data are consistent with a model in which the rate of desorption of cholesterol from the cell membrane is increased by ABCG1&#x0003b; in this experiment, the pool size of cholesterol available for efflux was increased by 6%. In a series of similar studies, the increase in size of the FC pool generated by the expression of ABCG1 was 6%&#x02013;12%. This observation is consistent with previous studies that proposed that the enhanced efflux observed with cells expressing ABCG1 is linked to this protein's ability to enrich the membrane pool of cholesterol that undergoes efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Further evidence that ABCG1 increases the availability of cholesterol in the plasma membrane comes from the observation that the cholesterol oxidase-sensitive pool of membrane cholesterol is expanded upon ABCG1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Thus, the major role of ABCG1 in this BHK cell system is to enrich the plasma membrane with cholesterol, perhaps in specific pools in the membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Phospholipid efflux</title><p>In addition to the efflux of cholesterol, ABCG1 expression also stimulates the release of cellular phospholipids to HDL<sub>3</sub> and to human serum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

We have measured choline-phospholipid efflux to different acceptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We observed phospholipid efflux to whole serum and isolated HDL&#x0003b; however, as with cholesterol efflux, incubation with lipid-free apoA-I had no ability to promote phospholipid efflux. The fractional release of phospholipid is considerably less than that obtained with cholesterol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The reason for this probably reflects the lower aqueous solubility of phospholipid compared with cholesterol consistent with the aqueous diffusion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and the distribution of phospholipid in plasma and internal membranes, whereas cholesterol is enriched in the plasma membrane and thus more available for efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). The extent to which ABCG1-mediated phospholipid release to lipoproteins can modify the composition of the acceptor particles remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Influx</title><p>The general pattern of ABCG1-mediated efflux is similar to that obtained with cells expressing high levels of SR-BI. SR-BI expression enhances the passive efflux of cell FC and also stimulates the influx of FC, and the selective uptake of HDL CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). ABCG1 activity promotes FC efflux&#x0003b; thus we determined if such expression also stimulates the influx of either HDL FC or CE. The results presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> demonstrate that, unlike SR-BI, expression of ABCG1 has no impact on the influx of either form of cholesterol. Incubating SR-BI-expressing cells with HDL can result in either net influx or net efflux, depending on the cholesterol gradient between the HDL and the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In contrast, and on a theoretical basis, if ABCG1 were the only protein participating in cholesterol flux, its expression would result in only greater net efflux when the cells were exposed to HDL. The cholesterol mass data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> are consistent with the isotopic data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Physiological implications of findings</title><p>It has become increasingly obvious that there are a number of pathways for the flux of cholesterol between cells and serum lipoproteins. At least three protein-mediated pathways have been identified, and these proteins demonstrate similarities and differences. Among them are:</p><sec><title>Acceptor specificity</title><p>ABCG1 and SR-BI require cholesterol acceptors that contain phospholipid, and the efficiency of the acceptor is determined by the composition and size of the extracellular particle. In contrast, phospholipid-free or phospholipid-poor apoproteins or helical amphipathic peptides serve as cholesterol acceptors via the ABCA1 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding</title><p>Cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 has an absolute requirement for the binding of apoprotein to the cell, with recent evidence indicating the efficient efflux requires binding directly to the ABCA1 protein and indirectly to other membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). There is a binding component to the SR-BI-mediated efflux of cholesterol to HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), particularly at low acceptor concentrations&#x0003b; however, there is also evidence that some cholesterol efflux occurs via aqueous diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). Our present study and the results of Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) indicate that acceptor binding to the donor cell is not a requirement for efflux via the ABCG1 pathway. However, in all cases the expression of efflux transporter results in changes in the organization of the lipids in the plasma membrane as evidenced by an increased susceptibility of plasma membrane cholesterol to cholesterol oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bidirectional flux</title><p>The two ABC transporters participate in unidirectional flux of cholesterol between cells and extracellular acceptors, even though the nature of the acceptors differs. In contrast, SR-BI expression enhances the efflux of cell FC and also the influx of lipoprotein FC and CE.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological significance</title><p>The role of cholesterol efflux in RCT has largely focused on macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells. All three transporters are present in macrophages, although the level of expression and the contribution to efflux of SR-BI remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). However, it is now well established that macrophages express ABCA1 and ABCG1, and the expression of these proteins is increased in cholesterol-enriched macrophages. There is evidence that ABCA1 and ABCG1 function coordinately, with ABCA1 initially providing phospholipid to lipid-poor apoproteins (pre-&#x003b2; HDL) that then become further enriched with phospholipid and cholesterol through the action of ABCG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). It can be speculated that SR-BI, if present, could also contribute to the lipidation of newly generated HDL&#x0003b; however it is apparent that SR-BI plays a major role in the flux of cholesterol between HDL and hepatocytes and endocrine cells, whereas the ABC transporters provide the major pathways for removal of excess cholesterol from macrophages.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ABC, ATP binding cassette</p></list-item><list-item><p>apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I</p></list-item><list-item><p>apoA-II, apolipoprotein A-II</p></list-item><list-item><p>BHK, baby hamster kidney</p></list-item><list-item><p>CE, cholesteryl ester</p></list-item><list-item><p>CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein</p></list-item><list-item><p>COE, cholesteryl oleyl ether</p></list-item><list-item><p>FC, free cholesterol</p></list-item><list-item><p>FPLC, fast-protein liquid chromatography</p></list-item><list-item><p>DMPC, 1, 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine</p></list-item><list-item><p>egg PC, egg glycerophosphocholine</p></list-item><list-item><p>MLV, multilamellar vesicle</p></list-item><list-item><p>PEG, polyethylene glycol</p></list-item><list-item><p>RCT, reverse cholesterol transport</p></list-item><list-item><p>rHDL, reconstituted HDL disc</p></list-item><list-item><p>SM, sphingomyelin</p></list-item><list-item><p>SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B type I</p></list-item><list-item><p>SUV, small unilamellar vesicles</p></list-item></list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><name><surname>Movva</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name>, and D.
