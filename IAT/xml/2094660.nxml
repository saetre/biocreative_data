The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) origin of plasmid replication (OriP) provides episomal genome stability through a poorly understood mechanism. We show here that recombinational repair proteins MRE11 and NBS1 are recruited to the Dyad Symmetry (DS) region of OriP in a TRF2- and cell cycle-dependent manner. Depletion of MRE11 or NBS1 by siRNA inhibits OriP replication and destabilized viral episomes. OriP plasmid maintenance was defective in MRE11 and NBS1 hypomorphic fibroblast cell lines and only integrated, non-episomal forms of EBV were detected in a lympoblastoid cell line derived from an NBS1-mutated individual. Two-dimensional agarose gel analysis of OriP DNA revealed that recombination-like structures resembling Holliday-junctions form at OriP in mid S phase. MRE11 and NBS1 association with DS coincided with replication fork pausing and origin activation, which preceded the formation of recombination structures. We propose that NBS1 and MRE11 promote replication-associated recombination junctions essential for EBV episomal maintenance and genome stability.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome stability depends on the successful completion of chromosome duplication prior to cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Kolodner1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The MRN complex accumulates at double strand break-induced foci, along with several other cellular proteins, including 53BP1, CHK2, and BRCA1. In addition to their role at sites of damaged DNA, MRN and other members of the intra-S phase checkpoint response have been implicated in normal replication initiation events at origins and during re-initiation at sites of stalled or collapsed replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Maser1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In earlier studies, MRE11 and NBS1 have been implicated in the replication activity of OriP through an association with the E2F binding sites located over 1 kb from the DS region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Maser2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We now provide evidence that MRE11 and NBS1 can be recruited to the DS region of OriP through additional interactions, including those with TRF2, and that deficiencies in MRE11 and NBS1 inhibit Orip replication and maintenance function. We present evidence that that recombination-like structures form in the later stages of S phase at OriP.

As expected, TRF2 bound efficiently to DS wt, but not to DS nm- or &#x00394;DS. Noteably, MRE11 was detected in the DSwt, but not in any of the control templates lacking telomere repeats. Control protein EBNA1 bound to DS wt and DS nm-, but not to &#x00394;DS lacking EBNA1 binding sites. Replication protein PCNA did not bind to any of the templates, and the DNA binding protein PARP1 bound non-specifically to all of the templates. These findings indicate that MRE11 can be recruited to DS template DNA in vitro, and that binding depends on the telomere repeat sequence in DS.</p><fig id="pone-0001257-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001257.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>MRE11 associates with the DS region of OriP.</title><p>A) DNA affinity purification assays were performed with Raji nuclear extracts and DNA templates derived from DS wt, DS nm-, or &#x00394;DS.

We tested the effect of the telomere repeats on protein interactions by comparing OriP wt and OriP nm- containing plasmid in transfected cells. We found that EBNA1 bound to OriP wt and nm- to a similar extent. TRF2 bound OriP wt (&#x0223c;22&#x00025; input), but its binding was reduced over 10 fold (&#x0223c;1.5&#x00025; input) for OriP nm-.

For these experiments, we used the EBV positive adherent cell line D98/HR1 which carry EBV episomes and have relatively high transfection efficiency. siRNA depletion of MRE11 and NBS1 was estimated at greater than 80&#x00025; reduction as monitored by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). OriP-dependent plasmid replication was assayed by Southern blot analysis of Dpn I resistant plasmid (top panel) relative to total input DNA linearized by BamHI (lower panel) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The DpnI resistant form measures the DNA replicated in mammalian cells since its methylation pattern differs from the E. coli generated plasmid DNA initially transfected. PhosphorImager quantification of at least four independent transfections revealed that siRNA depletion of MRE11 and NBS1 reduced OriP replication by &#x0223c;3.7 and &#x0223c;2.0 fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, and data not shown).

B) Transient DNA replication assays of OriP-containing plasmids were analyzed by Southern blot. D98/HR1 cells were transfected with OriP plasmid and siRNA for either MRE11, NBS1, or luciferase control (as indicated above each lane). Hirt extracted plasmid DNA was digested with DpnI plus BamHI (top panel) or BamHI only (lower panel) and probed with OriP specific probes.

The percentage of EBV episomes relative to the EBV DNA retained in the well is calculated below.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001257.g002"/></fig><p>OriP is also essential for episome maintenance of EBV. To determine if MRE11 or NBS1 contribute to EBV episome maintenance, we examined the stability of EBV episomes in D98/HR1 cells after siRNA depletion of MRE11 and NBS1. The episomal form can be detected by pulse field gel (PFG) electrophoresis and Southern blotting of D98/HR1 cell DNA purified in agarose plugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). We found &#x0223c;22&#x00025; of the EBV DNA could be isolated as intact episomes in D98/HR1 cells transfected with control siRNA (siControl). The DNA retained in the well is a combination of integrated and trapped episomal DNA. This was similar to that observed for latently infected Raji cells, which are known to have mostly episomal, but some integrated forms of EBV DNA. Transfection of D98/HR1 cells with siRNA specific for MRE11 or NBS1 decreased EBV episomes to &#x0223c;10 and 6.5&#x00025; of total EBV DNA, corresponding to a 2.2 and 3.1 fold loss of episomes in five days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). MRE11 and NBS1 depletion also caused aberrant migration of EBV episomes in PFG electrophoresis, suggesting that these proteins contribute to the structural stability of latent EBV genomes. These effects suggest that MRE11 and NBS1 function in EBV episome maintenance, as well as in genome stability.</p><p>To further assess the role of MRE11 and NBS1 in OriP function, we assayed OriP plasmid maintenance in MRE11 and NBS1 hypomorphic cell lines. Isogenic cell lines derived from mutant and wt replacements of MRE11 and NBS1 have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Stracker2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Wt and mt cell lines were transfected with OriP plasmid expressing the EBNA1 protein, and then assayed for plasmid maintenance at 1 day or 7 days post-transfection. We found that MRE11 and NBS1 mt cell lines were impaired for maintaining OriP plasmids after 7 days post-transfection, with no detectable difference observed at 1 day post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Wt and mt cell lines proliferated at similar rates, with similar cell cycle profiles (data not shown), and identical cell numbers were analyzed for each cell type. Quantification of the average of four independent experiments revealed that MRE11 and NBS1 mutant cell lines were reduced by &#x0223c;2 and &#x0223c;2.5 fold for plasmid maintenance relative to wt cell lines.</p><fig id="pone-0001257-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001257.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Evidence that MRE11 and NBS1 are required for EBV episome maintenance.</title><p>A) OriP plasmid maintenance assays were performed in MRE11 mutant (ATLD3) and reconstituted (ATLD3/wtMRE11) cell lines (left panel) or NBS1 mutant (GM7166) and reconstituted (GM7166/wtNBS1) cell lines (right panel).

To test this prediction, we analyzed the structure of EBV genomes in two lymphoblastoid cells derived from NBS1 mutated patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). EBV episomes were monitored by Southern blotting of agarose gels after PFG electrophoresis. Episomes were readily detected in Raji cells, which are known to carry multiple copies of circularized EBV genomes.

Interestingly, we found that NBS1 GM15808 cells had no detectable episomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). More extensive analysis of the EBV termini indicated that GM15808 cells had integrated viral genomes, similar to Namalwa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001257.s003">Fig. S2</xref>). In contrast, a second NBS1 mutated cell line GM0708 had EBV episomes at levels comparable to that of other lymphoblastoid cell lines, LCL3472 and LCLAW7. Simlar preparations of total cellular DNA were analyzed for each sample as demonstated by ethidium staining of the PFG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, lower panel). To determine if the lack of episomes in NBS1 GM15808 correlates with NBS1 and MRE11 protein expression or structure, we analyzed these cell lines by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). We found that NBS1 protein was absent from both NBS1 cell lines when assayed with antibody 143. In contrast, we found that NBS1 protein was detectable, but with a slightly faster mobility when probed with antibody 277, which recognizes a different NBS1 epitope. Interestingly, we found that MRE11 protein had a markedly faster mobility in NBS1 GM15808 cells relative to all other cell types analyzed, including NBS1 GM07078 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Since lymphoblastoid cells are non-clonal expansions of EBV immortalized B-lymphocytes they are expected to have episomal EBV. The lack of episomes in GM15808 suggest that their more severe defect in both NBS1 and MRE11contributes to their failure to support episomal maintenance of EBV.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Cell cycle-dependent recruitment of MRE11 and NBS1 to episomal OriP</title><p>MRN is known to have cell cycle-specific activities, and interact with TRF2 in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

Since MRE11 and NBS1 localize to OriP in mid-S phase, we explored the possibility that recombination-like structures may form at OriP. The DNA structures formed during replication and recombination can be analyzed using two-dimensional neutral agarose gel (2D gel) electrophoresis. The migration properties of prominent DNA structures have been well established, including the Y-arcs formed by replication fork progression, replication pause sites that appear as bulges in the Y-arc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, red arrows), origin bubbles arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, green arrow), and Holliday junctions or X-structures which appear as vertical spikes emerging from the 2n spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, magenta arrows). Holliday junctions are notoriously unstable due to their transient nature and branch migration on linearized fragments.

Cell cycle fractions from EBV positive Mutu I cells were analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

This pause was most likely localized to the DS region based on the appearance in the large Y-arc of the PvuII digested OriP DNA. Further progression through S phase revealed that the formation of a bubble arc indicative of replication initiation (green arrow, fraction 25). As cells further progress through mid S phase, the replication pause sight disappeared, and a vertical spike emerging from the 2n position appeared. This vertical spike has been interpreted as recombinational intermediates, which may include Holliday junctions, X-structures, and hemicatenanes (magenta arrows, fractions 27, 29, 30). By G2/M, the major replication and recombination structures were less apparent (fraction 36).

We therefore assayed the formation of 2n species across the cell cycle using MutuI cells that were fractionated by centrifugal elutriation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). We found that the 7.5 kb CTAB-stabilized species (indicated by the arrow) formed predominantly in mid S phase (fraction 26). This species was not detected in cells derived from early S phase (fraction 25), or G2/M (fraction 45), and was detectable in small amounts during late S phase (fractions 32 and 36). The appearance of the 7.5 kb structure coincides with the formation of the spike structure in 2D gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>The DNA structure formed at OriP was further investigated with the use of a structure-specific endonuclease. Holliday junctions (HJ) and related recombinational structures are known to be cleaved by T7 endonuclease I (T7endoI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Muller1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found that T7endoI eliminated the 7.5 kb CTAB-sensitive species. T7endoI also partially digested a faster migrating 6.0 kb (small arrow) species, with a corresponding increase in the faster migrating (1n) species. We also found that T7endoI eliminates the vertical spikes, along with replication pause sites, observed in 2D neutral agarose gels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001257.s006">Figs.

Additionally, incubation at 65&#x000b0;C which facilitates branch migration and the resolution of HJ structures on linear DNA, reduced the appearance of the vertical spikes in 2D gels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001257.s007">Fig. S6</xref>). We conclude that the vertical spike observed in 2D gels, and the CTAB-stabilized structures observed in 1D gels, are consistent with HJ and related recombination structures.</p><p>We next asked whether the MRN complex contributed to the formation of the slower migrating forms of OriP DNA. NBS1 hypomorphic cell line GM7166, or NBS1-wt reconstituted cells GM7166/NBS1wt were transfected with OriP plasmid and selected for 48 hrs prior to extraction with CTAB and linearized with EcoRI restriction endonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). In GM7166/NBSwt cells, we observed a slower migrating species (&#x0223c;11 kb, indicated by the arrow) that formed 6 fold greater relative to the 1n species (&#x0223c;5.5 kb EcoRI fragment). In GM7166 cells, the slower migrating species formed only &#x0223c;1.6 fold over the 1n species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). These results indicate that NBS1 contributes to the formation of the slower migrating form of OriP DNA, and suggests that NBS1 is required for the formation of recombinational structures at OriP.</p><p>The recombination junctions that form at OriP are predicted to form linkages between newly replicated sister EBV genomes. To test this possibility, we analyzed EBV genome migration by PFG electrophoresis at different stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). Cell cycle fractions were collected by centrifugal elutriation as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and EBV episomes were analyzed by PFG electrophoresis and Southern blotting as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">3B</xref>. We found that monomeric episomes were the predominant form in G1 and early S, migrating at a position equivalent to &#x0223c;900 kb of linear DNA . A slower migrating species with the predicted mobility of a 2n dimeric circle (&#x0223c;1.8 MB of linear DNA) appeared in mid S and accumulated to almost 50&#x00025; of the total molecules by G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>).

However, the precise role of the MRN in cellular DNA replication processing remains elusive, partially as a consequence of having limited knowledge of the genetic loci where MRN functions. Here, we provide evidence that components of the MRN complex function at the replication origin and plasmid maintenance element of Epstein-Barr virus. We provide evidence that recombination-like X structures form at OriP following replication pausing and origin activation. We suggest that MRN proteins regulate the formation and/or processing of origin-associated recombinational structures, and that these structures contribute to the plasmid maintenance function of OriP.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Cell cycle-dependent association and function of MRN at DS</title><p>Telomere repeats within DS contribute to the DNA replication and plasmid maintenance function of OriP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Deng1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

We therefore explored the potential role of MRE11 and NBS1 in the functions of OriP. We found that MRE11 associates with the DS region of OriP and that the telomere repeats enhanced this association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We also found that MRE11 and NBS1 bound to DS in a cell cycle-dependent manner with maximum binding occuring in middle S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). A cell cycle-dependent interaction of NBS1 with TRF2 has been previously reported, thus potentially explaining the cell cycle association of MRN with the DS region of OriP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Zhu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Deletion of telomere repeat sites in DS only partially eliminated MRN binding in vivo, suggesting that other mechanisms also contribute to MRN recruitment to OriP.

However, it is also possible that MRN is recruited to DS through the recognition of complex DNA structures associated with replication initiation, pausing, and termination. We speculate that TRF2 sites evolved at DS to reinforce MRN recruitment and enhance the processing of DNA structures important for episome maintenance.</p><p>The function of MRN proteins at DS was investigated using the DNA replication and plasmid maintenance assays. We found that OriP replication activity and EBV genome stability was reduced in cells where MRE11 and NBS1 were depleted by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). We also found fibroblasts with hypomorphic mutations in MRE11 or NBS1 were defective in maintaining OriP-dependent plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, an EBV immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line derived from an NBS1 mutated individual lacked any detectable episomal forms of EBV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Although a second NBS1 mutated lymphoblastoid cell line retained EBV episomes, this second cell line had normal MRE11 protein and less severe alterations in NBS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001257-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Since the EBV transformed NBS1 cells are not a clonal isolate, we consider the exclusively integrated form to be highly significant, since it represents the statistical average of many transformation events. Almost all non-cloned LCLs have episomal and linear forms of EBV. The NBS1 mutated cells had no linear forms, and in the case of the more severely mutated NBS1 and MRE11 defective cell line GM15808, there were no detectable episomes. These findings argue strongly that NBS1 and MRE11 are important for maintaining stable episomes of EBV during latent infection in lymphoblastoid cells. Since MRE11 and NBS1 localize to DS by ChIP, and not to other regions of the OriP plasmid, we consider it likely that MRN acts directly at DS to process DNA structures formed during DNA replication that are necessary for stable episome maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Replication pausing, initiation, and termination at OriP</title><p>Two dimensional agarose gel analysis of OriP has revealed that replication can both initiate, pause and terminate near the DS and FR regions of OriP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Gahn1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Dhar2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

Weaker pause sites could also be detected at FR. This suggests that EBNA1 sites at DS and FR obstruct replication fork progression. The accumulation of Y-structures at OriP is most probably a consequence of replication initiating outside of OriP. Single molecule analysis of DNA replication revealed that replication can initiate at other sites in EBV, and that OriP is a major site of replication fork pausing and termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Norio2">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. In this scenario, the origin function of DS may be required only under conditions where initiation fails at other locations in the viral genome, or if replication of the viral genome is not complete. Replication initiation at DS may be required to complete DNA synthesis of the regions between the DS and FR, especially if these EBNA1 binding sites function as replication fork barriers.

Others have shown that MRN components contribute to HJ formation in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Tauchi1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. MRN may work in conjunction with TRF2 at DS to stimulate strand invasion, in a manner similar to that proposed at telomere T-loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Fouche1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. While the precise structure of the recombination-like junctions are not yet known, we suggest that these junctions contibute to the sister chromatid cohesion necessary for homologous DNA repair and for chromosome segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Nasmyth1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the origin recognition complex (ORC) promotes sister chromatid cohesion in yeast (ORC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001257-Shimada1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is possible that OriP recruits ORC to generate cohesion between sister viral genomes. This suggests that the origin function of OriP is mechanistically linked to the plasmid maintenance function. These findings provide a new mechanistic paradigm for OriP plasmid maintenance, and have implications for the episome maintenance mechanisms of related viruses, including KSHV and HPV. These findings may also have implications for the mechanisms of generating sister chromatid cohesion at cellular chromosome sites, like telomere repeats and origins of replication, where recombinational junctions are likely to form.</p><fig id="pone-0001257-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001257.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model of recombination junctions formed at OriP and their function in sister-chromatid cohesion.</title><p>A) Schematic of EBV episome DNA replication with fork pausing and terminating at OriP.
