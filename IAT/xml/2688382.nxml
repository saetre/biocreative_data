We adapted EC-mural cell co-culture to a microtiter plate format to facilitate high throughput interrogation of mural cell-dependent regulation of endothelial cell behaviors by combined chemical genetic manipulation and quantitative high content imaging techniques. Using this approach we reveal that this high throughput screening (HTS)-compatible EC-mural cell co-culture system recapitulates a remarkable assortment of angiogenic endothelial cell behaviors. Mural cells define a context in co-culture that enables an endothelial cellular program resulting in formation of a capillary-like network, via a predictable sequence of phenotypic changes reflective of several facets of angiogenesis and vessel maturation: i) loss of EC proliferation; ii) pathfinding cell migration; iii) adherens junction formation; iv) branching morphogenesis and network formation; v) vascular basement membrane-like formation, collagen IV/XVIII ensheathment; vi) patent lumen formation; vi) anastamosis and vii) network stabilization.

During a one-week period primary human ECs co-seeded with vSMCs in microtiter plates undergo a predictable series of phenotypic changes that result in a stable, interconnected network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g001">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Elongated ECs interdigitate to form capillary-like tubular structures of uniform diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Co-cultured EC and vSMC cells rapidly self-organize into two distinct layers, vSMCs forming a confluent layer on the culture dish surface and ECs above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Impeding this cellular self-organization by pre-attaching ECs to the culture vessel surface followed by vSMC plating, blocked EC network formation (data not shown). Heterotypic cell contact was required as neither vSMC-conditioned medium alone nor co-culture in transwell chambers resulted in EC network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g001">Figure 1E-F</xref>; data not shown). vSMC monolayers fixed by a variety of methods (e.g cross-linking agents, freeze-thaw) also do not induce EC network formation (data not shown). Time-lapse video fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that the formation of EC networks progresses through distinct phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g001">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005798.s003">Video S1</xref>). ECs immediately stop dividing and during the first 48 hours become elongated and highly migratory. Migrating ECs form &#x0201c;cell trains&#x0201d; and branched junctions eventually enlisting nearly every cell into the final network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Once formed, these networks stabilize, ceasing migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005798.s004">Video S2</xref>) and form a patent lumen structure that concentrates exogenous dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g001">Figure 1H-I</xref>). There is no observable EC apoptosis during this process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005798.s003">Video S1</xref>) and stabilized EC networks can been maintained in culture for several weeks (data not shown). Both primary human microvascular endothelial cells (HuMVEC) and primary human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) formed indistinguishable networks in co-culture with vSMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g002">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Endothelial vessel-like structures assemble amid a confluent monolayer of vSMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Confocal microscopy analysis shows that vSMC extend filopodia that co-localize with multiple endothelial cells at various points both above and below the focal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Endothelial networks could also be induced by co-culture with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g002">Figure 2E-F</xref>). In contrast, normal human dermal fibroblasts did not support network formation in co-culture with EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005798-g002">Figure 2G-I</xref>).

Time-lapse fluorescence videomicroscopy analysis of PTK787/ZK-treated co-cultures demonstrated that EC remain viable and actively migrate, likely due to vSMC matrix protein expression (fibronectin, collagen I), but do not elongate or form stable cell-cell contacts.
