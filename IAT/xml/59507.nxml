No studies to our knowledge have investigated the potential contribution to short-term neurotoxicity of the brain microglia, a cell type that constitutes circa 10% of the total glial population in the brain. We tested the hypothesis that a short-term <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to domoic acid, might lead to the activation of rat neonatal microglia and the concomitant release of the putative neurotoxic mediators tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), matrix metalloproteinases-2 and-9 (MMP-2 and -9) and superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>-).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>In vitro,</italic> domoic acid [10 &#x003bc;M-1 mM] was significantly neurotoxic to primary cerebellar granule neurons. Although neonatal rat microglia expressed ionotropic glutamate GluR4 receptors, exposure during 6 hours to domoic acid [10 &#x003bc;M-1 mM] had no significant effect on viability. By four hours, LPS (10 ng/mL) stimulated an increase in TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA and a 2,233 % increase in TNF-&#x003b1; protein In contrast, domoic acid (1 mM) induced a slight rise in TNF-&#x003b1; expression and a 53 % increase (p &#x0003c; 0.01) of immunoreactive TNF-&#x003b1; protein. Furthermore, though less potent than LPS, a 4-hour treatment with domoic acid (1 mM) yielded a 757% (p &#x0003c; 0.01) increase in MMP-9 release, but had no effect on MMP-2. Finally, while PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) stimulated O<sub>2</sub>- generation was elevated in 6 hour LPS-primed microglia, a similar pretreatment with domoic acid (1 mM) did not prime O<sub>2</sub>- release.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence that domoic acid, at <italic>in vitro</italic> concentrations that are toxic to neuronal cells, can trigger a release of statistically significant amounts of TNF-&#x003b1; and MMP-9 by brain microglia.

Two different phenotypic forms of microglia are known: the activated but nonphagocytic microglia, which play a role in inflammatory pathologies, and the reactive or phagocytic microglia which participate actively in trauma, infection and neuronal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> administration of LPS rapidly and potently activates rat adult and neonatal microglia (for review see Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Accompanying both adult and neonatal microglia activation by LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] is a concomitant release of numerous secretory products (for review see Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]) that include tissue plasminogen activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], reactive oxygen species such as O<sub>2</sub>- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], cytokines like TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and proteases, in particular MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These mediators have been implicated in sublethal and lethal neuronal and glial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], neuronal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that could potentially affect neurodevelopment in the immature brain.</p><p>Exposure to the marine toxin domoic acid, an excitotoxic amino acid structurally similar to kainic acid and to the neurotransmitter glutamic acid, has been shown to lead to amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans, a condition that can lead to death in extreme cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Currently, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US. Food and Drug Administration has included amnesic shellfish poisoning as one of the "<italic>...five recognized fish poisoning syndromes in the United States...</italic>", together with paralytic, neurotoxic, diarrhetic and ciguatera fish poisoning (FDA website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/haccp-2f.html"/>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recent behavioral toxicity studies in rodents, have confirmed that domoic acid is a very rapid and potent neurotoxin in newborn rats, at doses far lower than in adult animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Even though hippocampal pyramidal neurons and mossy fiber terminals appear to be selectively targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> by domoic acid in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and cynomolgus monkey brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], recently domoic acid was shown to affect glutamate uptake by astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and "<italic>...thus produced neurotoxicity...</italic>" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Of interest is the fact that no studies to our knowledge have investigated the potential contribution of brain microglia to neonatal neurotoxicity after a short-term exposure to domoic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The possibility that domoic acid may activate neonatal microglia both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> is suggested by recent observations with kainic acid, a domoic acid and glutamate analog that can induce upregulation of neonatal microglia scavenger receptor mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and tissue plasminogen activator release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The putative molecular explanation for these observations has been that kainic acid activates the ionotropic AMPA glutamate GluR4 subunit which has recently been shown to be expressed by activated microglia following transient forebrain ischemia <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Because this subunit of the AMPA glutamate receptor has affinity for domoic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we hypothesized that domoic acid might activate neonatal microglia <italic>in vitro</italic> and lead to concomitant mediator release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a short-term <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to domoic acid might activate rat neonatal microglia and cause mediator release. Using LPS, which we have previously shown is a rapid and potent <italic>in vitro</italic> activator of neonatal microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] as our positive control, we focused our investigation on three microglia mediators which are released upon LPS activation, namely TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-9 and O<sub>2</sub>- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our present study demonstrates that in contrast to LPS, during a 6 hour <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to domoic acid, neonatal rat microglia release small, but statistically significant amounts of TNF-&#x003b1; and MMP-9. Furthermore our observations suggest that <italic>in vivo,</italic> brain microglia as well as the mediators released by this cell type in brain tissue, would appear to play a limited role in the rapid and potent domoic acid neurotoxicity observed in neonatal rats after a short-term administration of domoic acid.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Determination of domoic acid by electrospray mass spectrometry</title><p>The presence of undegraded domoic acid in both stock solution (12.5 mM) and dilutions prepared with LPS-free water was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry prior to the experiments.

In order to ascertain that under our experimental conditions rat neonatal microglia expressed the GluR4 subunit, we studied the expression of the AMPA receptor GluR4 by immunohistochemistry. The top left photo in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows a bright field, phase contrast view of microglia that were incubated in the absence of the primary antibodies against GluR4 and CD11b/c. Note that the microglia are irregular in shape and show numerous elongated processes extending from the bodies of the cells. In addition, numerous vesicular structures are present in the cytoplasm of the microglia. The top right photo shows the same microglia when viewed using the FITC filter configuration. Note that the vesicular structures exhibit an intense autofluorescence, but that little or no fluorescence is evident over most of the microglia cell bodies or in the elongated processes. Interestingly, this same pattern of autofluorescence was evident when the microglia were viewed with the TRITC filter configuration (not shown). The middle left photo shows a bright field, phase contrast view of microglia that had been labeled with the antibodies against the glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit and the leukocyte marker CD11b/c. Again, the microglia are irregular in shape, with elongated processes extending from the cell bodies and numerous vesicles present in the cytoplasm. The middle right photo (green) shows this same field when viewed using the FITC filter configuration. As evident, the microglia not only contain fluorescent vesicles, but also exhibit a prominent speckled pattern of fluorescence over the cell bodies and the elongated processes. The fact that this speckled pattern of labeling is not present in the samples that were incubated without the primary GluR4 antibody (compare with top right photo) strongly indicates that the speckled pattern represents specific labeling of GluR4 subunit. The lower left photo shows that these same microglia exhibited intense labeling of CD11b/c (red), which confirms that the microglia are of leukocytic origin. In the bottom right photo the images showing the GluR4 and the CD11b/c labeling have been superimposed (yellow). Together, these results indicate that GluR4 glutamate receptor subunits are present on the cell surface and that these cells are, in fact, microglia.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Immunofluorescent visualization of CD11b/c and ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluR4 in neonatal rat brain microglia.</bold> The integrin CD11b/c and the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluR4 were visualized using the dual-labeling indirect immunofluorescent technique (See Materials and Methods). <bold>(Top left)</bold> bright field, phase contrast view of microglia incubated in the absence of the primary antibodies against GluR4 and CD11b/c. <bold>(Top right)</bold> same microglia viewed using FITC filter configuration.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]), a growing body of research also suggests that there might be increased vulnerability during the <italic>neonatal</italic> period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The fact that the blood-brain barrier is incomplete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], provides a putative explanation as to why neonates and fetal mice <italic>in utero</italic> appear to be more sensitive to neurotoxins like domoic acid than adult animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Although microglia contribute to circa 10% of the total glial cell population in the central nervous system (For review see Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]), to our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the potential role of microglia in mediating the neurotoxic effects of domoic acid in the developing rat brain. We have recently hypothesized that the marine toxin domoic acid might affect the developing brain by directly activating neonatal rat microglia and causing a subsequent release of potentially neurotoxic mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Prior to testing our hypothesis experimentally, and determining whether domoic acid had the potential to directly activate rat neonatal microglia <italic>in vitro,</italic> we thought that it was of critical importance to establish that: (1) the domoic acid preparation used in these experiments was stable, (2) rat neonatal microglia isolated by our methodology expressed the AMPA glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit which has been observed in activated rat microglia <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and, (3) to confirm that the domoic acid concentration selected for our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with rat neonatal microglia was one that was clearly toxic to neuronal cells <italic>in vitro</italic> after a short-term exposure.</p><p>Although it has been reported that the solubility of domoic acid in water is approximately 7.6 g/L (24.4 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], rapid and complete dissolution of domoic acid was only consistently observed in our laboratory when preparing a stock domoic acid solution of 12.5 mM in certified LPS-free water. To rule out the possibility that domoic acid might have degraded as a consequence of either our preparative method or the subsequent freezing (-80&#x000b0;C) and thawing of the domoic acid stock solution, electrospray mass spectrometry was run on both the domoic acid stock solution (12.5 mM) and the dilutions prepared prior to the experiments. Our electrospray mass spectrometry results clearly showed that undegraded domoic acid was present, demonstrating the stability of domoic acid in the aqueous solutions that had been frozen at -80&#x000b0;C and thawed prior to use in the experiments. Interestingly, our observations complement those recently reported on domoic acid's stability in saline solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit has been shown to be expressed by activated rat adult microglia <italic>in vivo</italic> following transient forebrain ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and also <italic>in vitro</italic> by rat neonatal microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Because it is well established that AMPA glutamate receptors bind domoic acid with high affinity in the nanomolar range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we investigated the presence of GluR4 in rat neonatal microglia used in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments by a dual-labeling indirect immunofluorescence technique. Our results clearly confirmed that GluR4 was present in the rat neonatal microglia used in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with domoic acid, demonstrating that the protocol used in our laboratory to isolate microglia did not appear to affect the presence of the AMPA glutamate receptor GluR4 subunits and their colocalization with the CD 11 b/c integrin.</p><p>The cytotoxicity of domoic acid to neuronal tissue <italic>in vitro</italic> has been investigated over a wide range of concentrations, namely at 10 &#x003bc;M with primary cultures of cerebellar neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] as well as hippocampal slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], at 100 &#x003bc;M with cultured prenatal rat hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and at 20 mM with rat lumbar spinal interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In order to determine a concentration of domoic acid for our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that was toxic to cerebellar granule cells after a short-term exposure in our experimental conditions, we completed a viability study using the WST-1 method. The results of this study demonstrated that even though the highest concentration of domoic acid tested, namely 1 mM, did <italic>not</italic> affect rat neonatal microglia viability <italic>in vitro,</italic> domoic acid concentrations as low as 10 &#x003bc;M were clearly cytotoxic to cerebellar granule neurons after a 6 hour exposure. Because cerebellar granule cells appear to be inherently resistant to the cytotoxic effects of excitatory amino acids and neurotoxicity appears to be "<italic>...facilitated when cellular energy is limited in cultured cerebellar neurons...</italic>" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], perhaps manipulating the experimental conditions (e.g. lowering the temperature to 22&#x000b0;C) might have enhanced the intensity of the observed cytotoxicity to cerebellar neurons even further, as was reported recently when cerebellar granule cells were exposed to 10 &#x003bc;M domoic acid for up to 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Future work is necessary to determine if similar changes in the experimental conditions might also increase the toxicity of domoic acid to rat neonatal microglia <italic>in vitro.</italic> It is interesting to note, however, that in newborn mice a brief local application of 2 mM domoic acid to the exposed cortical surface led to a massive degeneration of AMPA/KA GluR receptor positive Cajal-Retzius neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], severe impairment of cortical neuronal migration <italic>in vivo</italic> and malformation of the domoic acid-treated neocortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Thus, because 1 mM domoic acid was clearly toxic to cerebellar granule neurons both <italic>in vitro</italic> (our current study) and <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], we selected 1 mM domoic acid for the experiments with rat neonatal microglia reported herein.</p><p>Having determined that our domoic acid preparation was stable and undegraded, that rat neonatal microglia expressed GluR4 <italic>in vitro</italic> and that 1 mM domoic acid was toxic to cerebellar granule neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> but did not affect the viability of rat neonatal microglia, we then investigated whether a short term 1&#x02013;6 hour exposure to 1 mM domoic acid would activate rat neonatal microglia <italic>in vitro.</italic> In all our experiments we compared domoic acid's effect with that of 10 ng/ml LPS, a potent and rapid microglia activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], to clearly show that rat neonatal microglia were able to become rapidly activated and release mediators, i.e. TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-9 and O<sub>2</sub>- upon short-term <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment. We have recently reported on the kinetics of LPS activation of rat neonatal microglia and the concomitant release of TNF-&#x003b1; protein, MMP-9 and O<sub>2</sub>- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These three microglia mediators are currently thought to participate in neuronal and glial injury <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] .</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; is a cytokine that can mediate myelin and oligodendrocyte damage in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and thought to play a key role in central nervous system pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>In vitro E. coli</italic> LPS can trigger rat neonatal microglia to rapidly activate TNF-&#x003b1; gene expression and subsequent protein release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Although <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure of rat neonatal microglia to 10 ng/ml LPS resulted, as expected, in a rapid elevation of both TNF-&#x003b1; gene expression and protein release, we observed only a small effect of 1 mM domoic acid on TNF-&#x003b1; gene expression. Interestingly, the slight rise in TNF-&#x003b1; expression yielded a 53 % (p &#x0003c; 0.01) increase of TNF-&#x003b1; protein release 4 hours after stimulation with 1 mM domoic acid. Although we feel it may be premature to speculate on the putative pathophysiological significance of this increase in immunoreactive TNF-&#x003b1;, the fact that TNF-&#x003b1; can induce MMP-9 expression in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], suggests that TNF-&#x003b1; may play an as yet undetermined role in the mechanism of MMP-9 release observed in our studies. Futhermore immuno-PCR techniques, which have allowed investigators to study the kinetics of TNF-&#x003b1; release at the femtomolar range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], might help to study the kinetics of picomolar microglia TNF-&#x003b1; release triggered by a short-term exposure to domoic acid. These proposed studies might be of considerable significance in view of the fact that similar amounts of TNF-&#x003b1; release have <italic>also</italic> been observed after a 2 hour stimulation of rat neonatal microglia with kainic acid, a domoic acid and glutamate analog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Taken together, our results with domoic acid as well as those of Noda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]with kainic acid support the recently proposed notion that TNF-&#x003b1; might not be neurotoxic in some situations when the release of this mediator is low, and therefore might not be a necessary requirement for neuronal death involving excitatory amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Proteases such as MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], which have been implicated in sublethal and lethal neuronal and glial injury <italic>in vivo</italic> in "<italic>...central nervous system diseases...</italic>" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] are released by LPS-activated rat neonatal microglia <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], by a mechanism that may involve TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Clearly because in our studies 1 mM domoic acid stimulated both an increase in TNF-&#x003b1; release, as well as MMP-9, further investigation of a possible relationship between these two events may be important. Furthermore, though the magnitude of MMP-9 secretion stimulated by domoic acid was lower than the one observed with LPS, this is the first observation to our knowledge that an excitatory amino acid like domoic acid is able to trigger MMP-9 release <italic>in vitro.</italic> Although at the present time it is difficult to comment on the pathophysiological significance of increased MMP-9 release, it is perhaps noteworthy that increased MMP-9 expression has been correlated with increased apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and increased microvascular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], events possibly involved in the opening of the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and potential injury to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Microglia constitute the main leukocyte-dependent source of reactive oxygen species in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Since microglia were first shown to release O<sub>2</sub>- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] numerous investigations have been undertaken over the past 14 years to characterize agents than can either prime and/or trigger the microglia O<sub>2</sub>- generating system (for review see Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). In our current experiments, we observed that 1 mM domoic acid did not prime rat neonatal microglia for PMA-stimulated O<sub>2</sub>- release, again in marked contrast with LPS. Interestingly though, domoic acid appeared to modulate LPS-primed rat neonatal microglia O<sub>2</sub>- release, suggesting that domoic acid might potentially play a role in the <italic>in vivo</italic> modulation of activated rat neonatal microglia, and perhaps other leukocytes capable of releasing O<sub>2</sub>-.</p><p>In summary, in our experiments the <italic>in vitro</italic> effect of a 1&#x02013;6 hour exposure to domoic acid on rat neonatal microglia activation and concomitant TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-9 and O<sub>2</sub>- release was clearly <italic>distinct in its magnitude</italic> from that observed after exposure to LPS, an agent involved in endotoxic shock and other central nervous pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Even though this present study was limited to the study of the <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of domoic acid on three microglia mediators, namely TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-9 and O<sub>2</sub>-, it provides the first experimental evidence to our knowledge that domoic acid, at <italic>in vitro</italic> concentrations that are toxic to neuronal cells, can trigger a limited activation of rat neonatal microglia and the concomitant release of modest though statistically significant amounts of TNF-&#x003b1; and MMP-9.</p><p>Our investigation does not exclude the possibility that <italic>in vitro</italic> domoic acid may affect expression of genes and mediators that might support survival of neuronal cells. Several lines of evidence appear to support this possibility. Thus, in a recent report ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptors were shown to "<italic>...function not only as ion channels but also as cell-surface transducers by means of their interaction with the Src-family non-receptor protein kinase Lyn...</italic>", ultimately leading to "<italic>...expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) messenger RNA</italic>" in cerebellar primary culture neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].

Interestingly, because rat neonatal microglia have been shown to express BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and bFGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and in view of the fact that LPS can affect BDNF gene expression in rat neonatal microglia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], experiments are currently underway in our laboratory to determine if domoic acid may affect neonatal rat microglia expression of both BDNF and bFGF. However, we do not rule out the possibility that growth factors other than BDNF and bFGF could be released by domoic acid-stimulated neonatal microglia cells and play a role in neuroprotection from excitotoxic injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our present results provide the first experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that a <italic>direct</italic> interaction of domoic acid with rat neonatal microglia <italic>in vitro,</italic> leads to the release of small but statistically significant amounts of two potentially neurotoxic mediators, namely TNF-&#x003b1; and MMP-9 after a short-term <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure. These observations are of considerable significance if future research demonstrates that higher levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and MMP-9 are generated by neonatal rat microglia as a result of either (1) a synergistic interaction between domoic acid "<italic>...when in association with subtoxic concentrations of excitatory amino acids...</italic>" a combination that has been shown to increase the neurotoxicity of domoic acid to primary cultures of cerebellar neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or (2) an increase in the time of exposure to domoic acid, as we have reported is the case with LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

The mixed glial cell suspension was plated in either 75- or 162-cm<sup>2</sup> vented cell culture flasks with DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS +120 U/ml P + 12 &#x003bc;g/ml S and grown in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 36&#x000b0;C for 12&#x02013;14 days. On day 14 and every 3&#x02013;4 days thereafter, microglia were detached using an orbital shaker (150 rpm, 0.5 hours, 36&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), centrifuged (400 &#x000d7; g, 25 min, 4&#x000b0;C), and microglia number and viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Microglia were characterized as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Depending on the particular experimental protocol (see below), microglia averaging &#x0003e; than 95% viability were plated in either 60 mm &#x000d7; 15 mm polystyrene cell culture dishes, 96-well cell culture clusters, or 24-well cell culture clusters, with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS + 120 U/ml P + 12 &#x003bc;g/ml S, and placed in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 36&#x000b0;C 18&#x02013;24 hours prior to the experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary culture of rat cerebellar granule neurons</title><p>Primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from the cerebella of 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Cerebella were dissected and processed as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The dissociated cells were grown in a serum-free Neurobasal-A medium with B27 supplement (10 ml/500 ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], and in the presence of 25 mM KCl (Sigma). The cells were maintained in poly-L-lysine-treated (10 ug/ml; Sigma) 96-well plates (60,000 cells/0.1 ml Neurobasal A medium/well), at 37&#x000b0;C in an incubator with 95% air/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. This method results in a culture consisting of neuronal precursors that differentiate into neurons; the differentiated cultures were used for experiments after 10 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental protocol to determine the viability of domoic acid-treated rat neonatal microglia or cerebellar granule neurons</title><p>A colorimetric assay for the quantitation of cell viability, based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (4-[3-(4-Iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]1,3-benzene disulfonate) (slightly red) to formazan (red) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells was utilized for these studies. Briefly, rat neonatal microglia or cerebellar granule cells (60,000 cells / well) were plated in LPS-free 96-well cell culture clusters 24 hours prior to the experiments in either 0.1 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS + 120 U/ml P + 12 &#x003bc;g/ml S (microglia), or 0.1 ml serum-free Neurobasal A medium with B27 supplement (cerebellar granule neurons). Thereafter each well received 4 &#x003bc;l of domoic acid (0.01 &#x003bc;M &#x02013; 1 mM final concentration) or vehicle (LPS-free water) and 10 &#x003bc;l of the tetrazolium salt WST-obtained from Roche Diagnostics Gmbh (Mannheim, Germany). Plates were incubated in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 36&#x000b0;C and the reduction of the WST-1 reagent to formazan was measured repeatedly after the addition of the WST-1 reagent, at either 415 nM (neurons) or 450 nM (microglia), with a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental protocol to determine the effect of domoic acid and LPS on rat neonatal microglia release of TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-2, MMP-9 and O<sub>2</sub>-</title><p>To study the time-dependent effects of domoic acid and LPS on the generation of TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-2 and MMP-9, rat neonatal microglia (2.8&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/60 mm &#x000d7; 15 mm polystyrene cell culture dish) were treated with (1) 1 mM domoic acid, (2) LPS-free water used as a vehicle for domoic acid or (3) 10 ng/ml LPS in a final volume of 5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS + 120 U/ml P + 12 &#x003bc;g/ml S and incubated in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 36&#x000b0;C for 1 to 6 h. Upon termination of the experiments, cell-free supernatants from each culture dish were assayed for TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-2 and MMP-9, while rat neonatal microglia were processed for RNA isolation and RT-PCR. For the O<sub>2</sub>- assay, rat neonatal microglia (250,000 cells/ 24-well cell culture clusters) were treated with (1) 1 mM domoic acid, (2) LPS-free water used as a vehicle for domoic acid or (3) 10 ng/ml LPS in a final volume of 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS + 120 U/ml P + 12 &#x003bc;g/ml S and incubated in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 36&#x000b0;C for 1 to 6 hours.

(Cincinnati, OH). The RT-PCR were performed in the same sample tube using gene-specific primers obtained from IDT (Coralville, IA), as described below, and the Superscript one-step kit obtained from Gibco-BRL (Grand Island, NY). Briefly, first strand cDNA was made using 0.25 &#x003bc;g of RNA, Superscript II H-reverse transcriptase, antisense gene-specific primers and conditions of 30 min at 50&#x000b0;C. Samples were denatured at 94&#x000b0;C for 2 min, and PCR was performed for various cycle numbers to ensure linear amplification. The PCR cycling conditions consisted of a denaturation step at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, an annealing step at 54&#x000b0;C (S12) or 60&#x000b0;C (TNF-&#x003b1;), an extension step at 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The 50 &#x003bc;l samples contained 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.2 mM magnesium sulfate. Platinum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> taq DNA polymerase, and 0.2 &#x003bc;M of each gene specific primer. The primers for rat TNF-&#x003b1;, were designed using the DNASTAR Lasergene software (Madison, WI) and the rat TNF-&#x003b1; cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number NM 012675), and are sense (bp 127 &#x02013; 150):5'-GGG GCC ACC ACG CTC TTC TGT CTA-3' and antisense (bp 285 &#x02013; 307): 5'-CCT CCG CTT GGT TTG CTA CG-3', and generate a 181 bp cDNA product. The primers for rat constitutively expressed ribosomal S12, were sense:5'-ACG TCA ACA CTG CTC TAC A-3' and antisense:5'-CTT TGC CAT AGT CCT TAA C-3' and generate a 303 bp cDNA product as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Controls for RT-PCR included samples without the enzyme reverse transcriptase and samples without template. The PCR reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis using 1.5 % agarose gels, visualized with SYBR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gold nucleic acid staining (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR), photographed, scanned and digitized with the UN-SCAN-IT&#x02122; gel automated digitizing system from Silk Scientific (Orem, UT). The relative amounts of TNF-&#x003b1; expression as determined by RT-PCR were normalized to S12 levels using methods similar to those previously described by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Assays for TNF-&#x003b1; and O<sub>2</sub>-.

All experimental treatments were run in triplicate and in a final volume of 1 ml. Changes in FCC absorbance were measured at 550 nm using a Beckman DU-650 spectrophotometer and O<sub>2</sub>- generation expressed in nmol by employing the molecular extinction coefficient of 21.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>SDS-PAGE gelatinase zymography for MMP-2 and MMP-9 analysis</title><p>Following incubation with LPS or domoic acid, MMP expression was analyzed in the harvested media of cultured rat neonatal microglia. As the rat neonatal microglia cultures were normalized for cell number, equal volumes of harvested media obtained from each condition were analyzed. Briefly, 10 &#x003bc;l of each sample were electrophoresed at 4&#x000b0;C and under non-denaturing conditions using a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.05% gelatin. The gels were incubated for 1 hour in a 2.5% Triton X-100 solution and then washed twice with water (20 min each). The gels were then incubated for 24 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. A duplicate negative control gel was incubated as described above but in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 10 mM EDTA instead of CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The gels were fixed for 1 hour in 40% methanol /7% acetic acid and then stained in Coomassie Blue Solution (Sigma), followed by destaining in 10% methanol, 7% acetic acid. MMP activity was visualized as clear bands against a blue background. Gelatin-containing zymograms are typically used to detect MMP-2 (72 kDa) and MMP-9 (92 kDa) and their identification is based on molecular weight. Relative clearing of each sample was quantitated by determining the inverse optical density units using the NIH Image software package (version 1.60). Values are represented as the mean &#x000b1; SE and are presented as inverse optical density. The value corresponding to background, a region of equal area as that used to measure the cleared bands and of a lane in which no sample was loaded, was subtracted from each sample value.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis of the data</title><p>Data were analyzed with the Prism<sup>R</sup> software package purchased from GraphPad (San Diego, CA.). One way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test was performed on all sets of data. LPS or domoic acid-treated groups were compared with the vehicle-treated group, shown as 0 or control in the corresponding figures. Differences were considered statistically significant at p &#x0003c; 0.05 and reported in each figure legend.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AMPA, &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum certified; FCC, ferricytochrome c type III; HBSS, Hank's balanced salt solution; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9; O<sub>2</sub>-, superoxide; P, penicillin; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; S, streptomycin; SOD, superoxide dismutase; TNF-&#x003b1;, tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This publication was made possible by grant number R03 ES10138&#x02013;01 from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH.
