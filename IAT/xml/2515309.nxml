This fluid must be rapidly removed at birth for adequate gas exchange across the alveolar epithelium-endothelium at birth to occur. Failure to clear fetal lung fluid has been linked to preterm birth, inherited genetic diseases, and inflammation and may increase the risk of hypoxic injury to vital organs in newborn infants; such injuries representing ~4% of infant fatalities in 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Lung fluid absorption and secretion have been intensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Apical amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na channels (ENaC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and basolateral Na,K-ATPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have been demonstrated as key proteins for vectorial Na transport and lung fluid absorption. Recent studies in fetal rats found an accelerated lung fluid absorption between birth and 40 h postnatal age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Lung Cl transport is traditionally associated with fluid secretion during lung development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Studies of cultured alveolar type II epithelial cells suggest that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-(CFTR)-mediated Cl transport may also be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. There are, however, still some questions to CFTR involvement since these studies rely on cultured cells of uncertain phenotype and did not address the possibility that fluid transport may involve multiple different epithelial cell types, including alveolar epithelial type I cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and distal airway epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In fact, the Na transport machinery involved in lung fluid absorption as well as CFTR are present in both alveolar epithelial type I and II cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>ENaC and CFTR functions have been assessed in &#x003b1;ENaC<sup>-/- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and CFTR<sup>-/- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] mice, but these results may be confounded by various <italic>in vivo </italic>compensatory mechanisms. In the present study, our first aim was to adapt and use our recently developed RNA interference (RNAi) technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] to silence CFTR in newborn rats by trans-thoracic intrapulmonary (ttip) injection and to explore functional <italic>in vivo </italic>responses to the CFTR-silencing. Thus, we determined extravascular lung water and newborn mortality after CFTR-silencing. Our second aim was to use RNAi technology to silence CFTR in primary distal lung epithelial cells (DLE cells) and to compare the effects with the <italic>in vivo </italic>situation. Our third aim was to determine if CFTR-silencing affected lung &#x003b1;ENaC expression and if &#x003b1;ENaC silencing affected lung CFTR expression <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (wt 200&#x02013;250 g, <italic>N </italic>= 28; Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were used in the study.

Two 19-nucleotide regions from cDNA, 3872&#x02013;3892 bp and 3458&#x02013;3478 bp, were selected and designed as targets for rat CFTR specific siRNA-generating pDNA, named pSi-C<sub>1 </sub>and pSi-C<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Each target sequence was specific and did not match other sequences in the GenBank. For construction of siRNA-generating pDNA, two complementary oligonucleotides (forward and reverse), containing a sense strand, followed by a short spacer (5'-TTCAAGAGA-3'), an antisense strand, and a RNA polymerase III termination signal (5'-TTTTTTGGAAA-3'), were synthesized, annealed, and ligated into pSilencer 3.0-H1.

Briefly, dams were anesthetized with heparinized (1,000 U) pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg body wt) intraperitoneally and placed in temperature-controlled environments. Rat fetuses were delivered one-by-one via abdominal hysterotomy. Between deliveries the uterus was kept closed by a non-injurious hemostat. Fetal lungs and hearts were excised <italic>en bloc </italic>(heart was removed and discarded) immediately after fetal decapitation. Lungs from each litter were pooled, rinsed twice in ice-cold HBSS (w/o Mg &#x00026; Ca), and minced to &#x0003c;1 mm<sup>3</sup>. Fetal lung tissue was digested in HBSS containing 0.125% trypsin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) and 25 &#x003bc;g/ml DNase I (MP Biochemicals, Aurora, OH) 20 min at 37&#x000b0;C. After 20 min, collagenase (USB Co., Cleveland, OH) and additional DNase I were added to final concentrations of 0.1% and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively, and digestion was continued for 20 min. Enzymes were neutralized by adding 2 ml FBS (fetal bovine serum; Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) at 4&#x000b0;C. Cell suspensions were transferred to new tubes by tituration to break up cell clumps. Dispersed cell solutions were filtered through 100 &#x003bc;m cell strainers (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and then through 70 &#x003bc;m cell strainers.

After incubation, membranes were washed 5 &#x000d7; 10 min with wash buffer (pH = 7.5; TBS with 0.1% Tween-20).

Extravascular lung water was measured in untreated (<italic>N </italic>= 20), pSi-0-injected (<italic>N </italic>= 10), pSi-4-injected (<italic>N </italic>= 12), and pSi-C<sub>2</sub>-injected (<italic>N </italic>= 15) newborn rats from 3&#x02013;4 litters each. The lungs were rapidly excised, hearts removed, and placed in pre-weighed sample tubes and re-weighed. Water (250 &#x003bc;l) was added, lungs were weighed again, and homogenized using a Tissue Tearor. If the extravascular lung water determinations were not done the day of lung harvest, collected lungs were weighed, water (250 &#x003bc;l) added, and lungs were re-weighed and stored frozen at -20&#x000b0;C until analysis. Parts of lung homogenates were centrifuged 5 min at 14,000 <italic>g</italic>. Blood was collected from a small number of newborn rats after decapitation to obtain a hemoglobin (Hb) value for newborn rat blood. Hb content was measured on supernatants obtained after centrifugation and blood volume of newborn rat lungs were calculated from homogenate supernatant Hb concentration relative to blood Hb concentration. Newborn rat blood wet-dry weight was determined. Lung wet-to-dry weights were corrected for blood volume. Drying of lung homogenates, lung homogenate supernatants, and newborn rat blood was carried out using a moisture analyzer (Sartorius, Edgewood, NY) that continuously recorded water loss as samples dried. Each sample was dried at 80&#x02013;120&#x000b0;C until dry weights reached stability. Typically, this procedure required 15 min/sample. Non-specific water loss of wet samples and non-specific re-humidification of dried samples, as may occur when small samples are measured by traditional extravascular lung water techniques, was prevented in this analysis. We verified the technique by comparing it to traditional techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] in adult rat lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>All data are presented as means &#x000b1; SD.

First, ttip injection of specific CFTR siRNA-generating pDNA (pSi-C<sub>2</sub>) increased extravascular lung water and mortality rate of newborn rats. Second, ttip pSi-C<sub>2</sub>-injection decreased CFTR mRNA and protein in both <italic>in vivo </italic>newborn rat lungs and isolated, pSi-C<sub>2</sub>-transfected DLE cells. Third, CFTR-silencing by ttip pSi-C<sub>2</sub>-injection was specific. Fourth, ttip CFTR-silencing also reduced &#x003b1;ENaC mRNA and protein expression, thus suggesting involvement of CFTR in regulation of ENaC at the conversion from lung fluid secretion to fluid absorption near term. Fifth, ttip &#x003b1;ENaC silencing caused a slight reduction in CFTR mRNA and protein expression, further supporting a role for both proteins in the development of lung fluid absorption mechanisms.</p><p>The majority of infants make the transition from intrauterine life to postnatal life without complications, but only hours before birth, lungs are filled with an essentially protein-free isosmolar solution that has been actively secreted by the lung epithelium. The normal rate of lung fluid absorption in newborn rats has been determined earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and was not apparent before birth, reached a high rate immediately after birth, and decreased to the rate seen in adult rats by 40 h of newborn life. The molecular mechanism responsible for perinatal lung fluid absorption has been proposed to be ENaC, as mice deficient in &#x003b1;ENaC expression dies within 40 h of birth from failure to clear fetal lung fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. mRNA for &#x003b1;ENaC is found earliest at GD19, while both &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits are expressed at or after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This expression patterns agrees well with the observed amiloride-sensitivity and function of fetal rat lungs at birth in the earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], especially since ENaC requires all three subunits to become fully functional. Recent studies have demonstrated that failure in lung fluid absorption at birth may be associated with ENaC deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In some cases, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), ENaC deficiency may have serious impact on lung fluid absorption at birth and drastically affect the ability to oxygenate the newborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In our current study, silencing CFTR with pSi-C<sub>2 </sub>was associated with elevated extravascular lung water and an increased mortality rate, thus strengthening the assumption of CFTR being involved in the transition from fluid-filled fetal lungs to air-filled newborn lungs at birth. ENaC and Cl transport proteins, such as CFTR, are two important membrane components expressed in the epithelial lining of lung alveoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. An earlier rat study has reported that fetal lung fluid absorption was mediated by &#x003b2;AR stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the elevated lung fluid absorption rate in GD22 rat fetuses was only minimally amiloride-sensitive and increased in amiloride-sensitivity during the first 40 h of postnatal life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the current study, we investigated how CFTR transcription changed during early postnatal development. CFTR maintained a relatively high expression at birth and reached adult levels at the 2<sup>nd </sup>postnatal day.</p><p>In our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], &#x003b1;ENaC gene silencing in adult rat lungs was achieved by siRNA generating pDNA, where the pDNA was delivered conjugated with liposomal complexes by intratracheal instillation. This method was originally developed by Folkesson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and took advantage of the anatomical characteristics of the lung. To deliver pDNA in the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] we utilized a modification of the discoveries by Sawa and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], where they demonstrated that intraluminal water instillation into the lung increased transfection efficiency. However, this instillation technique is not suitable for newborn rats due to their small size. It has been demonstrated that DNA can be directly delivered to skeletal muscle by intramuscular injection of 'naked' pDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The gene transfer was, however, restricted to muscle cells adjacent to the route of injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A more recent study by Bhargava and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] demonstrated that site-specific transient gene knockdown can be achieved by local double-strand RNA hypothalamic injection. In our current study, we modified the siRNA-delivery methods by developing a repeatable ttip injection technique using a pDNA (&#x003bc;g):liposome (&#x003bc;l) ratio 1:1 with a pDNA concentration 4 &#x003bc;g/g body wt in a final volume of 40 &#x003bc;l/g body wt and with a low osmolality of 100 mOsm. Our results showed a reproducible specific siRNA-mediated &#x003b1;ENaC and CFTR-silencing, about ~80&#x02013;85% for both mRNA and protein, in newborn rat lungs by this method. In addition, our method was organ specific and did not affect ENaC expression in the kidney, another organ where ENaC is highly expressed, nor did the pDNA itself reach the kidneys. We also demonstrated that our siRNA-generating pDNAs did not reach the kidney after the ttip injections. In our recent publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] using this technique, we demonstrated the involvement of Nedd4-2 in ENaC membrane regulation and the importance for newborn lung conversion for fluid secretion to absorption in the rat.</p><p>An additional limitation of our data might be that the delivery of the siRNA-generating pDNAs invoked an interferon and/or cytokine response. Since both ENaC and CFTR can be affected by cytokines and interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], this could potentially explain the downregulation of ENaC when the CFTR was silenced. However, for multiple reasons we do not believe this to be the case. First, since the interferon response is a response to the introduction of a siRNA to the cells, pSi-0 should also have caused a downregulation of ENaC and CFTR. This never occurred in these or our earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Second, albeit more speculative, earlier studies suggest that introduction of pure siRNA directly to the cells were more likely to cause an interferon response than the introduction of siRNA-generating pDNA or phage-mediated transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Third, all ENaC subunits, &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;, would likely have been downregulated when &#x003b1;ENaC was silenced had there been an interferon response of significance. Fourth, in our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], when Nedd4-2 was silenced, the expression of ENaC increased. Thus all this evidence argues against that a major interferon and/or cytokine response would be occurring in these studies.</p><p>As a functional endpoint, we evaluated changes in extravascular lung water and mortality following ttip pSi-C<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, extravascular lung water was increased after ttip pSi-C<sub>2</sub>-injection. Moreover, pSi-C<sub>2</sub>-injection resulted in an increased mortality. These results indicate that CFTR is involved in the transition from lung fluid secretion to fluid absorption at birth. &#x003b1;ENaC silencing resulted in a similar increase in extravascular lung water, with an even higher increase in mortality. The mortality rate, however, was not the same as &#x003b1;ENaC gene knockout mice studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], possibly because the siRNA-generating pDNA was administered after birth, in contrast to a gestational knockout. It may also be associated with the fact that ttip pSi-4 and pSi-C<sub>2</sub>-injection only silenced &#x003b1;ENaC and CFTR in the lung and thus we avoided unspecific systemic side-effects from &#x003b1;ENaC and CFTR knockdown in other organs, i.e., the GI tract. A third possibility is that siRNA-mediated &#x003b1;ENaC and/or CFTR knockdown was incomplete and left residual &#x003b1;ENaC and CFTR expression in the lung. When a rescue model with CMV promoter-driven rat &#x003b1;ENaC expression in the -/- &#x003b1;ENaC mouse lung was utilized, a very low &#x003b1;ENaC expression was encountered and this was apparently sufficient to rescue ~50% of the mouse pups at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The mortality may also be attributable to that CFTR knockdown reduced &#x003b1;ENaC mRNA and protein by ~20&#x02013;40%, since ENaC deficiency is lethal.</p><p>Factors implied to regulate lung fluid absorption and ENaC expression in the newborn include &#x003b2;AR agonists, glucocorticoid hormones, thyroid hormones, and oxygen concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Key Na transport proteins involved are the basolateral Na,K-ATPase, that provides the driving force, and ENaC provides an apical pathway for Na entry into the epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Evidence has been brought forward suggesting that ENaC activation requires CFTR Cl channel function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. A number of hypotheses have been presented how CFTR control ENaC activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Research supports the hypotheses that there are ENaC-CFTR interactions related to electrical coupling of ion fluxes in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Regulation of apical Na channels (ENaC and other Na channels) has been attributed to changes in cytosolic Ca, Cl concentration, and pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Our results indicate that ENaC and CFTR expression levels appear to correlate with each other at this critical stage of lung development. However, if one is affected by gene silencing (artificially or naturally by mutation), a functional deficiency of this channel may also affect the function/expression other channels. Potentially this may be explained as that ion flow through the channel, either partially or wholly, depends on the electrochemical potential. Thus, when two channels are active in the same membrane they would benefit from being able to influence each other's expression/function. The "electrical coupling" of Cl and Na conductances require that these two conductances are expressed in parallel at the apical epithelial cell membrane with a significant impact on each other. Our results also suggest an "expression coupling" that support and may provide some molecular background of the "electrical coupling" between ENaC and CFTR.</p><p>Was this "expression coupling" between ENaC and CFTR an "animal-only phenomenon" or could it be reproduced in simpler system such as cell systems? To answer this question we isolated and cultured DLE cells and transfected them <italic>in vitro </italic>with pSi-4 or pSi-C<sub>2 </sub>pDNA. DLE cell isolation was done on GD21 fetuses, transfection was done 1 day later, and &#x003b1;ENaC and CFTR expression measured after another day of incubation. We decided on this protocol since it mimicked the time points when the newborn rats were transfected <italic>in vivo</italic>. Transfection of DLE cells with pSi-C<sub>2 </sub>resulted in a knockdown of CFTR, as observed in the newborn rat <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, when pSi-C<sub>2</sub>-transfected cells were assayed for &#x003b1;ENaC expression, we found that &#x003b1;ENaC mRNA and protein were all decreased, also as observed in the newborn rats. Reversely, when the DLE cells were transfected with pSi-4, &#x003b1;ENaC expression was decreased very significantly, while CFTR expression was much less affected. Thus, the "ENaC-CFTR expression coupling" was indeed present in the isolated DLE cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate by using selective siRNA inhibition of CFTR expression that both CFTR and ENaC are involved in the transition from lung fluid secretion to lung fluid absorption at birth. Our data also suggest that ENaC, being the principal agent stimulating lung fluid absorption at birth, may possibly depend on CFTR expression/function. Both CFTR and ENaC seem to be interdependent to each other in order to generate the driving force for perinatal lung fluid absorption.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TL and SK carried out the experimental studies and drafted the manuscript.
