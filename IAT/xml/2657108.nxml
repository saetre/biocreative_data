A3G can potentially induce G-to-A hypermutation in these viruses, and hypermutation could contribute to genetic variation in HIV-1 populations through recombination between hypermutant and wild-type genomes. Thus, hypermutation could contribute to the generation of immune escape and drug resistant variants, but the genetic contribution of hypermutation to the viral evolutionary potential is poorly understood. In addition, the mechanisms by which these viruses persist in the host despite the presence of A3G remain unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To address these questions, we generated a replication-competent HIV-1 Vif mutant in which the A3G-binding residues of Vif, Y<sup>40</sup>RHHY<sup>44</sup>, were substituted with five alanines. As expected, the mutant was severely defective in an A3G-expressing T cell line and exhibited a significant delay in replication kinetics. Analysis of viral DNA showed the expected high level of G-to-A hypermutation; however, we found substantially reduced levels of G-to-A hypermutation in intracellular viral RNA (cRNA), and the levels of G-to-A mutations in virion RNA (vRNA) were even further reduced. The frequencies of hypermutation in DNA, cRNA, and vRNA were 0.73%, 0.12%, and 0.05% of the nucleotides sequenced, indicating a gradient of hypermutation. Additionally, genomes containing start codon mutations and early termination codons within <italic>gag </italic>were isolated from the vRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that sublethal levels of hypermutation coupled with purifying selection at multiple steps during the early phase of viral replication lead to the packaging of largely unmutated genomes, providing a mechanism by which mutant Vif variants can persist in infected individuals. The persistence of genomes containing mutated <italic>gag </italic>genes despite this selection pressure indicates that dual infection and complementation can result in the packaging of hypermutated genomes which, through recombination with wild-type genomes, could increase viral genetic variation and contribute to evolution.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The APOBEC3 proteins APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) are potent inhibitors of Vif-deficient HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, in the presence of HIV-1 Vif the A3G and A3F proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation, thereby protecting the progeny virions from their antiviral effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The importance of the Vif-APOBEC3 interaction in protecting HIV-1 therefore makes it a very attractive target for antiviral therapy development, as inhibiting the interaction would allow these host restriction factors to inhibit HIV-1 replication. To further elucidate the structural determinants of the Vif-APOBEC3 interaction, we and others have identified the domains of Vif that are involved in binding to A3G and A3F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, as a proof of principle, work by Mehle et al. has shown that Vif peptides overlapping the A3G-binding domain were able to inhibit the Vif-A3G interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms of action of the APOBEC3 proteins on Vif-deficient HIV-1 have been the focus of a number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and recently reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, the effect of extensive G-to-A hypermutation on the ongoing replication of HIV-1 has not been studied in depth. Recently, Mulder et al. have shown that a replication-competent virus containing mutations in Vif residues involved in interactions with A3G displayed reduced fitness in PBMC cultures; furthermore, viral DNA in these cells contained extensive G-to-A hypermutation indicative of A3G-induced cytidine deamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, among these viral clones drug-resistant variants existed that could be rescued through recombination with wild type (WT) HIV-1 following dual infection.</p><p>The mechanisms by which mutant Vif HIV-1 clones are able to maintain replication despite continued inhibition by A3G are poorly understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, we studied the growth kinetics of replication-competent HIV-1 containing the YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 Vif mutation in permissive CEM-SS cells and non-permissive CEM cells. We have previously shown that the YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutation renders Vif unable to efficiently bind to and inhibit A3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] thereby allowing us to examine the effects of A3G on replication-competent HIV-1 replication. Unlike previous work studying the presence of G-to-A hypermutation, we examined both the cellular viral and virion RNA as well as the viral DNA. The results showed that the frequency of hypermutation was highest in viral DNA, reduced in cellular viral RNA (cRNA), and lowest in virion RNA (vRNA), indicating a gradient of hypermutation. We surmise that purifying selection at multiple steps during viral replication results in the generation of this hypermutation gradient. As a consequence, viral RNAs that are unmutated or only slightly mutated are packaged in virions for the next round of infection. These observations provide an explanation for the persistence of Vif mutants defective in A3G inhibition in HIV-1 infected individuals, such as those previously reported by Simon et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We also observed complementation between replication-competent virus and virus containing stop codons in Gag, providing additional evidence that hypermutant genomes could contribute to viral variation through recombination with wild-type viral genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Virus containing the YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutation is inhibited in the presence of A3G and D128K-A3G but not A3F</title><p>Our previous studies showed that a Vif mutant (YRHHY &#x0003e; A5), in which the Y<sup>40</sup>RHHY<sup>44 </sup>residues were substituted with five alanines, was unable to block the antiviral activity of A3G but was fully effective in blocking the antiviral activity of A3F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To assess the effects of this Vif mutant in a multiple cycle system the YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutation was introduced into a replication-competent virus (HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5). To confirm that HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 showed the expected phenotype, the mutant and HIV WT were first tested in a transient transfection system in the presence of A3G, A3F, and the D128K-A3G mutant which is resistant to HIV-1 Vif-induced degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As expected, HIV WT was resistant to A3G and A3F but not D128K-A3G, since WT Vif can inhibit both A3G and A3F but not D128K-A3G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In agreement with our previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutant virus was inhibited by A3G and D128K-A3G but not A3F.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of the YRHHY domain of Vif in the context of replication-competent HIV-1 results in loss of Vif function against A3G but not A3F</bold>. HIV WT and pHIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5, a replication competent HIV-1 containing the YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutation, were transfected into 293T cells in the presence of A3G, A3F, or D128K-A3G (a Vif-resistant mutant of A3G). The infectivity of the virus produced from the transfected cells, harvested after 48 hours, was determined by infection of TZM-bl indicator cells and quantitation of the resulting luciferase enzyme activity. The data shown are plotted as the infectivity relative to that produced in the absence of any APOBEC3 proteins which was set to 100%, with standard deviation from two independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-6-16-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 is delayed in CEM cells but not CEM-SS cells</title><p>Next, we compared the replication characteristics of HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 and HIV WT in a multiple cycle assay in permissive CEM-SS cells and non-permissive CEM cells. We also used as a control, NL4-3&#x00394;Vif, which contains two stop codons resulting in the production of a truncated protein consisting of only the first 29 amino acids of Vif. To verify that the CEM cells expressed A3G and the CEM-SS cells did not, we performed western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

To determine the growth kinetics of HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 in permissive CEM-SS cells, 1000 RT units were added to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>CEM-SS cells and the virus and cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C. At various time points virus-containing supernatant was removed and the RT levels were determined. As controls, HIV WT and NL4-3&#x00394;Vif were also included. The results are plotted as the scintillation counts/minute measured at each time point for 3 independent infections of HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 and two independent infections of HIV WT and NL4-3&#x00394;Vif.

The Round 1 input virus was produced in 293T cells and each infection was carried out with 1000 RT units of each virus and 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>CEM or CEM-SS cells. As the results in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> show, in the permissive CEM-SS cells the RT values of HIV WT, NL4-3&#x00394;Vif (two independent infections), and HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 (three independent infections; curves labeled YA, YB, and YC) all peaked between days 9 and 11 and then declined, concomitant with increasing cell death. These results indicated that in the absence of A3G, HIV WT, HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5, and NL4-3&#x00394;Vif exhibited similar replication kinetics in a spreading infection.</p><p>Next, we compared the replication kinetics of HIV WT, HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5, and NL4-3&#x00394;Vif in the non-permissive CEM cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). HIV WT replication, as determined by RT activity, peaked at day 7 (two independent infections, labeled WT A and WT B) whereas the NL4-3&#x00394;Vif replication did not reach above background levels for the duration of the experiment (15 days; two independent infections, labeled as &#x00394;VifA and &#x00394;VifB); this observation indicated that in the absence of Vif, HIV-1 cannot grow in the presence of A3G. For the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutant, ten independent infections were carried out (labeled YA through YJ); as the results in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> show, HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutant replication peaked between days 11 and 15, indicating a 4 to 8 day delay compared to HIV WT. These results indicated that in the presence of the YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutation, which results in suboptimal Vif function, the A3G expressed in CEM cells is able to significantly delay the kinetics of HIV-1 replication. We also noted that the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 viruses replicated with delayed kinetics while the NL4-3&#x00394;Vif viruses completely failed to replicate. We therefore hypothesized that the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutant possessed a low level of Vif activity that allowed some viruses to escape the inhibitory effects of A3G, resulting in continued replication, albeit with delayed kinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>No evidence of adaptive mutations in HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 virus passaged in CEM cells</title><p>To determine whether the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 virus that replicated in CEM cells contained adaptive mutations that allowed it to inhibit A3G and thus grow in the non-permissive cells, 1000 RT unit aliquots of the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 viruses from the days of peak RT for samples YA (day 13), YB (day 11), and YC (day 13) were added to fresh CEM cells (Round 2); these three samples were selected at random as they appeared to be representative of the 10 cultures that were analyzed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>. As the results in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> show, the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 viruses in Round 2 were further delayed, with the HIV WT (WT P2) peaking at day 7 and the mutant viruses (YA P2, YB P2, and YC P2) peaking 14 to 16 days later between days 21 and 23; the increased delay in the replication kinetics indicated that the viruses from Round 1 had not acquired any escape mutations.</p><p>We hypothesized that the increased delay seen between Rounds 1 and 2 may have been due to the fact that the RT units did not accurately reflect the level of infectious HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 virus present in the Round 1 peak. To test this hypothesis, 100 &#x003bc;l of the virus from the days of peak RT at Round 1 was added to TZM-bl cells and the level of luciferase expression measured 24 hours later. To detect luciferase expression in this system, the incoming virus must be capable of cell entry, reverse transcription, integration, and Tat expression, thus making it a more accurate reflection of infectious virus levels than the RT assay. As the results in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> show, the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 viruses taken from the peak RT values of Round 1 were between 7- and 8.6-fold less infectious than the HIV WT taken from the peak RT at day 7, possibly explaining the increased delay seen between Rounds 1 and 2. Based on this observation, the viruses from the days of peak RT of Round 2 were also analyzed on TZM-bl cells and, as the results in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> show, equivalent volumes of the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 viruses were 9.5- to 21.7-fold less infectious than the HIV WT virus. This difference was taken into consideration when setting up Round 3 infections, and equivalent amounts of infectious viruses, as quantified using the TZM-bl cells line, were added to fresh CEM cells. Surprisingly, the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 viruses were delayed as much in Round 3 as they were in Round 2 with HIV WT peaking at day 8 and the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 viruses peaking between days 18 and 25 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of the Round 3 mutant viruses on TZM-bl cells showed a further drop in infectivity from 19.1- to 106.4-fold compared to HIV WT (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The fact that the viruses from Round 2 were still delayed when added to fresh CEM cells in Round 3 further confirmed that escape mutations were not the cause of the observed virus growth.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Infectivity of HIV WT and HIV-YRRHHY &#x0003e; A5 virus-containing supernatants from samples with peak RT activities.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Virus</td><td align="left">Round of Infection<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">Relative Infectivity<sup>b</sup><break/>(%) &#x000b1; S.D.<sup>c</sup></td><td align="left">Fold Decrease in Infectivity</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">WT</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">100 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="left">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YA</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">11.6 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td align="left">8.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YB</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">13.6 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td align="left">7.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YC</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">14.2 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td align="left">7.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">WT</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">100 &#x000b1; 3.0</td><td align="left">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YA</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">10.6 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="left">9.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YB</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">7.3 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="left">13.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YC</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">4.6 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="left">21.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">WT</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">100 &#x000b1; 4.2</td><td align="left">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YA</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">0.9 &#x000b1; 0.0</td><td align="left">106.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YB</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">5.2 &#x000b1; 1.0</td><td align="left">19.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YC</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">2.2 &#x000b1; 0.4</td><td align="left">44.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>Peak time points analyzed are shown in Fig. 2.</p><p><sup>b </sup>The infectivity of equivalent volumes of cell supernatants was assessed using TZM-bl cells.

Furthermore, sequence analysis of <italic>vif </italic>from individual clones of Rounds 1, 2, and 3 did not show any consensus mutations indicative of escape mutants (data not shown). We hypothesized that because the YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutant possessed a low level of Vif activity, this allowed some viruses to escape the inhibitory effects of A3G, resulting in continued replication with delayed kinetics. To test this hypothesis, we first sequenced viral DNA from Rounds 2 and 3 to determine whether any of the proviruses lacked G-to-A hypermutation indicative of A3G-mediated inhibition. Cellular DNAs were extracted, a 730-bp region spanning the <italic>vif </italic>gene and a portion of the <italic>vpr </italic>gene was amplified, cloned, and individual clones were sequenced. The results in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> show a representative set of sequences obtained from Rounds 2 and 3, respectively, with the horizontal lines depicting individual clones and the vertical lines indicating G-to-A mutations; red vertical lines represent G-to-A mutations that would result in either a loss of expression due to mutation of the start codon or a truncated protein due to the formation of an early termination codon. In addition to the G-to-A mutations, the viral DNAs also had other mutations at a frequency that was 11.4-fold lower than the G-to-A mutations (0.06% per nucleotide sequenced; data not shown). The mutation frequency of non G-to-A changes was not altered between HIV WT and HIV-RHHY &#x0003e; A5. The results showed that most viral DNAs had extensive G-to-A hypermutation; 69 and 70 viral DNAs were sequenced from Rounds 2 and 3, respectively; the G-to-A mutation frequencies for Round 2 and 3 were 0.44% and 1.02% per nucleotide sequenced, respectively. In agreement with previously published data, the G-to-A mutations predominantly occurred in GG dinucleotides, in which the 5' G was mutated to A (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. For the 139 viral DNA clones sequenced, the overall G-to-A mutation frequency was 0.70% per nucleotide sequenced. The mutation frequency in viral DNAs from Rounds 2 and 3 was significantly higher than the 0.02% mutation frequency (4 mutations in 23 sequences) observed in viral DNAs analyzed from HIV WT infections (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-6</sup>). An average of 5.12 G-to-A mutations were observed per 730 nucleotides of sequence from the Vif/Vpr region analyzed.

Firstly, we hypothesized that G-to-A mutations in the viral packaging sequence and/or dimer initiation site (DIS) would prevent the packaging of extensively hypermutated RNAs. However, analysis of the 5' untranslated region did not reveal the presence of a high number of G-to-A mutations in these regions; only 1 G-to-A mutation was found in the DIS region and that was in the cRNA and a total of 6 mutations were found in the packaging sequence (2 in each of the DNA [2 out of 24], cRNA [2 out of 116] and vRNA [2 out of 96]). Furthermore, there did not appear to be a gradient of hypermutation between the cellular and viral RNA suggesting that this area is not under selection pressure, although the numbers of mutations in this region are too small to draw definitive conclusions. Secondly, we hypothesized that inactivating mutations in HIV-1 <italic>gag </italic>would result in the loss of functional proteins that are essential for virus production. To test these hypotheses, we carried out sequencing analysis of the viral untranslated leader and the beginning of the <italic>gag </italic>gene.

However, in some infected individuals, HIV-1 variants with Vif mutations that inhibit the Vif-A3G interaction have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In these individuals, it is unclear how the Vif variants persist in the population since they are expected to be inhibited by the A3G protein. The work described here presents mechanisms by which these Vif variants may survive in the population by showing, for the first time, that a gradient of hypermutation exists for the integrated proviral DNA, the cellular viral RNA, and the virion RNA. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that purifying selection is occurring at each stage of virus production, including transcription, mRNA stability, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, translation, and virion assembly. The integrated genomes with extensive hypermutation may not be transcribed, possibly due to mutations in the promoter regions or in the tat gene, thereby preventing the extensively hypermutated genomes from contributing to the gene pool of the viral population. Mutations in the transcribed RNA may reduce their stability and they may be degraded before they can be translated; for example, the RNAs may be rapidly degraded through a nonsense-mediated RNA decay mechanism due to the generation of premature stop codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Additionally, in the absence of co-infection with a wild-type virus, transcribed genomes encoding <italic>gag </italic>genes with early termination codons or mutated start codons will not be able to assemble virus particles, thereby allowing only unmutated genomes or minimally mutated genomes to both produce, and be packaged into, progeny virions. Despite this purifying selection at multiple steps, we were able to detect viral genomes containing stop codons in <italic>gag</italic>; the presence of these genomes in vRNA indicates dual infection and complementation of the <italic>gag </italic>defect. Thus, hypermutated genomes can be packaged in viral particles, and the G-to-A mutations could contribute to viral variation through recombination. Recombination allowing drug resistance mutations to jump from 'dead' hypermutated genomes to WT HIV-1 has recently been observed by Mulder et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The frequency of G-to-A mutations in vRNAs derived from Vif-defective HIV-1 was not significantly different from the vRNAs derived from HIV WT even after 61 days in culture, suggesting that hypermutation does not increase, or only moderately increases, the overall mutation rate of the replicating viral population. The strong purifying selection and the significantly reduced levels of G-to-A mutations in the vRNA observed in this study reduces the probability of hypermutation contributing to viral variation; however, the extent to which hypermutated genomes, packaged by complementation, undergo recombination with wild-type genomes during the course of natural HIV-1 infection, is not known.</p><p>We observed that 18% of the viral DNAs did not have G-to-A mutations in the 730 nucleotide Vif/Vpr region sequenced. It is possible that these viral DNAs contained mutations in the approximately 9000 nucleotides of their genome that we did not sequence. It is also possible that a proportion of the 18% of the viral DNAs without G-to-A mutations did not package A3G, and as a result escaped G-to-A hypermutation. We observed that the virions produced in Round 3 had an average infectivity of 2.76% of wild-type virus, suggesting that a small proportion of the virions either had no mutations or had few mutations that did not prevent virus production, infection, and expression of the Tat protein. One possible mechanism to explain how these viruses retained their infectivity is the low or absent levels of A3G expression in a subset of the CEM cells, leading to production of virions that do not contain A3G. Another possible mechanism is that a small percentage of virions are produced from A3G-expressing cells but did not package A3G and thereby escaped inhibition. We previously estimated that 7 &#x000b1; 4 A3G molecules are packaged in virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; if we assume a Poisson distribution, we estimate that only 0.09% of the virions would fail to package A3G. We have also observed that A3G inhibits viral DNA synthesis and integration, and the efficiency of integration in the presence of A3G is only about 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, in the integrated viral DNA pool, the frequency of non-mutated viral genomes would increase from 0.09% to 3.0%. This predicted frequency of non-mutated genomes is close to the 2.76% infectivity of the Round 3 virions; however, additional experiments are needed to verify the hypothesis that some virions retain infectivity because they do not package A3G and therefore are not subjected to hypermutation.</p><p>Interestingly, we were unable to detect the presence of any Vif-based escape variants despite a total of up to 61 days in culture. This observation does not exclude the possibility that mutations elsewhere in the genome compensated for the defects in Vif, resulting in restoration of the replicative capacity as recently observed by Hache et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, the fact that the mutant Vif virus continued to show delayed growth kinetics, and indeed was more delayed with each round of replication, argues against the presence of any escape variants in our experiments.</p><p>The observed reductions in the frequencies of G-to-A mutations in the Vif/Vpr region could be the result of either direct or indirect purifying selection. The reductions in the frequencies of G-to-A mutations in the cRNAs are most likely due to mutations elsewhere in the genome that affect transcription, mRNA stability, and mRNA transport. The purifying selection against these mutations could indirectly reduce the frequency of mutations in the Vif/Vpr region by selecting for viral genomes with lower levels of hypermutation. On the other hand, the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutant possessed some Vif function since it replicated with delayed kinetics while the NL4-3&#x00394;Vif mutant failed to replicate. Thus, there could be direct purifying selection against more deleterious mutations in Vif.</p><p>Finally, the observation that the HIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutant exhibited a significant delay in replication kinetics for over two months, with no evidence of adaptive mutations, suggests that the Vif-A3G interaction could be a promising target for antiviral drug development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results show for the first time that HIV-1 genomes that have been hypermutated by APOBEC3 proteins are subjected to purifying selection at multiple steps during viral replication, including transcription, mRNA stability, mRNA transport, and virus production. As a result of this purifying selection, a gradient of hypermutation exists, with the viral DNAs containing the highest levels of mutations, cellular viral RNAs containing intermediate levels of mutations, and viral RNAs containing low levels of mutations. The frequency of G-to-A mutations in vRNAs derived from Vif-deficient HIV-1 was not significantly different from the vRNAs derived from HIV WT even after 61 days in culture, suggesting that hypermutation does not increase, or only moderately increases, the overall mutation rate of the replicating viral population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction and cell culture</title><p>The YRHHY &#x0003e; A5 mutation that renders HIV-1 Vif unable to efficiently bind to A3G was inserted into the replication-competent HIV-1 plasmid pNL4-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] using overlapping PCR to generate pHIV-YRHHY &#x0003e; A5.

The virus-containing supernatant was harvested 48 hours after transfection, filtered through a 0.45 &#x003bc;m filter, and diluted in CM. TZM-bl cells were seeded at 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells per well in white flat-bottomed 96-well plates, and 24 hours later infected with virus supernatant containing 5 ng of p24 capsid protein, as determined using the p24 ELISA kit (Perkin Elmer). Another 24 hours later, the culture medium was removed and replaced with 100 &#x003bc;l of CM without phenol red, and 100 &#x003bc;l of britelite luciferase solution (Perkin Elmer).
