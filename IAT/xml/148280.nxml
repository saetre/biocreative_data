Ski and SnoN are transcription factors that form both homodimers and heterodimers. They recognize a specific DNA binding site (GTCTAGAC) through which they repress transcription. Efficient homodimerization of Ski, mediated by a bipartite C-terminal domain consisting of five tandem repeats (TR) and a leucine zipper (LZ), correlates with efficient DNA binding and cellular transformation. The present study assesses the role of SnoN homodimerization and SnoN:Ski heterodimerization in the activities of these proteins. Unlike Ski, efficient homodimerization by SnoN is shown to require an upstream region of the protein in addition to the TR/LZ domain. Deletion of the TR/LZ from SnoN decreases its activity in transcriptional repression and cellular transformation. When co-expressed in vitro, c-Ski and SnoN preferentially form heterodimers. In vivo, they form heterodimers that bind the GTCTAGAC element. Tethered Ski:Sno hetero-dimers that lack TR/LZ domains are more active than either their monomeric counterparts, tethered Ski:Ski homodimers or full-length SnoN and c-Ski. This work demonstrates, for the first time, the differences between dimer formation by Ski and SnoN and underscores the importance of dimerization in their activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
