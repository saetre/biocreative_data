We sequentially used transcriptional profiling and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping to narrow down which genes to test for association with kidney aging. We first performed whole-genome transcriptional profiling to find 630 genes that change expression with age in the kidney. Using two methods to detect eQTLs, we found 101 of these age-regulated genes contain expression-associated SNPs. We tested the eQTLs for association with kidney aging, measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using combined data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the InCHIANTI study.

Specifically, we examined aging in the kidney, an organ that shows an objectively quantifiable decline in function with age. With age, the kidney gets smaller, particularly in the cortex, and kidney function begins to measurably decline after age 40&#x02013;50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000685-Gourtsoyiannis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000685-Lindeman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The glomeruli are ball-shaped structures in the kidney composed of capillary blood vessels actively involved in the filtration of the blood to form urine. The rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli, and thus the measure of the overall renal function, is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The major aging phenotype in the kidney is a 25&#x00025; decline in GFR starting at age 40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000685-Hoang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

A powerful alternative to genome-wide association studies is genomic convergence, which selects candidate genes for a specific phenotype based on genome-wide expression studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000685-Hauser1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000685-Oliveira1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Differential expression between cases and controls may indicate that the gene is functionally involved in disease pathogenesis. DNA chips can be used to identify gene expression increases or decreases in affected individuals compared to controls, and then SNPs within the genes that change expression can be used as candidates in genetic association studies. This approach scans the entire genome for expression changes associated with a disease in order to prioritize genes with a greater chance of contributing to the disease phenotype. This approach was first used to identify genes associated with Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000685-Hauser1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000685-Oliveira1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we have extended the genomic convergence approach to find genes associated with kidney aging by adding an eQTL analysis after the initial genome-wide transcriptional analysis. If a gene is functionally involved in kidney aging and if DNA differences in the gene cause variation in expression among individuals, then there may be an association between the specific allele carried by an individual and that individual's physiological aging trajectory. Finally, we tested the set of eQTLs for association with kidney aging in two studies of normal aging, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the InCHIANTI study. Using this sequential approach, we were able to find SNPs in the matrix metallopeptidase gene <italic>MMP20</italic> (GeneID 9313) that are significantly associated with kidney aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Selection of Age-Regulated Genes</title><p>We used a sequential method involving transcriptional profiling, eQTL mapping and gene association to identify genes that may contribute to kidney aging. We determined which genes change expression with age in the kidney because these are likely enriched for genes that affect physiological aging. For example, a gene that decreases expression with age may contribute to poor renal function because it is expressed at levels below a physiological threshold in the elderly. We obtained a set of 447 age-regulated genes from a genome-wide transcriptional profile of aging in the human kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000685-Rodwell1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a previous gene set enrichment analysis identified four genetic pathways that were coordinately age-regulated in each of three human tissues (kidney, muscle and brain).

We focused on finding expression-associated SNPs (eSNPs) using two methods. The first method searched for eQTLs by pooling individuals that have the same genotype for a particular SNP, and then determining whether the different SNP genotypes are associated with average expression of the corresponding gene. We selected 1041 SNPs in the promoter regions and 386 SNPs in the coding and untranslated regions of the 630 age-regulated genes. We then used a custom Illumina GoldenGate assay to genotype these SNPs in 96 kidney samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000685.s001">Table S1</xref>). Total expression data for these 96 samples was obtained from whole-genome microarrays of 69 kidneys from Rodwell et al. (2004) and new expression data from 26 kidney samples. Kidney samples were from normal tissue from patients aged 29 to 92 years. The kidney samples were dissected into cortex (94 samples) and medulla (59 samples). Expression levels of each gene in the genome were determined using Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133B microarrays.</p><p>We compared the genotypes from our chosen SNPs to their corresponding gene expression levels and found 16 SNPs in 12 genes associated with total expression level (Linear Regression, p&#x0003c;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000685.s002">Table S2</xref>).

Heterozygotes were examined for allelic transcript levels that differ from each other, using genomic DNA allelic ratios as a control of 1&#x02236;1 hybridization intensity.

Kidney cortex mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA prior to the start of the GoldenGate assay. In the assay, the PCR products for each allele were labeled with a different fluorophore and the intensities of each allele were compared to determine if one allele was expressed higher than the other. The cDNA allelic intensities for each SNP were compared within heterozygotes to test for differential allelic expression. Because the intensities from each fluorophore (Cy3 and Cy5) can differ, the genomic DNA allelic intensities of heterozygotes were used as a control to define a 1&#x02236;1 allelic ratio for each SNP. The cDNA allelic ratio for each heterozygote was compared to the 95&#x00025; confidence interval surrounding the mean genomic DNA allele intensity ratio for each SNP. At least five heterozygotes were tested per SNP.

One explanation for this is that the functional SNP causing the expression difference is not closely linked to the SNP we measured in the transcript. Another explanation is that epigenetic effects such as imprinting could cause the differences in expression from the two homologs.

In these studies, the function of the kidney was measured by GFR using 24-hour creatinine clearance.

The candidate kidney aging genes were first searched for mRNA SNPs that could be used in an allele-specific expression assay. In addition to being within the transcript on an autosome, the SNPs had to have a minor allele frequency greater than 0.05 in the HapMap CEU population, an Illumina SNP score greater than 0.4, and be greater than 30 bp from an exon boundary (NCBI Build 36.1) to ensure the Illumina genotyping assay would work properly for both genomic DNA and cDNA. For genes that had multiple assayable mRNA SNPs, those closest to the 5&#x02032; end of the gene were chosen, with a maximum of two SNPs per gene. These criteria were met for 386 SNPs in 276 genes. For candidate aging genes that did not have an appropriate mRNA SNP, promoter region (defined as 5 kb upstream or downstream of the transcription start site) SNPs meeting the same minor allele frequency (&#x0003e;0.05) and SNP score (&#x0003e;0.4) criteria were chosen.
