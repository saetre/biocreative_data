Prostate carcinomas are initially androgen-dependent (ADCaP) and hormone ablation efficiently inhibits their growth, although some deleterious side effects result from the inhibition of AR signaling in normal tissues. The major limitation of these treatments is the capacity of tumors to escape and recur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Heinlein1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Once tumors became resistant to castration, the prognosis is poor. Non-specific and toxic chemotherapies like taxotere are only palliative, and the issue is usually fatal in less than 2 years. Increasingly, clinical observations demonstrate that in the majority of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas (CRCaP, also called hormone-refractory), AR is expressed and controls transcription. Although hormone ablation treatments strongly reduce the circulating testosterone levels, the residual amounts of androgens measured within the tumors of castration-resistant patients, are sufficient to maintain some AR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Mohler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Mostaghel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, several other processes allow CRCaP bypassing hormonal ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Culig1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Scher1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In experimental tumors, a moderate overexpression of AR in androgen-dependent tumors allows experimental tumors bypassing hormone ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Chen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In patients, AR overexpression can result from gene amplification, increased transcription, or stabilization of the AR protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Gregory1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, recently linked to the phosphorylation of some AR residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Chen2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Guo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Other molecular events, such as mutations broadening the ligand spectrum, or conferring agonist properties to androgen antagonists, alterations in nuclear receptor coactivators, ligand-independent binding of AR to DNA, were also implicated in AR signaling in CRCaP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Culig1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Scher1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The variety of mechanisms that can be selected by prostate tumor cells to escape androgen-ablation therapies underlines their plasticity, and suggests that AR expression is mandatory in CRCaP. However, molecular alterations continue to accumulate once resistance to hormone ablation is established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Sirotnak1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and a fraction of aggressive tumors, like the DU145 and PC3 cells, stably silence AR, activate other signaling pathways, and become truly androgen-independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Nakayama1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, although AR is functional in most recurrent tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Scher1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Dehm1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, disrupting AR signaling once the resistant phenotype is established, may not be sufficient to halt the tumor growth.

Once the measurement of tumors for 5 days demonstrated their exponential growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001006.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the mean volume of tumors was 49.7&#x000b1;8.6 mm<sup>3</sup> (mean&#x000b1;SEM).

Half of the mice were treated with the panAR-siRNA, the other half with a control-siRNA (cont-siRNA) matching no known mRNA sequences in mouse and human databanks. The growth of tumors treated with AR-siRNA was very rapidly arrested, and after 10 days, the mean tumor volume represented only 15&#x00025; of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The nuclear AR labeling observed in cont-siRNA treated tumor cells was no longer detected in tumors treated with AR-siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g001">Figure 1D, left panel</xref>), where large areas of dead, TUNEL-positive cells were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g001">Figure 1D, right panel</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, the hAR-siRNA also inhibited the LNCaP growth in vivo, as efficiently as the AR antagonist bicalutamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).

Half of the animals in each group were sacrificed on the fourth day of treatment. At that time, the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) mRNA was strongly repressed in the hAR-siRNA and in the bicalutamide groups, while AR mRNA level was repressed only in the hAR-siRNA treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Specificity of the AR-siRNA induced inhibition of tumor growth</title><p>The weight and behavior of mice were not affected by a 3 weeks-long daily treatment with siRNAs, whatever the sequence used.

Because off-target effects occur independently of the target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Jackson1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, we injected AR-siRNA into mice bearing tumors that do not express AR. We chose the fibrosarcoma JT8 cell line for this purpose, because we previously demonstrated that injections of VEGF-siRNA into mice bearing JT8 tumors inhibited by 70&#x00025; the VEGF production, resulting in a sustained inhibition of the tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Filleur1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

None of the siRNA significantly modified these levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001006.s003">Figure S3</xref> and data not shown). In addition, it is noteworthy that RNAseL/HPC1 is one of the major susceptibility genes identified in familial prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Nupponen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is therefore highly unlikely that the inhibition of LNCaP tumor growth observed in AR-siRNA treated mice results from a non-specific mRNA degradation and apoptosis induced by interferons.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Silencing of AR in prostate and testes of treated mice</title><p>In patients, castration or AR antagonists affect not only the tumor cells, but also normal tissues, triggering deleterious side effects. Development of tumor-selective treatments would reduce these unwanted effects but could also be less efficient. To address this question we analyzed the prostate and testes of mice treated for 2 or 3 weeks with daily injections of 3 &#x000b5;g of siRNA. As compared to cont-siRNA, AR expression was strongly reduced by the pan-AR-siRNA treatment in epithelial and stromal cells of the ventral prostate, and in Leydig and Sertoli cells in the testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In the testes, the AR-target gene Glutathione S-transferase alpha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-BenbrahimTallaa1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> was also inhibited by AR silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As observed with other AR signaling inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-DeGendt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, AR silencing in the testes induced the apoptosis of germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), but not that of the AR-expressing Leydig and Sertoli cells, further demonstrating the specificity of the effects triggered by the panAR-siRNA. We recently reported that AR silencing in the testes inhibits the Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 synthesis in the germ cells, a mechanism possibly involved in the induction of their apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-GonzalezHerrera1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Testosterone is mainly produced by the Leydig cells. We therefore measured whether AR silencing affected the production of this hormone, and found no significant differences between untreated mice (0.88&#x000b1;0.69 ng/ml), and mice treated for 3 weeks with cont-siRNA (0.53&#x000b1;0.31 ng/ml) or panAR-siRNA (0.81&#x000b1;0.52 ng/ml). It is thus unlikely that the antitumoral effects of the panAR-siRNA result from an indirect effect on peripheral tissues. Furthermore, the AR expression in prostate and testes was not affected by treatment of mice with the siRNA selective for the human AR mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) whereas this siRNA efficiently silenced AR in the human tumor cells and inhibited their growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, the effects of hAR- and panAR-siRNAs to inhibit the growth of C4-2 tumors were very similar (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the main driver of the antitumoral effects of the AR-siRNA is the AR silencing in the tumor cells themselves. Treatment of tumors expressing a mutated AR isoform with siRNAs targeting specifically this mutation would silence AR in the tumor, while preserving its expression is normal tissues, thus reducing the unwanted side effects.</p><fig id="pone-0001006-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001006.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Silencing of AR in prostate and testes.</title><p>A: Upper panels, immunodetection of AR expression in the ventral prostate of mice treated for 3 weeks with hAR-, cont-, or panAR-siRNA as indicated.

However, this technique does not demonstrate the integrity of siRNAs into tissues. We demonstrate, and quantify here for the first time, the uptake of siRNAs into tumors and mouse tissues. The blood vessels density in tumors from AR-siRNA treated mice was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001006-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and, accordingly, the number of siRNA copies detected in these tumors was of the same order of magnitude than that measured in testes, which are poorly vascularized, whereas the siRNA uptake appeared more efficient in liver and prostate. However the number of siRNA molecules within tumor cells is likely underestimated, due to the heterogeneity of necrotic and fibrotic tumors, the difficulty to quantify the number of viable cells within a tumor, and the presence of nucleases released by dying cells during the RNA purification process. It is still unclear today which transporter, among the several membrane proteins identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-ODwyer1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, is really involved in the uptake of naked oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) demonstrated in some clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Beltinger1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

We therefore used this cellular model to set up the technical conditions to silence AR in exponentially growing tumors using synthetic AR-siRNA. The uptake of panAR-siRNA triggered a strong silencing of AR in tumor cells, prostate and testes which did not modify the blood level of testosterone. Interestingly, the sequence specificity of siRNA allowed here discriminating <italic>in vivo</italic> the closely related mouse and human AR mRNAs: treatment with hAR-siRNA silenced AR in tumor cells and inhibited the tumor growth while preserving AR expression in mouse prostate and testes. Treating tumors with hAR-siRNA was as efficient as treating with the antagonist bicalutamide, which affects AR signaling in prostate and testes. The inhibition of the growth of C4-2 tumors by panAR- or hAR-siRNAs in intact males was comparable. All together, these data demonstrate that the inhibition of AR signaling outside the tumor does not participate in the antitumoral effect, opening promising perspectives for developing tumor-specific treatments with reduced side effects for patients.</p><p>Prostate tumor cells can escape androgen-ablation therapies by multiple mechanisms involving the androgen receptor. The functionality of AR in these resistant cells is well established, but this does not foretell if AR silencing is sufficient to inhibit proliferation and trigger apoptosis, as other molecular events accumulating along tumor progression could help cells bypassing AR signaling.

In our hands, AR silencing produced a time-dependent inhibition of cells' proliferation in C4-2 as in 22RV1 cells, but triggered apoptosis in C4-2 cells only, at least during the time-course of this experiment. Using a lentiviral AR-shRNA expressing vector, Chen et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001006-Chen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> stably silenced AR in LAPC4 and in castration-resistant LNCaP cells, which then failed to develop tumors once grafted into SCID mice.

From all the above studies, it was therefore not possible to foretell whether AR was a key target in established resistant tumors.</p><p>We used to address this question one ADCaP and two unrelated CRCaP models and checked during at least 5 days that each tumor was exponentially growing before randomization for siRNA treatment.
