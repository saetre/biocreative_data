TIMPs serve not only to inhibit MMP activity, but also aid in the activation of MMPs that are secreted as inactive zymogens. <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> metamorphosis is an ideal model for studying MMP and TIMP expression levels because all tissues are remodeled under the control of one molecule, thyroid hormone. Here, using RT-PCR analysis, we examine the metamorphic RNA levels of two membrane-type MMPs (MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP), two TIMPs (TIMP-2, TIMP-3) and a potent gelatinase (Gel-A) that can be activated by the combinatory activity of a MT-MMP and a TIMP. In the metamorphic tail and intestine the RNA levels of TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP mirror each other, and closely resemble that of Gel-A as all three are elevated during periods of cell death and proliferation. Conversely, MT3-MMP and TIMP-3 do not have similar RNA level patterns nor do they mimic the RNA levels of the other genes examined. Intriguingly, TIMP-3, which has been shown to have anti-apoptotic activity, is found at low levels in tissues during periods of apoptosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amphibian metamorphosis is a late developmental event that has been used to examine numerous processes including; cell signaling, receptor function, gene regulation, morphogenesis, and effects of environmental toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001000-Dodd1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001000-Crump1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

MMPs are a family of 25 proteins that function to cleave and remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) and other cell surface proteins.

Most MMPs are secreted as inactive zymogens (pro-MMPs) that must to be activated extracellularly, often by other already active MMPs. Interestingly membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs), a family of six molecules, are activated intracellularly in the Golgi by furin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001000-Kang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

MT3-MMP RNA displayed one peak at stage 61, while TIMP-3 RNA levels dipped at stage 61. MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 and Gel-A RNA levels increased as metamorphosis progressed and were maintained until the end of metamorphosis. Metamorphosis of the tail is a late event and one of the last to occur as all tail tissues are remodeled and removed in an efficient and safe manner.

The high levels of TIMP-2 supports two possible roles for this molecule. It can either work with MT1-MMP in activating other pro-MMPs, or conversely, if protein levels are high enough, TIMP-2 can inhibit and slow ECM remodeling to allow tail resorption to take place. TIMP-3 may then be playing an important role in modulating the speed of ECM degradation at late stages of metamorphosis (after stage 63), presumably a time when many MMPs are active and would otherwise degrade the ECM and induce apoptosis.</p><fig id="pone-0001000-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001000.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Patterns of MMP and TIMP RNA Levels Seen During <italic>X. laevis</italic> Tail Metamorphosis Derived From RT-PCR Data.</title><p>Levels of RNA found during tail metamorphosis demonstrated that MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 and MMP-2 shared similar RNA expression patterns, peaking at stage 61 and staying elevated at stage 63.

As the tail is one of the last tissues to undergo metamorphosis, it responds to T3 days after other tissues do during natural metamorphosis. It is likely that 3 days of T3 treatment is comparable to only the very early stages of tail metamorphosis. TIMP-3 levels do rise late in natural metamorphosis only after stage 61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001000-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001000-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, this often takes many days after natural metamorphosis has started, and to expose tadpoles to high levels of exogenous T3 for long periods of time to induce complete tail regression is impractical, as it is most often lethal. Parenthetically, TIMP-3 levels may remain low during early stages as TIMP-3 has been shown to have anti-apoptotic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001000-Lambert1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, characteristics that would be detrimental to the regression of the tail.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The RNA levels of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 mirror each other during natural and induced metamorphosis of both the intestine and the tail. Their RNA patterns are closely matched by Gel-A, except during late intestine metamorphosis where Gel-A levels stay elevated. It is known that MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 can work together to activate Gel-A and our RNA data support this activation scenario. By comparison, MT3-MMP and TIMP-3 do not share similar RNA patterns during intestine metamorphosis, tail metamorphosis, nor in response to T3. This suggests that MMP and TIMP expression patterns during development should be considered collectively as certain pairings of these molecules appear to play significant roles together. While there appears to be a clear elevation of genes in response to apoptotic and cell proliferation events both in the intestine and tail, the level of active proteins and the exact cellular distribution of these proteins remains to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Animals and Treatments</title><p>Free-swimming <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles (Boreal Northwest) were raised in dechlorinated tap water.
