Conversely, experimentally characterized mammalian genes may be used to annotate fish genomes. However, gene families that escape this principle include the rapidly diverging cytokines that regulate the immune system, and their receptors. A classic example is the class II helical cytokines (HCII) including type I, type II and lambda interferons, IL10 related cytokines (IL10, IL19, IL20, IL22, IL24 and IL26) and their receptors (HCRII). Despite the report of a near complete pufferfish (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>) genome sequence, these genes remain undescribed in fish.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have used an original strategy based both on conserved amino acid sequence and gene structure to identify HCII and HCRII in the genome of another pufferfish, <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>that is amenable to laboratory experiments. The 15 genes that were identified are highly divergent and include a single interferon molecule, three IL10 related cytokines and their potential receptors together with two Tissue Factor (TF). Some of these genes form tandem clusters on the Tetraodon genome. Their expression pattern was determined in different tissues. Most importantly, Tetraodon interferon was identified and we show that the recombinant protein can induce antiviral <italic>MX </italic>gene expression in Tetraodon primary kidney cells. Similar results were obtained in Zebrafish which has 7 <italic>MX </italic>genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a scheme for the evolution of HCII and their receptors during the radiation of bony vertebrates and suggest that the diversification that played an important role in the fine-tuning of the ancestral mechanism for host defense against infections probably followed different pathways in amniotes and fish.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The increasing number of sequenced genomes provides molecular explanations for both the unity and diversity of living organisms. The more divergent the organisms, the less they share genes. This explains why annotation of genomes using genes with known functions in other organisms leaves a high number of predicted genes with no predicted function. For some prokaryotes, the percentage of genes with no predicted function rises to 65% but falls to 20% for the closely related vertebrate genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The majority of genes with no assigned functions are those involved in the recent evolutionary success of the considered taxonomic group. This is both true for prokaryotes that develop original metabolisms allowing growth in special environments and for the vertebrate species that have developed original solutions in response to environmental pressures. Comparison of mammalian proteins show that host defense ligands and receptors make up the group of proteins that diverge the most rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. According to the &#x000ab;red queen model&#x000bb; the pressure of pathogens is, at small time scales, the most drastic pressure for the evolution of vertebrate species.</p><p>At the genomic level, together with the mutation/modification of regulatory elements, three driving forces are instrumental for the diversification. The first is the emergence of new domain architecture through domain accretion and shuffling, the second is deletion of genes, and the third is the expansion of a gene family either by gene duplications or by retropositions. Lineage specific expansion (LSE) is the proliferation of a given gene family in a given lineage. Its description implies the comparison of sister lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Using predicted proteomes, Lespinet et al. have recently performed a systematic comparative analysis of LSEs in the following eukaryotic genomes: <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster </italic>and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. They reached the conclusion that &#x000ab;LSE seems to be one of the most important sources of structural and regulatory diversity in crown-group eukaryotes, which was critical for the tremendous exploration of the morphospace seen in these organisms&#x000bb; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A good example for an LSE is the expansion of immunoglobulin genes in gnathostomes compared to other chordates. But LSEs also exist when comparing the different orders of mammals as exemplified by the expansion of the alpha interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Vertebrate immunoglobulins (Ig) are built up from modules of one hundred amino acids. These modules are defined both by a common 3-D structure, by conserved disulfide bridges and by conserved amino acid positions. They share the same 3-D structure with the Fibronectin type III repeats (FNIII), but conserved amino acid positions are different in both groups of domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Genes coding for such modules were already present in the genomes of invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The originality of the gnathostomes is the invention of rearranging antigen receptors by insertion of a transposable element in a gene coding for one of these Ig modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. During the further diversification of the vertebrates, the different lineages (for example, condrychtians and osteichtians) have developed the system in different ways but the main difference consists in the maturation of the immune response that mainly takes place in the lymphoid organs. Cytokines that regulate the maturation of the immune response from antigen detection to clonal expansion of the one cell with better affinity mostly belong to the helical cytokine (HC) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. They include interferons, most interleukins, LIF, CNTF, GCSF, GM-CSF, thrombopo&#x000ef;etine. These helical cytokines have no similarities at the level of primary amino acid sequences, but they are all structured around a similar four alpha helix bundle. They share this common 3-D structure with some hormones that for this reason are structurally described as helical cytokines: Growth Hormone (GH), Prolactin (PRL), Erythropo&#x000ef;etin (EPO) and Leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These helical cytokines all bind to the extracellular binding domains of their cognate receptors (helical cytokines receptors: HCR) which all contain a 200 amino-acids (D200) domain that is the identification mark of the <italic>HCR </italic>gene family. These D200 domains are composed of two subdomains of 100 amino-acids (SD100A &#x00026; SD100B) that are both structured like the basic Ig domains with two &#x003b2; sheets of respectively 3 and 4 strands (C type). Conserved amino-acid positions clearly distinguish these D200 domains from the Ig superfamily and from the FNIII family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Whereas Ig and FNIII families have been expanded in invertebrates, a single gene with a D200 has been described in invertebrates: the <italic>dome </italic>gene in drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The HCR family is therefore an interesting example of a vertebrate specific LSE. Like other families of receptors involved in host defense, it mostly consists of highly diverging receptors (28% amino acids identities between the human and chicken IFNAR2 proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Together with the difficulty of predicting genes from genomic sequences, this explains why the comparison of the predicted human and Fugu proteomes did not allow the identification of the complete repertoire of HCR in Fugu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Depending on the conserved amino acids residues, HCRs can be divided in two classes: Class I and Class II. Class II consists of the Tissue Factor, the receptors for interferons and the receptors for IL10 and its related cytokines(IL10, IL19, IL20, IL22, IL24 and IL26). Class I consists of all other HCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Their cognate ligands have been called class I and class II helical cytokines. Genes for HCRI have been described in the major vertebrate groups including fish, birds and mammals, but HCRII have only been described in birds and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The question is therefore open as to whether the HCRII expansion is amniote specific or not. The recent efforts to sequence genomes from fish offer an interesting opportunity to answer this question.</p><p>Interestingly, the intron/exon structure of the vertebrate <italic>HCR </italic>genes is strictly conserved in all the family: like the exons coding for the Igs and the FNIII, the exons coding each SD100 are bordered by phase 1 introns, but what is specific for D200s is that SD100As are encoded by two exons with an internal phase 2 intron falling at the level of the third &#x003b2; strand and that SD100Bs are encoded by two exons with an internal phase 0 intron falling at the level of the fourth &#x003b2; strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Intron/exon structures can thus be used as a criterion for the identification of homologs in distant species.</p><p>We decided to use the genomic data from <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>to look for the genes coding the class II HCR (HCRII) and their ligands. The main interest of <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>is both its completely sequenced compact genome and the ease with which it can be maintained in the laboratory and used for experiments. We report here the complete description of the <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>class II HCR repertoire and show that its diversification from common ancestral elements has occurred independently in fish and mammalian lineages. We have also characterized two ligands for these receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of HCRII genes in <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic></title><p>The starting point for the search was the alignment of the classII HCR D200 as reported in Uz&#x000e9; et al. (1995), extended to include the more recently described members IFNAR2 and CRF2-8 to CRF2-12 that allows the definition of a pattern of conserved positions. A conserved tryptophan in exon A1 (the first exon coding for SD100A), a conserved tryptophan and pair of cysteines in exon A2, a conserved serine and pair of cysteines in exon B2. All HCRII were tblastn against the 3 million genomic reads of <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>(see methods). Reads with e&#x0003c;0.1 were kept and assembled. Each contig was tested for the presence of correct potential exons: introns of the correct phase and predicted proteins compatible with HCRII. False positives were exons coding for FNIII repeats that do not have the D200 intron/exon structure. All matching contigs were further extended in order to reach sizes of contigs compatible with whole gene size in the compact genome of <italic>T. nigroviridis</italic>: 5 contigs from 4 to 30 kb were obtained. Gene models were predicted in each contig and most probable exons were used to design oligonucleotides for 3' and 5' RACE. The full-length cDNAs were then aligned against the contigs to deduce gene structures and compared to Genscan predictions <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html"/>. None of the 11 TnHCRII was correctly predicted by Genscan. The largest contig harbors 6 genes while the 5 others harbour a single HCRII gene. All genes are around 3 kb long. In agreement with the human nomenclature, they were named TnCRFB-1 to TnCRFB-11. All reading frames start with a leader peptide followed by a single D200. Except for TnCRFB-9 they all have a clear transmembrane (TM) domain after the D200. Expression patterns were determined for each of the 11 genes by Q-PCR using cDNAs reverse transcribed from RNAs of brain, spleen, cephalic kidney, gonads and intestine (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Long open reading frames and high expression in at least one tissue were considered sufficient criteria to state that these genes code for receptors and are not pseudogenes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Strategy for the characterization of the T. nigroviridis HCR genes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-4-29-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression pattern for the classII helical cytokine receptor genes. </bold>RNA samples were prepared from tissues, reverse transcribed and abundance of each cDNA was measured by QPCR using oligonucleotides listed in supplementary material.

As already described the <italic>HCRIIs </italic>are grouped in clusters on the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The largest cluster lies on human chromosome 21 (HSA21); it contains four genes (<italic>IFNAR2</italic>, <italic>IL10R2</italic>, <italic>IFNAR1 </italic>and <italic>IFNGR2</italic>) and is linked to the <italic>C21orf4 </italic>and <italic>GART </italic>genes. Two other clusters exist, one on HSA6q containing three genes (<italic>IFNGR1</italic>, <italic>IL22BP </italic>and <italic>IL20R1</italic>) and one on HSA1p containing two genes (<italic>IFNLR1 </italic>and <italic>IL22R2</italic>). The <italic>TF </italic>gene is also located on HSA1p but so distant that it cannot be considered as a member of the same cluster. The <italic>IL20R2 </italic>and <italic>IL10R1 </italic>genes are isolated and therefore called outgroups. The <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>genome harbors a single <italic>HCRII </italic>gene cluster. As proved by the presence and similar orientation of the <italic>TnC21orf4 </italic>gene, this cluster is homologous to the HSA21 gene cluster. It contains six genes instead of the four genes present on the human homologous cluster. Interestingly, the <italic>TnGART </italic>gene, is not linked to this cluster, but is adjacent to the <italic>TnMT </italic>gene (<italic>T nigroviridis </italic>homolog of the yeast <italic>YDR140w </italic>gene). The same organization of the <italic>GART </italic>and <italic>MT </italic>genes, has already been described in the Fugu genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The human homolog for this <italic>MT </italic>gene (Acc nb of the cDNA: AF139682) is present on HSA21, 4.5 Mb centromeric to the cluster and transcribed toward the centromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The respective position of these genes indicates that an inversion has occurred since the divergence of the fish and mammalian ancestors. This inversion has involved a large chromosomal fragment covering genes from <italic>C21orf4 </italic>to the <italic>MT </italic>homolog of the yeast <italic>YDR140w </italic>gene. In one state, the <italic>C21orf4 </italic>is adjacent to the <italic>GART </italic>gene (amniotes), but in the other, the <italic>MT </italic>is next to <italic>GART</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative genomic mapping of the HCR genes in human and T. nigroviridis </bold>All genes are represented by an arrow that indicates the orientation of transcription. <bold>A) </bold>Clusters of HCR in the human genome.

The alignment was used to draw the phylogenetic tree that is depicted in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Tree branches with bootstrap values over 80% are indicated in bold. The clearest result is the grouping of TnCRFB10 &#x00026; 11 with the TFs. TnCRFB10 and TnCRFB11 therefore appear as homologous to the mammalian TFs. This is confirmed by the intron/exon structure of their genes. <italic>TnCRFB10 </italic>&#x00026;<italic>11</italic>, as the mammalian <italic>TF </italic>genes, are unique among the <italic>HCRII </italic>genes coding for transmembrane proteins in that the same exon encodes the TM domain and the very short intracellular domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Clearly, as shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file: 2</xref>, tetraodons, contrarily to amniotes have no IFNAR1 receptor with its typical double D200 that has certainly been instrumental to the diversification of the type I IFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. But the question remains open whether or not fish have interferon related molecules with similar functions.</p><p>The <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>reads were searched for exons capable of coding for molecules structurally related to the IFNs and IL10 related cytokines (tblastn). Contrary to their receptors, these cytokines are not encoded by genes with similar intron/exon structures. Genes for type I IFNs (IFNI) have no introns, those for IFNII have three introns.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], those for IFN lambda have four introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]and those for IL10 related cytokines have four common introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore the intron/exon structure could not be used as a criterion for the search of homologs in distant species. Potential exons were used for 3' and 5' RACE and the genes for four helical cytokines could be cloned: three genes coding IL10 related cytokines with the four conserved phase 0 introns and an interesting <italic>TnIFN </italic>gene also interrupted by four phase 0 introns. This gene codes for an interferon structurally related to IFNI and IFN lambda. For this reason, we call it <italic>TnIFN</italic>. The same full-length cDNA was cloned both from a wild animal and from an animal from breeders.</p><p>In order to establish that this fish <italic>IFN </italic>gene is not specific for tetraodons, we also cloned the orthologous gene from <italic>Danio rerio </italic>(zebrafish) using the trace repository reads to design oligonucleotides on potential exons for 3' and 5' RACE. The first four exons could easily be identified <italic>in silico </italic>using the <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>sequence, but the last exon could be identified only by 3' RACE. The corresponding gene was called <italic>zIFN</italic>. Full-length cDNAs were cloned from two individuals from different breeders: alleles A &#x00026; B. Both zIFN sequences differed at four silent positions, two non silent positions and differed at their COOH terminus; allele B codes for two extra amino acids. Despite the report from Aparicio et al.

For this purpose, we looked for the <italic>MX </italic>genes both in <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>and in zebrafish. <italic>MX </italic>genes code for mechanoenzymes of the Dynamin family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and are typical interferon induced genes. We have identified seven <italic>MX </italic>genes in zebrafish (<italic>zMXA </italic>to <italic>zMXG</italic>) and have found evidence of expression for all of them except <italic>zMXF</italic>. The <italic>zMXA </italic>gene corresponds to the already reported zebrafish <italic>MX </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In contrast <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>has a single <italic>MX </italic>gene. The amount of <italic>TnMX </italic>mRNA was therefore used as a test for the biological activity of TnIFN. The TnIFN orf was cloned in either pIVEX2.3-MCS or pIVEX 2.4bNde (6HIS Cterm and Nterm fusions respectively) and the resulting plasmids were used to produce recombinant TnIFN. The recombinant protein was used to challenge primary cultures of cephalic kidney <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>cells. After a 6 hours treatment, cells were harvested for total RNA preparations and quantitative RT PCR was used for measuring the amount of TnMX mRNAs. The <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>mRNA for hnRNPA2, a house keeping splicing regulator, was used as a reference. PolyI/PolyC treatment was used as a control of interferon induction. Results shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> show that the recombinant TnIFN molecule with a Nterm HIS tag can induce the expression of the TnMX mRNA to a level similar to PolyI/PolyC treatment.</p><p>We verified that, in contrast to the PolyI/PolyC treatment, recombinant TnIFN and GFP do not induce the TnIFN mRNA (not shown). Similar result were obtained with zebrafish cell lines ZF4/7 using zMXE as a reporter mRNA as it is the <italic>zMX </italic>gene the more induced by IFN (not shown). <italic>PKR </italic>is an other very well characterized IFN induced gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>has two <italic>PKR </italic>genes (<italic>PKR1 </italic>and <italic>PKR2</italic>) which were used as reporters to confirm the results with <italic>TnMX</italic>: both are induced like the single <italic>TnMX </italic>gene (not shown).</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation, Altmann et al (2003) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] have reported the molecular and functional analysis of zIFN and shown its antiviral activity and Yap et al. (2003) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] have shown that the promoter of the single Fugu MX gene can be induced by human interferon when transfected in human cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Rapidly evolving lineage specific gene families are intrinsically difficult to analyze by large scale comparative genomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A good example of this difficulty is the recent report of the near complete sequence of the Fugu genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This report clearly stated that IFNs and their related IL10 family cytokines and most of their receptors could not be identified in the Fugu genomes. We show here that reexamination of the data leads to opposite conclusions. Careful analysis of the HCR family in amniotes reveals features that can be used as criteria for a specific search of their homologs in distant species. Both conserved positions in the amino acid sequence of the protein and conserved phase and positions of introns are instrumental for this search.</p><sec><title>Receptor diversification</title><p>Using the strategy described in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, we have been able to describe 11 <italic>TnHCRII </italic>genes in <italic>T. nigroviridis</italic>. Primary amino acid sequences are so divergent that the phylogenetic tree is poorly reliable. Only a limited number of branches have good bootstrap values. For this reason, we cannot make estimates of divergence time for the different family members. It also explains why the tree differs from that of Kotenko et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and why it is difficult to distinguish between paralogy and orthology for those receptors. The clearest homology is for <italic>TnCRFB10 </italic>&#x00026;<italic>11 </italic>that are paralogous and represent the homologs of the mammalian <italic>TF</italic>s. TF is an interesting member of the HCRII family in that it does not bind a helical cytokine, but a coagulation factor (VIIa) whose 3D structure is similar to that of a helical cytokine. It clearly is not involved in host defense against pathogens and as such is not diverging as rapidly as the other HCRII family members from one species to the other. Interestingly, the two <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>genes are not expressed in the same tissues, <italic>TnCRFB11 </italic>being specific for the brain. We see two reasons to postulate that these two genes have not been duplicated recently. The first is that the encoded proteins show only 35% amino acid identity and the second is that they do not lie in cluster on the genome of <italic>T. nigroviridis</italic>. This could lead us to postulate that other teleost fish species also have two <italic>TF </italic>genes. Curiously the Fugu proteome deduced from the near complete sequence of the Fugu genome contains only the ortholog of <italic>TnCRFB10 </italic>(Scaffold8956, protein 61906). A <italic>Oncorhynchus mykis TF </italic>gene has been cloned (Acc nb CAC82787) that is also the ortholog of <italic>TnCRFB10</italic>. For this reason we propose that <italic>TnCRFB10 </italic>would be called <italic>TnTF1 </italic>and <italic>TnCRFB11 </italic>be called <italic>TnTF2</italic>. The absence of <italic>TF2 </italic>in other species could simply reflect lack of detection of the paralogous <italic>TF2 </italic>gene. We therefore re-examined the Fugu genome for potential exons coding for a FuguTF2. Such exons could be found on Fugu-Scaffold 5445, but the Scaffold seems badly assembled as the exons are scrambled, therefore the correct gene model has escaped automatic detection. This proves that the Fugu genome has the <italic>TF2 </italic>gene. The <italic>O. mikis TF2 </italic>gene has probably escaped cloning by classical means just by chance as investigators were probably looking for just one gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Expression pattern of the TnIFN and TnIL10 genes and accumulation of the TnMX mRNA after IFN treatment. </bold>Results are amounts of mRNA relative to the hnRNPA2 mRNA. 5% confidence in a student T test is shown. <bold>A) </bold>TnIL10 in different tissues. <bold>B) </bold>TnIFN in different tissues in animals injected by PolyI/PolyC or PBS(basal). <bold>C) </bold>TnMX in primary kidney cells treated either with PolyI/PolyC, recombinant GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) or recombinant TnIFN with either Nterm or Cterm 6His tag.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-4-29-6"/></fig><p>The other possible homology is between TnCRFB4 &#x00026; 5 and IL10R2. The IL10R2 receptor is in fact a "common chain" as it is a necessary component of the receptors for IL10, IL22 and IFN lambda and it is (apart from TF) the HCRII with the lowest sequence divergence in amniotes. Its gene lies in the center of the HSA21 <italic>HCRII </italic>gene cluster. Interestingly, <italic>TnCRFB4 </italic>&#x00026;<italic>5 </italic>also lie in a similar central position on the homologous <italic>TnC21orf4 </italic>linked gene cluster. Finally, TnCRFB1, 2 &#x00026; 3 are closely related to each other. Careful inspection of the data indicates that the three genes are also present in the Fugu genome, but because of assembly problems they appear on different contigs (Fugu Scaffolds 3897 &#x00026; 6320). They seem to code for receptors distantly related to amniote's IFNAR2. This is in accordance with their mapping at the extremity of the C21orf4 linked cluster and could suggest a common ancestry. The successive tandem duplications that lead to the three fish genes could be fish specific. The vicinity of the unassigned outgroups <italic>TnHCRII </italic>did not reveal genes whose homologs would be linked to human <italic>HCRII </italic>genes, it is therefore not possible to state any clear homology to mammalian genes. Careful inspection of the Fugu genome reveals that the 11 <italic>TnHCRII</italic>s have homologs in Fugu.</p></sec><sec><title>Ligand diversification</title><p>The search for ligands has revealed only four classII helical cytokines (HCII): IFN and three IL10 related cytokines (IL10, IL20 and IL24). The present work allows the definition of two categories of classII cytokines. One category is made up in mammals of lambda IFN and typeI IFN, the other would be made up of IL10 related cytokines and gamma IFN (see below). In fish, the first category would be made up of only an ancestral interferon gene with four phase 0 introns that is homologous to the human IFN lambda genes. The three human IFN lambda genes are located on human chromosome 19 and their four phase 0 are perfectly conserved both amongst them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and with <italic>TnIFN </italic>and <italic>zIFN</italic>. The key element during the evolution of the <italic>IFN </italic>genes has therefore been a retroposition event that occurred during evolution after the separation of sarcopterygians from actinopterygians and that created an intronless type I <italic>IFN </italic>gene. In the mammalian lineage, this gene then underwent successive duplications to generate first the alpha and the beta interferons and then during the mammalian radiation, the numerous alpha <italic>IFN </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This key retroposition event has probably been associated with duplication of receptor genes that generated the <italic>IFNAR1 </italic>and <italic>IFNAR2 </italic>genes. The <italic>IFNAR1 </italic>gene that was present in amniote ancestors already had two D200 allowing the building of receptor complexes with different binding sites that could accommodate the diversification of the ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The "IL10 related cytokines" category is represented in Tetraodon by three genes with four phase 0 introns (<italic>IL10, 20 </italic>&#x00026;<italic>24</italic>). If some have extra-introns, all genes coding for IL10 related cytokines have the same four phase 0 introns. The high expression of the <italic>TnIL10 </italic>gene in the intestine (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) suggests that the encoded fish cytokine could play a role similar to that of mammalian IL10 whose function is to keep under strict control the balance between immune and inflammatory response especially in the bowels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly these two categories of HCII, despite having no similarity at the amino acid level, are both encoded by genes with exactly the same intron/exon structure. The four phase 0 introns fall at similar positions. This suggests that both genes derive from a common ancestor harboring the same four phase 0 introns. As in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, we therefore postulate that the ancestor for classII helical cytokine was encoded by a gene with this intron/exon structure. The first duplications would have taken place before the osteichtian radiation and would have generated the ancestral IFN and an ancestor for the IL10 related genes. The different lineages having then expanded this gene family by different means of retrotransposition and duplication. In this context, the gene for amniote type II IFN (gamma IFN) poses an interesting problem. It has only three phase 0 introns that correspond to the first three introns of both the ancestral IFN and IL10 related genes. Is it derived from an IFN gene or from an IL10 related gene? The location of the human IFN gamma gene on a cluster of classII cytokine genes including two other genes for the IL10 related cytokines (<italic>IL22 </italic>and <italic>IL26</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] suggests that it is in fact derived from an IL10 related gene. Despite the functional similarities of type I and type II IFNs, receptor binding characteristics of the dimeric forms of IL10 and IFN gamma also favor a closer relationship between these ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic drawing for the diversification of the helical cytokines and their receptors during the evolution of the osteichthians. </bold>Open boxes are for coding exons, black parts for 3' and 5' non coding regions.

It shows that the fine tuning of the main mechanisms for host defense against infections has been performed independently in the different vertebrate lineages. This is both true for the non specific antiviral defenses mediated by interferons and for the regulation of the immune response invented by ancestors of the gnathostomes in which IL10 related cytokines play a major role.</p><p>The question remains open of what happened in other vertebrate lineages, but the most fascinating question is the origin of this ligand/receptor system. Both genetic (intron/exon structures) and structural data (conserved amino acid positions and/or common 3D structures) argue in favor of a common ancestry for all classII ligand/receptor systems. The fascinating quest is now to find organisms that would have retained this single ancestral ligand/receptor pair and the central question will be: what is its function? In this perspective, the <italic>dome </italic>gene of drosophila is intriguing. Primary amino acid sequence clearly indicates that it harbors a D200 domain but the intron/exon structure is not that of the vertebrate <italic>HCR </italic>genes. The<italic>dome </italic>gene has one D200 domain plus FNIII repeats in its extracellular domain, but none of the canonical introns that border such domains in vertebrate genes is conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The <italic>dome </italic>gene has lost the intron/exon &#x000ab;memory&#x000bb;. Interestingly, it is the only invertebrate gene with a D200 described so far; the expansion of the HCR family has occurred only in vertebrates. The <italic>dome </italic>gene could therefore testify for the presence of an HCR ancestor in invertebrates. The first step in the diversification of this gene family in deuterostomes or chordates has therefore been the duplication to generate class I and class II ancestors. We have started the quest for these classI and classII ancestors by searching homologs of these genes in animal groups branching close to the vertebrate ancestors. In the genome of <italic>Ciona Intestinalis</italic>, we have found just two <italic>HCR </italic>genes, one coding for a classI and the other for a classII receptor. We have started experiments in order to determine in which biological functions they are involved.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fish samples and sequences</title><p><italic>T nigroviridis </italic>imported from Thailand (wild animals) or from Indonesia (breeders) were purchased at local dealers.
