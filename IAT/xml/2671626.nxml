In this study, T-DNA insertion mutants of the single-copy <italic>SPPA1</italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (At1g73990) were examined. Mutation of SPPA1 had no effect on the growth and development of plants under moderate, non-stressful conditions. It also did not affect the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis as measured by dark-adapted <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and light-adapted &#x003a6;<sub>PSII</sub>. Chloroplasts from <italic>sppA</italic> mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type. Loss of SPPA appears to affect photoprotective mechanisms during high light acclimation: mutant plants maintained a higher level of non-photochemical quenching of Photosystem II chlorophyll (<italic>NPQ</italic>) than the wild type, while wild-type plants accumulated more anthocyanin than the mutants. The quantum efficiency of Photosystem II was the same in all genotypes grown under low light, but was higher in wild type than mutants during high light acclimation. Further, the mutants retained the stress-related Early Light Inducible Protein (ELIP) longer than wild-type leaves during the early recovery period after acute high light plus cold treatment. These results suggest that SPPA1 may function during high light acclimation in the plastid, but is non-essential for growth and development under non-stress conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anthocyanin</kwd><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>high light acclimation</kwd><kwd>NPQ</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>SPPA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteases are essential for the development and function of all living organisms. They are responsible for processing, repair, and turnover of proteins and protein complexes in all compartments of the organism. Protease activity is tightly controlled either via protease expression, protease activation, or substrate accessibility. This research addresses the function of the plastid SPPA1 protease in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> L. (Heynh.).</p><p>Plastids contain at least 11 types of proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakamoto, 2006</xref>), which have been identified by biochemical and genetic analyses, proteomic analysis or by prediction from EST databases and expression profiling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam and Clarke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakamoto, 2006</xref>). All of the plastid proteases discovered to date have homologues in a bacterium, which reflects the bacterial origin of the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). They vary in location (envelope, stroma, lumen, or thylakoid-localized) and some of their functions are known (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam and Clarke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakamoto, 2006</xref>). Several of the best characterized plastid proteases are Clp, FtsH, Deg, and CND41. The SPPA1 protease is always relegated to the heading of &#x02018;other proteases&#x02019; in reviews on the subject, along with other proteases about which little is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ostersetzer <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>SPPA is an ATP-independent protease IV/serine-type endopeptidase. It was first described in eubacteria where it has a signal peptide peptidase activity, but is also found in viruses, archaea, and in the chloroplasts of photoautotrophic eukaryotes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sokolenko, 2005</xref>). The SPPA protease family contains two conserved potentially catalytic domains. In the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803, and many of the other heterotrophic and photoautotrophic bacteria, SppA has several isoforms that vary in the number of these domains they contain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sokolenko, 2005</xref>). In higher plants the two catalytic domains are retained in a single gene, <italic>SPPA1</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>SPPA</italic>), although the structure suggests that only one of the catalytic domains is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lensch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sokolenko, 2005</xref>). Higher-plant SPPA was first identified in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lensch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), but it is present in many other species. NCBI Unigene currently lists <italic>SPPA</italic> genes from 16 plant species and the putative catalytic sites are conserved (CM Wetzel, data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lensch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). This indicates that SPPA is ubiquitous in higher plants and is conserved, presumably because it has a purpose. Its function in chloroplasts is still unknown. Note that SPPA1 is structurally and functionally distinct from SPase1 (At2g30440, At1g06870, At3g24590), a known plastid thylakoid signal peptide peptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inoue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The SPPA protease was identified as a single copy gene in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (At1g73990). Its resultant protein is estimated at 680 amino acid residues to yield a 74.8 kDa product. After plastid import and post-translational processing the protein is approximately 66&#x02013;68 kDa in size. The chloroplast protease is anchored in the thylakoid membrane, enriched in stroma lamellae, but lacks transmembrane domains seen in its bacterial counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lensch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The <italic>SPPA</italic> mRNA is light-inducible in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, yet the protein is constitutively present suggesting post-translational control of protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lensch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). SPPA protein is easily detectable through immunoblotting during pre-induction, and experiences a 4-fold increase in abundance after a 52 h high light induction period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lensch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giacomelli <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> observed a dramatic increase in SPPA abundance in the proteome of high-light-stressed plants, and loss of ClpR2 resulted in reduced Clp complex accumulation and a 10-fold increase in SPPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rudella <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Its light dependence and response to the loss of Clp suggest a role in protein turnover in chloroplasts during light stress and thylakoid protein homeostasis.</p><p>When the amount of light energy absorbed by chlorophyll exceeds the capacity of the photochemical process, photoinhibition and/or irreversible photo-oxidative damage (photodamage) can occur in chloroplasts (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oelm&#x000fc;ller, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prasil <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Logan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barber and Andersson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aro <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mishra <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In the latter situation, singlet chlorophyll molecules remain in an excited state long enough to cause their transition to reactive triplet chlorophyll molecules. Damage to the chloroplast occurs when triplet chlorophyll reacts with oxygen, creating singlet oxygen radicals, which react with membrane lipids and proteins. Photoinhibition is a slowly reversible decrease in photosynthetic capacity primarily caused by repairable damage to the D1 polypeptide of Photosystem II (e.g. mediated by DegP2 and FtsH proteases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lindahl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hau&#x000df;&#x000fc;hl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and engagement of photoprotective energy quenching, while photodamage and bleaching is a more extreme, non-reversible condition of chloroplast destruction. Several systems have evolved to prevent and/or protect the chloroplast from photo-oxidative damage (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aro and Andersson, 2001</xref>). These include oxygen radical and peroxide-scavenging systems (ascorbate, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, etc), as well as scavengers of excess light energy (carotenoids). Any process that inhibits the use of absorbed light energy relative to its rate coming in will cause &#x02018;excitation pressure&#x02019; on the photosystem, that is, more light energy is absorbed than can be processed by photochemistry so the reaction centres become reduced or &#x02018;closed&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Temperature extremes, sub-optimal salt levels, heavy metals, and desiccation all contribute to inhibition of processes downstream of light absorption and can lead to photoinhibition and/or photodamage.</p><p>To determine if SPPA in chloroplasts plays a role in high light acclimation, two <italic>SPPA</italic> T-DNA insertional knockout lines were identified in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and the <italic>sppA</italic> mutant phenotypes were characterized under normal growth and high light stress conditions compared to wild-type plants. It was determined that under non-stress conditions, lack of SPPA had no appreciable effect on plant growth and development, but the mutants maintained a different level of non-photochemical quenching of Photosystem II (NPQ) than wild-type plants. Importantly, the lack of SPPA had little effect on plant response to short-term high-light treatment, but did alter the plant's response to longer-term high-light acclimation conditions compared to wild-type plants (measured by photoinhibition, early light-inducible protein, <italic>NPQ</italic>, chlorophylls, and anthocyanins).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>The <italic>A. thaliana SPPA</italic> gene sequence (At1g73990) was used to query the Salk SIGnAL T-DNA express gene mapping tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.signal.salk.edu">www.signal.salk.edu</ext-link>) and seeds for the potential knockout lines were ordered.

Dark- and light-adapted photosynthetic quantum efficiency was unaffected by loss of SPPA under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). This suggests that SPPA has no essential function under these conditions, or that there is another protease with functional redundancy that compensates for loss of SPPA. Despite the fact that SPPA may be part of a 270&#x02013;500 kDa complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lensch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Majeran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), its loss does not have any obvious deleterious effects.

Lack of an effect under moderate growth conditions led us to examine the effect of SPPA loss on plants under photoinhibitory stress during high light acclimation.</p><p>Acclimation of a plant to high light levels moderates potential high-light damage. It takes several days and causes changes in pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanins), leaf morphology, and thylakoid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka and Tanaka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ballottari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; Dall'Osto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007). In this study, loss of SPPA protease did not have an extreme effect on plant acclimation. However, it did alter the level of anthocyanin accumulation, which was lower in the mutants than in the wild-type plants after acclimation to high light. Stress-induced anthocyanin accumulation in vacuoles is a widespread phenomenon and there is experimental evidence for its role in photoprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Havaux and Kloppstech, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Merzlyak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Close and Beadle, 2003</xref>); however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esteban <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> found no correlation between foliar anthocyanin and photoprotection.

Results from this study suggest either that the wild-type plants experienced greater stress than the SPPA mutants leading to more anthocyanin accumulation, or that the mutants are unable to mount as great a response as the wild type when acclimating to high light.</p><p>Non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence results from excitation pressure on Photosystem II (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). It involves a response to the <italic>trans</italic>-thylakoid pH gradient, the xanthophyll cycle and other carotenoids, the PsbS protein, and other undefined aspects of photoinhibition. Therefore it was of great interest to observe that loss of SPPA resulted in higher-than-wild type levels of <italic>NPQ</italic> in response to increases in irradiance, under both ambient light and after acclimation to high light. Realized (light-adapted) quantum efficiency of Photosystem II was also affected by loss of SPPA in high-light grown plants, with mutants unable to maintain as high a Photosystem II quantum efficiency as the wild type when challenged with high measuring irradiance. It is not clear what component of <italic>NPQ</italic> or Photosystem II quantum efficiency is affected by SPPA, and is the subject of current study.</p><p>One might argue that the higher level of anthocyanin in WT plants partially blocked the induction of <italic>NPQ</italic> under high light by altering the light absorption properties of the leaves. This explanation loses support from the fact that the mutants had higher <italic>NPQ</italic> than WT even in pretreatment or low light growth conditions, when anthocyanin levels were low and equal between genotypes. Thus screening of incident light by anthocyanins is not a robust explanation for the difference in <italic>NPQ</italic> at high light levels. It may, however, contribute to the differences in realized Photosystem II quantum efficiency with mutant leaves losing efficiency due to less screening by anthocyanins.</p><p>In this study, when detached leaves from wild-type plants were subjected to high light in combination with cold temperatures they had an expected dramatic decrease in quantum yield as excitation pressure built up on Photosystem II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ivanov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). A mere 4 h of this treatment caused irreversible damage as demonstrated by severe loss of pigmentation and structural integrity of the leaves after their return to recovery conditions (not shown). However, the remaining functional tissue recovered quantum efficiency at the same rate, regardless of the presence or absence of SPPA. This result suggests that SPPA does not have a direct positive role in photoprotection under acute stress, i.e. its presence is not required for it, because if it was required then the mutants would be expected to be more susceptible to photoinhibitory stress than wild-type plants. The fact that all genotypes are equally susceptible to the stress suggests that SPPA function may be related more indirectly to one of the photoprotective mechanisms.</p><p>A related result was observed in cyanobacteria <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

Cells that lacked SppA did not undergo normal bleaching and loss of phycobilisomes when shifted from low to higher light, and retained more phycobilisome linker proteins. In fact, although the authors did not measure photosynthesis, they showed that mutant cells had more robust growth than the wild-type cells after the shift to high light conditions. The authors concluded that SppA was responsible for degradation of the linker proteins during normal high light acclimation and antennae size adjustment. Unfortunately, they did not provide evidence for direct interaction between SppA and the proposed substrate, so specificity of the protease activity cannot be concluded.</p><p>One class of proteins that has been proposed to play a role in photoprotection is &#x02018;early light inducible protein&#x02019; (ELIP). RNA hybridization, microarray, and cDNA analyses of plants subjected to diverse stimuli show that <italic>ELIP</italic> mRNA increases in abundance in response to more than just high light stress. These include treatment with salt, heat, abscisic acid, cold, desiccation, aluminium, high CO<sub>2</sub>, and senescence (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamska, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Binyamin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harari-Steinberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bhalerao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). ELIPs are part of a LHC superfamily that includes the light harvesting proteins, PsbS, HLIP, and Seps (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Montan&#x000e9; and Kloppstech, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamska, 2001</xref>).</p><p>A critical role for ELIPs in photoprotection was suggested in work done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hutin <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>. They used the <italic>chaos</italic> mutant of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, which lacks the cpSRP43 pathway of protein processing leading to a lack of ELIP import and accumulation. These mutants were more susceptible to photoinhibition than wild-type plants, and over-expression of ELIP in the <italic>chaos</italic> background rescued the mutants and afforded greater photoprotection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heddad <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> showed that ELIP1 location and the timing of accumulation correlate with the degree of Photosystem II photodamage, supporting a function in protection and/or the repair process. However, reports of work with ELIP1 and ELIP2 single and double T-DNA knockout <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casazza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rossini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) clearly demonstrated that ELIP is not essential for photoprotection, as the mutants were just as capable of responding to high light stress as the wild-type plants. The double mutants did show a slight pigmentation phenotype, with lower levels of chlorophyll and slightly altered xanthophyll ratios. These apparently incongruous sets of results may be interpreted as in agreement if one assumes that the <italic>chaos</italic> mutant is impaired in more than just ELIP processing, thus a lack of ELIP along with other undefined components led to increased susceptibility to photoinhibition that was compensated for by ELIP over-expression. The more-specific ELIP double knockout plants may have experienced compensation by other photoprotective mechanisms that were impaired or overwhelmed in the <italic>chaos</italic> mutant, i.e. over-expression of a photoprotective component may lead to increased photoprotection, but eliminating one photoprotective component may just lead to compensation by other mechanisms. The picture of ELIP function becomes more complicated by the fact that ELIP2 overexpression in wild-type <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leads to a decrease in chlorophyll and photosystem accumulation, and concomitant down-regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tzvetkova-Chevolleau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Clearly, further investigation of the exact function of ELIPs is required.</p><p>The SPPA mutants in this study did not show the wild-type pattern of ELIP1 degradation after acute high light stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adamska <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1996</xref>). When wild-type leaves are returned from HL to LL, ELIP1 abundance drops after 3&#x02013;5 h recovery time. By contrast, SPPA mutant leaves retain high levels of ELIP1. Note that none of the genotypes had detectable ELIP1 or ELIP2 in pretreatment leaves, thus SPPA mutants are not constitutively expressing ELIP, only retaining it longer than the wild type after a stress event. This suggests a role for ELIP in recovery from HL stress instead of in the process itself, because all three genotypes had comparable amounts of ELIP during the stress period yet had very different early post-stress recovery phenotypes. From this study it cannot be determined if there is a direct protease&#x02013;substrate interaction between SPPA and ELIP. If SPPA can proteolyse ELIP, it must do so in concert with another protease because, after 24 h of post-HL recovery, ELIP levels are undetectable in mutant as well as wild-type leaves. Lack of SPPA could generate a general stress level that maintains ELIP; for example, preacclimation to moderate stress can increase a plant's protection from photoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Further assays are being carried out to address these questions, as well as to examine the phenotypes of intact plants under longer-term acclimation to moderate high light. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Havaux and Kloppstech (2001)</xref> found the opposite pattern in a mutant deficient in the xanthophyll cycle (<italic>npq1</italic>). It had inhibited <italic>NPQ</italic> and accumulated more anthocyanins than wild-type plants. During long-term acclimation, ELIP was induced, but disappeared in the <italic>npq1</italic>mutant and remained stable in wild-type plants.</p><p>In summary, T-DNA insertional mutagenesis of the single-copy <italic>SPPA</italic> gene in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> had no measurable effect on growth and development under stable, optimal conditions. Lack of SPPA did not affect the ability of detached leaves to recover from acute high light plus cold stress, but did cause a delay in the degradation of ELIP relative to wild-type leaves after the stress abated. Loss of SPPA appears to cause an altered balance between two photoprotective mechanisms during high light acclimation: mutant plants maintained a higher level of <italic>NPQ</italic>, while wild-type plants accumulated more anthocyanin.
