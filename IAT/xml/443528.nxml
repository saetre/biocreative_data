This requires the action of DNA damage sensors such as the Rad family proteins. The three human proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a heterotrimeric complex (called the 9-1-1 complex) that is recruited onto DNA upon damage. DNA damage also triggers the recruitment of DNA repair proteins at the lesion, including specialized DNA polymerases.

Functional analysis revealed that the 9-1-1 complex had a stimulatory effect on DNA polymerase &#x003b2; activity.

Activation of these checkpoints requires the action of DNA damage sensors and transducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c1">1</xref>) such as ATM, ATR, ATRIP, Rad17, Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1. The three human proteins hRad9, hRad1 and hHus1 form a heterotrimeric complex (9-1-1 complex) which exhibits structural similarity with the homotrimeric clamp formed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c5">5</xref>). In addition, hRad17 associates with the four small subunits of the heteropentameric replication factor C complex (RF-C) in a manner similar to the RF-C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c7">7</xref>). Several studies showed that the 9-1-1 complex and Rad17-RF-C<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub> function as a clamp&#x0002f;clamp&#x02013;loader pair, similarly to PCNA and RF-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c11">11</xref>). Moreover, the 9-1-1 complex, Rad17-RF-C<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub> and PCNA co-localize in foci formed upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c14">14</xref>). These data suggested a mechanism in which Rad17-RF-C<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub> would recognize DNA lesions, allowing the recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex to these sites. ATM and ATR kinases are recruited simultaneously at the same sites of DNA damage but in a 9-1-1 complex and Rad17-RF-C<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub> independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c18">18</xref>). The proposed mechanism is that the 9-1-1 complex may serve as a recruiting platform for the checkpoint effector kinases such as Chk1 or Chk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c20">20</xref>), that are subsequently phosphorylated by the ATR&#x0002f;ATM kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c1">1</xref>). According to the currently accepted model, the 9-1-1 complex is present where the action of DNA repair has to take place, suggesting the possibility that it may play a direct role in subsequent stages of the DNA repair processes.</p><p>Following recognition by DNA damage sensors, the lesions are processed by multiprotein complexes specialized in different DNA repair pathways such as base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), double-strand break repair (DSBR) or mismatch repair (MMR). An essential component of these machineries are DNA polymerases (pols) that are needed to synthesize DNA during the DNA repair processes. In human cells, pol &#x003b2;, which belongs to the pol X family, is the major repair pol, and it is essential for the BER pathway. Pol &#x003b2; preferentially uses shortly gapped DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c21">21</xref>), performs strand displacement synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c22">22</xref>) and also possesses a 5&#x02032; dRP lyase activity which is essential for completion of BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c25">25</xref>). Moreover, pol &#x003b2; is able to bypass <italic>in vitro</italic> several types of DNA lesions like apurinic (AP) sites, cisplatin (cis-Pt) adducts or cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesions, albeit with a relatively low efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c29">29</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which DNA repair occurs are now beginning to be unraveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c30">30</xref>). Likewise, the way cells trigger the DNA damage checkpoints is also starting to be depicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c1">1</xref>). However, the link between checkpoint engagement and the recruitment to DNA lesions of pols involved in repair machineries is far from being understood. In view of its localization onto DNA lesions, the 9-1-1 checkpoint complex could be a potential candidate for the role of &#x02018;recruiting platform&#x02019; for DNA repair effectors. In this context, recent studies have shown interaction or co-localization of the 9-1-1 complex with proteins involved in various DNA repair processes upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c32">32</xref>). In order to address further the link between checkpoint proteins and DNA repair, we tested the possibility of a physical and functional interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with the main repair pol, pol &#x003b2;.</p><p>In this work we present evidence that the 9-1-1 complex directly interacts with and stimulates pol &#x003b2; activity, by increasing its affinity for the 3&#x02032;-OH primer end, resulting in an increase of nucleotide misincorporation without affecting the efficiency of correct nucleotide incorporation. In addition, we show that the 9-1-1 complex enhances DNA strand displacement synthesis by pol &#x003b2; on a 1 nt gap DNA substrate. Our results are discussed in the view of a possible role of the 9-1-1 complex in recruiting pol &#x003b2; to DNA damage sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>[<sup>3</sup>H]dTTP (40 Ci&#x0002f;mmol) and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP (3000 Ci&#x0002f;mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences; unlabeled dNTPs, poly(dA) and oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub> were from Roche Biochemicals.

To address this question, we first incubated purified His-pol &#x003b2; with Sf9 cell extracts expressing the 9-1-1 complex. From these extracts, anti-Rad9 immunoprecipitation by using a polyclonal anti-Rad9 antibody was carried out. Western blot analysis showed that Rad9 was immunoprecipitated, and that Rad1, Hus1 and pol &#x003b2; were all co-immunoprecipitated with Rad9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f1">1</xref>A). Second, a GST-pulldown experiment was performed after incubation of the purified 9-1-1 complex with GST-tagged pol &#x003b2; or with GST alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f1">1</xref>B). Western blot analysis against Rad1 and Hus1 showed a specific coprecipitation of Rad1 and Hus1 with GST&#x02013;pol &#x003b2; but not with GST. Third, we tested which of the monomers were directly involved in this interaction. We performed a GST-pulldown experiment after incubation of GST-tagged pol &#x003b2; or GST alone with Sf9 cell extracts overexpressing either Rad1 or Hus1 separately. Western blot analysis revealed a specific direct interaction of Rad1 and Hus1 with GST&#x02013;pol &#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f1">1</xref>C). These results were further confirmed when a GST pulldown of GSTRad1 and GSTHus1 with His-tagged pol &#x003b2; was performed (data not shown). Fourth, we performed an anti-Rad9 immunoprecipitation after incubation of His-tagged pol &#x003b2; with Sf9 cell extracts overexpressing only Rad9. Coprecipitation of pol &#x003b2; with Rad9 showed that these two proteins also interact (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f1">1</xref>D). Finally, in view of our data that pol &#x003b2; could independently interact with the three 9-1-1 complex monomers, a gel filtration analysis was performed with pol &#x003b2; and the 9-1-1 complex. As shown on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f1">1</xref>E, an additional activity peak eluting with the 9-1-1 complex ahead of pol &#x003b2; alone could be detected. A control elution of the 9-1-1 complex alone showed that the purified 9-1-1 complex does not contain any contaminating polymerase activity that may account for this activity peak. Western blot analysis against Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 confirmed that the additional pol &#x003b2; peak co-eluted in the earliest fractions containing the three Rad proteins. This suggested that a high molecular weight complex containing pol &#x003b2; and the 9-1-1complex was formed. In summary, these data suggested that pol &#x003b2; can form a complex with the 9-1-1 complex, and that this interaction appears to be mediated by each of the three monomers.</p></sec><sec><title>The 9-1-1 complex specifically stimulates DNA polymerase &#x003b2; activity</title><p>In order to check whether the physical interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with pol &#x003b2; had a functional relevance, we next analyzed the effect of the 9-1-1 complex on pol &#x003b2; activity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA polymerization assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>, the 9-1-1 complex was able to stimulate pol &#x003b2; activity in an acid precipitable assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>A) whereas it did not affect nucleotide incorporation by pol &#x003bb;, another X family pol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>B). Next, to confirm this finding, the elongation products synthesized by these two pols were visualized on polyacrylamide denaturing gel. For this, elongation of a d17:d73mer primer&#x02013;template by pol &#x003b2; and pol &#x003bb; was carried out in the absence or in the presence of either the 9-1-1 complex or PCNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>C, lanes 1 to 6). A distinct increase in pol-&#x003b2;-mediated elongation of the primer was observed in the presence of 9-1-1 complex (lane 2), whereas PCNA did not affect pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis (lane 3), as expected from the data in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c22">22</xref>). On the other hand, pol &#x003bb; activity was not affected by the presence of the 9-1-1 complex and even a slight decrease in the products length was observed (lane 5). PCNA did not stimulate pol &#x003bb; activity under distributive conditions (lane 6) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c43">43</xref>). In order to investigate further the specificity of the 9-1-1 complex effect on pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis, we next analyzed the ability of 9-1-1 to stimulate replicative pols. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>C, the 9-1-1 complex did not affect either pol &#x003b1; or pol &#x003b4; elongation patterns under the tested conditions (lanes 8 and 11). As expected, PCNA had no effect on pol &#x003b1; activity but allowed pol &#x003b4; to synthesize full-length products (lanes 9 and 12). Lanes 13 to 15 show that neither the 9-1-1 complex nor PCNA contained intrinsic pol activity. Taken together these data show a specific stimulation of pol &#x003b2; by the 9-1-1 complex.</p></sec><sec><title>The 9-1-1 complex does not influence the processivity of DNA polymerase &#x003b2;</title><p>To further investigate the mechanism of pol &#x003b2; stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex, we analyzed its effect on the time course incorporation of pol &#x003b2; on the d17:d73 primer&#x02013;template under distributive and processive conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f3">3</xref>). Under distributive conditions, pol &#x003b2; alone was not able to synthesize full length products even after 20 min incubation, and the majority of the products stopped at a strong termination site around position 60, where a G-rich sequence is present (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f3">3</xref>A). In the presence of the 9-1-1 complex, however, the termination site was overcome and full length products accumulated within the first 5 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f3">3</xref>B). In agreement with the data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>C, the DNA synthesis rate appeared to be enhanced by the 9-1-1 complex (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f3">3</xref>A and B). Next, the same analysis was performed under processive conditions [presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled poly(dA)&#x02013;oligo(dT) as a trap]. Under these conditions, all the pol &#x003b2; products terminated at the strong pausing site around position 60 both in the absence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f3">3</xref>C) and in the presence of the 9-1-1 complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>D). While at early time points (1 and 2 min), the length of the products was higher in the presence of 9-1-1 complex, at later time points the maximal length of products in the presence of 9-1-1 complex was similar to the maximal length observed in its absence. However, when the 9-1-1 complex was present, intermediate products accumulated, suggesting that pol &#x003b2; can reinitiate synthesis more efficiently under these conditions. These data indicate that the stimulation of pol &#x003b2; by the 9-1-1 complex is not achieved via a substantial increase of its processivity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The 9-1-1 complex stimulates DNA polymerase &#x003b2; activity by increasing its primer utilization efficiency, but does not affect its nucleotide incorporation efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>)</title><p>The stimulatory effect of the 9-1-1 complex on pol &#x003b2; might be due either to an increased nucleotide incorporation, or to an increased affinity of the pol for the DNA primer template. To address this question, we next measured the initial velocities of the reaction catalyzed by pol &#x003b2;, using poly(dA)&#x02013;oligo(dT) as a primer&#x0002f;template, in the absence or the presence of increasing amounts of the 9-1-1 complex. This allowed the determination of the apparent affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) and the catalytic rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) values for the 3&#x02032;-OH primer end at each concentration of the 9-1-1 complex. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f4">4</xref>A, the apparent affinity of pol &#x003b2; for the 3&#x02032;-OH primer end was increased in the presence of 9-1-1 complex, as indicated by the decrease of the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f4">4</xref>B, the 9-1-1 complex also induced a dose-dependent increase of the efficiency of primer utilization (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio) of pol &#x003b2;. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f3">3</xref>C the variation of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> [&#x00394;(<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>)] was plotted as a function of the 9-1-1 complex concentration. The curve was fitted to a hyperbolic equation that allowed estimating an apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for the pol &#x003b2;&#x0002f;9-1-1 complex interaction of 26 nM.</p><p>Since the 9-1-1 complex appears to stimulate pol &#x003b2; synthesis by increasing its affinity for the 3&#x02032;-OH primer end, we next wanted to determine if it also affects its nucleotide incorporation efficiency. For this purpose, we performed experiments similar to the ones described above, but by varying the dTTP concentrations. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values of pol &#x003b2; for dTTP were determined in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of 9-1-1 complex. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f4">4</xref>D, the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) was not affected by the presence of 9-1-1 complex. Taken together, these results suggested that the 9-1-1 complex stimulates pol &#x003b2; activity by increasing its primer&#x02013;template utilization efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>The 9-1-1 complex increases misincorporation by DNA polymerase &#x003b2; in different sequence contexts</title><p>Next, we determined whether the presence of the 9-1-1 complex has an effect on the misincorporation ability of pol &#x003b2;. For this, we used a 60mer template annealed to different primers allowing DNA incorporation to start by a T (d14:d60<sub>a</sub>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>A), an A (d15:d60<sub>a</sub>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>B), a C (d16:d60<sub>a</sub>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>C) or a G (d17:d60<sub>a</sub>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>D). The left panels of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;D show that pol &#x003b2; alone was capable of limited misincorporation depending on the sequence context. Misincorporation could be observed when DNA synthesis started opposite C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>D, left panel) and when incorporation started opposite G (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>C, left panel). No misincorporation was seen when DNA synthesis started opposite A or T (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>A and B, left panels). As expected, elongation products up to 27&#x02013;30 nt length were observed in the presence of all four dNTPs with all the primer&#x02013;template pairs tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;D, left panels). In the presence of the 9-1-1 complex an increase in misincorporation by pol &#x003b2; could be observed, with all four primer&#x02013;template pairs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;D, right panels), but mainly opposite G and C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>C and D, right panels). As it can be seen, the addition of 9-1-1 complex caused an increase of the products length to about 45 nt in the presence of the four dNTPs with all the four tested primers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;D, right panels). Using longer exposure times, products corresponding to full-length synthesis were also detected (data not shown). According to these results, the 9-1-1 complex, under conditions allowing incorporation of only one of the four desoxynucleotides, apparently led to increased misincorporation by pol &#x003b2;. In view of the fact that the 9-1-1 complex did not affect the nucleotide incorporation efficiency by pol &#x003b2;, this misincorporation effect is likely to be due to an increased stability of the pol &#x003b2;&#x0002f;primer complex in the presence of the 9-1-1 complex.</p></sec><sec><title>The 9-1-1 complex stimulates the strand displacement synthesis by DNA polymerase &#x003b2; on a 1 nt gap DNA template</title><p>Subsequently we tested the effect of the 9-1-1 complex using a 1 nt gap template as a substrate for pol &#x003b2; (represented on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f6">6</xref>A). Such a template mimics BER intermediates that are substrates for pol &#x003b2; gap filling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f6">6</xref>B shows the products synthesized by pol &#x003b2; on this BER substrate. Each of the four dNTPs was tested separately or all together. Pol &#x003b2; was able to incorporate the correct nucleotide, dCTP, opposite to the free nucleotide position. Furthermore, in the presence of the four dNTPs pol &#x003b2; showed strand displacement DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c22">22</xref>), and replicated the template up to position &#x0002b;19. In the presence of the 9-1-1 complex (70 nM), however, an increase in incorporation of dCTP at position &#x0002b;1 was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f6">6</xref>C). A slight misincorporation of dATP was also detected, which corresponded to the main misincorporation observed opposite a G when a classical primer&#x02013;template oligonucleotide was used (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>C, right panel). When all four dNTPs were present, the 9-1-1 complex enhanced strand displacement DNA synthesis by pol &#x003b2; and mainly full length products were observed. These results suggest that the 9-1-1 complex can enhance strand displacement DNA synthesis by pol &#x003b2; on a1 nt gap DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The 9-1-1 complex has been shown to be recruited onto DNA following DNA damage as an early step of the checkpoint cascades. Its structural similarity to PCNA suggested that it might act as an alternative sliding clamp for certain pols, such as repair pols.</p><p>In this paper, we showed that the 9-1-1 complex and pol &#x003b2; can directly interact and form a complex <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f1">1</xref>A&#x02013;C), and that all three monomers were able to directly interact with pol &#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f1">1</xref>C and D). The 9-1-1 complex specifically stimulated pol &#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>) whereas it did neither stimulate pol &#x003bb;, nor the replicative pol &#x003b1; and &#x003b4;. The 9-1-1 complex did not act as a processivity factor for pol &#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f3">3</xref>) but significantly increased its efficiency of primer utilization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f4">4</xref>A&#x02013;C). This mechanism looks rather similar to the one observed for PCNA mediated pol &#x003b5; stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c44">44</xref>). An estimation of the apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for the pol &#x003b2;&#x0002f;9-1-1 complex interaction gave a value of 26 nM, consistent with the affinities determined for PCNA and pol &#x003b4; or &#x003b5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c45">45</xref>), thus providing additional evidence for the physiological relevance of this effect. Addition of the 9-1-1 complex also resulted in an increase of single nucleotide misincorporation by pol &#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f5">5</xref>), which could be a consequence of the observed polymerase stabilization at the 3&#x02032;-OH end by the complex. Subsequently, using a substrate mimicking a BER intermediate (1 nt gap primer&#x02013;template), a stimulation of pol &#x003b2; strand displacement synthesis in the presence of the 9-1-1 complex was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f6">6</xref>B). This substrate not only mimics one of the repair intermediates occurring during BER, but gapped double-stranded DNA has also been shown to be the preferred substrate for loading of the 9-1-1 complex by Rad17-RFC<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c10">10</xref>). We also found that PCNA was unable to stimulate pol &#x003b2; in its elongation of a primer template (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh652f2">2</xref>C, lane 6) and it had no effect on misincorporation by pol &#x003b2; or its strand displacement synthesis on a 1 nt gap template (data not shown). Hence, in spite of recent evidence that PCNA interacts with pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c46">46</xref>), the increase in pol &#x003b2; affinity for the primer appears to be specific to the 9-1-1 checkpoint complex, rather than clamp-structure-dependent.</p><p>From the data presented here, we propose that the 9-1-1 checkpoint complex might have a direct implication in BER. In fact, the 9-1-1 complex increased the affinity of pol &#x003b2; for the 3&#x02032;-OH end of the primer. This suggests that, once loaded onto sites of DNA damage, the 9-1-1 complex may attract and stabilize pol &#x003b2; to those sites where BER proceeds. Our data are in good agreement with a model very recently proposed by two different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c11">11</xref>) where the 9-1-1 complex and the Rad17-RF-C<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub> clamp loader stabilize stalled replication forks. We propose an analogous mechanism where the 9-1-1 complex could exert a stabilization effect in BER.</p><p>Furthermore, the specificity of the functional interaction between the clamp and the pol suggests that it may act as a selection mechanism, recruiting and stimulating a particular pol where its activity is needed. Finally, strand displacement synthesis stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex could increase the efficiency of pol &#x003b2; in long patch BER, where pol &#x003b2; strand displacement synthesis is effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c47">47</xref>).</p><p>It remains to be assessed whether the Rad17-RFC<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub> clamp loader would also have an influence on the observed pol &#x003b2;&#x0002f;9-1-1 interaction. However, analogy between the two clamp&#x0002f;clamp-loader pairs 9-1-1&#x0002f;Rad17-RFC<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub> and PCNA&#x0002f;RF-C has been demonstrated by several groups, and the 9-1-1 complex is able to slide freely on DNA similarly to PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c11">11</xref>). In the case of the PCNA&#x0002f;RF-C pair, it has been shown that the main function of RF-C is to load PCNA onto DNA, without influencing PCNA affinity for the cognate pol &#x003b4; and &#x003b5;. Indeed, in the case of PCNA, the determination of its mechanism of stimulation of pol &#x003b4; and &#x003b5; were performed mainly in the absence of RF-C, in order to avoid interference of RF-C binding to single-strand DNA or to the primer terminus, in competition with the pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c51">51</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we would like to stress that our data, given the simplicity of the experimental system used, do not pretend to reflect the complexity of the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, but rather aimed to highlight what appears to be an intrinsic property of the 9-1-1 complex, namely its ability to interact with and stimulate pol &#x003b2;.</p><p>In summary we propose that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the 9-1-1 complex located at DNA lesions may participate to the recruitment not only of checkpoint effectors for ATM&#x0002f;ATR kinases phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh652c18">18</xref>) but also of DNA repair factors, such as pol &#x003b2;. However, our first attempts to co-immunoprecipitate pol &#x003b2; together with the 9-1-1 complex from cells under normal growth conditions have been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, the 9-1-1 complex has been shown to be recruited onto chromatin only under genotoxic stress conditions. According to this observation, it is conceivable that the interaction between the 9-1-1 complex and pol &#x003b2; may occur in response to DNA damage events, which may explain the absence of a 9-1-1&#x0002f;pol &#x003b2; complex in untreated cells. Consequently, it will be crucial to identify the genotoxic stress conditions, which induce this interaction in cells, and to elucidate the role of the 9-1-1 complex in BER.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh652f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> DNA polymerase &#x003b2; physically interacts with the 9-1-1 complex.
