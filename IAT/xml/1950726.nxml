A major activation of zygotic transcription occurs together with degradation of maternal mRNAs during the midblastula transition in several vertebrate systems. How these processes are regulated in preparation for the onset of differentiation in the vertebrate embryo is mostly unknown. Here, we studied the function of TATA-binding protein (TBP) by knock down and DNA microarray analysis of gene expression in early embryo development. We show that a subset of polymerase II-transcribed genes with ontogenic stage-dependent regulation requires TBP for their zygotic activation. TBP is also required for limiting the activation of genes during development. We reveal that TBP plays an important role in the degradation of a specific subset of maternal mRNAs during late blastulation/early gastrulation, which involves targets of the miR-430 pathway. Hence, TBP acts as a specific regulator of the key processes underlying the transition from maternal to zygotic regulation of embryogenesis. These results implicate core promoter recognition as an additional level of differential gene regulation during development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>maternal mRNA</kwd><kwd>MBT</kwd><kwd>TBP</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most animal models, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the onset of zygotic gene activation is delayed until the midblastula transition (MBT). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kimmel <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). Whereas there is no MBT in mammals, here zygotic gene activity is also delayed after fertilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). In the zebrafish blastula, the general delay in zygotic gene activity is followed by the sudden and broad activation of a large number of genes representing all main gene ontologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kane and Kimmel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mathavan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) leading to gastrulation. The activation of the zygotic genome is parallelled by an equally significant process, the differential degradation of maternally inherited mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mathavan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">De Renzis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Whereas little is known about the mechanisms of degradation of maternal mRNA, they are known to involve both transcription-dependent and -independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bashirullah <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Audic <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schier, 2007</xref>). Dynamic changes in expression of maternally and zygotically activated genes are observed during zygotic gene activation also in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Not all maternally inherited mRNAs degrade during early embryogenesis and many maternal mRNAs continue to influence embryo development until later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Wagner <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Pelegri (2003)</xref>).</p><p>The initiation of zygotic transcription during MBT is believed to be regulated by a competition between chromatin and the assembly of the transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kimelman <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>). The TATA-binding protein (TBP) has been implicated as a key regulator of transcription initiation in early embryo development in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Veenstra <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Martianov <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). TBP protein levels have been shown to be limiting for transcription before MBT and are dramatically upregulated at the initiation of zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Prioleau <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Veenstra <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">B&#x000e1;rtfai <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). TBP, together with TBP-associated factors (TAFs) are components of the TFIID complex, a key point at which activators can control transcription through the core promoter. Until recently, it was argued that TBP is required for the correct initiation of all RNA polymerase (Pol I, II and III)-mediated transcription in eukaryotes. However, recent reports have revealed the contrary: the composition of Pol II core promoter-binding complexes varies and is likely to represent a point of differential gene expression regulation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Davidson (2003)</xref>). Consistently, whereas TBP is essential for early embryo development, it is not required for all Pol II transcription as demonstrated by studies on a small number of vertebrate genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Veenstra <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Martianov <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The apparent redundancy of TBP in vertebrates is probably due to the function of TBP-like factors (TLF/TRF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Veenstra <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) and the recently described second set of TBP paralogue genes TBP2/TRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Persengiev <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">B&#x000e1;rtfai <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jallow <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The functional requirement for different TBP family proteins in embryogenesis suggests specific nonoverlapping roles for these factors in regulating subsets of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Moore <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Teichmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">B&#x000e1;rtfai <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jallow <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our objective was to investigate the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that involve core promoter recognition proteins such as TBP in the whole organism. The transition of gene activity from maternally inherited mRNAs to zygotic gene expression provides an ideal model for the analysis of the control of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>). By using Morpholino (MO) knockdown and microarray expression profiling, we have addressed which genes require TBP for their activity and what is the function of TBP in regulating the transition from maternal to zygotic regulation during early vertebrate embryo development. We show that TBP is preferentially required for genes that exhibit dynamic changes in their expression during ontogeny. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a previously undocumented negative regulatory role of TBP in zygotic gene activation. Importantly, we also describe a novel biological function of TBP: a role in the degradation of a subset of maternal mRNAs after MBT.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>TBP regulates specifically a subset of mRNAs in the dome-stage embryo</title><p>In the early embryo, the steady-state levels of mRNA result from a dynamic process of gradual degradation of maternal mRNAs and the delayed initiation of zygotic gene expression at the MBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the role of TBP in regulating genes expressed in the early zebrafish embryo, we carried out a microarray analysis of 10 501 genes at the dome stage in embryos in which TBP function was blocked using MO antisense oligonucleotides as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). The dome stage occurs 1.3 h after the start of the global initiation of zygotic transcription at the MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kane and Kimmel, 1993</xref>) and any TBP-dependent changes in gene activity detected at this stage are still expected to be mostly direct transcriptional effects. Loss of protein was confirmed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). A total of 1927 genes from the 10 501 represented on the microarray were selected, having applied stringent but commonly used criteria (FDR cut off of 0.05) to eliminate potential false positives and false negatives from the analysis (see Materials and methods). Three distinct response groups of genes were identified: downregulated genes (&#x02a7d;&#x02212;2-fold change), genes with low variability in expression (values between &#x0003e;&#x02212;2 and &#x0003c;&#x0002b;2-fold-change); upregulated genes (&#x02a7e;&#x0002b;2-fold change) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>). The three groups thus identified were further validated by semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR experiments; out of a total of 39 genes representing the above groups, 37 showed comparable activity to that observed in the microarray experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The specificity of the effects detected was confirmed by microinjecting a second MO targeting TBP mRNA (TBP MO2), which resulted in comparable gene expression changes to the above TBP MO injection when analysed by RT&#x02013;PCR of 28 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, the gene expression changes caused by TBP MO injection could be reverted by injecting a form of TBP mRNA that could not be targeted by the MO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>Within the 1927 genes that were used for this analysis, a large proportion of genes expressed in the dome-stage embryo (65.3&#x00025;) showed no significant difference in signal strength between TBP MO- and control MO (c MO)-injected embryos, indicating that their steady-state mRNA levels are independent of TBP function. A smaller group of genes showed a significant reduction of expression demonstrating that these genes require TBP directly or indirectly for their activation (17.5&#x00025;). A similar number of genes (17.1&#x00025;) showed increased levels of transcripts in TBP MO injected embryos, suggesting that TBP is required for controlling their steady-state levels by reducing their transcription and/or by enhancing mRNA degradation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Most TBP-activated genes are dynamically regulated during zebrafish ontogeny</title><p>To characterise further the genes affected by loss of TBP function, we tested whether genes in the three response groups described above showed discrete expression dynamics during zebrafish ontogeny. To this end, we compared the data set described above to an ontogenic stage-dependent expression profiling experiment on the zebrafish transcriptome (Konantz M, Otto G-W, Weller C, Saric M, Geisler R. Microarray analysis of gene expression in zebrafish development, manuscript in preparation). The two gene sets share 717 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D and E</xref>) and the proportions of the three TBP morphant response groups among these 717 genes are similar to those of the total TBP microarray data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C and E</xref>).</p><p>Meta-analysis of the ontogenic stage-dependent gene expression array was carried out to define two classes of genes. Genes showing stage specific peaks of expression activity during zebrafish ontogeny were classified as &#x02018;stage-dependent' and genes that showed no significant variation in gene expression during ontogeny were considered as constitutively active genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>, see Materials and methods). Nearly half of the 717 genes (46.9&#x00025;) that overlap between the two microarray data sets were shown to be constitutively expressed genes. The remaining genes belonged to the stage-dependent class (53.1&#x00025;) showing dynamic activity during zebrafish ontogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>Applying the &#x02018;constitutive versus stage-dependent' classification to the TBP microarray gene response groups revealed that genes that require TBP for their activation were predominantly stage-dependent (77&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>), whereas upregulated genes in TBP morphants showed the opposite tendency. The low-variable group of genes did not show a bias to either stage-dependent or constitutively expressed genes. These results indicate that TBP-dependent activation tends to be a property of genes that show dynamic activity during ontogeny. Moreover, TBP tends to negatively regulate steady-state levels of constitutively active genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TBP dependence of transcription from isolated zebrafish promoters</title><p>TBP could influence steady-state levels of mRNA in zebrafish embryos both through transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional processes. To address the former, we tested 23 GFP constructs using promoters of zebrafish genes expressed at the sphere/dome-stage and representing various gene ontology classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">O'Boyle <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). TBP-dependent promoter activation was evident for seven promoters, including the <italic>otx1</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>). This result is consistent with the proposed role of TBP in activating zygotic transcription of many genes during development. On the other hand, 12 promoters, including the <italic>apoeb</italic> gene promoter, did not show significant changes of activity upon loss of TBP function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). TBP independence of <italic>apoeb</italic> transcription was further confirmed by its mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) and the utilisation of its TSS (data not shown) in TBP morphants. No correlation was found between known promoter motifs (such as TATA boxes, CpG islands, etc.) and TBP response (data not shown).</p><p>Several promoters (4 out of 23) showed a clear increase of promoter activity upon loss of TBP, including the 1.4-kb promoter of the <italic>tbp</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). This finding suggests negative regulatory role of TBP on the <italic>tbp</italic> gene promoter and is in line with the inverse correlation between <italic>tbp</italic> mRNA and TBP protein levels at the late blastula and early gastrula stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">B&#x000e1;rtfai <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4D</xref>). Co-injection of a synthetic TBP MO-resistant <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<italic>x</italic>) <italic>tbp</italic> mRNA, but not of bacterial <italic>IS30 transposase</italic> control mRNA rescued the epiboly movements of the animal cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C&#x02013;F</xref>, bright field view) and <italic>tbp:yfp</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C&#x02013;F</xref>, fluorescence views). Finally, the injection of TBP MO2 resulted in comparable effects to TBP MO both in blocking epiboly movements and in the increased activity of the <italic>tbp:yfp</italic> promoter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results demonstrate that the specific loss of TBP protein is the reason for the observed upregulation of the <italic>tbp</italic> promoter in TBP MO-injected embryos.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TBP is required for degradation of a large number of maternal mRNAs</title><p>It is known that degradation of many maternal mRNAs involves zygotic transcription-dependent mechanisms, which may be specifically regulated by TBP. Thus, the steady-state levels of maternal mRNAs may appear increased in TBP morphants. To test if the inhibition of the degradation of maternal mRNA occurs in TBP morphants, we searched for maternally expressed genes in the TBP morphant microarray gene sets.</p><p>We classified genes as being maternal or zygotic through another microarray experiment utilizing mRNA pre- and post-MBT; those showing a decrease of mRNA levels from pre- to post-MBT (MBT down) were classified as prevalently maternal and vice versa (MBT up) for prevalently zygotic ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables III</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">IV</xref>).

The overlap showed that maternal mRNAs were enriched among the upregulated genes of TBP morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>, MBT down) and the inverse was observed for zygotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>, MBT up). A side by side hierarchical clustering analysis of gene activity fold changes in the MBT experiment versus the TBP MO experiment demonstrates further the inverse correlation between the levels of mRNAs before or after MBT as compared to mRNA levels in TBP morphants versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>We further verified our findings by intersecting the TBP MO microarray experiment with an independent set of 622 maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mathavan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), which resulted in an overlap of 143 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table V</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that the upregulation of genes observed in TBP morphants could be in large part due to the specific loss of degradation of many maternal mRNAs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of TBP-dependent maternal transcripts</title><p>To validate the predicted involvement of TBP in the degradation of maternal mRNAs, we investigated the fate of individual maternal mRNAs. <italic>Zorba</italic> is a maternally expressed gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bally-Cuif <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), which is upregulated 2.51-fold in TBP MO embryos.

In contrast, in TBP morphant embryos, <italic>zorba</italic> mRNA levels showed similar levels throughout early development, consistent with the assumption that degradation of maternal mRNA was impaired. We verified that the lack of degradation of <italic>zorba</italic> mRNA in TBP morphants was not due to a general delay in embryo development by observing the expression of two zygotically expressed genes: the TBP-independent gene <italic>no tail</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Schulte-Merker <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>), which correctly initiated transcription after the sphere stage in TBP morphants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>); and the TBP-dependent <italic>goosecoid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Schulte-Merker <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>), whose activity was lost in TBP morphants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>).

Not all maternal mRNAs were degraded in TBP morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). This may be due to different regulatory mechanisms acting in parallel during maternal mRNA degradation. To investigate this further, we verified the kinetics of mRNA degradation by exploiting a published microarray data set on maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mathavan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and compared it to our TBP morphant data set. We established three classes of mRNAs based on the time of their degradation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table X</xref>): a &#x02018;fast' group of mRNAs, which degrade transcription independently or in a transcription dependent manner immediately after initiation of zygotic transcription; a &#x02018;medium' group which is mostly degraded after MBT by early gastrula stage; and a &#x02018;late' group degraded during neurulation and somitogenesis. The comparison of these groups with the TBP-morphant experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>) showed that maternal mRNAs upregulated in TBP morphants follow the pattern of expression dynamics of the &#x02018;medium' group (<italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003d;2.205e&#x02212;06). TBP-dependent maternal mRNAs showed minimal degradation until MBT (3 h post-fertilisation (hpf)) and accelerated degradation by early gastrulation (4.5 hpf), suggesting that zygotic transcription-dependent mechanisms are involved in their degradation.</p><p>These results suggest that TBP is only acting on a subset of mRNAs and that these mRNAs require transcription for their degradation. To test the transcriptional requirement for degradation of maternal mRNAs, we treated embryos with &#x003b1;-amanitin at a concentration that inhibits Pol II activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) and carried out RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of gene expression.

These results taken together with the results obtained using synthetic <italic>smad2</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>) suggest that the sustained levels of maternal mRNAs in TBP morphants are due to the inhibition of maternal mRNA degradation rather than ectopic activation of zygotic transcription of the respective genes. Not all maternal mRNAs require zygotic transcription (and TBP) for their degradation as confirmed by the fact that degradation of the <italic>dnl2</italic> gene is unaffected by &#x003b1;-amanitin and TBP MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>) and its degradation is primarily mediated by mechanisms acting before MBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, TBP appears to function within a transcription dependent mechanism directing the degradation of a subset of maternal mRNAs eliminated in a tight time window after MBT during early gastrulation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Degradation of maternal mRNA by the miR-430 microRNA is specifically affected in TBP morphants</title><p>Recently, a novel mechanism for maternal mRNA degradation has been described, which involves the zygotically transcribed miR-430 microRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Importantly, the maternally inherited <italic>zorba</italic> and <italic>smad2</italic> transcripts have been shown to be targets of miR-430 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), suggesting a potential link between TBP and miR-430 function in mRNA degradation. Therefore, we explored the relationship between miR-430- and TBP-dependent mRNA degradation mechanisms.</p><p>We first addressed the question whether TBP-dependent maternally inherited transcripts represent targets of miR-430-mediated mRNA degradation in general. We compared the overlap between experimentally verified miR-430 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and our TBP morphant microarray gene sets (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables XI</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">XII</xref> and Materials and methods). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, a significant enrichment of miR-430 target genes among the upregulated genes of TBP morphants was observed (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.002074). The proportion of miR-430 target genes was found to be higher among TBP-upregulated genes (20&#x00025;) than among maternal genes in general (14&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.0276). This difference is significant also after 100 randomisation experiments in which we randomly selected 100 maternal genes (15&#x00025; s.d.&#x0003d;3, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.0507). This suggests that the enrichment of miR-430 targets among the upregulated genes of TBP morphants is not simply reflecting the high proportion of maternal genes among miR-430 targets and upregulated genes in TBP morphants.</p><p>Subsequently, we have checked the degradation patterns of miR-430 target genes by analysing the overlap between the maternal genes with known degradation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mathavan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and miR-430 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VI</xref>). The degradation kinetics of miR-430 target genes largely but not exclusively overlap with that of the maternal genes degraded by TBP-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate a correlation between miR-430- and TBP-dependent mRNA degradation.</p><p>We next tested whether miR-430-dependent mRNA degradation requires TBP function. Embryos were injected at the zygote stage with a combination of synthetic mRNAs containing UTR sequences with or without miR-430 target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) together with TBP MO or c MO, and mRNA distribution was detected by WISH before and after the MBT. A synthetic <italic>gfp</italic> mRNA containing the 3&#x02032; UTR region from SV40 that lacks miR-430 target sequences was not degraded until the 50&#x00025; epiboly stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D, E and I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VIII</xref>), suggesting that they are not degraded by the miR-430 pathway. In contrast, <italic>gfp</italic> mRNA linked to the UTR from the <italic>zgc:103420</italic> gene containing a miR-430 target site is degraded by the 50&#x00025; epiboly stage in c MO-injected embryos, but not in TBP MO-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C&#x02013;E and I</xref>). Similar results were obtained with <italic>gfp</italic> mRNA fused to the 3&#x02032; UTR sequences of the <italic>zgc:63825</italic> and <italic>gstm</italic> genes containing miR-430 target sites or when only the miR430 target site sequences were added to <italic>gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C&#x02013;E and I</xref>). These results suggest that TBP is required for miR-430-dependent degradation of several mRNAs. Upon injection of a transcript containing a mutated 3&#x02032; UTR sequence of <italic>zgc:103420</italic> lacking the miR-430 target site, the mRNA became insensitive to degradation until the 50&#x00025; epiboly stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C&#x02013;E and I</xref>), indicating that the degradation of these synthetic mRNAs are indeed miR-430-dependent. The defects in miR-430-dependent degradation of mRNA in TBP morphants was also rescued by overexpression of recombinant TBP. Co-injection of synthetic <italic>tbp</italic> mRNA with <italic>gfp-zgc:103420</italic> and TBP MO resulted in reversal of the mRNA degradation phenotype of TBP morphants, indicating that the mRNA degradation effects relate directly to loss of TBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F and I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VIII</xref>). As miRNA genes are known to be transcribed by polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) miR-430 may be a candidate target of TBP-dependent transcription regulation. However, miR-430 expression in TBP morphants is unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5D</xref>), suggesting that TBP functions downstream of miR-430 production in the mRNA degradation process. We investigated further whether TBP is involved in general microRNA function or the mir-430 pathway specifically. Thus, we co-injected miR-430 and miR-1 with their respective target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) with TBP and c MO. miR-430-mediated mRNA degradation was blocked in TBP morphants, as opposed to that by miR-1, confirming the specificity of TBP function to a subset of miRNA-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>Given the tight temporal control of TBP-dependent mRNA degradation, we hypothesised that those miR-430 target mRNAs are degraded in a TBP-dependent manner, which are eliminated at a &#x02018;medium' rate during late blastulation/early gastrulation. To test this hypothesis, we utilised the overlap between miR-430 target genes and maternal genes and identified those, which show either medium or fast degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5G</xref>). Then we tested both fast- and medium-degrading miR430 target genes for TBP dependence of their degradation. The results indicate that medium-degrading mRNAs are more likely to be TBP-dependent (increased accumulation in TBP MO injected embryos) than fast-degrading mRNAs (5 of 7 versus 1 of 6, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5H</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that TBP is specifically required for the degradation of a subset of miR-430-dependent mRNAs that are eliminated at late blastula/early gastrula stages.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, we have demonstrated a differential requirement for TBP in the regulation of mRNA levels in the early zebrafish embryo and pinpointed three levels of regulatory activities associated with TBP function. The approach to block TBP function by MO oligonucleotides resulted in the efficient depletion of TBP in the embryo before the MBT, and thus allowed the detection of the earliest effects of loss of TBP protein on zygotic transcription and associated maternal degradation processes. The extensive use of a second TBP targeting MO and rescue experiments with a MO-insensitive recombinant TBP in this study provided strong experimental verification of the specificity of our key findings to loss of TBP function.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Redundant and specific function of TBP in the activation of subsets of genes at MBT</title><p>In this study of the transcriptome of the early zebrafish embryo, we have found that the expression of most genes remains weakly or not affected in TBP morphants. It is tempting to speculate that the TBP paralogue TBP2/TRF3, which has similar DNA-binding properties to TBP and is expressed at high levels in ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">B&#x000e1;rtfai <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) may contribute to the control of steady-state levels of mRNAs before gastrulation, thus complementing TBP function. However, due to the presence of maternally inherited TBP2 protein in the early zebrafish embryo, MO knockdown of TBP2 is inefficient before gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">B&#x000e1;rtfai <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and new ways of interfering with TBP2 function in the oocyte will have to be developed to address TBP2 function in the early zebrafish embryo. Another TBP-related factor (TLF/TLP/TRF2) has also been shown to affect transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Veenstra <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">M&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Together, these alternative transcription initiation mechanisms may explain the large number of unaffected gene activities in TBP morphants and emphasise the need to define the boundaries of TBP-regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>The differential regulation of genes during early development by TBP raises the question of which genes are specifically regulated by TBP and what promoter properties do they possess. Among genes requiring TBP for their activation, there was an enrichment for genes with stage-dependent activity during ontogeny. This observation suggests that TBP is required for genes that are expressed in a tightly regulated manner and demonstrates an important regulatory role for TBP as a core promoter-binding factor during ontogeny. Does the correlation between TBP function and the type of genes regulated by TBP mean a correlation between TBP dependence and core promoter motif composition? The recent genome-wide analysis of mouse and human promoters revealed that the binding site for TBP, known as the TATA box, is more likely to be present in genes associated with tightly regulated transcription and tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Carninci <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Our results, which show that ontogenic stage-dependent genes preferentially require TBP, are in line with the observations in mammals. However, our failure to detect a direct correlation between the presence of a TATA box and TBP dependence of gene activation in zebrafish is possibly due to the small set of genes available for this analysis. The small number of promoters analysed combined with the very low number of TATA boxes encountered in zebrafish promoters (for less than 10&#x00025; of genes verified, unpublished data) is consistent with findings in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Carninci <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and hampers the establishment of statistically significant correlations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TBP limits certain gene expression activities in the zebrafish embryo</title><p>The striking presence of upregulated genes in TBP morphants could be attributed to two distinct mechanisms: the direct or indirect negative regulatory role of TBP on zygotic transcription as well as the block of maternal mRNA degradation. In this paper, we show evidence for both mechanisms, thus revealing the complexity of regulatory roles played by TBP during the maternal to zygotic transition in zebrafish.</p><p>The observed negative regulatory role of TBP in zygotic gene activation is consistent with recent observations made in cultured cells. Inverse correlation between TBP occupancy and gene activity has been reported recently in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lebedeva <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Moreover, TBP was found to inhibit transcription of the NF1 promoter in transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Chong <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus, published biochemical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Chong <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) together with our observations on the biological roles of TBP together make it feasible to hypothesise that TBP may repress promoters directly during embryogenesis. To test this possibility, as well as to assess the direct effects of TBP in early development, will require the establishment of assays of promoter occupancy by TBP <italic>in vivo</italic> during zebrafish embryonic development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The mRNA degradation machinery active during maternal to zygotic transition requires TBP function</title><p>The temporally regulated degradation of maternal mRNAs at and after the MBT is part of a general mechanism to regulate the maternal to zygotic transition and is required for normal development of the zebrafish embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schier, 2007</xref>). We showed here that TBP is required for a zygotic developmental programme, which facilitates the regulated degradation of a subset of maternally deposited mRNAs during late blastula/early gastrula stages in the zebrafish. This finding is one of the few currently available explanations for the interplay between zygotic transcription and mRNA degradation during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">De Renzis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Where does TBP function in maternal mRNA degradation? The most likely scenario is that TBP is required for the expression of a zygotic gene product, which acts in the mRNA degradation mechanism. The components of the mRNA degradation pathway(s) in the embryo that may be affected by TBP function are largely unknown. However, our analysis of the temporal regulation of maternal mRNA degradation allowed us to characterise the set of mRNAs that require TBP for their elimination and provides useful tools for future research into the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of mRNA degradation by transcription-dependent mechanisms. We concluded that TBP-dependent mRNAs are specifically degraded after the MBT but before the end of gastrulation in a transcription-dependent manner. The zygotically expressed miR-430 becomes active at the MBT and was recently shown to regulate the degradation of many mRNAs in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In our study, TBP was found to affect miR-430 target mRNAs but only a subset of them. Importantly, we were able to pinpoint the set of miR-430-dependent maternal mRNAs degraded during late blastula early gastrula that require TBP. Thus, TBP may act on yet unidentified components of a pathway feeding into or functioning genetically downstream to the miR-430-dependent maternal mRNA degradation pathway. The pursuit for other factors in this pathway, including other potential TBP-dependent miRNAs, remains an urgent subject for future investigation. It will be important to address whether the restricted role TBP plays in the degradation of a subset of mRNAs can be associated with a particular developmental programme such as the various aspects of spatial and temporal control of gene activities during gastrulation. Another interesting question is whether TBP-dependent degradation of maternal mRNAs is a general feature of vertebrate development. Whereas it is premature to make direct comparisons with other vertebrates, there are indications for similarities in mRNA degradation dynamics. For example, <italic>smad2</italic> is a maternally expressed gene in the mouse with a similar early degradation pattern to that described here for zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The role of TBP in regulating specific subsets of genes during early embryo development demonstrates that promoter recognition proteins, once considered as constitutive components of transcription initiation, play specialised roles in differential gene expression regulation and may explain the diversity of core promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Butler and Kadonaga, 2002</xref>). Our findings support the model that promoter recognition by general transcription factors represents an additional regulatory level in transcription, which may provide flexibility for the cells of the animal to respond to signals at the core promoter level during ontogeny.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Embryo injection experiments</title><p>Wild-type embryos (Tubingen AB) were collected after fertilisation and dechorionated by pronase treatment as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Westerfield, 1995</xref>).

For a clustering of maternal mRNAs into fast-, medium- and slow-degrading subgroups the following criteria were used: fast-degrading, &#x0003e;200&#x00025; decrease of fold change from 0 to 3 hpf; medium&#x02013;degrading, &#x0003c;100&#x00025; from 0 to 3 hpf, &#x0003e;100&#x00025; from 3 to 4.5 hpf; slow-degrading, &#x0003c;50&#x00025; decrease of fold change till 4.5 hpf).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of miR-430 targets among the genes of the TBP microarray</title><p>We downloaded the raw data of the experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Giraldez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; wild type, MZ Dicer and MZ Dicer miR-430-injected) by the GEO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE4201">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE4201</ext-link>).
