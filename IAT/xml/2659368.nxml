The levels, mutual interactions, activities, and localization of G<sub>1</sub>/S regulators were analysed with respect to growth and differentiation parameters of the cells. <italic>Results and Conclusions</italic>: We demonstrate that proliferation parameters of differentiating cells correlate with the activity and structure of cyclin A/E&#x02013;CDK2 but not of cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4/6&#x02013;p27 complexes. In an exponentially growing P19 cell population, the cyclin D1&#x02013;CDK4 complex is detected, which is replaced by cyclin D2/3&#x02013;CDK4/6&#x02013;p27 complex following density arrest. During endodermal differentiation kinase-inactive cyclin D2/D3&#x02013;CDK4&#x02013;p27 complexes are formed. Neural differentiation specifically induces cyclin D1 at the expense of cyclin D3 and results in predominant formation of cyclin D1/D2&#x02013;CDK4&#x02013;p27 complexes. Differentiation is accompanied by cytoplasmic accumulation of cyclin Ds and CDK4/6, which in neural cells are associated with neural outgrowths. Most phenomena found here can be reproduced in mouse embryonic stem cells. In summary, our data demonstrate (i) that individual cyclin D isoforms are utilized in cells lineage specifically, (ii) that fundamental difference in the function of CDK4 and CDK6 exists, and (iii) that cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4/6 complexes function in the cytoplasm of differentiated cells. Our study unravels another level of complexity in G<sub>1</sub>/S transition-regulating machinery in early embryonic cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During development of multi-cellular organisms, cell lineages become specified, cells acquire unique cell fates, and they differentiate. Differentiation processes proceed in a balanced concerted way, with cell proliferation and cell death maintaining homeostasis of the entire organism. At least some differentiation processes can be effectively mimicked <italic>in vitro</italic> using pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which have their physiological <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts in cells of pre-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Andrews <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Smith 2001</xref>).</p><p>Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), their activating and inhibiting partners &#x02013; cyclins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs), are well recognized as essential regulators of cell proliferation. Their interactions, activities and functions as related to regulation of both progression of the cell cycle and maintenance of the quiescent state are well established (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Sherr 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sherr &#x00026; Roberts 1999</xref>). Yet, irrespective of whether the cells reside in a developing embryo or in an adult organism, expression of individual cell cycle regulators of G<sub>1</sub> and S phases is significantly diverse, with individual cell types employing specific G<sub>1</sub>/S cell cycle regulators to guarantee a balance between proliferation, quiescence, and/or maintenance of differentiation (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gao &#x00026; Zelenka 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Nakayama &#x00026; Nakayama 1998</xref>). In this study, mouse embryonal carcinoma cells (line P19) have been employed to address the question of how such molecular diversification develops during the earliest steps of differentiation that take place in the early embryo.</p><p>Up until now, several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been undertaken with the aim of understanding the role of cell cycle regulators in early differentiation; however, their results are not completely congruent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Savatier <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gill <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baldassarre <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Li <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Baldassarre <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Glozak &#x00026; Rogers 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Preclikova <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bryja <italic>et al</italic>. 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bryja <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). Still, as culture systems (monolayer versus three-dimensional), differentiation-inducing strategy/compounds, timing, cell density and other factors vary from study to study, controversies are likely to some extent, due to differences in experimental setup. Here, to overcome such limitations, we have introduced a simple experimental design that uses P19 EC cells, which profits from two different retinoic acid (RA)-based differentiation protocols, that in 4 days produce homogenous populations of primitive endodermal and primitive neuroectodermal cells, respectively. Importantly, it is also inherent to this setup that differentiation-associated changes to cell population growth, measured by cell density, DNA synthesis and distribution in cell cycle phases, are similar in both endodermal and ectodermal pathways. Experiments employing this design have led to the following findings: while cyclin A/E-CDK2 activity correlate with cell population growth parameters independently of differentiation status of cells, differences in cell fate are associated with existence of several types of molecular complex formed by D-type cyclins, CDK4, or CDK6 and p27. We assume that this molecular diversity mirrors distinct roles of (i) CDK4 and CDK6, and (ii) individual D-type cyclins, and that these molecules play a part in cell fate specification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>P19 EC cells (ATCC no.

Then, they were cultured in the respective media without RA for another 48 h, thus establishing two cell groups further referred to as SR (serum + RA) and IR (ITS + RA) cells, respectively. It was typical for SR cells to form monolayers of flat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1b</xref>), to express markers of extraembryonal endoderm such as TROMA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1c,d</xref>), and to lack markers of undifferentiated and/or neural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1c</xref> and not shown). In contrast, IR cells adopted neural morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1b</xref>) and started to express neural markers, for example neural specific class III &#x003b2;-tubulin or N-CAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1c,d</xref>), while lacking both the endodermal marker TROMA-1 and the marker of undifferentiated cells Oct-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Control cells were cultured for 96 h in serum-containing medium (undifferentiated P19 EC cells, further referred to as S cells). Control cells at 48 h (S48) were fully proliferative and undifferentiated (as repeatedly judged by Oct-4 expression) and thus represent the basic control.

As determined by both total protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2a</xref>) and total cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2b</xref>), treatment with RA resulted in population growth retardation, which was more pronounced in IR cells. Distribution of cells in G<sub>1</sub>, S and G<sub>2</sub> phases was then determined for all three culture protocols, by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2c</xref>). A significant decrease in numbers of cells in S phase took place after induction of differentiation (S48 versus SR96/IR96; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, One-way <sc>anova</sc>) and also with increased cell density (S48 versus S96; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Flowcytometric counting of BrdU-pulse-labelled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2d</xref>) showed that 60&#x02013;70% of S48 control cells incorporated BrdU into their DNA, whereas at the 96 h time point only, around 10% of cells retained BrdU in S96, SR and IR. Clearly, increased cell density and RA-induced differentiation both caused inhibition of DNA synthesis under our culture conditions. A high proportion of S96 cells in S phase suggests that a density-dependent slowdown of DNA synthesis and subsequent S phase arrest was a major mechanism responsible for reduction in proliferation in undifferentiated P19 EC cells, as was shown recently for mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Jirmanova <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">And&#x000e4;ng <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). In contrast, both SR and IR cells accumulated in G<sub>1</sub> phase at the expense of in S phase, suggesting that G<sub>1</sub>/S transition was affected. Importantly, SR and IR cells were indistinguishable from each other based on cell cycle distribution/proliferation characteristics. As an additional parameter, we analysed the level of apoptosis using three apoptotic markers &#x02013; cleavage of PARP, cleavage of lamin B, and proportion of cells in sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>. We could detect cleavage of caspase substrates PARP and lamin B clearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2e</xref>) and increased number of cells in sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> population in S96, SR96 and IR96 cells, as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2f</xref>). Interestingly, PARP was cleaved mainly in S96 and IR96 cells, whereas lamin B was cleaved mainly in SR96 and IR96 cells. PARP and lamin B are substrates of distinct caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Slee <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>), and different patterns of their cleavage suggest that the mechanisms of apoptotic activation in S96, SR96 and IR96 cells may differ.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure and kinase activity of cyclin A/E-CDK2-p27 complexes during differentiation</title><p>CDK2 and its regulatory partners, cyclins A and E, and appropriate CKIs are major drivers of G<sub>1</sub>/S transition and S-phase progression. We have analysed levels, mutual interactions, and kinase activities of cyclins A and E, CDK2, and p27 (the only CKI showing detectable levels in P19 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Cyclin E-associated kinase activity dropped both by induction of differentiation (SR/IR) and with increasing cell density (S96), which is likely due to a combination of increased binding of p27 and down-regulation of cyclin E. Cyclin A showed a more complex pattern, which was characterized by decreased cyclin A-associated kinase activity and increased association with p27 in differentiated cells (SR96/IR96). Interestingly, increased density of S96 cells resulted in increased level of cyclin A and cyclin A/CDK2 activity, despite higher association with p27. Because S96 cells did not incorporate BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2c</xref>), it is possible that cyclin A/CDK2 complex had an additional function in S96 cells. In all cultures other then S96, however, activity of CDK2 correlates well with binding of its activating and inhibiting partners and matches observed growth characteristics of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Analysis of cyclin A/E&#x02013;CDK2&#x02013;p27 complexes</title><p>Cells were cultured according to protocols outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1a</xref>, and cell lysates were used to immunoprecipitate cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and p27.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4a</xref>, only cyclin D1 was expressed in significant levels in fully proliferating undifferentiated P19 cells (S48), although a minute amount of cyclin D2 was also present. When differentiation was induced, both cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 became up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4a</xref>). Prolonged culture lead also to up-regulation of cyclin D3 in undifferentiated S96 cells, suggesting that not only RA treatment but also other signals (most likely increased cell density), may induce expression of D-type cyclins in P19 cells. Previously, we have shown that in differentiated cells, D-type cyclins accumulate due to stabilization by binding partners and not due to changes in their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Bryja <italic>et al</italic>. 2004a</xref>). To resolve whether or not the changes in levels of D-type cyclins and p27 were due to increased levels of transcripts, we have determined the mRNA levels by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4b</xref>). Amounts of transcripts coding for cyclins D and p27 matched well changes in the respective protein levels, suggesting that D-type cyclins and p27 were regulated during differentiation primarily via transcription mechanisms. Only cyclin D1 showed more complex regulation with low quantities of protein in differentiated cells despite high level of its mRNA. Importantly, based on the obvious lack of correlation between levels of mRNA for individual D-type cyclins and cell growth characteristics, we hypothesize that in differentiating P19 cells these cyclins play role(s) other than regulation of cell cycle progression.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Expression of D-type cyclins</title><p>Cells were cultured according to protocols outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1a</xref>.

Interestingly, there were major differences among D-type cyclins in their association with CDK4. While in fully proliferating undifferentiated P19 cells (S48) cyclin D1 was the only cyclin bound to CDK4, significant physical interaction of CDK4 with cyclins D2 and D3 was observed in cells induced to differentiate by RA. Specifically, the following cyclins had undergone the most prominent increase in binding to CDK4: (i) cyclins D2 and D3 in undifferentiated S cells, (ii) cyclin D3 in endodermal (SR) cells, and (iii) cyclins D1 and D2 in neural (IR) cells.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Analysis of cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4/6&#x02013;p27 complexes</title><p>Cells were cultured according to protocols outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1a</xref>, and cell lysates were analysed.

Interestingly, binding of D-type cyclins to CDK6 was completely different from their association to CDK4. In undifferentiated, proliferating S48 cells, CDK6 associated with only small amounts of cyclin D2 and p27. In contrast, growth-arrested S96 cells were characterized by high levels of cyclins D2 and D3 interacting with CDK6; however, such interactions were much less pronounced in cells differentiating into endodermal (SR) and neural (IR) lineages. Strong physical interaction between CDK6 and p27 was detected in S96 and SR96 cells. No interaction of cyclin D1 with CDK6 was observed under any condition. To complement the analysis, we also determined the portions of D-type cyclins that physically interacted with p27. Cyclin D1 bound to p27 in IR96 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>), cyclin D2 bound to p27 in a pattern corresponding well to the total amount of cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 bound to p27, mainly in dense, serum-containing cultures (S96 and SR96 cells). Taking all these data together, CDK4 associated with p27 and D-type cyclin partners mainly during differentiation of P19 cells, although such interactions were clearly specific for individual D-type cyclins. In contrast, complexes involving CDK6 and its partners developed predominantly in cells that were approaching confluence (S96 and SR96). Importantly, although D-type cyclins associated with CDK4 during differentiation, neither CDK4-associated kinase activity nor cell population growth was stimulated in differentiating cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of p27 and <sc>d</sc>-type cyclins in differentiating cells</title><p>Cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate their targets, which then further regulate cell cycle progression. The majority of these events occur in nucleus. In this study, we have shown that changes in levels of D-type cyclins were not linked to cell cycle characteristics of differentiating P19 cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that specific subcellular localization of certain members of cell cycle-regulating machinery may be responsible for absence of the expected link. To address this issue, we employed immunocytochemistry to visualize subcellular localization of cyclin A, cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 <italic>in situ</italic> in S48 (undifferentiated), SR96 and IR96 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6a</xref>, cyclin A was predominantly nuclear under all conditions. In contrast, although cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 were mostly nuclear in undifferentiated cells (S48), they all appeared in cytoplasm following differentiation to endodermal (SR96) and/or neural (IR96) lineages. Interestingly, in neural IR cells, both CDK4 and CDK6 were heavily associated with neurite outgrowths. To complement immunohistochemical analysis, cell lysates of differentiated cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and the efficiency of this separation process was confirmed by including analysis of cytoplasmic &#x003b1;-tubulin, a component of nuclear membrane lamin B, and chromating binding protein HP1&#x003b1;. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6b</xref>, all D-type cyclins and p27 were predominantly cytoplasmic.

We were not successful in transferring the neural differentiation protocol (IR) to mESCs, mainly because high cell death was associated with given treatments to mESCs (not shown). Yet, the endodermal differentiation protocol (SR) proved to be fully applicable to mESCs and produced relevant data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7a</xref>, expression patterns of D-type cyclins and p27 did not differ from those observed in differentiating P19 cells. Importantly, endodermal differentiation was accompanied by remodelling of protein complexes involving CDK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7b</xref>). In undifferentiated mESCs (S48), CDK4 predominantly bound cyclin D1, which was replaced during progressing differentiation by cyclins D2 and D3 together with p27. These expression and interaction patterns closely resemble behaviour of the cell cycle regulators in P19 cells, differentiating under identical conditions. Interestingly, similarly to P19 cells, cyclin D/CDK4/p27 complexes in differentiating mESCs were likely to be localized in the cytoplasm as indicated by cytoplasmic localization of individual D-type cyclins, CDK4 and p27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7c</xref>).

The ultimate aim of this study was to investigate the link between metabolism of key members of the cell cycle-regulating machinery and lineage determination, in differentiating pluripotent cells of embryonic origin. To do so, two differentiation protocols were implemented, which produced cells of two different phenotypes: endodermal (positive for TROMA-1) and neural (positive for neural specific class III &#x003b2;-tubulin). Analyses described here have led to two major revelations. First, the cell cycle characteristics of P19 cells and their differentiated progeny correlated well with activity of CDK2. Moreover, activity of CDK2 correlated with cyclin A- and cyclin E-associated kinase activity, as well as with association with CDK inhibitor p27. Second, amounts of D-type cyclins and their physical interactions with CDK4 were elevated in the conditions which did not support proliferation. Moreover, complexes of D-type cyclins with CDK4/6, which are distinct depending on differentiation program, were localized predominantly in cytoplasm, contrasting with the nuclear localization of complexes involving cyclin A and CDK2. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that although cyclin A/E&#x02013;CDK2&#x02013;p27 complex regulates progression of the cell cycle in differentiating P19 cells, major role of cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4 complexes in these embryonic cells differed from the regulation of entry into S phase. It should, however, be noted that any pro-differentiation function of cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4/6&#x02013;p27 complexes was not in conflict with their function in regulation of G<sub>1</sub>/S transition. It is possible that subcellular localization represents a mechanism of how these independent functions were realized and regulated.</p><p>It has been shown that although cells are able to proliferate in the absence of both CDK4/6 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Malumbres <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>) and D-type cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kozar <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>), differentiation in D-cyclin-null embryos is often affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fantl <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Sicinski <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chellappan <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huard <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Ciemerych <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). Our screen identifies cyclin D2, cyclin D3 and p27 as the molecules that become expressed and stay elevated when EC and mESC cells are induced to differentiate. Instead, bimodal expression was typical for cyclin D1 (with this cyclin being high in undifferentiated cells), and after transient decrease being up-regulated again, but only in the neural lineage. Obviously, the coordinated increase of p27 and cyclin D2 and/or D3 during differentiation was not an uncommon phenomenon, as it has been widely described using other differentiation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Savatier <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gill <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baldassarre <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Li <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Baldassarre <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Glozak <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Preclikova <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bryja <italic>et al</italic>. 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bryja <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). In the present study, however, detailed analysis of the dynamics of a composition of cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4/6&#x02013;p27 complex unravelled important differences, not only in a utilization of individual D-type cyclins but also in the roles of CDK4 and CDK6, respectively. As indicated in the schematic diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8a</xref>), undifferentiated, exponentially growing cells (S48) mostly contained cyclin D1 associated with CDK4 and a low level of cyclin D2 complexed with CDK6. Although p27 was detected, the level of this regulator was very low in undifferentiated P19 cells. In 2 further days, when cells cultured under non-differentiating conditions reached confluence (S96), p27, cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 were induced and they bound mainly to CDK6 and to CDK4. Simultaneously, expression of cyclin D1 became reduced and its binding to CDK4 was abolished.</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Shuffling of cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4/6&#x02013;p27 complexes in P19 EC cells</title><p>In exponentially growing P19 EC cells, kinase-active cyclin D1&#x02013;CDK4 was a predominant complex but low amounts of cyclin D2&#x02013;CDK6&#x02013;p27 were also present.

During endodermal differentiation cyclin D2, cyclin D3 and p27 were also induced but they associated mainly with CDK4 (and only to a small extent with CDK6), thus forming inactive, predominantly cytoplasmic cyclin D2/D3&#x02013;CDK4&#x02013;p27 complexes, which replaced nuclear cyclin D1&#x02013;CDK4 complexes contained in undifferentiated P19 cells. Differentiation towards neural lineage was also associated with up-regulation of D-type cyclins and p27, which then bound to CDK4 (and not CDK6). Notably, cyclins D1 and D2 were dominant in neural differentiation, instead of cyclins D2 and D3, typical of endodermal differentiation. Cyclin D2 is expressed throughout embryonic and adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Ross &#x00026; Riskin 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Ross <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>) and its specific role in neurodifferentiation has been documented in several lines of evidence. Cyclin D2-deficient mice display defects in architecture of the cerebellum, due to inappropriate proliferation of granule cell precursors and due to defects in differentiation of granule and stellate interneurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huard <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). Moreover, additional ablation of cyclin D1 further amplifies the defects observed in cyclin D2-deficient mice &#x02013; the cyclin D1&#x02013;/&#x02013;D2&#x02013;/&#x02013; mouse has severely impaired development of the cerebellum which develops only in a rudimentary form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Ciemerych <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). Cooperation of cyclins D1 and D2 thus correspond well with their specific up-regulation observed here in neural IR cells.</p><p>Two major conclusions can be drawn from the above analysis: (i) distinct D-type cyclins are utilized in neural and endodermal differentiation; (ii) CDK4 is a major partner of D-type cyclins and p27 in differentiated cells, whereas CDK6 is bound to D-type cyclins and p27 in undifferentiated cells at higher densities. CDK4 and CDK6 are considered to be largely redundant in their ability to bind D-type cyclins and to phosphorylate target proteins, as well as in their biological function (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Ekholm &#x00026; Reed 2000</xref>). Distinct roles for CDK4 and CDK6 in cells of embryonic origin are suggested in our study, by differing metabolism of CDK4- and CDK6-containing complexes. We have shown previously that similar rapid and complete re-structuring of cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4/6 complexes from cyclin D2/D3&#x02013;CDK6 to cyclin D3&#x02013;CDK4&#x02013;p21/p27 accompanies fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Krejci <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Furthermore, cyclin D3&#x02013;CDK6 and cyclin D1&#x02013;CDK4 complexes, which are typical for undifferentiated mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Faast <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; &#x0010c;aj&#x000e1;nek unpublished), become rebuilt into cyclin D3&#x02013;CDK4&#x02013;p27 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Savatier <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bryja <italic>et al</italic>. 2004b</xref>) upon entry into the differentiation pathway. Unfortunately, functional significance of such dramatic molecular changes occurring to CDK4 and CDK6 is as yet largely unexplored, with only some distinct properties of CDK4 and CDK6 being recently found with respect to (i) substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Takaki <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>); (ii) sensitivity to the CKI inhibitors of INK4 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lin <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Faast <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>); and (iii) utilization of individual post-translational variants of p27 and subsequently ability to sequester p27 from CDK2. Although our experiments could not provide thorough functional analysis, they are still important by not only presenting further evidence for unequal roles of CDK4 and CDK6, but also primarily by pointing to CDK4, CDK6, and their partners concerning molecules that are involved in driving differentiation processes which take place in early development.</p><p>Here, we have demonstrated that individual D-type cyclins were differently utilized during lineage specification, with cyclins D1 and D2 (but not cyclin D3) being typical for differentiation towards the neural lineage. Similarly, substrate specificities of CDK4 and CDK6, and also CDK4 complexed to different D-type cyclins, may differ in substrate specificity as clearly demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Paternot <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref>. Cyclins D1 and D2 are crucial for neural development in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Ciemerych <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>) and cooperation of cyclins D1 and D2 in mouse development thus correspond well with their specific up-regulation observed here in neural lineage (IR) cells. Although the precise molecular mechanism of cyclin D1 and/or cyclin D2 action in neurodifferentiation is not yet known, recent data suggest that both these cyclins may be involved in regulation of apoptosis in neural cells. Cyclin D2 has been shown to mediate anti-apoptotic effects on cerebellar neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Poguet <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>) and cytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1 is required to protect differentiating neurones from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Sumrejkanchanakij <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). We have previously demonstrated similar anti-apoptotic functions for cyclin D3 in complex with p27 in mESCs, differentiating into extra-embryonic endoderm (SR cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bryja <italic>et al</italic>. 2004b</xref>). We suggest that neural IR cells expressing high levels of cyclins D1 and D2 localized in the cytoplasm, bound to but not activating CDK4, provide an <italic>in vitro</italic> system to investigate the role of D-type cyclins in neural differentiation in more detail.</p><p>In summary, our data provide evidence that depending on cell fate, diverse cyclin D&#x02013;CDK4/6&#x02013;p27 complexes are formed and are utilized distinctly by pluripotent embryonic cells. Whereas CDK4 is a major partner of cytoplasmic D-type cyclins and p27 in differentiating cells (associated with cyclins D1 and D2 in neuroectodermal cells and with cyclins D2 and D3 in endodermal cells), CDK6 binds D-type cyclins and p27 when cells are at high cell density. Our data suggest that individual D-type cyclins as well as CDK4 and CDK6 have sub-type specific and cell cycle regulation-independent functions utilized during embryonic development and differentiation of stem cells. From a practical point of view, this study provides a well-characterized experimental model to address biological processes whose understanding is required for safe use of human ES cells in cell therapies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to Dr. J.
