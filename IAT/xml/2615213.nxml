The <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> virulent serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae serovar Lai encodes a protein (LA2144), which exhibited the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity <italic>in vitro</italic> similar to that of human serum with respect to its substrate affinity and specificity and thus designated L-PAF-AH. On the other hand, the primary amino acid sequence of L-PAF-AH is homologous to the &#x003b1;1-subunit of the bovine brain PAF-AH isoform I. The L-PAF-AH was proven to be an intracellular protein, which was encoded unanimously and expressed similarly in either pathogenic or saprophytic leptospires. Mongolian gerbil is an appropriate experimental model to study the PAF-AH level in serum with its basal activity level comparable to that of human while elevated directly associated with the course of pulmonary hemorrhage during severe leptospirosis. Mortality occurred around the peak of pulmonary hemorrhage, along with the transition of the PAF-AH activity level in serum, from the increasing phase to the final decreasing phase. Limited clinical data indicated that the serum activity of PAF-AH was likely to be elevated in the patients infected by <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae, but not in those infected by other less severe serogroups. Although L-PAF-AH might be released into the micro-environment <italic>via</italic> cell lysis, its PAF-AH activity apparently contributed little to this elevation. Therefore, the change of PAF-AH in serum not only may be influential for pulmonary hemorrhage, but also seems suitable for disease monitoring to ensure prompt clinical treatment, which is critical for reducing the mortality of severe leptospirosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leptospirosis continues to be a leading zoonotic infection throughout the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Bharti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, little is known about the substances and mechanisms responsible for the hemorrhage and hemoptysis involved in their pathogenicity. It is generally believed that neither thrombocytopenia nor diminution of hepatically synthesized clotting factors seen in human leptospirosis were sufficient to account for the bleeding diathesis observed <italic>per se</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Bharti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Levett1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In 2004, Nally <italic>et al.</italic> reported that an autoimmune process may be involved in the etiology of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage in leptospirosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Nally1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Based on the annotation of <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic>' genomic sequence (serovar Lai strain 56601) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Ren1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, we recognized that the open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>la2144</italic> in the bacterial chromosome I seems encoding a putative platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). Its primary amino acid sequence exhibited significant levels of similarity to the &#x003b1;1-subunit of bovine brain PAF-AH isoform I (EC 3.1.1.47), a 29-kDa protein isolated from bovine brain soluble fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Sheffield1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Ho1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. PAF-AH isoform I is an intracellular heterotrimeric enzyme composed of three subunits with molecular mass of 29- (&#x003b1;1), 30- (&#x003b1;2), and 45-kDa (&#x003b2;) respectively. Both &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 are catalytic subunits, but the &#x003b1;1 alone is sufficient to catalyze the removal of the acetyl moiety at the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of PAF to generate the biologically inactive lyso-PAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Ho1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, LA2144 might hydrolyse PAF through its PAF-AH activity, and it was speculated to be associated with the pulmonary hemorrhage during severe leptospirosis.</p><p>Here, the identification and biochemical characterization of this leptospiral PAF-AH is firstly reported. By experimental infection to a Mongolian gerbil model, we found that although leptospiral PAF-AH contributed little to the change of PAF-AH level in gerbil sera during severe leptospirosis, the PAF-AH levels in serum were elevated along with the development of clinical manifestation, particularly, the whole course of pulmonary hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The LA2144 is homologous to the PAF-AH isoform I &#x003b1;1-subunit</title><p>Deduced amino acid sequence of ORF LA2144 (amino acid residues 23&#x02013;248) of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Lai was highly homologous (23&#x00025; identity and 42&#x00025; similarity) to that of the &#x003b1;1-subunit of PAF-AH isoform I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004181-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

It would, therefore, be of interest to explore the suitable animal to simulate the role of human serum PAF-AH.</p><p>The present study first investigated the serum PAF-AH levels of the commonly used experimental rodent and rabbit species, particularly guinea pig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Nally1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Nally2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Yasuda1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and golden hamster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Palaniappan1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, the most common models for the leptospirosis studies and found that only Mongolian gerbil has its normal serum PAF-AH level similar to that of human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004181-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, the patterns of the change of PAF-AH level in serum during the course of severe leptospirosis were similar in gerbils and patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004181-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004181.s006">Figure S6</xref>), including the levels of elevation. Therefore, gerbil seems to be the best model animal among the rodent and rabbit species to reflect the role of serum PAF-AH in the human diseases.</p><p>Platelet aggregation as well as platelet adhesion and subsequent plug formation at the site of injury plays a major role in the control of vascular hemostasis. Decreases in PAF levels <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to decreased ability of platelet aggregation, can profoundly influence vascular hemostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Chao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Garofalo1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The acetyl group at the sn-2 position of its glycerol backbone is essential for its biological activity, and its deacetylation product, lyso-PAF, loses biological activity. Comparing PAF-AH to the control, its changes in serum were closely associated with the whole course of pulmonary hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004181-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). In human, the PAF-AH levels in serum of leptospirosis patients infected by <italic>L. interrogans</italic> of serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae were found significantly higher than that of either normal control or patients infected by non-icterohaemorrhagiae leptospires (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004181-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These findings could be directly related to the possible decrease of the blood platelet activation activity of PAF caused by the elevated PAF-AH catalyzed hydrolysis. Eventually, pulmonary hemorrhage happens, of course, including the effects of the other virulent factors, such as LPS. Thus, the PAF-AH in serum might play an important role in the pulmonary symptom in severe leptospirosis although its mechanism is yet to be learnt along with the confirmation of this hypothesized function.</p><p>Practically, PAF-AH level in serum seems more likely a suitable biochemical marker for monitoring the occurrence of the lethal pulmonary hemorrhage in cases of severe leptospirosis. Most human fatalities in leptospirosis are due to hemorrhage, and pulmonary involvement is the main type of hemorrhage in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Bharti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Clinical course of pulmonary hemorrhage has been known to be developed so quickly that doctors did not have enough time to provide the suitable therapy, while early treatment could reduce most of the death for severe leptospirosis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Bharti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Levett1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the need for developing some convenient monitoring strategies has become even more critical now. The significant direct association of the PAF-AH activities in serum with the pulmonary hemorrhage implied that it would be one biochemical marker for monitoring the level of risk for pulmonary hemorrhage development along the course of the disease, which in turn, may direct the doctors to apply different therapeutic strategies for individual patients suffered in different disease phases to reduce the mortality rate of the severe leptospirosis. In our opinion, suitable antibiotics application for different duration of the disease with different PAF-AH level in serum might be suggested to support the present existed standards, such as doxycycline for both prophylaxis and mild disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Takafuji1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Guidugli1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, ampicillin and amoxicillin for mild disease, whereas penicillin G and ampicillin for severe disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Watt1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides, because PAF-AH is also considered a regulatory molecule for immune responses, appropriate application of some immune modulation drugs at certain duration of the severe leptospirosis might be considered, at least for animal model analysis. Finally, some assistant therapies, such as hospital admission and close observation, should be required for the severe patients at their early stage of the disease course. Thus, our observations have provided a potential clinical molecular marker for prospective clinical evaluation, by which, the manifestation course leading to pulmonary hemorrhage might be monitored to reduce the mortality of the severe leptospirosis.</p><p>To our knowledge, it is the first time that increased PAF-AH level in serum was reported for sepsis. Graham <italic>et al.</italic> reported decreased PAF-AH serum activity in blood samples from septic patients and the half-life of PAF was prolonged in the serum of dying septic patients compared to survivors or normal volunteers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Graham1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, in mouse models, serum activity of PAF-AH is significantly decreased within 24 hr after the challenge and then returns to baseline in surviving animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Gomes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. As leptospirosis shows typical sepsis symptoms including chills, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, conjunctival suffusion, and less often a skin rash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Faine1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, it was surprising to observe the elevation of PAF-AH in serum in severe leptospirosis patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004181-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and gerbil models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004181-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, the PAF-AH levels in serum of dying gerbils, most of which showed the severest pulmonary hemorrhage, were significant higher than the mean level of total gerbils infected the virulent strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004181.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Considering that leptospires are different from either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria with basically unknown mechanisms of pathogenicity or virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Bharti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, the modulation of PAF-AH in serum might be different between the leptospirosis patients <italic>vs.</italic> other sepsis patients, for most of them were infected by typical Gram-positive or Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Gomes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Graham1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, this changing pattern of PAF-AH in serum, so-far unique for severe leptospirosis may distinguish it from other reported sepses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Gomes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Graham1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, which may eventually help us to further understand the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. Moreover, as different sepses may have different response of PAF-AH activity, the exact role of serum PAF-AH in different kinds of sepses must be answered before undertaking any related medication, <italic>i.e.</italic> administration of recombinant serum PAF-AH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Opal1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Claus1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Intracellular isoforms of PAF-AH exist and are found in liver, kidney and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Stafforini1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02014;tissues involved in leptospiral complications and multiple organ failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004181-Bharti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, one of our next challenges would be to identify which isoform of the host PAF-AH actually makes the major contribution of elevation and explore the elevation mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions</title><p>The avirulent strain of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Lai was kindly provided by Professor Isabelle Saint Girons (Unit&#x000e9; de Bact&#x000e9;riologie Mol&#x000e9;culaire et M&#x000e9;dicale, Institut Pasteur, France). <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Lai strain 56601 and other leptospiral strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004181-t002">Table 2</xref>) used in this study are maintained by the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China.
