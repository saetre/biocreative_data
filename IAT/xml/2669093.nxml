GIMAP1 was the first reported member of this gene family, identified as a gene up-regulated at the RNA level in the spleens of mice infected with the malarial parasite, <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A monoclonal antibody against mouse GIMAP1 was developed and was used to analyse the expression of the endogenous protein in tissues of normal mice and in defined sub-populations of cells prepared from lymphoid tissues using flow cytometry. It was also used to assess the expression of GIMAP1 protein after infection and/or immunization of mice with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>. Real-time PCR analysis was employed to measure the expression of <italic>GIMAP1 </italic>for comparison with the protein level analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>GIMAP1 protein expression was detected in all lineages of lymphocytes (T, B, NK), in F4/80<sup>+ </sup>splenic macrophages and in some lymphoid cell lines. Additional evidence is presented suggesting that the strong expression by mature B cells of GIMAP1 and other GIMAP genes and proteins seen in mice may be a species-dependent characteristic. Unexpectedly, no increase was found in the expression of GIMAP1 in <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infected mice at either the mRNA or protein level, and this remained so despite applying a number of variations to the protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The model of up-regulation of GIMAP1 in response to infection/immunization with <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>is not a robustly reproducible experimental system. The GIMAP1 protein is widely expressed in lymphoid cells, with an interesting increase in expression in the later stages of B cell development. Alternative approaches will be required to define the functional role of this GTPase in immune cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>GIMAP1 (<underline>G</underline>TPase of the <underline>im</underline>munity-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein family 1; formerly known variously as iap38, imap38, IAN2) was the first reported member of a family of putative GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These are present in vertebrates, absent from bacteria, nematodes and flies but with relatives in higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Humans, rats and mice have seven or eight <italic>GIMAP </italic>genes clustered tightly on a single autosome. The predicted proteins encoded by these genes are similar in their amino-terminal regions, which contain a guanine nucleotide binding domain with conserved motifs, but vary significantly at their carboxy-terminal ends, which contain predicted coiled-coil regions or transmembrane (TM) domains, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>GIMAP1 was originally discovered in a differential screen of a spleen cell cDNA library made from malaria (<italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic>)-immune mice using cDNA from immune or non-immune mouse spleens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In this and a later publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the authors reported Northern blot comparisons of spleen mRNAs from mice either before, or seven days after, malaria infection, using both na&#x000ef;ve and malaria-immune animals. GIMAP1 expression, which was relatively weak in na&#x000ef;ve mouse spleen, was increased two to 30-fold post infection in various mouse strains on the C57BL/10 or C57BL/6 backgrounds and was high in spleens of immune mice both pre- and post-infection. Post-infection expression levels were particularly high in the plastic-adherent splenocyte fraction ('macrophages') and successively weaker in B and T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>GIMAP proteins are thought to be involved in the regulation of cell death. The evidence for this has come from family members other than GIMAP1, in particular GIMAP5 and GIMAP4. Diverse evidence from <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>systems in rat, mouse and human has indicated that GIMAP5 has anti-apoptotic properties, notably in the T lymphocyte lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Pro-death properties, by contrast, have been ascribed to GIMAP4, from studies in both mouse and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Consistent with the involvement of GIMAP4 and GIMAP5 in the regulation of cell survival, both proteins have been shown to be capable of interacting physically with members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>It was important to find out whether the up-regulation of GIMAP1 during malaria infection in mice was indicative of regulated apoptotic processes occurring during the immune response to this pathogen or, instead, reflected a distinct biological function for this member of the GIMAP family. The initial aim of this investigation was to generate antibodies specific for mouse GIMAP1, in order to study the expression of this GTPase at the protein level and learn more about the nature of the cells expressing it in both na&#x000ef;ve and malaria-immune or -infected mice. A surprising outcome of this study, which made use of a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) against mouse GIMAP1, was the failure, despite extensive efforts, to reproduce the up-regulation of GIMAP1 as reported in earlier publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 and C57BL/10ScSn mice for malaria experiments were bred and used at the National Institute for Medical Research; C57BL/6 mice and PVG-<italic>RT1</italic><sup><italic>u</italic></sup>, <italic>RT7</italic><sup><italic>b </italic></sup>rats for other experiments were bred at The Babraham Institute.

In order to exclude the predicted TM domain from any expressed fusion protein product, codon 239 of the open reading frame was converted to a stop (TAA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers 5'-CCCAGGACCAATAAGCCAAGGTGG-3' and 5'-CCACCTTGGCTTATTGGTCCTGGG-3'. A fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) N-terminal of mouse GIMAP1 was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>Rosetta DE3 (Novagen) in inclusion bodies. These were solubilized in 6 M urea and the fusion protein was purified using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by electro-elution from the gel using an electrophoretic concentrator (Isco Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska USA). A female LOU/C rat was immunized subcutaneously three times at three to four-weekly intervals with 50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g of the fusion protein in Freund's adjuvant. A final, intrasplenic, boost was delivered in an aqueous vehicle. Three days later the rat was killed and spleen cells were fused with the rat Y3Ag1.2.3 plasmacytoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] to generate hybridomas. Hybridoma supernatants were screened by western blotting on lysates of HEK293T cells expressing myc-tagged mouse GIMAP1 (see below). The selected positive hybridoma, MAC420, secretes a rat IgG<sub>2a </sub>antibody. An anti-mouse GIMAP1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was custom produced by Harlan Sera-Lab (Loughborough, UK) using the same immunogen.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of epitope-tagged constructs</title><p>N-terminally myc-tagged GIMAP constructs (with the exception of mGIMAP4) were generated by cloning PCR products amplified from GIMAP cDNA, or previously cloned plasmids, into pCANmyc1 (derivative of pcDNA3 which includes an ATG and encodes an in-frame myc tag at the 5' end of the multiple cloning site; provided by Dr Simon Cook).

Whereas GIMAP1 protein was expressed relatively highly by cells at all of the stages in T cell development from DN thymocytes to mature splenic T cells, cells in the early stages of B cell development were found to express it only weakly, with a significant up-regulation between the immature and mature B cell stages. In order to find out whether this was a unique feature of GIMAP1 expression, Real Time-PCR analysis of the expression of all the <italic>GIMAP </italic>gene family members in B cell development was conducted. The results showed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) an up-regulation in the expression of all the <italic>GIMAP </italic>genes during B cell maturation, with the exception of <italic>GIMAP7</italic>. It was also notable that the levels of GIMAP mRNA detected in mature B cells exceeded those for CD4<sup>+ </sup>lymph node T cells for the same family members.

It was of interest to determine whether this expression difference was also seen at the protein level. Unfortunately, no antibody suitable for comparing GIMAP1 protein expression in mouse and rat lymphocytes was available (the crossreactivity of our rabbit polyclonal anti-mGIMAP1 with rat was insufficiently good).

The evidence for a requirement for GIMAP5 in T cell generation and survival is compelling, coming as it does from independent experimental systems. These are, respectively, the analysis of the rat <italic>lymphopenia </italic>mutation present in the type I diabetic BB rat, which has been shown to be due to a premature stop in the <italic>GIMAP5 </italic>open reading frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the development of a mouse strain bearing a targeted deletion of the mouse <italic>GIMAP5 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the use of mouse reaggregate foetal thymic organ culture to examine <italic>GIMAP </italic>gene function by shRNA knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Similarly, evidence from both a knockout mouse strain and a hypomorphic rat variant strain has implicated GIMAP4 in the acceleration of cell death processes in mature T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The tight genomic clustering of the <italic>GIMAP </italic>genes within as little as 100 kb of autosomal DNA prompts the idea that they are coordinately regulated and participating in related functional activities. The data on GIMAP4, GIMAP5 and GIMAP3 [a very close relative of GIMAP5 so far identified only in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]] and their roles in T cell development lend support to this proposal but corroborative evidence with respect to the other members of the GIMAP family is so far lacking. In the case of GIMAP1, however, the published data on its induction in a mouse model of malaria infection were consistent with a possible role in lymphoid (and/or myeloid) cell responses/homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A re-examination of these findings was undertaken, making use of novel serological reagents to assess GIMAP1 at the protein level. Using the specific mAb MAC 420, GIMAP1 was shown to be highly expressed in lymphoid tissues, lung, kidney and heart (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), which is reasonably consistent with published results and on-line data resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Unlike that of GIMAP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], expression of GIMAP1 in the stages of thymic T cell development showed little variation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), a result consistent with previously published real-time PCR analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. By contrast, immature stages in B cell development expressed less GIMAP1 than mature B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Purification of spleen cell subsets revealed similar levels of GIMAP1 expression in T and B lymphocytes, modest expression in the F4/80<sup>+ </sup>macrophage subset and highest expression (on a per cell basis) in NK/NKT cells. The immunohistological appearance of normal spleen showed positive staining in both T and B cell areas, in agreement with the blotting data from separated cells. A number of mouse cell lines expressed GIMAP1: these came from various lineages &#x02013; T, B, NKT and mast cell &#x02013; consistent with the wide distribution seen in lymphoid tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The relatively high expression of GIMAP1 by mature mouse B cells was investigated further since it contrasted with gene expression data obtained for rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Results obtained using both RT-PCR and western blotting approaches (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) suggest that there may be a concerted up-regulation in the expression of most if not all the GIMAPs in mature mouse B cells. This appears to be a species-specific phenomenon since it was not seen in rats, and reference to on-line gene expression databases suggests that it is also not a feature of the expression of GIMAPs in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, and despite extensive efforts, we were unable demonstrate up-regulation of GIMAP1 in an experimental malaria infection as had been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This was the case not only for a primary response to infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) but also for mice made "immune" to malaria following the protocol described in the original papers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and for two differently virulent strains of the parasite. Indeed, GIMAP1 expression remained stubbornly constant despite a variety of treatment schedules that were tried out (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It has to remain a possibility that an unidentified and uncontrolled variable in the conduct of the experiments was responsible for this. In this regard it is worthy of note that a recently published dissertation originating from the laboratory in which the original findings were obtained reports a similar failure to observe GIMAP1 induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Chemical or microbiological contamination of the <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>stocks might have led to the original results but we have failed to up-regulate GIMAP1 expression in splenocytes <italic>in vitro </italic>using a range of Toll-like receptor ligands or cytokines.</p><p>Our studies of GIMAP1 have forced a reconsideration of the conclusions drawn previously about the role that this gene may be playing in a favoured mouse model of malaria. Given the evidence for substantially coordinated regulation of <italic>GIMAP </italic>gene expression, it seems likely that, in common with the better-studied family members such as GIMAP5, GIMAP1 will be shown to participate in the regulation of apoptosis in lymphomyeloid cells. Data consistent with this possibility have come from a study in which cell death was induced in a myeloid leukemic cell line, LTR6, carrying p53 under the control of a temperature-sensitive promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. When p53 expression was induced by a temperature shift to 32&#x000b0;C, <italic>GIMAP1 </italic>was one of several genes that showed increased expression at the RNA level. After 24 hrs, a 6-fold increase in GIMAP1 mRNA was observed by microarray analysis. Our own attempts to establish a survival function for GIMAP1 via siRNA knockdown of its expression have been inconclusive so far. A maximum of only 60% knockdown of protein expression could be achieved in a cell line, and this had no effect on the cells' susceptibility to a number of pro-apoptotic insults (data not shown). Of course, a critical survival requirement for GIMAP1 might doom to failure a simple knockdown approach, since cells in which this protein has been efficiently forced down might not survive the selection procedure. It is possible that germline modification methods in mice may be required to establish the function of GIMAP1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The reported up-regulation of GIMAP1 expression in C57BL mouse spleen in response to <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] is not a robust phenomenon. Defined conditions in which the effect could be reproduced were sought without success. Unfortunately, this experimental malaria system does not appear to be a promising one for the further investigation of <italic>GIMAP </italic>gene function. It also seems unlikely that the study of this gene family holds particular promise for our understanding of the resistance to malaria characteristic of the C57BL strains of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The monoclonal antibody MAC420 should prove to be a useful reagent for the further characterization of the role of this GTPase in immune cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AS generated the immunogen for the production of the anti-GIMAP1 hybridoma, analysed the expression of GIMAP1 protein, conducted malaria infections and QPCR on malaria-infected samples and drafted the manuscript (with GB &#x00026; JP). TL conducted malaria infections, and designed the malaria experiments (with JL). JP drafted and revised the manuscript (with AS, GB). AH made the anti-GIMAP1 hybridoma (with AS). CD validated the QPCR primers and controls and measured GIMAP mRNA levels in lymphocyte subsets. LH and CC purified lymphocyte subsets from rats and mice and western blotted for GIMAP4 and GIMAP8. LH also generated the immunogen for, and validated, the anti-GIMAP8 antiserum. JL designed the malaria experiments (with TL). GB conceived the project and drafted and revised the manuscript (with AS, JP).</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the following for their help: John Coadwell, Geoff Morgan, Martyn Cooke, Margaret Graham and Cecile Voisine.
