Therefore, the quantity of p27 protein appears to mediate tumor susceptibility, and misregulation of p27 expression, rather than loss of its gene, is responsible for decreases in p27 protein levels.

We discovered <italic>inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (Id3)</italic> as a candidate negative regulator of p27 in our screen.

Our strategy was to identify the subset of tumors arising in <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> heterozygotes that contained very low or undetectable quantities of p27 potentially resulting from insertional activation of genes that down-regulated p27. Western analysis of 44 lymphomas induced by M-MuLv in <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed that all of them expressed lower amounts of p27 protein than did normal <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> thymus. Indeed, 10/44 tumors had almost no detectable p27 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030219-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The uniformly lower amounts of p27 protein in lymphomas compared to normal thymus may be a normal consequence of the increased proliferation characteristic of many tumors. However, we hypothesized that the ten lymphomas with undetectable amounts of p27 protein had suffered an M-MuLv-mediated event that caused a further, pathological reduction in p27 expression. From these ten tumors, retroviral junction fragments were cloned by inverse PCR and verified by DNA sequencing as legitimate M-MuLv-genomic DNA junction fragments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). From these we identified 55 unique insertional junction fragments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030219-t001">Table 1</xref>), which was in good agreement with the 53 retroviral insertions we had estimated on the basis of Southern data from the tumors (unpublished data).</p><fig id="pgen-0030219-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Analysis of M-MuLV Induced Lymphomas from <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> Mice</title><p>(A) Western analysis of p27 protein levels in <italic>p27</italic> wild-type and <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> thymus tissues and 20 of the 44 <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphomas.

Insertion sites from at least two independent tumors that colocalized to within a 125-kb genomic interval were designated as common insertion sites (CIS). Our analysis revealed seven CIS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030219-t002">Table 2</xref>). The gene tagged most frequently in the <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphomas was <italic>myc</italic> (seven out of ten). Also, the <italic>C14</italic> CIS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; was found in four of the ten tumors analyzed; <italic>myb, RORC, cux-1, CIS4,</italic> and <italic>LDLR/Mc7</italic> were each detected in two independent tumors. In a large-scale retroviral insertional mutagenesis to identify cancer genes, 62&#x00025; of the CIS were found in only two tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, our data indicate 71&#x00025; of the CIS in <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were detected in two tumors. In addition to the above CIS, two CIS defined by insertions in or near different members of a gene family were detected. <italic>Eya1</italic> and <italic>Eya3</italic>, and <italic>Wnt10b</italic> and <italic>Wnt16</italic> were each identified in this way.

We postulated that three types of genes would be tagged in our screen: genes that modulated p27 levels; genes that were oncogenic by mechanisms other than down-regulation of p27; and genes that represented random, unselected sites of retroviral integration. We tentatively assigned a tagged gene to the first, p27-regulatory category if it: (1) was tagged in multiple independent tumors with low levels of p27 protein expression and was therefore unlikely to represent a random, unselected site of integration, and (2) it was not tagged in any tumor arising in <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> mice. Activation of a gene that down-regulated p27 should provide no selective advantage to cells already lacking the p27 protein. We compared the <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> CIS in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030219-t002">Table 2</xref> to the CIS identified from 277 junction fragments that were isolated in a similar manner from <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> lymphomas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Only CIS4 fulfills our criteria for a regulator of p27 because it was defined by insertions from two independent lymphomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030219-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), and insertions at CIS4 were not found in lymphomas from <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup>mice (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.03). In addition to CIS4, the CIS representing the <italic>Eyes Absent (Eya)</italic> family and the CIS representing the <italic>Wnt</italic> family were not isolated from <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> mice. Therefore, while the <italic>Eya</italic> and <italic>Wnt</italic> genes may also represent candidate negative regulators of p27, we focused here on CIS4.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Id3 Is a Target of M-MuLv Activation in CIS4</title><p>CIS4 was previously isolated in five retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens in <italic>p27</italic> wild-type mice and designated Evi62 (Retrovirus Tagged Cancer Gene Database). Evi62 insertions were mapped near the <italic>Id3</italic> and <italic>E2F2</italic> genes, but the target gene of the retroviral insertions in Evi62 had not been established. In addition to the <italic>Id3</italic> and <italic>E2F2</italic> genes, the <italic>Ddefl1</italic>, <italic>Tcea3</italic>, <italic>Zfp46</italic>, and <italic>Hnrpr</italic> genes mapped to the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030219-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Since <italic>Id3</italic> and <italic>E2F2</italic> regulate the cell cycle, we focused on these two as candidate genes. We used western analysis to determine if <italic>Id3</italic> or <italic>E2F2</italic> was up-regulated by the retroviral insertions in our tumors. Analysis of Id3 protein levels in the lymphomas detected high Id3 expression in the tumor with the retroviral insertion immediately adjacent to the <italic>Id3</italic> gene, and moderate Id3 expression in the other, more distantly tagged tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030219-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). In total, four of the ten lymphomas screened for CIS had high to moderate Id3 expression (unpublished data). One of the tumors with elevated Id3 protein had a retroviral insertion adjacent to the <italic>Notch</italic> gene, which is a known activator of Id3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The mechanism up-regulating Id3 in the fourth lymphoma was not investigated further. In the other set of 34 lymphomas, with higher expression of p27, 30&#x00025; had low expression Id3, and no Id3 expression was detectable in the others (unpublished data). No increase in E2F2 protein was observed in any of our tumors with the M-MuLV insertions (unpublished data). Additionally, no effect on p27 transcription by E2F2 was detected by DNA transcription array experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, our data suggest Id3 was the likely target of the retroviral insertion at Evi62. In addition to Id3, other genes in the region may also be activated by the retroviral insertions and could potentially regulate p27 in coordination with Id3; however, we analyzed Id3 alone as a negative regulator of p27.

Id3 is overexpressed in many cancer types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, and loss of p27 is a significant negative prognostic indicator for many types of human cancers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, analysis of human leukemias by DNA microarrays found increased <italic>Id3</italic> gene expression and decreased <italic>p27</italic> gene expression in the samples (Ross&#x0005f;Leukemia and Schmidt&#x0005f;Leukemia, Oncomine database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;). Therefore, Id3 misregulation of <italic>p27</italic> transcription may be an important mechanism in human cancers.</p><p>Our data demonstrating the control of <italic>p27</italic> transcription as a central mode of regulation downstream of Lck suggested p27 may be regulated similarly in normal developmental processes dependent on p56<sup>lck</sup> signaling, including &#x003b2;-selection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. The role of bHLH/Id proteins in lymphoid development is well established &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the genes regulated by bHLH/Id proteins during &#x003b2;-selection remain unknown. Previously, a cell cycle defect was observed in <italic>E2A</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> lymphocytes when the bHLH protein E47 was added to these cells, a phenotype that could indicate increased <italic>p27</italic> expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Other observations also suggest <italic>p27</italic> may be regulated by the bHLH/Id proteins during &#x003b2;-selection. Specifically, that DN4 cells had reduced <italic>p27</italic> expression compared to small, quiescent DN3 cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;, and impaired DN3 to DN4 maturation was seen with increasing dosage of transgenic p27 expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data confirmed that <italic>p27</italic> transcript was decreased in DN4 cells relative to DN3 cells and correlated the <italic>p27</italic> mRNA decrease with increased <italic>Id3</italic> mRNA at the DN3 to DN4 transition. Therefore, we concluded <italic>p27</italic> may be a critical target of regulation by Lck through Id3 during thymic &#x003b2;-selection.</p><p>We further observed that in a gene-dosage fashion, <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> partly relieved the <italic>lck</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> phenotype, augmenting the efficiency of DN to DP maturation and consequent thymus cellularity. That the DN compartment expanded in absolute cell numbers was an unexpected observation and may reflect more developmental niches available throughout the thymus, as the thymic epithelium increases in response to both maturation and expansion of the lymphoid compartment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d; as well as a consequence of the <italic>p27</italic> mutation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. In more preliminary studies, we examined the effect of <italic>p27</italic> mutation on the absolute block in development in a <italic>lck/fyn</italic> double mutant (M. Tasch and R. Perlmutter, unpublished observations). The residual thymic maturation in the <italic>lck</italic> mutant is due to functional redundancy between Lck and a related Src-family kinase, Fyn, and loss of both p56<sup>lck</sup> and p59<sup>fyn</sup> results in severe thymic hypocellularity and developmental arrest at the DN3 stage. Here, <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> relieved the DN3 arrest and allowed accumulation of a DN4 compartment. In parallel, very low level of expression for CD4 and CD8 was observed, consistent with thymocytes making the initial step in the DN to DP transition. However, this maturation was abortive as bona fide DP cells failed to accumulate. These results are consistent with p27 being a critical target of Lck signaling during thymic maturation, but also indicate that Lck has targets in addition to p27 that are essential for full thymic maturation.</p><p>In conclusion, our novel retroviral insertional mutagenesis screen discovered a repressor of the tumor suppressor p27, and our subsequent analysis identified transcriptional misregulation of the <italic>p27</italic> gene by Id3 as a new mechanism controlling p27 levels in lymphomas. This study highlights the fact that developmental pathways that regulate gene expression in normal cells are often coopted during tumor cell evolution. Thus, Id3 is an essential downstream target of Lck during normal thymic maturation and is activated to drive p27 down-regulation in Lck-driven thymic lymphomas. Finally, having demonstrated the importance of misregulating p27 at the level of gene transcription during lymphomagenesis, it now becomes crucial to understand which transcriptional pathways cause misregulation of <italic>p27</italic> in human cancers, and how frequently this occurs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice and M-MuLV mutagenesis.</title><p>M-MuLv infection and genotyping of the <italic>p27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was previously described in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030219-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.
