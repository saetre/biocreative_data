The role for oxytocin in the pathophysiology of GI complaints is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine genetic variations or polymorphism of oxytocin (<italic>OXT</italic>) and its receptor (<italic>OXTR</italic>) genes in patients with GI complaints without visible organic abnormalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Genetic variants in the <italic>OXT </italic>promoter region, and in the <italic>OXTR </italic>gene in DNA samples from 131 rigorously evaluated patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), 408 homozygous subjects referred for lactase (LCT-13910 C&#x0003e;T, rs4988235) genotyping, and 299 asymptomatic blood donors were compared. One polymorphism related to the <italic>OXT </italic>gene (rs6133010 A&#x0003e;G) and 4 related to the <italic>OXTR </italic>gene (rs1465386 G&#x0003e;T, rs3806675 G&#x0003e;A, rs968389 A&#x0003e;G, rs1042778 G&#x0003e;T) were selected for genotyping using Applied Biosystems 7900 HT allele discrimination assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences in the genotype or allele frequencies in any of the SNPs when IBS patients were compared to healthy controls.

When direct comparing, the A/G genotype was less common in the <italic>OXT </italic>promoter region in controls (p = 0.09) and in subjects with lactase persistence (p = 0.03) compared to subjects with lactase non-persistence. When healthy controls were viewed according to their own LCT-13910 genotypes, the C/C lactase non-persistent controls had a higher frequency for the <italic>OXT </italic>promoter A/G genotype than LCT-13910 T/T lactase persistent controls (41.2% vs 13.1%).</p><p>No significant differences in frequencies of the investigated <italic>OXTR </italic>SNPs were noted in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results suggest that polymorphism in the promoter region of the <italic>OXT </italic>gene is most common in subjects with lactase non-persistence.

These patients are classified as suffering from functional bowel diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Frequently indistinguishable symptoms are seen in the subgroup of patients with lactase non-persistence, which is also common in the adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and reported complaints in this group are surprisingly less correlated to the volume of milk intake, than previously assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Differences in gastric emptying and individual perception of symptoms have been discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Many neuropeptides, e.g. serotonin and norepinephrine, are involved in the regulation of GI sensitivity and motility, and polymorphism in these peptides has been suggested as another possible explanation to symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Oxytocin was long thought to be a hormone primarily involved in parturition and suckling. Recently, oxytocin expression has been found in the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], where it is secreted after a fatty meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and stimulates colonic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has further been demonstrated that systemic administration of oxytocin leads to enhanced gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and that the oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban significantly delays gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In accordance to this, diabetic patients with gastro paresis have no demonstrable postprandial oxytocin release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was thus to examine whether genetic variation or polymorphism in the <italic>OXT </italic>or <italic>OXTR </italic>genes may explain the pathology in numerous patients with GI complaints without organic explanation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was performed according to the Helsinki declaration and approved by the Ethics Committee of Lund University.</p><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>One hundred and thirty-one patients (108 females), mean age 38.2 &#x000b1; 15.1 years, range 20-78 years, who have undergone rigorous evaluations for GI complaints at tertiary care centres in Malm&#x000f6; (N = 43) and in Gothenburg (N = 88) were included in the study. LCT genotyping was performed, and 13 patients were found to have LCT-13910 C/C, 76 patients had LCT-13910 T/T and 38 patients were heterocygotes. In the absence of evident organic disease, and as the patients with LCT-13910 C/C had persistent GI complaints after elimination of milk products in the food, they were regarded as having irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (1, 3). They had predominantly constipation (N = 35), diarrhoea (N = 35) or mixed symptoms (N = 59), whereas clinical subgroups were not defined for 2 patients. Samples and written informed consent for this study were obtained from these patients and from 299 healthy adult blood donors (99 females), mean age 64.5 &#x000b1; 13.0 years, range 41-85 years, who negated all forms of abdominal pain or abnormal bowel habits on a written questionnaire.</p><p>Remnant samples submitted from an additional 319 subjects from predominantly primary care centres to screen for potential lactase non-persistence by analysis of LCT-13910C&#x0003e;T (rs4988235), and who had had homozygous C/C or T/T genotypes were also included in this pilot study. After initial registration of age, sex and genotype, all personal identifiers associated with the samples were destroyed. This procedure is in accordance with the Swedish biobank law. These samples were put together with the 89 patients from tertiary care centres with either homocygous for C/C or T/T. Of these totally 408 subjects, 154 (mean age 30.5 &#x000b1; 18.2 years, range 3-76 years, 113 females) were LCT-13910 C/C homozygotes for lactase non-persistence and 254 (mean age 36.8 &#x000b1; 19.3 years, range 2-81 years, 189 females) were LCT-13910 T/T homozygotes for lactase persistence. Heterozygous C/T samples were excluded from this study to avoid ambiguity in interpretation. Although the samples were not consistently tested for adjacent LCT variants, e.g. LCT-13907 C&#x0003e;G and LCT-13915 T&#x0003e;G, these when rarely present, are frequently noted outside of the main LCT-13910 C/C or C/T clusters. This is seen in 1-2% of samples at our laboratory and was not expected to interfere with interpretations of our results.</p></sec><sec><title>SNP selection</title><p>The <italic>OXT </italic>gene is located on chromosome 20p13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the <italic>OXTR </italic>gene is located on chromosome 3p26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

This polymorphism was observed also in asymptomatic controls when these were divided according to C/C and T/T.</p><p>The symptoms leading to admission for lactase genotyping is abdominal complaints after lactose intake in the form of abdominal pain and bloating, diarrhoea and an excess of gas. These symptoms are often impossible to differ from functional bowel diseases without making a genotyping. Patients referred for lactase genotyping who do not carry the lactase non-persistence genotype, may in the majority of cases suffer from functional bowel diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Even among lactase non-persistence subjects, many patients suffer from functional bowel diseases, and although reducing the milk intake, the symptoms persist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the present study, we chose only homozygote patients to obtain well-defined groups concerning lactase persistence, as individual variations in the lactose absorption, particularly among heterozygotes have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Factors causing this variation of symptoms in response to the same volume of milk intake, or according to different milk products, may include the amount of lactose not absorbed in the gut, differences in the bacterial flora and their metabolism of lactose in colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and the rate of gastric emptying and individual perception of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the present study, the A/A genotype of rs6133010 in the promoter region of the <italic>OXT </italic>gene was more frequent in asymptomatic controls and in lactase persistent subjects than in lactase non-persistent, although statistically significant only in persistent subjects. This suggests that the A/A genotype regulates the GI physiology in a different way compared to A/G. However, when comparing the LCT-13910 genotype in asymptomatic controls, C/C homozygous controls had the highest A/G frequency of all groups. Although the small sample size, this finding suggests that A/G may not be an important factor for the symptomatology, but is coupled to other factors such as LCT-13910 C/C.</p><p>During the last years, further genotypes associated with lactase persistence/non-persistence, e.g. LCT-13907C&#x0003e;G and LCT-13915T&#x0003e;G, have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These genotypes were not tested for in the actual study. However, as these genotypes are uncommon, and only a minority of the population in Sweden comes from the part of the world where these genotypes are most frequent, this may not obscure the picture.</p><p>Previously it has been suggested that oxytocin play a role in the regulation of GI physiology as it has been found in both the myenteric and submucous ganglia in the human GI tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is released in response to a fatty meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], whereas the oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban inhibited gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, oxytocin stimulated colonic peristalsis in healthy women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. On the other hand, studies in animals have shown that oxytocin inhibited gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and contractile motility of the proximal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and distal colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Possible explanation to these divergent results are differences in methods i.e.; dose and administration of oxytocin, in species studied, or in the region of the GI tract examined. Nothing has been described about the role of oxytocin in the pathophysiology of disturbances of GI motility.</p><p>Abdominal pain is the most frequent complaint among GI disturbances. Continuous infusion of oxytocin significantly elevated thresholds for visceral perception of colonic discomfort in patients with IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and increased the threshold for peripheral pain in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Nasal administration of oxytocin had a positive effect on abdominal pain in patients with IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Altogether, this suggests oxytocin to be involved in pain regulation, which is further supported by the expression of the peptide in the dorsal root ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and its widely spread presence in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Estradiol regulates the <italic>OXT</italic>-gene expression in rat uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that estradiol upregulates the oxytocin receptor in the enteric plexus of colon in rats and increases the colon sensitivity to the excitatory effect of oxytocin on colon motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Females have higher levels of oxytocin and estradiol than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and IBS is more common in females than in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In female patients suffering from IBS, blood estradiol and oxytocin levels were significantly lower than in control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. As many GI complaints debute at an age when the estradiol levels fall, lower expression of oxytocin receptors has been one hypothesis for the etiology of GI disturbances. However, differences in hormonal plasma levels may be secondary, and not causal. When comparing the genotype frequency in IBS patients in the table over rs6133010 A&#x0003e;G, the <italic>OXT </italic>gene promoter region which is closely coupled to estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], it seems as though patients with mixed IBS have similar frequencies of the genotypes as healthy controls, and diarrhoea-dominated IBS patients resemble subjects with lactase non-persistence. This finding raises the hypothesis that the symptoms in patients with lactase non-persistence, irrespective of milk intake, may depend on genetic factors resembling IBS patients with diarrhoea. This should be further evaluated in larger studies. However, we could not find any association between gender and polymorphism in the examined SNPs.</p><p>A limitation of this pilot study is the small sample size, and our lack of information concerning specific symptoms in subjects referred for LCT-13910 genotyping from the primary care centres. As people from northern Europe have a higher prevalence of lactase persistence than people from southern Europe, Africa and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], we can assume that the group of lactase non-persistent subjects contained a larger proportion of subjects with a non-Nordic background. These differences in ethnicity can possibly explain the genetic variation to some extent. Alternatively, the <italic>OXT </italic>promoter G allele may lead to increased pain, and thus increased medical evaluation, in patients with lactase non-persistence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our investigation has shown significant differences in genotype frequencies of a SNP in the promoter region of the <italic>OXT </italic>gene in patients with lactase non-persistence. The role of this polymorphism in the pathophysiology and symptomatology of GI complaints remains obscure, as the polymorphism was also present in healthy LCT C/C homozygous controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>GI: gastrointestinal; OXT: oxytocin; OXTR: oxytocin receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MT has substantial contributions to conception and design, analysis and interpretion of data and mainly drafting the manuscript.
