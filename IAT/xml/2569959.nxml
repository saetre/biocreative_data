In its early stage, melanomas can be treated surgically, but once the tumor has progressed, it is difficult to treat and it does not respond to current therapies. The molecular mechanisms underlying melanoma development and progression are still not completely understood, and novel diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as therapeutic targets are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>We have previously reported that phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, increases proliferation and promotes anchorage-independent survival of melanoma cells cultivated as multicellular aggregates in suspension (spheroids). This protective action was at least partly mediated through PKC and MEK-independent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (MAPK/ERK1/2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In an attempt to identify additional genes involved in survival and apoptosis of melanoma cells, we used high throughput gene expression profiling (Affymetrix&#x02122;) to identify differentially expressed genes in untreated cells cultured as monolayer or spheroids, as well as in spheroids treated with PMA and/or the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. The analysis revealed that the <italic>fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7, BLBP </italic>or <italic>B-FABP) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] was among the most significantly differentially expressed genes (unpublished results).</p><p>FABP7 belongs to a family of structurally-related proteins showing tissue-specific patterns of expression. Nine FABPs (FABP1 &#x02013; FABP9), expressed in normal liver, intestine, heart, adipose tissue, epidermis, brain, peripheral nervous system and testis have been identified (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). FABP proteins are involved in lipid metabolism, including uptake and intracellular trafficking of fatty acids and retinoids. In addition, they play a role in gene regulation, cell signaling, cell growth and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Several reports have suggested a possible role for the different FABP proteins in cancer biology, linking their levels with either increasing or decreasing degree of malignancy. Adamson et al. reported that FABP5 (C-FABP/E-FABP) protein expression is higher in prostate cancer compared to prostatic hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, the FABP1 level decreases with progression of colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. FABP7 is highly expressed in glia cells throughout development of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and high FABP7 expression in glioblastomas is related to poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recently, two studies have addressed FABP7 expression in surgical specimens from melanoma patients. While de Wit et al. reported down-regulation of FABP7 in melanomas compared to nevi, Goto et al. found FABP7 to be frequently expressed in melanomas, and suggested that it may play a role in cell proliferation and invasion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In the current study we examined the role of FABP7 in proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of melanoma cells grown <italic>in vitro </italic>and studied possible regulation mechanisms of this protein. In addition, we examined the expression of FABP7 protein in clinical melanoma specimens and assessed the relationship between FABP7 expression pattern and known prognostic variables, cell cycle factors and disease progression. We report that FABP7 is regulated via PKC and the MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in melanoma cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and promotes proliferation and invasion. Moreover, FABP7 expression is associated with tumor thickness and proliferation in melanoma biopsies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and Growth Conditions</title><p>The Wistar Melanoma (WM) cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA) and have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The MeWo cell line was derived from a lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

The cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker Europe, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biochrom, KG, Berlin, Germany). Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), whereas the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Multi-cellular aggregates (spheroids) were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

The results showed no correlation between cytoplasmic FABP7 expression and the expression of the cyclins A, D1 or D3 or the cdk inhibitors p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup>and p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>in either SSM or NM. However, a trend for an association between cytoplasmic FABP7 and Ki-67 (P= 0.07) in SSM was observed, which is in support of our <italic>in vitro </italic>results, suggesting FABP7 involvement in proliferation. Furthermore, expression of activated MAPK/ERK1/2 did not correlate with FABP7 expression. Interestingly, however, we observed that if the cutoff level was changed (only total lack of FABP7 was regarded as low expression), MAPK/ERK1/2 expression did positively correlate with cytoplasmic FABP7 expression in SSM (P= 0.047). This was not the case for NM, regardless of cutoff. Nuclear expression of FABP7 did not correlate with any of the examined markers (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously showed that PMA-mediated PKC activation and activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway contributes to increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis of melanoma cells under anchorage-deprived conditions. In the present study we used gene expression profiling to identify additional genes involved in these processes, and found the <italic>FABP7 </italic>gene to be differentially expressed and down-regulated in WM35 spheroids following both PKC activation and MEK1 inhibition while no differences were observed between monolayer cells and untreated spheroids. PKC activation and MAPK/ERK1/2 down-regulation had opposite effect on anchorage-independent survival of the melanoma cells, but both negatively regulated FABP7. This observation argues against FABP7 involvement in promotion of anchorage-independent survival in these cells. Thus, it is likely that these pathways are regulating additional factors important for survival, independent of FABP7 down-regulation.</p><p>PKC is a well known activator of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and we have previously reported that PMA activates MAPK/ERK1/2 independently of its upstream activator MEK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since PMA treatment down-regulates FABP7 even in the presence of activated ERK1/2 this down-regulation is likely to be PMA/PKC-mediated but MAPK/ERK1/2-independent. Together this suggests that FABP7 can be regulated by both signaling pathways independently in melanoma cells. Several reports have shown that activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway can induce increased activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors &#x003b1;/&#x003b3; (PPAR &#x003b1;/&#x003b3;). Similarly, PKC can both positively and negatively regulate PPAR&#x003b1;-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Binding of PPAR&#x003b3; to its response element, PPRE, has been shown to up-regulate FABP1 and FABP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that FABP7 might also be regulated through this mechanism.</p><p>To further clarify the role of FABP7 in melanomas we used siRNA to down-regulate its expression in the primary WM35 and metastatic WM239 melanoma cell lines. This down-regulation notably inhibited proliferation in both cell lines, but did not affect the degree of apoptosis, arguing for involvement of FABP7 in melanoma proliferation. In support of our results, Goto <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] showed that proliferation of melanoma cell lines is reduced upon down-regulation of FABP7, also without affecting apoptosis. Our results showed that down-regulation of FABP7 negatively influences the invasive potential of melanoma cells, also in agreement with Goto <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] who demonstrated that down-regulation of FABP7 decreased invasiveness in 2 of 6 melanoma cell lines. In further support of this hypothesis are the data of Mita <italic>et al</italic>., who showed that FABP7 increases the invasion properties of astrocytoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Of note, when FABP7 was reintroduced in the metastatic cell line LOX, lacking constitutive FABP7 expression, no effect on apoptosis, proliferation or invasion was observed (preliminary results, data not shown). Similar results were reported by Goto <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in 4 out of 6 melanoma cell lines. However, the reason for the discrepancy between the cell lines is still unclear. Thus, the biological role and detailed functional mechanism of the FABP7 protein in melanoma cells remains to be further investigated.</p><p>Several members of the FABP family have been reported to be differentially expressed in cancer. Loss of expression of FABP4 was reported in bladder cancer while FABP1 and FABP2 are over-expressed in prostate and breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In accordance with Goto <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] we found that FABP7 is expressed in both primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines, as well as in melanocytic lesions. However, there were no clear differences in FABP7 expression levels in primary derived compared to metastatic derived cell lines, suggesting that FABP7 is not associated with tumor aggressiveness. On the other side, cell lines are cultured in artificial environments that can not be directly compared to tumors <italic>in vivo </italic>and a connection to tumor aggressiveness and progression can not be completely excluded. In support of this, analysis of the clinical data showed that thicker SSM expressed higher levels of FABP7. Furthermore, a trend between high levels of FABP7 and reduced disease-free survival for these patients suggest that FABP7 could contribute to disease progression, possibly by increasing the invasion potential of the tumors. In support of our results, a negative association between FABP7 expression and survival was recently observed for patients with glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We also observed a positive trend between FABP7 and the proliferation marker Ki-67 in SSM, suggesting that FABP7 may contribute to increased proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since the patient subgroups in the analyses were small, the suggested clinical significance of FABP7 expression remains to be confirmed in larger patient cohorts.</p><p>In the clinical specimens, FABP7 protein expression was highest in nevi, with no observed differences between primary and metastatic melanoma. This is in accordance with the study by de Wit <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] who reported that FABP7 is down-regulated in melanoma tissue compared to nevi using oligonucleotide arrays. The higher expression of FABP7 in nevi compared to melanomas seems contradictory to the <italic>in vitro </italic>data in the present study, as well as to the association with clinical parameters of disease progression. We are unable to explain this discrepancy at present. However, the majority of benign nevi are terminal lesions that do not progress to melanoma and the molecular events regulating these processes might differ. It is also possible that different expression levels of FABP7 mediate different effects during disease progression.</p><p>Variation in sub-cellular localization of FABP7 has been reported in developing radial glia cells, glioma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Since FABP proteins are considered to be co-activators in PPAR-mediated gene transcription control, this could in part explain FABP7 translocation to the nucleus (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). Recently, it was reported that nuclear expression of FABP7 is restricted to infiltrative tumor types and related to EGFR amplification and over-expression as well as poor prognosis of GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In our melanoma cohort we did not find any association between nuclear expression of FABP7 and disease-free or overall survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We confirmed that FABP7 protein is expressed in melanocytic lesions and showed that it can regulate proliferation and invasion in melanoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results further suggest that FABP7 can be regulated by PKC and the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway through independent mechanisms. In addition, FABP7 expression is associated with proliferation and tumor thickness in the patients with SSM, suggesting that for these patients FABP7 could be a potential target for therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AS carried out the siRNA transfections, invasion experiments and evaluated immunohistochemical staining and drafted the manuscript.
