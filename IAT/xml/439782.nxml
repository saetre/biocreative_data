The proteins that form the conserved machinery for constitutive and regulated exocytosis have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Sollner1">Sollner and Rothman 1996</xref>), and calcium has been identified as the most common trigger for regulated exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Burgoyne1">Burgoyne and Morgan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Jaiswal1">Jaiswal 2001</xref>). However, there is not yet a consensus on the calcium-responsive components involved in this process. It has been suggested that multiple Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding proteins with distinct properties could act as the trigger for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Burgoyne1">Burgoyne and Morgan 1998</xref>). Evidence supporting the role of synaptotagmin I (Syt I) as the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent trigger for synaptic vesicle fusion in several organisms has led to the belief that the members of the synaptotagmin family act as ubiquitous calcium-dependent triggers for exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Brose1">Brose et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Geppert1">Geppert et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Littleton1">Littleton and Bellen 1995</xref>). While Syt I is the most well-studied member of this family, there are at least 15 different synaptotagmin isoforms with differing affinities for calcium and phospholipid and different cellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Chapman1">Chapman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Fukuda1">Fukuda 2003</xref>). Some members of synaptotagmin family (including Syt I) have also been found to regulate endocytosis and even negatively regulate Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Jorgensen1">Jorgensen et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Martin1">Martin et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Morimoto1">Morimoto et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Baram1">Baram et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Tucker1">Tucker and Chapman 2002</xref>). Thus, the role of synaptotagmin family members as Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent triggers for exocytosis is still an open question.</p><p>We have previously identified that in nonprofessional secretory cells calcium preferentially triggers exocytosis of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Jaiswal2">Jaiswal et al. 2002</xref>). A variety of agents that result in calcium increase, including membrane damage, trypanosome invasion<italic>,</italic> calcium ionophores, or the IP3 agonists thrombin or bombesin, trigger lysosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Rodriguez1">Rodriguez et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Caler1">Caler et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Caler2">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Ayala1">Ayala et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Reddy1">Reddy et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Jaiswal2">Jaiswal et al. 2002</xref>). However, the molecular machinery that regulates this calcium-triggered lysosomal exocytosis has remained elusive. Syt VII is the synaptotagmin isoform present on lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Martinez1">Martinez et al. 2000</xref>). It is expressed in most tissues and is present in organisms ranging from nematodes to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Fukuda2">Fukuda et al. 2002</xref>). Syt VII is involved in processes requiring lysosomal exocytosis, namely, release of lysosomal enzymes, repair of membrane rupture, and trypanosome invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Martinez1">Martinez et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Caler2">Caler et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Reddy1">Reddy et al. 2001</xref>). Further, the recent demonstration that cells from Syt VII knockout (<italic>KO</italic>) mice are compromised in these functions supports a role of Syt VII in regulating lysosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Chakrabarti1">Chakrabarti et al. 2003</xref>). To understand how Syt VII regulates lysosomal fusion, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) and studied the behavior of individual lysosomes following calcium increase in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type (<italic>WT</italic>) and Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To monitor the fate of exocytic lysosomes in MEFs, we labeled their lumen using fluorescent dextran (FITC&#x02013;dextran). Treating MEFs with calcium ionophore A23187 or the IP3 agonist bombesin or thrombin caused lysosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">1</xref>B). Fusion of a FITC&#x02013;dextran-loaded lysosome was indicated by a transient increase followed by a decrease in its fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">1</xref>C). The increase in fluorescence was due to a combination of two factors: (a) movement of the lysosome closer to the coverslip, which results in better excitation of its cargo by the evanescent wave; (b) opening of the fusion pore, which results in dissipation of the acidic pH of the lysosomes, resulting in dequenching of the fluorescence of FITC&#x02013;dextran. The rapid decrease in fluorescence was due to the diffusion of lumenal cargo away from the site of fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">1</xref>C). In some of the exocytosing lysosomes, the lumenal fluorescence decreased down to baseline, indicating that they completely released their lumenal cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The fluorescence of other lysosomes did not decrease down to baseline at the site of fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, these lysosomes only partially released their contents upon fusion. To resolve whether partial release represented a very slow diffusion of lumenal content or an opening of the fusion pore that was transient, we observed the lysosomes for longer periods. During partial release, the lumenal fluorescence decreased rapidly within the first second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), but remained relatively constant afterwards, decreasing only at the rate of photobleaching (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for FITC in our setup is 28.5 s). Absence of any subsequent decrease in its fluorescence, even over longer periods, indicated that cessation of release was the result of closure of the fusion pore prior to complete release of the lumenal cargo. Quantitation of the lumenal contents retained in all exocytosed lysosomes analyzed in the <italic>WT</italic> MEFs revealed that only 21&#x00025; completely released their lumenal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, gray bar). The percentage of lysosomes in individual <italic>WT</italic> MEFs that only partially released their lumenal cargo of 70 kDa dextran in response to A23187-induced increase in cellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was 65.3&#x00025; (<italic>n</italic> = 7 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>E, black bars; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020233-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). A comparable fraction of lysosomes, respectively, underwent partial release when calcium increase was triggered by the IP3 agonists thrombin (66.3) or bombesin (69.5), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>E; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020233-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine the fate of the membrane proteins during Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-triggered lysosomal exocytosis, we simultaneously imaged the lysosomal lumenal (TRITC&#x02013;dextran) and membrane (CD63&#x02013;GFP) cargoes in <italic>WT</italic> MEFs. We observed that the membrane proteins were delivered to the plasma membrane during complete release of lumenal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), but not when the lumenal contents were released partially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Even when the lysosomal membrane proteins were delivered to the plasma membrane, their diffusion into plasma membrane was restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g002">2</xref>C; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020233-t002">Table 2</xref>). This is unlike the fate of membrane proteins during exocytosis of biosynthetic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Schmoranzer2">Schmoranzer et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Kreitzer1">Kreitzer et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Schmoranzer1">Schmoranzer and Simon 2003</xref>) or recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Lampson1">Lampson et al. 2001</xref>), where following its delivery to plasma membrane, the vesicular membrane protein diffuses away completely from the site of fusion. Thus, exocytosis of lysosomes in the <italic>WT</italic> MEF is different from other exocytic events in two manners. First, the majority of exocytic lysosomes only partially release their lumenal cargo with no release of membrane proteins. Second, even when the lumenal cargo is completely released, the membrane proteins delivered to the plasma membrane do not diffuse freely, but are retained into punctae at the site of fusion.</p><p>To test the role of Syt VII in regulating these processes and acting as a calcium-dependent trigger for lysosomal exocytosis, we carried out a similar analysis using embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient in Syt VII (Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Chakrabarti1">Chakrabarti et al. 2003</xref>). Absence of Syt VII did not abolish calcium-dependent triggering of lysosomal fusion in response to ionophore, thrombin, or bombesin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">1</xref>F; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">Video S2</xref>). Upon examining individual exocytic lysosomes, we observed two significant differences between the <italic>WT</italic> and Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs. First, in individual Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs, a significantly greater (2-fold) fraction of lysosomes completely released their lumenal contents when the cellular calcium was raised using ionophore (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">Video S2</xref>), thrombin (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001), or bombesin (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>F; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020233-t001">Table 1</xref>). Second, upon complete fusion, the membrane protein of most exocytic lysosomes in Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs diffused freely in the plane of plasma membrane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g002">Figure 2</xref>D; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020233-t002">Table 2</xref>). These phenotypes indicated that the presence of Syt VII restricts complete fusion of lysosomes.</p><p>To identify whether Syt VII restricts lysosomal fusion by preventing its flattening into the plasma membrane or by regulating the size of the fusion pore, we quantified the simultaneous release of dextrans of different sizes in individual lysosomes (10 kDa &#x0005b;Stokes radius = 2.4 nm&#x0005d;, 70 kDa &#x0005b;5.8 nm&#x0005d;, 145 kDa &#x0005b;8 nm&#x0005d;, 250 kDa &#x0005b;10.5 nm&#x0005d;, and 500 kDa &#x0005b;14.7 nm&#x0005d;). Lysosomes were loaded with dextrans of two different sizes, each tagged with a different fluorophore (FITC or TRITC). In <italic>WT</italic> MEFs, all the lysosomes that released the TRITC&#x02013;dextran of 10 or 70 kDa also released similarly sized FITC&#x02013;dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">3</xref>B). Thus, the fluorophore did not appear to affect release of the dextran. The fluorophore also had no affect on the lysosomal uptake of the dextran, as every lysosome that had the TRITC-labeled dextran also had the FITC-labeled dextran (data not shown). Further, just prior to fusion, the fluorescence of the TRITC cargo and the FITC cargo in each lysosome started to increase at the same moment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This increase is the result of the movement of the lysosome to the plasma membrane just prior to fusion, which increases the excitation of the fluorophores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">1</xref>C). Thus, the TRITC and FITC cargos were not only spatially and temporally coincident in the plane of the plasma membrane, but also coincident in the plane perpendicular to the plasma membrane even in a motile lysosome. These observations rule out the possibility that the two fluorophores are present in separate lysosomes.</p><p>In <italic>WT</italic> MEFs, each lysosome that partially released the 10 or 70 kDa TRITC&#x02013;dextran at the same time also partially released the 145 kDa (data not shown) and 250 kDa FITC&#x02013;dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">3</xref>D). However, when the lysosome was simultaneously loaded with 500 kDa FITC&#x02013;dextran and with 70 kDa TRITC&#x02013;dextran, the smaller cargo was released and the larger cargo was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">Figure 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">3</xref>F). This suggests the fusion pore opened large enough to release the smaller but not the larger cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, at the moment of release of the TRITC cargo, the fluorescence from the 500 kDa FITC&#x02013;dextran increased to a significantly greater amount. As the FITC fluorescence is partially quenched by the acidic lumen of the lysosomes, this provided additional evidence in favor of the conclusion that the lysosome formed a fusion pore, without releasing the 500 kDa dextran. The lack of subsequent decrease in the fluorescence of the 500 kDa FITC&#x02013;dextran, when the 70 kDa TRITC&#x02013;dextran fluorescence decreases, indicates that the radius of the fusion pore is smaller than the size of the 500 kDa dextran (Stokes radius = 14.7 nm; diameter, 29.4 nm). We repeated these studies in Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs and found that in these cells all exocytosing lysosomes were able to fully release dextrans of all sizes, including the 500 kDa dextran (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">Figure 3</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g003">3</xref>H). This suggests that the presence of Syt VII blocks complete release of lysosomal contents during exocytosis, potentially by restricting the size of the exocytic pore.</p><p>Since cargo of any size would be released more rapidly through a larger pore, we independently assayed for the size of the fusion pore by measuring the time taken by exocytosing lysosomes to release their lumenal cargo. Increase in FITC&#x02013;dextran fluorescence was taken as the indicator for the time of opening of the fusion pore (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). We measured the time taken for the lumenal fluorescence of individual exocytic lysosomes (fusing partially or completely) to decrease to the post-fusion resting value in <italic>WT</italic> and Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). For most lysosomes (greater than 81&#x00025;) in <italic>WT</italic> MEFs, it took longer than 0.75 s for the fluorescence of the lumenal cargo to reach their post-fusion resting value (gray bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In contrast, in Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs for most lysosomes (greater than 75&#x00025;), this occurred in less than 0.75 s (white bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The increased propensity of lysosomes to rapidly release their lumenal content was also observed when Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> cells were treated with bombesin or thrombin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). This suggests that in the absence of Syt VII, the fusion pore either opens faster, opens to a larger size, or both. While we cannot distinguish among these possibilities, they are all consistent with Syt VII restricting the expansion of the fusion pore.</p><p>To further explore potential consequences of the presence of Syt VII on lysosomal secretion, we analyzed the effect of Syt VII knockout on the time course of initiation of lysosomal exocytosis. Similar to what we observed previously with CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Jaiswal2">Jaiswal et al. 2002</xref>), in <italic>WT</italic> MEFs, lysosomal exocytosis was initiated approximately 35 s after the addition of ionophore and peaked by 110 s (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>; gray bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). In contrast, in Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs, the earliest lysosomal fusion event was observed within 7 s after the addition of ionophore, and it peaked within 40 s (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">Video S2</xref>; white bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). As the time delay for IP3 agonist-induced calcium release varied significantly among the cells within a dish, we could not determine whether these agents have a similar affect on the latency of calcium-triggered lysosomal fusion in Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs.</p><p>While all the behaviors of individual lysosomes described above were independent of the agent used to trigger calcium increase, the bulk cellular behavior, such as the total number of lysosomal fusion events that occur at the basal surface of the cell, was dependent on the agent used to increase the cellular calcium level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020233-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). While ionophore or thrombin triggered exocytosis of a similar number of lysosomes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.46 and 0.51, respectively) in both <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>KO</italic> MEFs, there was a 2-fold decrease (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) when bombesin was used to raise cellular calcium in <italic>KO</italic> MEFs.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been shown that biosynthetic vesicles, secretory granules, and synaptic vesicles can undergo partial release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Holroyd1">Holroyd et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Aravanis1">Aravanis et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Gandhi1">Gandhi and Stevens 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Schmoranzer1">Schmoranzer and Simon 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Taraska1">Taraska et al. 2003</xref>). However, our analysis of calcium-triggered fusion of individual lysosomes has revealed several unique features of this process. In <italic>WT</italic> MEFs, partial fusion is the predominant mode of lysosomal exocytosis. Unlike partial fusion of secretory granules in PC12 cells, which results in incomplete release of the large lumenal cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Holroyd1">Holroyd et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Taraska1">Taraska et al. 2003</xref>), partially exocytosing lysosomes do not release any of the large (500 kDa) lumenal cargo. Similarly, during partial release of lumenal contents, none of the lysosomal membrane protein diffuses into the plasma membrane. The complete release of lysosomal cargo is also unlike the complete release of biosynthetic vesicles, where the membrane proteins of secretory vesicles fully diffuse into the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Schmoranzer1">Schmoranzer and Simon 2003</xref>). In constrast, the lysosomal membrane proteins remain as puncta near the site of fusion. These unique features associated with lysosomal exocytosis are dependent on the presence of Syt VII. Absence of Syt VII causes most lysosomes to fuse completely and allows the membrane proteins of completely fusing lysosomes to diffuse freely into the plasma membrane. Moreover, in the presence of a functional Syt VII, opening of the fusion pore is restricted both temporally (the pores open more slowly and remain open for a short period of time) and geometrically (large lumenal cargo cannot leave and membrane proteins cannot diffuse out into the plasma membrane). Thus, our analysis reveals that Syt VII is not critical for calcium-dependent triggering of lysosomal exocytosis. This is consistent with what has been proposed earlier and observed both in vitro and in vivo for Syt I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Popov1">Popov and Poo 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Martin1">Martin et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Morimoto1">Morimoto et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Mahal1">Mahal et al. 2002</xref>). The effects of Syt VII on the kinetics, size, and extent of calcium-triggered exocytosis of lysosomes in <italic>WT</italic> MEF are also consistent with observations reported for Syt I: the slower dilation of fusion pores caused by overexpression of Syt I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Wang1">Wang et al. 2001</xref>), and a 10-fold increased frequency of asynchronous release in Syt I null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Yoshihara1">Yoshihara and Littleton 2002</xref>). Interestingly, unlike the knockout of Syt I, which blocks the fast component of calcium-triggered exocytosis in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Yoshihara1">Yoshihara and Littleton 2002</xref>), knockout of Syt VII did not abolish calcium-triggered exocytosis in the MEFs. This could reflect different roles played by Syt VII (inhibitor for lysosome fusion) and Syt I (calcium-dependent trigger) in calcium-dependent exocytosis. Alternatively, each synaptotagmin may play multiple roles, including being a trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Geppert1">Geppert et al. 1994</xref>), an inhibitor of asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Yoshihara1">Yoshihara and Littleton 2002</xref>), or an inhibitor of fusion pore dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Wang1">Wang et al. 2001</xref>). While it remains to be determined whether other members of the synaptotagmin family can act as inhibitors of fusion, this possibility is supported by the recent observation that overexpression of Syt IV causes increased partial release of secretory granules in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Wang2">Wang et al. 2003</xref>). Involvement of Syt VII in premature closure of the fusion pore (leading to partial release) is also consistent with the proposed role of Syt I in facilitating the rapid retrieval of vesicular membrane following exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Jorgensen1">Jorgensen et al. 1995</xref>).</p><p>Syt VII function has been shown to be crucial for membrane repair and trypanosome invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Martinez1">Martinez et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Caler2">Caler et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Chakrabarti1">Chakrabarti et al. 2003</xref>). Cells lacking a functional Syt VII show reduced membrane repair and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trypanosoma cruzi</named-content> invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Chakrabarti1">Chakrabarti et al. 2003</xref>). Our observations suggest a few mechanisms by which Syt VII may contribute. Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs lose the restricted fusion of lysosomes: unlike the lysosomes of <italic>WT</italic> MEFs, the membrane-proximal lysosomes in Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs fully release their contents and deliver their membrane proteins to the surface. Since membrane of lysosomal origin has been shown to be required for healing membrane rupture and forming parasitophorous vacuoles during trypanosome invasion, it is possible that retaining the lysosomal membrane components at the site of fusion aids in both these processes. Additionally, upon treatment with bombesin, which may recapitulate the calcium signaling occurring during <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. cruzi</named-content> invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Tardieux1">Tardieux et al. 1994</xref>), total lysosomal exocytosis is decreased 2-fold in the Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEF. This effect is reminiscent of the approximately 2-fold decrease in lysosomal enzyme secretion observed by collagen matrix-mediated wounding of Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Chakrabarti1">Chakrabarti et al. 2003</xref>). We have previously observed that calcium predominantly triggers the exocytosis of membrane-proximal lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Jaiswal2">Jaiswal et al. 2002</xref>). In the Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs, these lysosomes also showed decreased propensity for partial release. Thus, it is possible that the membrane-proximal lysosomes play a role in decreased membrane repair and trypanosome invasion observed in the Syt VII <italic>KO</italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Chakrabarti1">Chakrabarti et al. 2003</xref>). Our analysis of Syt VII function not only adds to the roles of synaptotagmin in regulating calcium-triggered exocytosis, but also provides mechanistic clues regarding how lysosomal exocytosis might regulate membrane repair and pathogen invasion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Cell growth and treatments</title><p>MEFs were prepared from day 13.5 embryos of <italic>WT</italic> and Syt VII-deficient mice, expressing functional (<italic>WT</italic> MEF) or truncated Syt VII (<italic>KO</italic> MEF), as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020233-Chakrabarti1">Chakrabarti et al. 2003</xref>).

Owing to the exponential decay of the evanescent field (blue; top panels in &#x0005b;A&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;B&#x0005d;) away from the coverslip, a lysosome that is more than 150 nm from the cell membrane (black line in top panels in &#x0005b;A&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;B&#x0005d;) is not fluorescent. As this lysosome moves closer (labeled as &#x0201c;entry into evanescent field&#x0201d;), its fluorescence intensity increases. Since the lumen of lysosome is acidic, it quenches FITC fluorescence. As soon as the fusion pore is formed, the lysosomal lumen is rapidly alkalinized resulting in an increase of FITC&#x02013;dextran fluorescence (&#x0201c;pore opening&#x0201d;). Following the pore opening, the dextran is released and it diffuses away from the site of the fusion, causing the lumenal fluorescence to decrease (&#x0201c;release&#x0201d;).</p><p>(D) A histogram of the fraction of lumenal contents released by exocytosing lysosomes.
