This process depends on the local production of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which potently activates angiogenesis, enhances collateral vessel formation, and increases permeability of the microvasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. VEGF expression, which is induced by high glucose levels and hypoxia, plays important roles in both normal and abnormal angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Its levels in the vitreous and aqueous body of the eye have been found to be markedly increased in patients with PDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Moreover, several clinical studies have shown that increased concentrations of VEGF within the eye have a strong correlation to the development of PDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>The hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction that occurs in diabetes is not fully understood, but oxidative stress has been reported to play a key role in the initial insult. Multiple biochemical pathways that are known to increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been linked to hyperglycemia/diabetes-induced vascular injury. These pathways include glucose auto-oxidation, the polyol pathway, and the formation of advanced glycation endproducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The tissues exposed to oxidative stress in diabetes include renal and ocular tissues, which tend to suffer damage and cause some of the complications of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p><p>Oxygen free radicals can generate lipid peroxides, which are the products of oxidative fatty acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. N&#x003b5;-hexanoyl-lysine (HEL), an early stage of lipid peroxide, is formed from a lipid hydroperoxide and a lysine residue. HEL is considered to be one of the stable oxidative stress markers for lipid peroxide and protein modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. A previous report indicated that HEL production is promoted by oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein in rabbit atherosclerotic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of HEL are increased in patients with azoospermia and oligospermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress is caused by the imbalance between ROS generation and antioxidant capacity. Therefore, for the accurate assessment of oxidative stress, it is important to measure both components. The use of potential antioxidant (PAO) is one of the approaches for evaluating antioxidant capacity; in this method Cu<sup>2+</sup> is reduced by various antioxidants to Cu<sup>+</sup>, which is measured by colorimetry. PAO enables the evaluation of not only hydrophilic antioxidants, such as vitamin C and glutathione, but also hydrophobic antioxidants, such as vitamin E. This method also provides a quantitative measurement of the antioxidant capability of various biologic fluids, such as plasma and serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Therefore, PAO is a useful tool for clinical study to determine total antioxidant properties.</p><p>ROS is an angiogenesis inducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>], and oxidative stress is believed to play a pivotal role in the development of diabetic retinopathy. However, relatively little information is available on antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in PDR patients. In the present study, we aimed to clarify antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in the vitreous body from PDR patients. We measured the following parameters in the vitreous and serum obtained from PDR and macular hole (MH) patients: (i) the levels of PAO by evaluating Cu<sup>2+</sup> reduction by all antioxidants present, (ii) the concentrations of HEL (a marker of early stage lipid peroxide), and (iii) the concentrations of VEGF. We also designed the present study (a) to evaluate the relationship between antioxidant activity and oxidative stress in the vitreous body and serum obtained from PDR patients and (b) to determine whether the concentrations of VEGF correlate with other parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and sample collection</title><p>This study was conducted according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was performed after receiving approval from the institutional review committee of Osaka Medical College located in Osaka, Japan.

Undiluted vitreous samples were collected from 42 eyes of 42 individuals (PDR, 21 eyes; MH, 21 eyes) undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and other retinal disorders at Osaka Medical College Hospital. Samples with repeat vitrectomy were excluded. We excluded the persons who had undergone repeated vitrectomy, and after the judgment, we used in the experiments (vitreous samples: PDR, 21 eyes; MH, 21 eyes, serum samples: PDR, 17 patients; MH, 18 patients). imultaneously, serum samples were collected from 35 individuals (PDR, 17 patients; MH, 18 patients). PDR patients with or without macular edema and traction membrane were included. MH patients without neovascular disease and vitreous hemorrhage were used as the controls for nondiabetic ocular disease because MH is caused by vitreomacular traction and we assumed that the vitreous body from patients with MH would be the most similar in constitution to normal eyes.

Previous reports showed that levels of the lipid peroxidative products 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde in the vitreous and serum are significantly higher in patients with diabetic retinopathy than in nondiabetic controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. In the present study, an increase in HEL concentrations was observed in the vitreous bodies obtained from PDR patients, suggesting that oxidative stress (such as ROS generation) may lead to cellular damage and to disease development and pathogenesis in PDR patients.</p><p>ROS generation also plays a pivotal role against angiogenesis via upregulation of VEGF expression both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Colavitti et al. reported that ROS is one of the downstream mediators of the VEGF signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], while Ushio-Fukai and colleagues noted that the angiogenic effects of ROS are attenuated by <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine, a metabolic precursor of reduced glutathione, in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Hence, ROS may perform pivotal roles in various angiogenic events. In the present study, an increase in lipid peroxide (as represented by HEL) and VEGF levels were observed in the vitreous bodies obtained from PDR patients, and there was a significant correlation between HEL and VEGF concentrations in the vitreous bodies from both groups of patients. These results indicate that oxidative stress, such as from increased ROS generation, may play a pivotal role in the upregulation of VEGF in the vitreous body in PDR patients.</p><p>In our study, the intravital antioxidant capacity was increased during a state of enhanced oxidative stress in an advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy; however, some reports have indicated that antioxidant capacity is decreased in PDR patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. This discrepancy in antioxidant capacity may be a result of focusing on different types of antioxidant enzymes. Although catalase and glutathione are decreased in PDR patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], extracellular SOD is upregulated in PDR patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. These results indicate that the increased antioxidant capacity in the present study may result from the summation of increased and decreased antioxidant capacity of various enzymes. However, further investigations are needed to clarify the antioxidant capacity of individual enzymes in PDR patients.</p><p>ROS are products of normal cellular metabolism and are known to act as second messengers. Under pathological conditions, ROS generation in various diseases is accompanied by activation of redox homeostasis to protect cells against oxidative stress. In our study the total antioxidant capacity was increased with accompanying upregulation of HEL in the vitreous body from PDR patient. Understanding how the redox regulatory system increase the antioxidant capacity in the vitreous bodies in PDR patients. Redox regulation is essential machinery to maintain homeostasis of redox state. Major factors to regulate redox state are glutathione, thioredoxin, and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. The glutathione antioxidant system is one of the redox regulations. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is required to maintain the glutathione cycles, but in diabetes mellitus it is known that activation of the polyol pathway leads to depletion of NADPH, which results in the antioxidant capacity of glutathione being decreased in diabetes patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. A second redox regulation is thioredoxin. A previous study indicated that thioredoxin levels are significantly higher in diabetic patients than in healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. A third candidate is nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of phase II detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes, leading to an upregulation of antioxidant gene expression in vascular cells. In diabetes patients <italic>glutathione-s-transferase</italic>, one of the downstream genes regulated by the Nrf2/ARE pathway, is upregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Moreover, hyperglycemia-induced ROS production is exacerbated in Nrf2 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], further implicating the Nrf2/ARE pathway in the defense against oxidative stress in diabetic complications. These findings indicate that the thioredoxin and Nrf2/ARE pathways are candidates for redox regulation to maintain the redox status in the vitreous body from PDR patients. However, further examination is needed to clarify the relationship between PDR and the redox regulation.</p><p>In summary, our results reveal that lipid peroxides and antioxidant activities were increased in the vitreous body and serum samples obtained from PDR patients and there were positive correlations among these factors. Moreover, increased VEGF concentrations were significantly correlated with lipid peroxide concentrations and antioxidant activities in the vitreous body from PDR patients. These results suggest that lipid peroxides and antioxidants to involved in the pathogenesis of PDR.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
