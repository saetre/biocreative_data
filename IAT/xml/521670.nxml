In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a series of mutants of human SMUG1 (hSMUG1), and tested their activity for uracil, hoU, hmU, fU and other bases to elucidate the catalytic and damage-recognition mechanism of hSMUG1. The functional analysis of the mutants, together with the homology modeling of the hSMUG1 structure based on that determined recently for <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> SMUG1, revealed the crucial residues for the rupture of the N-glycosidic bond (Asn85 and His239), discrimination of pyrimidine rings through &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking to the base (Phe98) and specific hydrogen bonds to the Watson&#x02013;Crick face of the base (Asn163) and exquisite recognition of the C5 substituent through water-bridged (uracil) or direct (hoU, hmU and fU) hydrogen bonds (Gly87&#x02013;Met91). Integration of the present results and the structural data elucidates how hSMUG1 accepts uracil, hoU, hmU and fU as substrates, but not other oxidized pyrimidines such as 5-hydroxycytosine, 5-formylcytosine and thymine glycol, and intact pyrimidines such as thymine and cytosine.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reactive oxygen species generated by normal aerobic metabolism, ionizing radiation and exogenous redox-active chemicals induce strand breaks and a plethora of oxidative base lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c3">3</xref>). Many of the oxidative base lesions induce relatively minor and localized distortions in the DNA helix, but they arrest DNA synthesis or direct incorporation of non-cognate nucleotides during DNA replication, thereby resulting in cell death or mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c4">4</xref>). The major cellular mechanism for coping with such genotoxic effects is the base excision repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c7">7</xref>). In addition, the nucleotide incision repair pathway has been recently proposed as an alternative mechanism for repairing oxidatively damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c11">11</xref>). The base excision repair pathway is conserved from bacteria to humans, and is initiated by DNA glycosylases. In the first step of this pathway, DNA glycosylases remove the structurally altered base from the DNA backbone by the associated N-glycosylase activity. The resulting apurinic&#x0002f;apyrimidinic (AP) site is then incised by the AP lyase activity of DNA glycosylases via the &#x003b2;-elimination (or &#x003b2;,&#x003b4;-elimination) of the 3&#x02032; phosphodiester bond. Further processing of this repair intermediate by the sequential action of AP endonuclease (Endo), DNA polymerase and ligase restores DNA.</p><p>It has been long known that in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> oxidative pyrimidine lesions such as thymine glycols (Tg) are excised by Endo III and Endo VIII, whereas oxidative purine lesions such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine are excised by formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c13">13</xref>). To date, the mammalian homologs of Endo III (NTH1) and Endo VIII (NEIL1, NEIL2 and NEIL3) and a functional homolog of formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) have been identified, and their functions have been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c15">15</xref>). However, these <italic>E.coli</italic> and mammalian enzymes exhibit at most marginal activity toward a subset of oxidative thymine lesions including 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) and 5-formyluracil (fU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c18">18</xref>). Mismatched fU is a substrate of nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c19">19</xref>), but its physiological significance remains to be established. hmU resulting from the oxidation of thymine neither arrests DNA synthesis nor directs nucleotide misincorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c21">21</xref>), and hence is innocuous. Conversely, the generation of hmU by the deamination of 5-methylcytosine in CpG sites and subsequent oxidation of the methyl group (or vice versa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c22">22</xref>) induce mutations since a non-cognate nucleotide, dAMP, is inserted opposite hmU during DNA replication. Despite suffering no damage in the Watson&#x02013;Crick face, fU promotes misincorporation of dGMP and hence is mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c25">25</xref>). The underlying mechanism involves the mispairing of the ionized form of template fU and incoming dGTP in an anti-wobble structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c26">26</xref>). Thus, hmU and fU need to be removed from DNA to avoid mutations.</p><p>The hmU-excising activity in mammalian cells was demonstrated 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c28">28</xref>) and has recently been attributed to single-strand selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c29">29</xref>). SMUG1 was originally identified as uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) exhibiting a preference for single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c30">30</xref>), but later it was shown to be active for double-stranded DNA. Analyses of the residual activity for uracil (U) in UDG-knockout mice suggest a backup function of SMUG1 for UDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c32">32</xref>). The fU-excising activity in <italic>E.coli</italic> and mammals has also been identified recently as AlkA (3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II) and SMUG1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>). Interestingly, the mammalian functional homolog of AlkA (MPG) exhibits no activity for fU. Detailed investigations of the substrate specificity of human and rat SMUG1 have revealed that together with U, SMUG1 excises 5-hydroxyuracil (hoU), hmU and fU, bearing an oxidized group at ring C5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>). The damage-excising activity for these three lesions in HeLa cell extracts was neutralized almost completely by the antiserum of SMUG1. Thus, SMUG1 is a new member of DNA glycosylases involved in the repair of oxidative base lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c7">7</xref>). Interestingly, SMUG1 does not excise cytosine lesions bearing an oxidized group at ring C5 (5-hydroxycytosine (hoC) and 5-formylcytosine), C5&#x02013;C6 saturated thymine (Tg and 5,6-dihdrothymine), and intact thymine and cytosine, indicating an exquisite damage-recognition mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structures of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> SMUG1 (xSMUG1) complexed with DNA have been recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c34">34</xref>). xSMUG1 was found to be bound to the end of the oligonucleotide substrate, and hence the complex is not a productive one. However, the structure indicates that xSMUG1 is a member of the UDG structural family and has chimeric active site residues that are topologically equivalent to those of UNG and MUG&#x0002f;TDG enzymes. In addition, the xSMUG1 crystals soaked in free U and hmU bases suggest hydrogen bonds that may be pertinent to the recognition of the C5 substituent for U and hmU. However, no functional analysis of amino acid residues involved in catalysis and damage recognition has been performed. In this study, we prepared a series of mutant human SMUG1 (hSMUG1) proteins by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed their activity toward various oxidative base lesions to uncover the catalytic and exquisite damage-recognition mechanism. Here, we report the functionally important residues of hSMUG1 for catalysis, discrimination of pyrimidine bases and recognition of the oxidized group at ring C5. These data are further discussed in light of the homology modeling of the hSMUG1 protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotide substrates</title><p>The oligonucleotides containing U (19U), hoU (25HOU), hoC (25HOC), hmU (25HMU), fU (25FU) and Tg (19TG) were prepared as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c18">18</xref>) and are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb1">1</xref>.

The GST-tagged hSMUG1 proteins were affinity purified on a glutathione Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) and digested with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences). The hSMUG1 proteins without a GST tag were purified on an SP Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences) and stored in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM DTT, 0.005% Triton X-100 and 50% glycerol at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. The wild-type and mutant hSMUG1 proteins contained two extra N-terminal amino acids (Gly-Ser) from the GST linker. Purified hSMUG1 proteins were physically homogeneous and showed a single band of the expected size (30 kDa) in SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis (Figure S1). The protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard.</p></sec><sec><title>Circular dichroism spectroscopy</title><p>The hSMUG1 proteins in stock buffer were extensively dialyzed against 25 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT and 10% glycerol at 4&#x000b0;C to change the buffer composition, and the protein concentration was adjusted to <italic>A</italic><sub>280</sub> &#x0003d; 0.3&#x02013;0.4 using the same buffer. Far-ultraviolet (UV) circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on a Jasco J-720W spectropolarimeter (calibrated with a 0.003% aqueous solution of <sc>d</sc>-camphor-10-sulfonate) at 20&#x000b0;C using a quartz cuvette with a 1 mm path length as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c36">36</xref>). Each sample was scanned 16 times, and noise reduction was applied.

The concentration of NaCl was varied to ensure optimal activity: 20 and 50 mM for the substrates containing damage:A and damage:G pairs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>). The amount of protein (0.1&#x02013;200 ng) and the incubation time (3&#x02013;90 min) were varied depending on the enzyme activity such that the yield of products was linearly related to the amount of protein and incubation time (for detailed conditions, see tables and Figure S2). The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (final concentration 0.1 M). The sample was heated at 70&#x000b0;C for 5 min to cleave AP sites and then neutralized with 1 M acetic acid. The products were separated by 16% denaturing PAGE, and the radioactivity in the gel was analyzed on a Fuji BAS2000 phosphorimaging analyzer. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme reactions were determined in a similar manner except that the substrate concentration was varied up to 200 nM depending on the enzyme. The appropriate range of the substrate concentration for the parameter analysis was determined from the preliminary experiments. The parameters were evaluated from the plots of substrate concentration versus initial velocity using a hyperbolic curve-fitting program.</p></sec><sec><title>Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays</title><p>The oligonucleotide substrates containing U (19U&#x0002f;A and 19U&#x0002f;G) or hmU (hmU&#x0002f;A and hmU&#x0002f;G) (all 1 nM) were incubated with 100 ng of wild-type and mutant hSMUG1 in 25 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mg&#x0002f;ml BSA and 50 mM NaCl (total volume 5 &#x003bc;l) on ice for 30 min.

The superposition of the 3D structures of UNG and MUG&#x0002f;TDG enzymes shows that the active site of UDG enzymes comprises two moderately conserved polypeptides (motifs 1 and 2 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>A). In UNG enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c45">45</xref>), Asp in motif 1 and His in motif 2 are conserved, and they are indispensable for the unusually efficient hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond. The hydrogen bond from Asn between motifs 1 and 2 to the O4 carbonyl and N3H imino of U discriminates against the N4 amino and N3 <italic>tert</italic>-amino of cytosine. The &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking interaction of Phe at the C-terminus of motif 1 stabilizes flipped-out U. Finally, Tyr in motif 1 confers a steric barrier against the methyl group of thymine, hence preventing productive binding. In MUG&#x0002f;TDG enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c47">47</xref>), Tyr in motif 1 is replaced by Gly, which confers little steric barrier, hence accepting thymine as a substrate. Asp and His involved in catalysis are also replaced by two Asn residues (MUG), or Asn and Met (TDG). In the crystal structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug, a water molecule is positioned near deoxyribose-C1&#x02032; via hydrogen bonds to the side-chain amide and main-chain carbonyl of Asn in motif 1. Comparison of these features of UNG and MUG&#x0002f;TDG with those of hSMUG1 indicates that hSMUG1 has a hybrid active site structure of UNG and MUG&#x0002f;TDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c30">30</xref>): Phe98 (motif 1), Asn163 (between motifs 1 and 2) and His239 (motif 2) are conserved between hSMUG1 and UNG, whereas Asn85 and Gly87 (both in motif 1) are conserved between hSMUG1 and MUG&#x0002f;TDG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>A). In light of the putative functional conservation of the critical residues among the UDG superfamily, it is likely that Asn85 and His239 of hSMUG1 catalyze the rupture of the N-glycosidic bond, Asn163 and Phe98 discriminate pyrimidine bases and Gly87 or proximal residues recognize the C5 substituent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>B). Thus, the hSMUG1 proteins carrying mutations at these residues were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis in the present study (indicated by arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>CD spectra of hSMUG1 proteins</title><p>The secondary structures of wild-type and mutant hSMUG1 proteins were analyzed by far-UV CD spectroscopy. The wild-type hSMUG1 exhibited a large negative ellipticity band centered at 208 nm that was indicative of a significant content of &#x003b1;-helical structure, together with a shoulder around 220 nm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f2">2</xref>A). The CD spectrum of the N85A mutant essentially superposed that of wild-type hSMUG1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f2">2</xref>A); this was also the case for N163D, G87A&#x0002f;S&#x0002f;F and F89G&#x0002f;A&#x0002f;S mutants (data not shown). The H239L and H239N mutants exhibited spectra similar to that of the wild type, but the negative ellipticity of the shoulder around 220 nm was slightly decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f2">2</xref>B). A similar decrease was observed for F98H&#x0002f;L, G90A and M91A mutants (data not shown). The CD spectra were analyzed for secondary structural elements by the SELCON3 program with 29 basal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c48">48</xref>). The wild-type hSMUG1 and mutants with superposable spectra (N85A etc.) contained 50% &#x003b1;-helix, 10% &#x003b2;-sheet, 18% &#x003b2;-turn and 22% random structures. The mutants that exhibited slightly different spectra (H239L etc.) contained 49&#x02013;56% &#x003b1;-helix, 9&#x02013;11% &#x003b2;-sheet, 17% &#x003b2;-turn and 19&#x02013;25% random structures. Considering the estimation errors of the analysis program (5&#x02013;10%), the present CD data suggest that the mutant hSMUG1 proteins undergo no gross alterations of secondary structures and backbone conformations as compared with wild-type hSMUG1. We also found that there were no systematic correlations between the observed spectral changes and the activity of the mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity of hSMUG1 mutants for U, hoU, hmU and fU</title><p>Duplex oligonucleotide substrates containing U:G, hoU:G, hmU:A (or hmU:G) and fU:A (or fU:G) pairs were incubated with wild-type and mutant hSMUG1, and nicked products were quantified by PAGE analysis after alkaline treatment. The amount of enzyme and the incubation time were varied depending on the activity of enzyme (for more details see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb2">2</xref>). The damage-excising activity per nanogram of protein was determined from the initial slope of the plot of the product yield against the incubation time and normalized to that of wild-type hSMUG1 for each substrate. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb2">2</xref> summarizes these data and demonstrates the functional importance of mutated amino acids in a semi-quantitative manner (for quantitative analysis, see the next section).</p><p>The mutation of the residues involved in the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond (N85A and H239L) markedly impaired the damage-excising activity of hSMUG1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb2">2</xref>). The extent of reduction was similar for U:G, hoU:G, hmU:A and fU:A. The activities exhibited by N85A and H239L mutants were two and four orders of magnitude lower than that of wild-type hSMUG1, indicating that the role of His239 in the rupture of the N-glycosidic bond is more crucial than that of Asn85. The <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug has Asn at the position of His239 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>A). However, the H239N mutant carrying this mutation had significantly lower activity (by three orders of magnitude) than the wild type, though the H239N mutant showed a slightly higher activity than the H239L mutant (&#x0223c;10-fold). This difference might be due to the partial restoration of the hydrogen bond between the side-chain amide of substituted Asn239 to the O2 carbonyl of the base.</p><p>The substitution of Leu for Phe (F98L) involved in the discrimination of pyrimidine ring through the &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>B) resulted in damage-excising ability for U:G, hoU:G, hmU:A and fU:A being two orders of magnitude lower than that of the wild type (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb2">2</xref>). However, the F98H mutant carrying an aromatic side chain (imidazole) retained activity comparable to wild-type hSMUG1. The contrasting results with the F98L and F98H mutants are indicative of the crucial role of &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking interaction in base discrimination, and further elucidates a mechanism explaining how hSMUG1 discriminates against base lesions that lose aromaticity, such as Tg and 5,6-dihydrothymine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>). It is noted that neither F98L nor F98H mutants with distinct base-stacking capacities excised Tg even when 19TG&#x0002f;A was incubated with copious enzymes (data not shown). The substitution of Asp for Asn (N163D) that also participates in base discrimination (i.e. U versus C) impaired the damage-excising activity for U:G, hoU:G, hmU:A and fU:A. In UNG enzymes, the hydrogen-bonding specificity of the side-chain amide of the conserved Asn (equivalent to Asn163 of hSMUG1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>B) is compatible with the Watson&#x02013;Crick face of U but not with cytosine, and hence discriminates against cytosine. Consistent with this interaction, the Asn-to-Asp mutation confers a weak cytosine-excising activity on human UNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c49">49</xref>). Thus, we examined whether this is also the case for hSMUG1. The N163D mutant of hSMUG1 exhibited no appreciable cytosine-excising activity for a matched C:G pair and mismatched C:A, C:T and C:C pairs even when the substrates (25C&#x0002f;G etc.) were incubated with copious N163D mutant (100 ng) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f3">3</xref>A). Similar results were obtained with the wild-type and N85A mutant of hSMUG1 used as controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f3">3</xref>A). In contrast, the N163D mutant but not the wild-type or the N85A mutant showed a clear hoC-excising activity, particularly for mismatched hoC (hoC:A, hoC:T and hoC:C) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f3">3</xref>B). The amount of N163D mutant required to detect the activity (i.e. 100 ng) indicates that the hoC-excising activity of the N163D mutant is weak but still significant. A possible mechanism underlying the distinct activities of the N163D mutant for C and hoC is mentioned in Discussion.</p><p>The UNG enzymes have Tyr at the position of Gly87 of hSMUG1 that packs against the C5 substituent, thereby rejecting thymine but accept U, whereas MUG&#x0002f;TDG enzymes have Gly at this position and accept both thymine and U. Although the SMUG1 family has Gly (Gly87) as with MUG&#x0002f;TDG enzymes, it accepts U derivatives bearing a hydrophilic group at ring C5 (hoU, hmU and fU) but not a hydrophobic group (thymine). On the basis of these data, we have previously suggested hydrophilic interactions between the C5 substituent and the active site residue in hSMUG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>). In the present study, the residues lying in the vicinity of the C5 substituent (GPFGM in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>B) were changed systematically, and the activities of the mutants were assayed with oligonucleotide substrates containing U:G, hoU:G, hmU:G and fU:G (all in a mismatched base pair). The activities normalized to that of wild-type hSMUG1 are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f4">4</xref>. Note that both wild-type and mutant hSMUG1 exhibited a slightly higher activity for mismatched substrates (i.e. opposite base &#x0003d; G) than for matched substrates (i.e. opposite base &#x0003d; A), but both types of substrates gave essentially the same results with respect to the activity relative to wild-type hSMUG1. The substitution of Gly87 by Ala or Ser (G87A and G87S) impaired the damage-excising activity for U bearing a small hydrogen atom at ring C5 as well as hoU, hmU and fU, indicating a discriminating interaction between the small side chains of Ala and Ser with the bases. hmU with the most bulky C5 substituent was the poorest substrate of the G87A and G87S mutants. The discrimination was further evident with the G87F mutant with a bulky side chain. The mutation of Phe89 (F89G, F89A and F89S) and Met91 (M91A) did not severely hamper the damage-excising activity for U, hoU, hmU and fU, suggesting that the side chains of Phe89 and Met91 have no contact with the C5 substituent. This proves to be the case by the structural analysis of hSMUG1 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>A and D). Interestingly, the G90A mutant lost the U-excising activity almost completely and retained a weak but significant activity for hoU, hmU and fU, suggesting distinct interaction modes of hSMUG1 toward U and other bases (hoU, hmU and fU).</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetic parameters of hSMUG1 mutants</title><p>To obtain further insight into the catalytic and damage-recognition mechanism, the enzymatic parameters of hSMUG1 mutants were determined using 19U&#x0002f;G as a substrate (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb3">3</xref>). The relative catalytic efficiency of hSMUG1 mutants (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb3">3</xref>) correlates well with the activity data for U in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb2">2</xref>. The N85A, H239L and H239N mutants carrying mutations in catalytic residues exhibited significant reductions in U-excising activity and showed the simultaneous decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and affinity for the substrate (i.e. increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>). As expected from the nature of mutations, the decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> was greater than that in affinity in these mutants. However, H239L and H239N mutants exhibited not only a large decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (380- and 120-fold relative to the wild type, respectively) but also a fairly large decrease in affinity (34- and 42-fold, respectively) as compared with the N85A mutant (3.4-fold). When 25HMU&#x0002f;G containing an hmU:G pair was used as a substrate for the catalytic mutants (N85A and H269L), similar parameter changes were observed (Table S2). The order of affinity for the substrates containing U and hmU determined by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (wild-type &#x02265; N85A &#x0003e; N163D &#x0003e; H239L, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f5">5</xref> and S3) further confirmed a large affinity decrease in the H239L mutant compared with the N85A mutant. Thus, the hydrogen bond of His239 to the O2 carbonyl of the base (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>B) has two crucial roles: (i) adjustment of the base orientation in the pre-transition state to increase affinity and (ii) stabilization of the enolate intermediate in the transition state to increase <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. Interestingly, the F98L mutant also exhibited a large decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (160-fold) together with a moderate decrease in affinity (11-fold), suggesting that proper adjustment of the base orientation by Phe98 through the &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking interaction is crucial not only for base binding but also for efficient catalysis. In contrast, the F98H mutant, presumably retaining the &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking capacity, exhibited 12-fold higher <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> than the wild type, but at the same time exhibited a 14-fold reduction of affinity, implying some as yet unknown alterations of the reaction mechanism. The opposite parameter changes of the F98H mutant resulted in activity comparable to wild-type hSMUG1. Similar results were obtained for the F89A and M91A mutants with their side chains not directly interacting with the base (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>A and D). The results obtained for the F98H, F89A and M91A mutants indicate that their apparent activity is comparable to that of wild-type hSMUG1, but it involves a slightly modified reaction mechanism. From the kinetic viewpoint, wild-type hSMUG1 with a high damage affinity is better suited than the F98H, F89A and M91A mutants when searching for rarely occurring damage in the genome. This may also explain why hSMUG1 variants such as these have not evolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Homology modeling of hSMUG1 structures</title><p>xSMUG1 is a member of the UDG structural family and has a chimeric active site of UNG and MUG&#x0002f;TDG enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c34">34</xref>) as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>B. We performed homology modeling of wild-type and mutant hSMUG1 by taking advantage of a high sequence homology between xSMUG1 and hSMUG1. The sequence used for modeling had 66% identity (residues 26&#x02013;269 of hSMUG1 and 37&#x02013;280 of xSMUG1), allowing fairly accurate prediction of the structure of hSMUG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c38">38</xref>). The residues in motifs 1 and 2 and Asn163 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>A) are conserved between hSMUG1 and xSMUG1. The backbone of wild-type hSMUG1 virtually superposed that of xSMUG1 with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.37 &#x0212b; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f6">6</xref>A). Moreover, the position and orientation of the active site residues were well conserved between the two proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f6">6</xref>B). The backbone structures of wild-type hSMUG1 and the G87A and G90A mutants were indistinguishable (data not shown). The xSMUG1 crystals soaked in free U and hmU bases have hydrogen bonds that may be pertinent to the recognition of the C5 substituent for U and hmU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f6">6</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c34">34</xref>). The O4 carbonyl of U bound in the active site pocket makes water-bridged hydrogen bonds to the main-chain NHs of Gly98 and Met102 (equivalent to Gly87 and Met91 of hSMUG1), whereas the C5 hydroxymethyl of hmU displaces the water molecule and directly forms similar hydrogen bonds. If thymine is placed at the same position as hmU, the C5 methyl also displaces the water molecule but cannot make any hydrogen bonds to the main chain due to its hydrophobicity, thereby preventing productive binding of thymine. Although one must take precautions about whether the same interaction schemes are applicable to the base constrained by the DNA backbone, interactions revealed for free bases provide testable models for how hSMUG1 recognizes U, hoU, hmU and fU in DNA via specific water-bridged (U) or direct (hoU, hmU and fU) hydrogen bonds to the backbone, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f6">6</xref>C. The superposed structures of hSMUG1 and the xSMUG1 complex indicate that the C5 hydroxyl of hoU displaces the bridging water molecule due to the repulsive Van der Waals interaction. Accordingly, we tentatively assume that hoU with a short C5 arm moves slightly toward the backbone of Gly87 and Met91 to optimize the hydrogen bonds to the backbone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f6">6</xref>C). We assess the consistency between the structural data of the modeled hSMUG1 proteins and the results of the functional analysis of the mutants in Discussion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the crucial residues of hSMUG1 involved in the rupture of the N-glycosidic bond (Asn85 and His239), discrimination of pyrimidine rings (Phe98 and Asn163) and recognition of the C5 substituent (Gly87&#x02013;Met91). The substitution of Asn85 by Ala (N85A) and that of His239 by Leu (H239L) significantly hampered the damage-excising activity (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb3">3</xref>) as reported for MUG&#x0002f;TDG and UNG enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c50">50</xref>). Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed for the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond by UNG enzymes. One mechanism proposes nucleophilic attack on deoxyribose-C1&#x02032; by a water molecule activated by the conserved Asp, with the conserved His coordinating the O2 carbonyl of U stabilizing the negative charge that develops on U as the reaction proceeds (associative SN2 cleavage mechanism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c42">42</xref>). The other mechanism proposes the dissociative cleavage of the glycosidic bond to relieve the conformational strain of U and deoxyribose in the flipped-out nucleotide (dissociative SN1-like mechanism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c51">51</xref>). The resulting U enolate anion is stabilized by the conserved His, and the deoxyribose oxocarbenium cation reacts with a water molecule positioned near C1&#x02032; by the conserved Asp. Like MUG&#x0002f;TDG enzymes, hSMUG1 has Asn (Asn85) instead of Asp, which is conserved in UNG enzymes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>A). Thus, the Asn85 of hSMUG1 can either activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack (associative SN2 mechanism) or position it near C1&#x02032; for the reaction with the deoxyribose oxocarbenium cation (dissociative SN1-like mechanism). As mentioned in Results, the His239 of hSMUG1 likely adjusts the orientation of the base (U, hoU, hmU or fU) and stabilizes the enolate intermediate by delocalizing the developing negative charge in both mechanisms. A new UDG family (family 4) has been recently identified that lacks polar residues for the activation or positioning of a water molecule in motif 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c52">52</xref>). The present study shows that the mutation of His239 (H239L) results in a much greater reduction in the damage-excising activity of hSMUG1 than does the mutation of Asn85 (N85A) (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb3">3</xref>). These data together suggest that hSMUG1 employs the dissociative SN1-like mechanism to rupture the N-glycosidic bond.</p><p>hSMUG1 is unique among DNA glycosylases in recognizing the oxidized C5 substituent of U derivatives. We have previously suggested hydrophilic interactions between the C5 substituent and the active site pocket of hSMUG1 as key interactions for damage recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>). This mechanism has been supported by the structure of xSMUG1 complexed with free U or hmU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f6">6</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c34">34</xref>), though the bases are not constrained by the DNA backbone. To fill a gap between the data with free bases and those with bases constrained by actual DNA, we systematically analyzed the effect of mutations that may be pertinent to the recognition of the C5 substituent (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f4">4</xref>). The mutants of Gly87 and Gly90 exhibited reductions in damage-excising ability, whereas those of Phe89 and Met91 were only moderate to negligible (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f4">4</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref> shows the structures, built by homology modeling, of Gly83&#x02013;Ala92 residues of the wild-type and G87A and G90A mutants of hSMUG1. The backbone structure of wild-type hSMUG1 almost superposed those of the xSMUG1&#x02013;U (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>A) and xSMUG1&#x02013;hmU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>D) complexes. The Gly83&#x02013;Ala92 residues of hSMUG1 (light blue) are nearly indistinguishable from the corresponding ones of xSMUG1 (Gly94&#x02013;Ala103, white). Thus, like xSMUG1, the O4 carbonyl of U can make water-bridged hydrogen bonds to the main-chain NHs of Gly87 and Met91 of hSMUG1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>A), and the C5 hydroxymethyl oxygen of hmU can make direct hydrogen bonds to the same backbone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>D). When the G87A mutant superposes the xSMUG1 complex, the side-chain methyl of Ala87 makes repulsive Van der Waals contacts with the ring C5 (3.76 &#x0212b;) and C6 (3.65 &#x0212b;) of U and the oxygen atom (3.36 &#x0212b;) of bridging water (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>B), where the numbers in parentheses are the heavy-atom distance to the methyl carbon of Ala87. Similarly, the Ala87-methyl also makes repulsive contacts with the ring C5 (3.58 &#x0212b;) and C6 (3.45 &#x0212b;) of hmU and the CH<sub>2</sub> (3.15 &#x0212b;) and O (3.51 &#x0212b;) of the C5 hydroxymethyl (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>E). In view of the structural similarity, similar discriminating interactions are also expected for fU and hoU. It is possible that these repulsive interactions displace the substrate base (and the bridging water molecule for U) and hamper the formation of hydrogen bonds crucial for the direct (hoU, hmU and fU) or indirect (U) recognition of the C5 substituent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f4">4</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the structure of the G90A mutant superposed on the xSMUG1 complexes also reveals repulsive Van der Waals contacts of the side-chain methyl of Ala90 with the oxygen atom (2.28 &#x0212b;) of bridging water for U (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>C) and the CH<sub>2</sub> (2.83 &#x0212b;) and O (2.70 &#x0212b;) of C5 hydroxymethyl of hmU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f7">7</xref>F), where the numbers in parentheses are the heavy-atom distance to the methyl carbon of Ala90. The displacement of bridging water due to the close contact with the Ala90-methyl accounts well for the observed severe impairment of the U-excising capacity of the G90A mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f4">4</xref>). Conversely, the same mutant excised hoU, hmU and fU with a low but significant efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f4">4</xref>). The distinct distances of the Ala90-methyl to the bridging water (&#x0223c;2.3 &#x0212b;) and the C5 substituent (&#x0223c;2.8 &#x0212b;) correlates with the observed activity difference (U &#x0003c; hmU, hoU and fU). However, the C5 substituents of hmU, hoU and fU are too close to the Ala90-methyl to partially relieve the repulsive interaction, implying a limitation of analyses based on the crystal structure with the diffused free base. It is likely that the C5 substituents of hoU, hmU and fU lie slightly distant from the modeled Ala90-methyl when they are actually constrained by the DNA backbone. It is also not clear from the present model as to why the displacement of the bridging water for U in the G90A and G87A mutants leads to opposite effects on <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (22-fold decrease with G90A and 3-fold increase with G87A relative to the wild type), while affinity reduces in both mutants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh859tb3">3</xref>).</p><p>The N163D mutant but not wild-type hSMUG1 excised hoC with a low but significant efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f3">3</xref>B). The C5 hydroxyl of hoC can form hydrogen bonds to the backbone like hoU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f8">8</xref>A and B), but the hydrogen-bonding specificity of the side-chain amide of Asn163 of wild-type hSMUG1 is incompatible with the Watson&#x02013;Crick face of hoC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f8">8</xref>B). The present modeling data show that the orientation of the side-chain amide of Asn163 is locked by the hydrogen bond to the main-chain NH of Met84. This conformational restriction is crucial since otherwise a side-chain rotamer with the flipped amide group can make hydrogen bonds to the Watson&#x02013;Crick face of hoC. Moreover, the amide NH<sub>2</sub> in the locked conformation makes a repulsive contact with the N4 amino of hoC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f8">8</xref>B). The same unfavorable interaction is expected for 5-formylcytosine, which is not a substrate of hSMUG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>). Presumably, the N163D mutant accommodates hoC through the hydrogen bonds to the C5 hydroxyl and partially restores one to the N4 amino (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f8">8</xref>C), and excises hoC with a low but detectable efficiency. Conversely, the N4 amino of cytosine has a repulsive Van der Waals contact with the water molecule bound to the backbone of the wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f8">8</xref>D) and N163D mutant of hSMUG1, and is unable to make any stable hydrogen bonds to the backbone. Thus, both the wild-type and N163D mutant of hSMUG1 can discriminate against cytosine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f3">3</xref>B). The N163D mutant prefers mismatched hoC to matched hoC as a substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh859f3">3</xref>B), as does wild-type hSMUG1 for U, hoU, hmU and fU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c53">53</xref>) (this study). The molecular basis of the preference has not been fully established, but is possibly related to the flip-out mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh859c54">54</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified the crucial residues of hSMUG1, a new member of DNA glycosylases for oxidative damage, involved in damage-recognition and catalysis. Determination of the 3D structure of the productive hSMUG1&#x02013;DNA complex will provide further insight into the underlying mechanisms of action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_17_5291__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_17_5291__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh859f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Conserved motifs of the UDG superfamily and expected interactions in the active site pocket of hSMUG1.
