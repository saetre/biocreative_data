Although the disease is known to be caused by mutations in the <italic>ABCA1</italic> gene, the mechanism by which lesions in the ABCA1 ATPase effect this outcome is not known. The inability of ABCA1 knockout mice (<italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) to load cholesterol and phospholipids onto apoA1 led to a proposal that ABCA1 mediates the transbilayer externalization of phospholipids, an activity integral not only to the formation of HDL particles but also to another, distinct process: the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages. Expression of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of both macrophages and their apoptotic targets is required for efficient engulfment of the apoptotic cells, and it has been proposed that ABCA1 is required for transbilayer externalization of PS to the surface of both cell types. To determine whether ABCA1 is responsible for any of the catalytic activities known to control transbilayer phospholipid movements, these activities were measured in cells from <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and from Tangier individuals as well as ABCA1-expressing HeLa cells. Phospholipid movements in either normal or apoptotic lymphocytes or in macrophages were not inhibited when cells from knockout and wildtype mice or immortalized cells from Tangier individuals vs normal individuals were compared. Exposure of PS on the surface of normal thymocytes, apoptotic thymocytes and elicited peritoneal macrophages from wildtype and knockout mice or B lymphocytes from normal and Tangier individuals, as measured by annexin V binding, was also unchanged. No evidence was found of ABCA1-stimulated active PS export, and spontaneous PS movement to the outer leaflet in the presence or absence of apoA1 was unaffected by the presence or absence of ABCA1. Normal or Tangier B lymphocytes and macrophages were also identical in their ability to serve as targets or phagocytes, respectively, in apoptotic cell clearance assays. No evidence was found to support the suggestion that ABCA1 is involved in transport to the macrophage cell surface of annexins I and II, known to enhance phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. These results show that mutations in ABCA1 do not measurably reduce the rate of transbilayer movements of phospholipids in either the engulfing macrophage or the apoptotic target, thus discounting catalysis of transbilayer movements of phospholipids as the mechanism by which ABCA1 facilitates loading of phospholipids and cholesterol onto apoA1.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) ATPase, ABCA1, are responsible for Tangier disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Bodzioch1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Rust1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the virtual absence of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), reduced levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and mildly elevated triglycerides.

However, ABCA1, a membrane-spanning enzyme that is not an obvious candidate as either ligand or receptor, has been identified as necessary for efficient engulfment of apoptotic cells.

Redistribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane of both apoptotic targets and phagocytes plays a crucial role in engulfment. Phospholipids are normally distributed asymmetrically across the membrane bilayer, with the aminophospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), concentrated in the inner leaflet, and the neutral phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin, concentrated in the outer leaflet. This distribution is maintained by an aminophospholipid translocase, a P-type ATPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Tang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> that actively and specifically transports the aminophospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of the bilayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. When lymphocytes undergo apoptosis, they inactivate this enzyme and activate a non-specific lipid flipsite, termed the scramblase, which promotes rapid equilibration of phospholipids across the bilayer, producing a symmetric distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Verhoven1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. When PS, which is normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, reaches the surface of the cell, it serves as a recognition signal for macrophage engulfment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Schlegel1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Fadok1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, macrophages constitutively express low levels of PS on their surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Callahan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, which is acquired as monocytes differentiate into macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Callahan2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

PS on both the apoptotic lymphocyte and the macrophage is required for phagocytosis of the apoptotic cell, since phagocytosis is inhibited by masking the PS on either of the partner cells using the small protein, annexin V, whose Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent binding is PS-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Callahan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Callahan2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Krahling1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The dual requirement for <italic>ced-7</italic> and the dual requirement for cell surface PS for apoptotic cell engulfment raise the possibility that the two are related; in mammals, this hypothesis predicts that ABCA1 plays a role in the exposure of PS on both the apoptotic lymphocyte and the macrophage. Tests of this hypothesis have been performed. The scramblase, responsible for exposure of PS on apoptotic lymphocytes, can be artificially activated in the absence of apoptosis by elevating cytosolic levels of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> using a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ionophore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Verhoven2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, we test the ability of ABCA1-deficient macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic cells and the ability of ABCA1-deficient apoptotic lymphocytes to serve as targets for macrophages. Finally, we test the hypothesis that ABCA1 is required for exposure of annexins on the macrophage surface, proteins previously shown to be involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Fan1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>The distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane is regulated by at least two opposing activities. One is active transport of PS, and to a lesser extent PE, from the outer to the inner leaflet by the aminophospholipid translocase; the other is equilibration of all phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets by the scramblase. ABCA1 could affect phospholipid externalization if it were one of these two enzymes, if it regulated one of these activities, or if it supplemented these activities.

The molecular shape of the scramblase (center) is arbitrary, since the protein responsible for this activity is not known. One possibility, investigated here, is that the ABCA1 protein is actually the protein responsible for this activity; another possibility is that the ABCA1 protein transports PS from the inner to the outer leaflet, as depicted. An HDL particle (far right) is also drawn approximately to scale by extrapolation from the structure of other lipoprotein particles, with the apoA1 protein drawn as the belt-like helices enclosing the lipid core. The molecular shape of an unlipidated apoA1 protein is unknown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000729.g001"/></fig><sec id="s2a"><title>Translocase Activity</title><p>In healthy normal cells, the aminophospholipid translocase activity rapidly transports PS from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer, in contrast to the slower, unaided diffusion of PC across the same bilayer. In apoptotic cells this activity is down-regulated. ABCA1 might contribute to PS exposure on the cell surface if it reduced or blocked translocase activity. If so, ABCA1 mutations would be expected enhance translocase activity in healthy cells, or to no longer allow the translocase to be inactivated in apoptotic cells. To measure translocase activity, fluorescent NBD-PS or NBD-PC derivatives are introduced into the outer leaflet of cells, and the kinetics of probe transfer to the inner leaflet measured periodically by first removing probe still on the surface with BSA-containing buffers and then quantitating the remaining, internalized probe by measuring cellular fluorescence using flow cytometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows the results of applying this assay to primary fibroblasts from normal and Tangier individuals. Internalization of PC was slow for both normal and mutant nonapoptotic cells. This rate provides an upper boundary for probe internalization by endocytosis, although measurements of internalization of other probes such as sphingomyelin (not shown) indicate that PC internalization overestimates the contribution of endocytosis. In contrast, internalization of PS was rapid in both normal and Tangier cells, indicating that disabling the ABCA1 gene does not enhance PS internalization by the aminophopholipid translocase in these cells. Similar results were observed in comparisons of translocase activity in normal vs Tangier EBV-transformed B lymphocytes, in thymocytes from wildtype vs <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, and in control human HeLa cells, which do not express detectable levels of ABCA1 protein, or transfected HeLa cells expressing functional ABCA1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Remaley1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>(data not shown).. These results show that ABCA1 is not the aminophospholipid translocase, and suggest that it is also not a negative regulator of the translocase, since its absence does not enhance and its overexpression does not reduce translocase activity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000729-t001">Table 1</xref> for a summary of these and following results). These results leave open the possibility that ABCA1 is required to downregulate the translocase in apoptotic cells. In apoptotic cells, not only translocase activity but also transbilayer lipid movements catalyzed by the scramblase must be considered in PS externalization. Therefore, whether ABCA1 is or regulates the scramblase was addressed.</p><fig id="pone-0000729-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000729.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Internalization (translocation) of NBD-labeled phospholipids by normal human fibroblasts and fibroblasts from Tangier individuals.</title><p>The outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of normal (circles) or Tangier (squares) fibroblasts was labeled with NBD-PC (open symbols) or NBD-PS (filled symbols).

To distinguish these possibilities, 50 &#x000b5;M glyburide was added to Jurkat T lymphocytes growing in suspension culture; at intervals, aliquots were removed and the ability of the cells to activate the scramblase was tested by measuring PS exposure after addition of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and ionophore. At a concentration of 50 &#x000b5;M, glyburide inhibition of scramblase activity was complete by 30 min after addition of the inhibitor to cells (data not shown). At earlier times during this incubation, inhibition was observable, but incomplete. When the kinetics of PS exposure were examined at these intermediate times, it was apparent that the lag time before the onset of lipid movement remained relatively constant, but that once the lag was over, the rate at which PS moves to the external leaflet was slowed (data not shown). These results show that the effect of glyburide is not on the preliminary step(s) that occur during the lag phase, but rather on lipid movement itself, consistent with a role for an ABC protein in the process of PS externalization. However, there are many potential targets for glyburide which might account for its effects on this process. A more definitive test of whether ABCA1 is required for PS externalization is whether there is a detectable inhibition of scramblase-mediated phospholipid movements in ABCA1-deficient cells.</p><p>It has been reported that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced externalization of PS is inhibited in primary fibroblasts isolated from <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, as measured by a reduced fraction of cells binding annexin V over time compared to wildtype controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Hamon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

The latter measure is more sensitive to changes in the efficiency of scramblase activation, and less sensitive to changes in the rate of lipid movement. To ensure that the difference in measures reported (fraction of PS-exposing cells vs level of PS exposure) was not responsible for the difference in results compared to the previous study, the fraction of PS-exposing cells was determined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, the rate at which cells become activated is not slower in cells from the <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. In addition, the fraction of responsive cells is not reduced; indeed, in the experiment shown this fraction was slightly elevated in cells from the knockout mice, although in repeated experiments, this result was not generally observed. Together, these results demonstrate that deletion of ABCA1 does not reduce the efficiency of scramblase activation, and does not reduce the rate of PS movement catalyzed by the scramblase following elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels in either human or mouse cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Apoptosis-induced Scramblase Activity</title><p>Studies with cells from patients with Scott disease, in which Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> activation of the scramblase has been inactivated by mutation, suggest that the scramblase activated during apoptosis may be the same as the scramblase activated by elevated cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but that the activation mechanisms are distinct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. If so, it is possible that ABCA1 is only required for PS exposure during apoptosis, which would explain the inability of ABCA1 deletion to block Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced lipid movement in normal, healthy cells. The activation of scramblase during apoptosis is most easily seen in the change in NBD-PS and NBD-PC movement observed in apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cells can be identified by their characteristic light scattering properties (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g004">Figure 4</xref>, below), so that internalization of phospholipid by just those cells can be measured using flow cytometry. In contrast to healthy cells where the aminophospholipid translocase transports NBD-PS (but not NBD-PC) rapidly to the inner leaflet (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), in apoptotic fibroblasts, both phospholipids moved to the cell interior at the same intermediate rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The same change in pattern, and the same resulting rates of lipid movement, were observed whether the fibroblasts were normal or Tangier apoptotic fibroblasts, indicating that ABCA1 deletion does not inhibit this process. Similar results were seen with EBV-transformed apoptotic normal and Tangier B lymphocytes, as well as with apoptotic normal and ABCA1-expressing HeLa cells (data not shown), indicating that ABCA1 is not required for activation of the scramblase in apoptotic cells, nor does it contribute positively or negatively to the rate at which phospholipids move across the bilayer in apoptotic lymphocytes or fibroblasts. In addition, the failure to observe accumulation of PS in the interior of ABCA1-deficient apoptotic cells shows that the translocase has been inactivated as usual, showing that ABCA1 is not required for down-regulation of the translocase activity.</p><fig id="pone-0000729-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000729.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Endogenous PS externalization in apoptotic EBV-transformed human B lymphocytes.</title><p>EBV-transformed normal (A&#x02013;D) or Tangier (E&#x02013;H) B lymphocytes were untreated (A&#x00026;B, E&#x00026;F) or treated with camptothecin (C&#x00026;D, G&#x00026;H) to induce apoptosis, stained with fluorescent annexin V, and examined by flow cytometry.

Cells in a population do not enter apoptosis synchronously; induction of lipid movements is therefore not synchronous, as it is for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated induction. As a result, the efficiency of scramblase induction during apoptosis cannot be measured by the continuous annexin V binding assays described above. However, it is possible to measure the rate of activation of PS exposure relative to other events in the apoptotic program, using conventional annexin V binding assays. Apoptotic cells undergo measurable cell shrinkage. If PS exposure is induced before this change in size, annexin V binding is observed in cells of normal size and shape, as well as in the smaller and more irregularly shaped apoptotic cells produced by shrinkage. This pattern can be readily detected in the flow cytometer, as shown for EBV-transformed apoptotic B lymphocytes in the left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g004">Figure 4(A,C,E,G)</xref>. Cells in the gated R2 subpopulation are of normal size and shape, while cells which have undergone shrinkage appear in the gated R1 subpopulation of lower forward angle light scatter and slightly higher side scatter. At early times after the induction of apoptosis, PS-exposing cells, which are usually absent from the normal (R2) subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g004">Fig 4B</xref>), begin to appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g004">Fig 4D</xref>). If inactivation of ABCA1 substantially slowed the onset of lipid rearrangements, more cells would be expected to complete the shrinkage step before the activation of lipid movement. The result would be a substantial drop in the number of PS-exposing cells in the subpopulation of cells with normal morphology. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g004">Figure 4</xref> (D compared to H), this expectation is not observed; in fact in this example, normal-sized cells which expose PS and bind annexin V appear at a slightly higher frequency in the absence of ABCA1. These results suggest that deletion of ABCA1 does not reduce the efficiency of scramblase activation in apoptotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>PS-specific Outward Lipid Movement</title><p>It has been suggested that ABCA1 contributes to PS exposure, not through the scramblase, but rather by specific enhancement of movement of just PS from the inner to the outer leaflet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Hamon2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>(see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the presence or absence of ABCA1 makes no detectable difference in the rate at which PS externalization occurs in cells in which the scramblase is activated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. It could be that the rate of externalization of PS induced by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is too fast to see the effects of additional, ABCA1-dependent, PS movement. One might, therefore, measure PS externalization in cells in which the scramblase was not activated, except that, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g002">Figure 2</xref>, ABCA1-dependent PS movement to the external leaflet would be masked by the action of the translocase. However, a method has been devised to measure PS externalization rates irrespective of an active translocase. In this assay, healthy cells were allowed to internalize NBD-PS by means of the translocase, and were then placed in the presence of the reducing agent sodium dithionite. In the presence of this reagent, internalized NBD-PS which reappears at the cell surface is immediately reduced to a non-fluorescent amino derivative. The resulting decrease in cell fluorescence with time thus measures the rate at which the PS analog moves from the inner leaflet to the cell surface. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g005">Figure 5</xref>, NBD-PS moved from the cell interior to the cell surface in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, or HeLa cells. These observed basal rates differ significantly from one cell type to another, ranging from a half time for externalization of about 8 min in B lymphocytes to about 2 min in HeLa cells; importantly, these times are all slow by comparison with the half time for probe reduction by dithionite (about 5 sec). These rates are not increased by increasing the concentration of added dithionite (data not shown), indicating that they are not the result of membrane permeability to dithionite. There are no differences in the externalization rates between normal and Tangier fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) or B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g005">Fig 5B</xref>), or between normal and ABCA1-expressing HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g005">Fig 5C</xref>), showing that the basal PS externalization process in all of these cells is independent of ABCA1.

This result is reminiscent of the observation that the lipid distribution in the plasma membrane of macrophages differs from that of most other normal healthy cells in that PS is constitutively expressed at low levels on the surface of viable, non-apoptotic macrophages, where it is required for efficient recognition of PS-exposing apoptotic target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Callahan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore asked whether this macrophage-specific PS exposure was ABCA1-dependent. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, macrophages in the M region display this low level of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent annexin V binding, consistent with the presence of low levels of PS exposed on their surface. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent binding of annexin V is not reduced in macrophages from <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, indicating that this characteristic is not ABCA1-dependent. In view of these results, annexin V binding by healthy HeLa cells expressing ABCA1 was examined and the data confirmed that these cells do bind slightly more annexin V than control HeLa cells. However, this binding was not Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent (data not shown). Since Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependence is the hallmark of PS-specific annexin binding, this result does not reflect increased PS exposure, and is therefore unrelated to constitutive PS exposure in macrophages.</p><p>Annexin V binding by macrophages reveals the steady-state presence of PS in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, but provides no information on the transbilayer lipid movements that underlie this distribution. Measuring these movements with NBD-labeled phospholipids as was done above with other cell types can be problematic with macrophages, which rapidly internalize membrane by endocytosis. This rapid bulk membrane flow nonspecifically internalizes any lipid probe present in the membrane, sequestering even externally-directed probes in the lumenal leaflet of a vesicle. This process does not require, and can even mask, transbilayer lipid transport. Sodium dithionite was used to overcome this problem. After addition of NBD-labeled lipids and incubation to allow probe internalization as usual, samples of labeled macrophages taken at various times were incubated for 5 min with dithionite at room temperature to allow internalization of the reducing agent into the lumen of endocytic vesicles. During this secondary incubation, any probe remaining in the medium or outer leaflet will be reduced to the nonfluorescent form. In addition, reducing agent in the lumen of endocytic vesicles will enter the endocytic pathway and when these vesicles fuse with early endosomes, dithionite will come into contact with previously endocytosed probe which is still restricted to the (lumenal) leaflet. This process could reduce fluorescence from probe molecules that have been sequestered by endocytosis. To test whether this approach makes it possible to measure headgroup-specific transbilayer transport of phospholipids, the protocol was used to compare the internalization of PC and PS in macrophages. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g007">Figure 7</xref>, the assay revealed the standard aminophospholipid translocase pattern of rapid PS internalization and much slower PC internalization, comparable to that seen in the control S cells in the same experiment. As with other cell types, the macrophage translocase activity is unaffected by disabling ABCA1. In this case, the rate of internalization of PC by macrophages is measurable compared to no measurable transport in the control S subpopulation. Uptake of PC by macrophages includes both probe taken up by transport across the bilayer, and probe taken up by endocytosis but not reduced by internalized dithionite. This rate therefore defines an upper limit for the background of nonspecific endocytic uptake of probe still in the external leaflet but not reduced during the secondary dithionite incubation.</p><fig id="pone-0000729-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000729.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Internalization (translocation) of NBD-labeled phospholipids by peritoneal macrophages from wildtype and <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>The outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of macrophages from wildtype (diamonds) or <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (squares) mice was labeled with NBD-PC (open symbols) or NBD-PS (closed symbols).

By itself, this discovery did not identify the mechanism by which the ABCA1 protein facilitates transfer of cholesterol to HDL, but good evidence suggests that it acts upstream of actual transfer of cholesterol from the cell.

Once this phospholipid transfer step has been completed, phospholipid-containing apoA1 particles would then accept cholesterol from cells without any further intervention from ABCA1. This proposal implies that ABCA1 interacts in some way with phospholipids, an attractive idea because it might explain how ABCA1 could be required for another function, also dependent on phospholipid interaction, namely the engulfment of apoptotic cells. In particular, ABCA1 has been proposed as the mammalian functional homolog of ced-7, an ABC protein required for clearance of apoptotic cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

Ordinarily, PS is confined to the inner leaflet of mammalian plasma membranes by ATP-dependent inward transport catalyzed by a subfamily IV P-type ATPase, the aminophospholipid translocase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Tang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

ABCA1 might modulate this arrangement directly by regulating the activity of the aminophospholipid translocase or indirectly, for instance, by ensuring proper localization of the translocase at the plasma membrane. However, the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g007">7</xref> rule out these possibilities by showing that the presence or absence of ABCA1 has no effect on aminophospholipid transport activity.</p><p>PS comes to the cell surface in several physiological situations in addition to apoptosis, including upon platelet activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Zwaal1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and prior to myoblast fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-vandenEijnde1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

As might be expected, one is the downregulation of the aminophospholipid translocase. The other is the upregulation of the scramblase, which facilitates transbilayer movements of PS to the cell surface. The properties of the scramblase in both cell types is the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g001">Fig 1</xref>): all types of phospholipids are moved at identical rates in both directions across the bilayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Verhoven2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The studies with ABCA1-deficient mouse and human cells presented here collectively demonstrate that ABCA1 is not the (long-sought) scramblase activity itself in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, HeLa cells, or macrophages.</p><p>If not the scramblase itself, ABCA1 could still be involved in activation of the scramblase. Studies of cells from patients with a rare clotting disorder, Scott syndrome, suggest that two different activation pathways (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent and apoptotic, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-independent) converge on a common scramblase enzyme. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g001">Figure 1</xref>, ABCA1 could be a protein involved in one of these two activation pathways. In platelets and other hematopoietic cells, including lymphocytes, scramblase can be activated naturally or artificially by a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent pathway that is disrupted by the Scott mutation. It was recently reported that there is a single missense mutation in the ABCA1 gene of a Scott patient and that transfection of wild-type ABCA1 into lymphocytes from the patient restored Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent activation of the scramblase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Albrecht1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggested that reduced ABCA1 activity might result in a failure of PS exposure like that observed in the Scott syndrome. As shown here, however, this inference is incorrect: PS exposure by the scramblase is activated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> equally efficiently whether or not cells contain a functional ABCA1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g009">9</xref>). Similarly, it has been reported that scramblase activation by ionophore and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is negligible in fibroblasts from <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Hamon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> As confirmed here, human fibroblasts from Tangier patients do not activate the scramblase upon treatment with ionophore and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>; however, this phenotype is also observed in wild type fibroblasts, suggesting that the ability to activate the scramblase by elevation of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> may only be prominent in the hematopoietic lineage. In apoptotic cells, including lymphocytes, scramblase is activated by a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-independent mechanism which is unaffected by the Scott mutation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the absence of ABCA1 does not affect PS exposure via this apoptotic activation pathway, either.</p><p>A third possibility for involvement of ABCA1 in PS exposure, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g001">Figure 1</xref>, is that ABCA1, independent of the scramblase, actively transports PS, and not other lipids, from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. An activity of this sort was first proposed to explain PS exposure in activated platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Basse1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, but high resolution analysis of lipid movements in activated platelets failed to reveal any evidence for PS-specific externalization over and above the scramblase-mediated movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, analyses of movements of spin-labeled PC and PS analogs were also interpreted as evidence for an outward PS-specific transport in mouse red blood cells treated with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and ionophore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Hamon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, conditions known to activate the scramblase in human red blood cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson4">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In these experiments, the induction of rapid internalization of PC, characteristic of the scramblase activity, was unaffected by knockout of the ABCA1 gene. The behavior of the PS probe, however, was more complex. In red blood cells from wild type mice, externalization of labeled PS was slow and only 24&#x00025; of it moved from the inner to the outer membrane leaflet. In <italic>ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, externalization was similarly slow, and only 10&#x00025; of internalized probe was externalized. On the basis of these findings, the investigators concluded that Apart of PS externalization in the presence of cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> may be associated with ABCA1-dependent selective outward <email>transport@</email>. This model suggests that PS externalization results from both non-specific scramblase and PS-specific ABCA1 activity, and that when the latter is compromised, the rate of externalization of PS should be reduced to the rate of scramblase-mediated movement alone.</p><p>Although suggestive, these data are difficult to reconcile with previous studies of lipid movements in ionophore treated human red blood cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson4">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In these earlier studies with fluorescent probes, scramblase activation resulted in PS movement as rapid, and as extensive, as PC movement. Similar results were obtained in studies of the scramblase activity in platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> and in lymphoid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Williamson2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> using both fluorescent phospholipid analogs and continuous annexin V binding assays of endogenous PS movement. The failure of Hamon et al to observe PS equilibration in normal controls makes it difficult to interpret their findings in ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. The measurements of PS externalization rates reported here fail to confirm that ABCA1 deletion reduces the rate of PS externalization. Because ABCA1 ablation has no effect on the PS externalization rate in lymphocytes or macrophages activated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and ionophore, it is unlikely that ABCA1 catalyzes PS-specific externalization depicted as a possibility in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>These findings are reassuring in one way, because an activity that actively exports one major phospholipid population from one leaflet to the other, when activated, would pose a difficult problem for the maintenance of membrane integrity. Although PS comprises only approximately 10&#x00025; of plasma membrane phospholipid, even a simple equilibration of only this lipid between the two leaflets (from 100&#x00025; inner to 50/50, inner/outer) would produce a 10&#x00025; difference in the surface areas of the two leaflets, an unlikely event given that membranes cannot tolerate a difference of more than 1&#x02013;2&#x00025; in the surface area of the two leaflets. Active transport of all PS to the cell surface would be twice as disruptive. Indeed, this potentially disruptive effect of lipid movement may explain why the scramblase activity is non-specific for phospholipid headgroup. Although its function may be to bring PS to the cell surface, its nonspecificity provides an automatic compensation mechanism which dissipates any disparity in leaflet surface area as fast as it arises.</p><p>Because ABCA1 is prominently expressed in macrophages, it might seem likely, <italic>a priori</italic>, that the characteristics and function of this cell type would be affected by ABCA1 inactivation. The elevated level of annexin V binding to normal macrophages suggests that transbilayer lipid movements are altered in these cells, and it has been reported that annexin V binding to macrophages from ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Hamon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, although the data were not presented. The development of methods to measure lipid movements in macrophages reported here provides the first opportunity to actually examine this dynamic phenomenon in these membrane-active cells, rather than to measure just static levels of exposed PS using annexin V. The results presented here provide evidence that many of the transbilayer lipid movements seen in other hematopoietic cells are present in macrophages as well, including both translocase and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced scramblase activity. However, the assays also indicate that none of these transbilayer lipid movements, nor the elevated level of basal PS exposure measured by annexin V binding, requires the presence of ABCA1 in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g006">Figures 6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g007"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g008"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000729-g009">9</xref>). In addition, a reduction in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent annexin V binding by the F4/80-positive cells in the cell population could not be detected. These results indicate that ABCA1 is not responsible for readily-measurable lipid transport activity in macrophages, including catalysis of PS-specific externalization. In keeping with these observations, elicited peritoneal macrophages from ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were no less effective than wild type cells as phagocytes of apoptotic thymocytes in a controlled, <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. Although these results do not rule out a role for ABCA1 in the recognition of apoptotic cells, they do indicate that the contribution of ABCA1 to engulfment is quantitatively much less significant than that of the many other molecules identified by these <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, such as CD14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Devitt1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Schlegel2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Pradhan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Fadok2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, or annexin I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Fan1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A potential positive effect of ABCA1 activity was suggested by reports that introduction of ABCA1 into HeLa cells specifically activated spontaneous externalization of previously internalized NBD-PS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-AlderBaerens1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> In the higher resolution experiments described here with an independent line of ABCA1-transfected HeLa cells, no difference in externalization was observed. In addition, no reduction in the rate of basal PS efflux was observed in primary fibroblasts, macrophages, or lymphocytes lacking the ABCA1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212; </sup>gene. Some experiments have suggested that ABCA1 is essential for loading of phospholipid onto apoA1 to convert it to a form capable of taking up cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Chau1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Fielding2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. The experiments shown here demonstrate that the function provided by ABCA1 is not PS externalization stimulated by the presence of apoA1, at least on any large scale.</p><p>Understanding the function of ABCA1 in the efflux of cholesterol to HDL is also a persistent puzzle. The possibility that a phospholipid transport function was a key to solving this puzzle was a welcome unifying idea, because of the clear and defined importance of phospholipid transport in the process of clearance of apoptotic cells. The molecules that are responsible for mediating and regulating the transbilayer transport of PS required for recognition of apoptotic cells (among other functions) have resisted identification, and the possibility that ABCA1 is one of those molecules was an important potential implication of this unifying idea. The results presented here indicate that this possibility is not realized-ABCA1 plays no readily identifiable role as translocase, scramblase, or regulator of either of those molecules in either the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-stimulated or apoptosis-stimulated pathways in hematopoietic or fibroblast cells. These results do not rule out a role for ABCA1 in phospholipid loading of apoA1. Indeed, recent studies suggest that this enzyme plays a role in changing the conformation of apoA1, and loading as many as two PC molecules on the rearranged protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000729-Chau1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The loading of PC molecules in those studies is unlikely to involve transbilayer lipid movement, since PC is normally concentrated in the external leaflet of the plasma membrane, and the number of PC molecules loaded is small compared to the number of PC molecules present in the outer leaflet. Whether ABCA1 might function in a similar fashion during the process of apoptotic cell recognition will be an interesting possibility for future consideration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>ApoA-1(A-0722), propidium iodide (PI), RPMI-1640 and &#x003b1;-MEM medium, fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA, A-6003), dexamethasone, purified mouse IgG1 (clone MOPC 21) mAb isotype control, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and unconjugated goat IgG were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
