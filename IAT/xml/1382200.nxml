Both are heterodimeric enzymes consisting of distinct 80 kDa catalytic subunits, encoded by the <italic>Capn1 </italic>(&#x003bc;-80 k) and <italic>Capn2 </italic>(m-80 k) genes, respectively, that associate with a common 28 kDa regulatory subunit encoded by the <italic>Capn4 </italic>gene. The &#x003bc;-80 k and m-80 k subunits share 62% amino acid sequence identity, and are very similar in terms of structure, protein chemistry, and <italic>in vitro </italic>substrate specificity. Despite these similarities, the differential expression patterns of &#x003bc;- and m-calpain in mammalian tissues suggest they have some isoform specific and distinct functions. The &#x003bc; and m designations derive from the levels of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>required <italic>in vitro </italic>for optimal activation; 10&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+ </sup>for &#x003bc;-calpain and 0.3&#x02013;0.35 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>for m-calpain. It is generally assumed that &#x003bc;- and m-calpain maintain their differential sensitivities to calcium <italic>in vivo</italic>, although this has not yet been strictly demonstrated. Furthermore, since the cytoplasmic free Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration is typically less than 1 &#x003bc;M, it is also assumed that other <italic>in vivo </italic>factors must contribute to regulation of these enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Without apriori knowledge of the factors regulating calpain activity or their relevant substrates, elucidation of biological functions for calpains presents a challenge. Research on calpains has linked them with a wide variety of functions including muscle growth, development, degeneration (3), neuronal growth and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], signal cascades triggered by integrins and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], membrane protrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], remodeling of the cytoskeleton and cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and regulation of cell death via both necrosis and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To date, the literature suggests a complex interplay between caspases and calpains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and impact of calpain on cell death pathway components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The lack of highly specific cell-permeable inhibitors of calpains contributes to the challenge of investigating and defining calpain functions in these processes. Although over-expression of calpastatin, the endogenous protein inhibitor of &#x003bc;- and m-calpain provides an important approach for these efforts, it will not distinguish isoform specific functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Some work has suggested isoform specific roles, such as a role for m-calpain in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and a role for &#x003bc;-calpain in interferon-inducible protein 9-induced migration of keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A cell permeable calpain inhibitor (which likely inhibits other thiol-proteases as well) has been used to select cells lacking &#x003bc;-calpain which display reduced proliferation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, m-calpain expression persisted in these cells, suggesting a possible requirement of m-calpain for cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Targeted gene deletion in mice provides a powerful approach to determining the physiological roles of &#x003bc;- and m-calpain and the opportunity to approach their isoform specific functions. Initial studies targeted <italic>Capn4 </italic>based on the prediction that loss of this calpain subunit would abolish activity of both &#x003bc;- and m-calpain. <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>murine embryos died between days 10 and 11 of gestation, and there was no detectable &#x003bc;- or m-calpain activity in these or younger embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) could be cultured from these embryos, although they also lacked calpain activity as assessed by casein zymography or by the formation of characteristic spectrin breakdown products, and they displayed migration defects consistent with a role for calpain in release of focal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. An independently derived <italic>Capn4 </italic>knockout, involving a more extensive deletion of the gene, resulted in an earlier embryonic lethality, apparently at a pre-implantation stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The different times of embryonic lethality suggested that the first reported <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] were targeted with a hypomorphic mutation, which retained some small level of calpain activity, allowing for their survival to mid-gestation, while the second reported <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] represented a true null mutation. Disruption of <italic>Capn1</italic>, encoding the &#x003bc;-calpain catalytic subunit, was subsequently reported to result in fertile, viable mice with some mild defects in the &#x003bc;-calpain rich platelets relating to their aggregation and clot retraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The fact that <italic>Capn4 </italic>null mice die during embryogenesis indicates that at least one of the ubiquitous calpains is essential for development to term. The viability of <italic>Capn1</italic>-deficient mice does not however distinguish between two possibilities: either that m-calpain is specifically required during embryogenesis, or that either form of calpain alone is sufficient and can compensate for the absence of the other. To resolve this question, we have now knocked out the <italic>Capn2 </italic>gene encoding the m-80 k subunit in mice. We report here that <italic>Capn2 </italic>null embryos died prior to the implantation stage, indicating that m-calpain is indispensable for early embryogenesis. This role cannot be fulfilled by &#x003bc;-calpain, which is expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and is assumed to be present at this stage of gestation. This demonstrates unequivocally that m-calpain and &#x003bc;-calpain have distinct physiological roles during early embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation and characterization of <italic>Capn2 </italic>targeted ES cell clones</title><p>Two independent <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>ES cell lines, designated ES27 and ES36, were isolated from a screen of 305 drug-resistant clones. Correct targeting of the <italic>Capn2 </italic>locus was established both by Southern blot hybridization and PCR analysis. A probe located outside the short (upstream) arm of homology hybridized to a 3.5-kb <italic>Bam</italic>HI fragment of the wild-type allele and 5.3-kb <italic>Bam</italic>HI fragment of the mutant allele as predicted from genomic maps (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The same probe also detected the expected 7.2-kb wild-type and 6.4-kb mutant <italic>Bgl</italic>II fragments, 4.9-kb wild-type and 5.7-kb mutant <italic>Nco</italic>I fragments, as well as 7.2-kb wild-type and 4.9-kb mutant <italic>Bgl</italic>II/<italic>Age</italic>I fragments (not shown). A probe derived from the PGK-Neo cassette recognized only the 5.3-kb <italic>Bam</italic>HI fragment in <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>ES cells, suggesting that the targeting vector had integrated solely at the <italic>Capn2 </italic>locus (not shown). A PCR screening method was also established that generated a wild-type product of 2,749 bp and a 2,711 bp product from the mutant allele. The 2,711 bp product was only evident in the two targeted cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of targeted ES cell lines</bold>. (A) Targeted disruption of the <italic>Capn2 </italic>locus was detected initially by Southern blotting.

A 3.5-kb <italic>Bam</italic>HI fragment corresponding to the wild-type allele was present in all cells, whereas a 5.3-kb fragment from the mutant allele was detected in two targeted cell lines, designated ES27 and ES36. (B) PCR genotyping was carried out with two separate reactions designed to amplify either a 2,748 bp segment from the wild-type allele or a 2,711 bp segment from the mutant allele. Both reactions used a common sense primer located in intron 4, outside the short arm of the targeting vector, and distinct allele-specific antisense primers. The reaction to detect the wild-type allele used an antisense primer located in exon 7 while the amplification of the mutant sequence was done with an antisense primer in the PGK-Neo cassette. The results confirm the presence of the wild-type allele in all cells, whereas the mutant allele signal was observed only in the two targeted clones.

Two of these males transmitted the <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>ES27 genotype through the germline into the F<sub>1 </sub>generation. Heterozygous <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>animals appeared normal, with no obvious defects in gross anatomy, reproduction, or life span.</p><p>Out of 199 weanlings from heterozygous intercrosses, no <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>progeny were detected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). We did not observe high rates of perinatal death, and no <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>stillborns were observed. This suggested that <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>animals perished at some stage during embryonic development. In an attempt to determine if embryonic death occurred at a post-implantation stage, embryos were harvested for genotyping at different times between E10.5 and E18.5. No <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos were observed and no signs of embryo resorption were detected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This indicated that the <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos might be dying prior to implantation. Embryos were then flushed from the oviducts of pregnant females at E2.5 or E3.5, and genotyped by means of a nested PCR strategy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Two of 90 successfully genotyped pre-implantation embryos were <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

The scarcity of <italic>Capn2</italic>-deficient embryos surviving to the 8-cell stage suggested that the loss of m-calpain activity must fatally compromise the viability of early embryos. Furthermore, it is possible that persistence of some maternally derived mRNA transcript or protein might have allowed a small number of <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos to survive to the morula-stage.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Genotype distribution of offspring derived from <italic>Capn2 </italic>transgenic mice.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Cross</td><td align="left">(N)</td><td align="left">Age</td><td align="center" colspan="4">Genotype</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">+/+</td><td align="left">+/-</td><td align="left">-/-</td><td align="left">ND*</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">199</td><td align="left">3 weeks</td><td align="left">23</td><td align="left">176</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/+)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">122</td><td align="left">3 weeks</td><td align="left">50</td><td align="left">72</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/+)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">103</td><td align="left">3 weeks</td><td align="left">28</td><td align="left">75</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">E18.5</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">E17.5</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">E14.5</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">E11.5</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">E10.5</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">46</td><td align="left">E3.5</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">39</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(+/-)&#x02640; &#x000d7; (+/-)&#x02642;</td><td align="left">48</td><td align="left">E2.5</td><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">34</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* ND, not determined</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Nested PCR strategy for genotyping of pre-implantation embryos</bold>.

An even higher degree of <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>over-representation was seen when the mutant allele came the mother (73%) compared to when it came from the father (59%). In these crosses the ratios of <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>to <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>animals among males or females compared well with the ratio in the combined populations; 77% of males and 69% of females were <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>when the mutant allele came from the mother, and 62% of males and 55% of females were <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>when the mutant allele came from the father.</p></sec><sec><title>Attempted generation of <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells</title><p><italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>ES cells were subjected to clonal selection in the presence of 2 mg/mL G418 in attempts to generate homozygous mutant cells by gene conversion.

In this case, however, no <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells were isolated in screens of 126 drug-resistant clones. The inability to isolate <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells, in concert with the absence of <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos beyond the 8-cell stage, suggested that m-calpain activity might be essential for cell viability or the establishment of viable ES cell clones.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although calpain activity was first identified four decades ago, a clear understanding of the substrates and functions of the enzymes has remained elusive. In large part, this has been due to the lack of inhibitors capable of specifically down-regulating the calpains without affecting other proteases. In the past decade, the story has been further complicated by the discovery of a number of previously unknown isoforms which may be differently regulated and have different substrate specificity. Gene targeting in mice has provided a powerful approach to examine the physiologic roles of individual calpain isoforms. This was first used to disrupt the <italic>Capn4 </italic>gene, encoding the small regulatory subunit common to both &#x003bc;- and m-calpain. Two independent laboratories observed embryonic lethality in <italic>Capn4 </italic>knockout mice, albeit at different stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These observations supported the hypothesis that the small subunit is required for both &#x003bc;- and m-calpain, and furthermore suggested four possibilities regarding their requirement for embryonic development: 1) both isoforms were required; 2) &#x003bc;-calpain was required; 3) m-calpain was required, or 4) &#x003bc;- and m-calpain are redundant, and one or the other isoform was required. These options were narrowed down by the subsequent observation that <italic>Capn1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, which lack the &#x003bc;-calpain catalytic subunit, were healthy and fertile, although platelet aggregation and clot retraction defects were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. At that point, we were left with the last two possibilities that either m-calpain was specifically required during embryogenesis, or that either isoform alone was sufficient for sustaining embryonic viability.</p><p>We report here that <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, which lack the m-calpain catalytic subunit, die at the preimplantation stage of development. This observation allows us to now conclude that m-calpain is specifically required during embryogenesis. Since homozygous disruption of the <italic>Capn4 </italic>gene was also expected to abolish m-calpain activity, this result is in agreement with the phenotype presented by one of the two <italic>Capn4 </italic>targeted lines in which preimplantation lethality of null embryos was also observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The survival of <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos from the original targeted line reported by Arthur and colleagues to mid-gestation is more difficult to reconcile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In retrospect, it seems likely that the latter line represents a hypomorphic state, rather than a true null. The <italic>Capn4 </italic>targeting strategy employed by Arthur and colleagues involved disrupting the C-terminus of the calpain small subunit by insertion of the PGK-Neo cassette into the middle of exon 9, which caused truncation of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This strategy was based upon previous structure/function studies showing that excision of the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues of the small subunit abolished calpain activity when co-expressed with the m-calpain large subunit in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In contrast, the <italic>Capn4 </italic>targeting strategy employed by Zimmerman and colleagues involved a much more extensive deletion of exons 4 through 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It now seems probable that the difference in the time of lethality of these two targeted <italic>Capn4 </italic>lines can be explained by different extents of disruption. The Zimmerman allele probably represents a true null genotype while the Arthur allele is likely a hypomorphic mutation. Alternate targeting strategies have been shown to yield different phenotypes in gene disruption studies. For example, three different targeting strategies were independently used to disrupt the mixed lineage leukemia (<italic>Mll</italic>) gene. In all three studies, homozygous null embryos perished during embryogenesis, but at different stages (E0.5, E10.5, E14.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The variation in phenotype was attributed to the differences in degree of function of the truncated proteins produced from the mutant alleles. A similar effect might be at work in the two <italic>Capn4 </italic>transgenic lines. Efforts were made to detect transcripts or calpain activities derived from the Arthur <italic>Capn4 </italic>allele. This allele gave rise to multiple mRNA species, detectable by RT-PCR, reading through from the first half of exon 9 to at least two different cryptic splice sites in the PGK promoter sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These transcripts could give rise to defective calpain small subunits with 10&#x02013;30 inappropriate C-terminal acids, which might be sufficient to support a low level of calpain activity. However, expression of calpains with these modified small subunits did not give rise to any detectable calpain activity when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, although their functionality in mammalian cells has yet to be determined (J.S. Elce, unpublished work) It has also been suggested that calpain large subunits alone might provide some activity in eukaryotic cells, although the Zimmerman et al. knockout appears to exclude that possibility, and no calpain activity was observed in our hands when calpain large subunits were expressed alone either in <italic>E. coli </italic>or in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The different timing of lethality in the <italic>Capn4 </italic>knockouts might also be a consequence of the different genetic backgrounds of the two transgenic lines, which has been observed to influence the phenotype of transgenic mice on a number of occasions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>One of the enduring questions in calpain research has been whether the two ubiquitous isoforms, &#x003bc;- and m-calpain, possess distinct <italic>in vivo </italic>roles. The two enzymes share 62% sequence identity and are very similar in their structure and biochemistry. Notably, they cleave essentially the same set of substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that they have the potential to carry out the same functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. On the other hand, since they require different amounts of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>for <italic>in vitro </italic>activation, it is possible that the two isoforms are differentially regulated inside cells. It is now clear, from the gene targeting work done in mice, that &#x003bc;- and m-calpain have some distinct physiological roles, at least during embryogenesis. As noted, whereas <italic>Capn2 </italic>null murine embryos die prior to implantation, homozygous disruption of the &#x003bc;-calpain large subunit gene, <italic>Capn1</italic>, did not affect the viability of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The principal phenotype observed as a result of <italic>Capn1 </italic>deficiency involved a disturbance in platelet function, possibly at the level of the tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins involved in platelet activation. Both &#x003bc;- and m-calpain activities are present in most mammalian cells, although the published data, owing to weaknesses in the available methodology, do not provide reliable estimates of their relative amounts. Platelets and erythrocytes contain abundant &#x003bc;-calpain activity, while m-calpain activity is barely detectable. Compensation for &#x003bc;-calpain deficiency by m-calpain is therefore less likely in platelets and erythrocytes than in other cell types. As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the absence of marked phenotype in <italic>Capn1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>animals is due to a compensatory affect by the remaining m-calpain activity, or whether the functions of &#x003bc;-calpain are simply not essential. In contrast, lethality in <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos demonstrates that m-calpain activity is essential for embryonic development beyond the 8-cell stage. It follows that at least some functions of &#x003bc;-calpain and m-calpain are distinct.</p><p>The underlying cause of the preimplantation lethality in <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos has not yet been clarified. The two homozygous null embryos identified at the 8-cell stage did not present any obvious morphological defects. However, the fact that only two out of 90 successfully genotyped pre-implantation embryos proved to be <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>is in itself revealing. Preimplantation lethality resulting from gene knockouts can typically be attributed to two general causes. In some cases, defects are incurred in the embryonic differentiation program which can often be observed morphologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Null embryos of this type often survive beyond the morula stage, and a Mendelian distribution of embryonic genotypes is usually noted. In other cases, however, the gene disruption is thought to compromise fatally the viability of cells in the early embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In these instances, only a few null embryos are ever observed and homozygous mutant ES cells could not be isolated. The <italic>Capn2 </italic>knockout fits into the latter category. If it is true that m-calpain is essential for some aspect of cell viability, the survival of a few <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos to the 8-cell stage is most likely due to the persistence of some maternal m-calpain mRNA and/or protein through 2&#x02013;3 cell divisions.</p><p>The mechanistic reasons for lethality in the absence of m-calpain are still unclear. There have been several reports of m-calpain involvement in cell proliferation in certain circumstances, including reports of its involvement in chromosome segregation during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] as well as during meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Defects in migration, reported in <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], could contribute to failed embryonic development. The association between calpain and cell viability has been noted in <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>MEFs and other cell lines, although the reported work frequently did not distinguish between &#x003bc;- and m-calpain, and did not show that calpain was strictly essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In both CHO cells and <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>MEFs, calpain was shown to influence cell proliferation, but only at very low cell densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Calpain has also been associated with progression through the G<sub>1 </sub>stage of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, some of the proteins known to be involved in cell cycle progression, such as p53, p107, cyclin D1, and p27<sup>kip1 </sup>are reputed to be calpain substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Sperm binding to the oocyte leads to increased cytoplasmic calcium which triggers the acrosome reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Both &#x003bc;- and m-calpain have recently been detected in rodent sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. m-calpain was implicated in the acrosome reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] which correlated with a translocation of m-calpain to the cortical membrane in oocytes where it might participate in the release of cortical granule contents required to prevent polyspermy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. m-calpain also relocalized to the oocyte meiotic spindle after fertilization, were it could be involved in chromosome segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Polyspermy or defective chromosome segregation would both have lethal effects on early embryonic development.</p><p>It should also be stressed that <italic>Capn4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES and MEF cells from the presumptive hypomorphic allele can be maintained in culture despite an apparent lack of calpain activity, as assessed by casein zymography or by the appearance of characteristic spectrin breakdown products. It is conceivable, as discussed earlier, that a trace amount of calpain activity, beneath levels detectable by these methods, is retained from this mutant <italic>Capn4 </italic>allele, and it is sufficient for maintaining the viability of the cells. Furthermore, calpain-independent mechanisms for protecting cell viability might exist in these cell lines that are absent in early embryonic cells.</p><p>The repeated failure to achieve gene conversion of <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>to <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells by selection of clones in high concentrations of G418 suggests that the homozygous mutant state somehow compromises cell viability or clonal selection of ES cells. Efforts are under way to express the m-80 k subunit from a <italic>Capn2 </italic>cDNA rescue transgene prior to gene conversion in order to preemptively rescue m-calpain activity before the remaining endogenous wild-type allele is lost. However, difficulty in achieving stable expression of the rescue transgene has thus far hampered these attempts.</p><p>One curiosity which arose during the genotyping of progeny from heterozygous interbreeding was the highly non-Mendelian ratio of <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>(11.6%) to <italic>Capn2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>(88.4%) of weanlings. At present, there is no obvious explanation for this result. Crosses between wild-type and heterozygous mice also produced progeny with a greater than expected proportion of heterozygous offspring. Interestingly, heterozygous crosses involving the <italic>Capn4 </italic>transgenic line generated by Zimmerman and colleagues yielded progeny with a similar, if less extreme, skewing in favor of the heterozygous genotype. Out of a total of 80 genotyped animals, 22.5% were wild-type and 77.5% were heterozygous, with no homozygous null progeny observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These observations suggest a developmental advantage associated with reduced calpain expression. Perhaps future studies will reveal a mechanistic basis for this.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The work presented here has clarified two important questions regarding the physiological roles of the two ubiquitous calpain isoforms, &#x003bc;- and m-calpain. Firstly, it was determined that m-calpain plays an indispensable role in murine embryogenesis, possibly related to pre-implantation development. Furthermore, this function cannot be carried out by &#x003bc;-calpain despite the apparent <italic>in vitro </italic>similarities of &#x003bc;- and m-calpain, demonstrating that the two isoforms clearly have some distinct roles <italic>in vivo</italic>. The functions of m-calpain during post-implantation embryogenesis and in adult mice remain to be elucidated and will have to be addressed using a conditional gene targeting strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning and sequencing of the mouse <italic>Capn2 </italic>locus</title><p>The mouse <italic>Capn2 </italic>gene encodes the 700 amino acids of the m-calpain large subunit (m-80 k) and consists of 21 exons extending over 50-kb on chromosome 1.

It was found to contain 2.8-kb of sequence from position 247 of the coding sequence to the stop codon at position 2,101, including the 3'-UTR to the polyA signal.

Isolated embryos were then digested for five hours at 55&#x000b0;C in 20 &#x003bc;L of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 200 &#x003bc;L/mL proteinase K, pH 8.0), followed by ten minutes at 95&#x000b0;C to inactivate the proteinase K. Lysates were then used for PCR genotyping.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>EGF: Epidermal growth factor</p><p>ES: Embryonic stem</p><p>MEF: Mouse embryonic fibroblast</p><p>kDa: kilodalton</p><p>kb: kilobase</p><p>bp: base pair</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DEC generated the Capn2 targeting construct.
