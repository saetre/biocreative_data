We tested and applied a novel probabilistic method called the gamma Model for Oligonucleotide Signals to analyse hybridization signals from Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. Expression levels estimated by this method correlated closely (p&#x0003c;0.0001) across a 10-fold range with those measured by quantitative RT-PCR for a sample of 61 different genes. In an unbiased list of 26 genes whose temporal profiles clustered most closely with that of <italic>gata3</italic> in all cell lines, 10 were linked to Insulin-like Growth Factor signalling, including the serine/threonine kinase <italic>Akt/PKB</italic>. Knock-down of <italic>gata3</italic> in vitro was associated with a decrease in expression of genes linked to IGF-signalling, including IGF1, IGF2 and several IGF-binding proteins. It also led to a small decrease in protein levels of the serine-threonine kinase Akt2/PKB&#x003b2;, a dramatic increase in Akt1/PKB&#x003b1; protein and relocation of Akt1/PKB&#x003b1; from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>kip1</sup>, a known target of PKB/Akt, simultaneously decreased. In heterozygous <italic>gata3</italic> null mice the expression of <italic>gata3</italic> correlated with high levels of activated Akt/PKB. This functional relationship could explain the diverse function of gata3 during development, the hearing loss associated with <italic>gata3</italic> heterozygous null mice and the broader symptoms of human patients with Hearing-Deafness-Renal anomaly syndrome.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous regulatory genes have been implicated in the development of many tissues, including the inner ear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Fekete1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Fekete2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Fritzsch1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Kelley1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, but identification of the intracellular systems that they regulate remains a considerable challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Levine1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This challenge is compounded because a given gene may regulate several molecular events in different cell types during different developmental stages. Consequently, functional analysis should be done at cellular resolution during specified time windows. To achieve this in an organ as complex as the inner ear we have derived conditionally immortal epithelial and neuronal cell lines that have been characterised with a wide range of structural and functional markers with reference to their counterparts in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Helyer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-LawokoKerali1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Nicholl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These cell lines can be differentiated in vitro and screened with whole genome oligonucleotide arrays to determine temporal profiles of gene expression. Assuming that functionally related genes are likely to share similar temporal expression profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Niehrs1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> we can explore such datasets to identify the influence that a given regulatory gene exerts on gene networks and intracellular systems. Whilst such information does not identify direct transcriptional targets it should provide valuable insight into the genetic regulation of cell behaviour.</p><p>The value of this approach depends very heavily on the rigor of the primary analysis of the array hybridisation signals. Given the biological variability and high level of noise in this kind of dataset we have developed probabilistic models, namely the gamma Models for Oligonuceotide Signals (gMOS), that provide a robust estimate of expression level along with a measure of uncertainty for each gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Milo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We have assessed the performance of gMOS on a biological dataset by re-analysing temporal expression profiles in an epithelial cell line derived from the cochlear duct of a mouse inner ear at embryonic day E13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Rivolta1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we include new datasets from another epithelial cell line derived from the ventral otocyst at E10.5 that expresses key sensory cell markers during differentiation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Helyer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and from one that expresses critical markers for cochlear neuroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Nicholl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We focus our analysis on the zinc finger transcription factor <italic>gata3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Pandolfi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Patient1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> for several reasons. First, it is an early regulator of auditory system development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Karis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-LawokoKerali2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and is expressed in numerous cell types including sensory and non-sensory epithelial cells, efferent and afferent auditory neurons and periotic mesenchyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Karis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-LawokoKerali2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Lillevali1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Rivolta2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Null mice die in mid embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Pandolfi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and although a small otic vesicle forms it lacks a cochlear duct, semicircular canals and auditory ganglion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Karis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. There is direct evidence that gata3 regulates the expression of fibroblast growth factor 10 (<italic>fgf10</italic>) in the otic placode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Lillevali2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Ohuchi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the expression patterns in vivo suggest that it has a more fundamental role in cell signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-LawokoKerali2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. All of the cell lines used in this work were selected for expression of <italic>gata3</italic> and provide an opportunity to explore its function at a cellular level. The second reason for studying <italic>gata3</italic> is that haploinsufficiency causes severe hearing loss in man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-VanEsch1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-VanEsch2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Verri1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and heterozygous null mice suffer a hearing loss of about 30dB from the onset of hearing with a progressive, degenerative loss of sensory hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-vanderWees1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This dose-dependency should increase the chances of identifying functionally associated genes by clustering temporal profiles of gene expression. Third, the expression of <italic>gata3</italic> is conserved amongst vertebrates and also occurs in T-lymphocytes, endothelial cells, placenta, kidney, adrenal gland, hair follicles and parts of the peripheral and central nervous systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Hendriks1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Kornhauser1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Kurek1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Murphy1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Nardelli1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus our results could be relevant to the development of many other tissues.</p><p>The results validate our application of gMOS models to real biological datasets from oligonucleotide arrays and have allowed us to establish entirely objective, ranked lists of genes clustered with <italic>gata3</italic> in each of 3 cell lines. A final list was prepared by selecting those genes that were most highly ranked in all cell lines under all culture conditions. The results reveal a previously unknown functional link to insulin-like growth factor signaling and to the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB, which is a hub signaling molecule for a number of tyrosine kinase receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Brazil1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This may explain elements of the mechanism by which <italic>gata3</italic> might &#x02018;orchestrate the regulation of different signaling pathways&#x02019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Kurek1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and co-ordinate the development of the auditory system and other tissues, including the eye and central nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Performance of gMOS and mgMOS for the analysis of gene expression data</title><p>Three main datasets were used in this study. They were taken from cells cultured for 14 days under differentiating conditions. The first included 12 time points for the epithelial cell line UB/OC-1 (OC-1), which was derived from organ of Corti at embryonic day E13.5 and cultured with 10&#x00025; serum. This dataset is composed of 24 .CEL files with two chips (Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; MU11k A and MU11k B) covering 11,000 genes of the mouse genome and originally analysed with Microarray Analysis Software MASv.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Rivolta1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The second dataset included 6 time points for the epithelial cell line US/VOT-E36 (VOT-E36), which was derived from the ventral part of the otic vesicle at E10.5 and cultured in serum-free media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Helyer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. It was produced from 6 hybridisations to the Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; Mg_U74Av2 for a total of six .CEL files. The third was a joint set taken only at 0 days and 14 days from VOT-E36 and US/VOT-N33 (VOT-N33) cultured with 10&#x00025; serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-LawokoKerali1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and hybridised on Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; MU11k A and MU11k B (eight .CEL files). Whilst OC-1 and VOT-E36 represent epithelial cells at different developmental stages, VOT-N33 was derived from auditory neuroblasts at E10.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Nicholl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The analysis was thus based upon 38 .CEL files representing 22 different cell preparations and three different array platforms. The datasets for the full temporal profiles have been deposited in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nvbi.nlm.nih.giv/geo">http://www.nvbi.nlm.nih.giv/geo</ext-link>) under the accession numbers GSE36 and GSE15585.</p><p>We required a model that would estimate hybridization signals as accurately as possible with a robust estimate of the background, particularly those signals expressed at low levels, and that would provide a measure of uncertainty for each probe-set or transcript. The ability to do this also facilitates the need to merge data from different GeneChip platforms. Thus we chose to test the application of the gamma Model for Oligonucleotide Signals (gMOS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Milo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and the subsequent modification, mgMOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Liu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Rattray1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

They were developed for the specific questions addressed in this study and have evolved into a more complete package for analysis of microarray data. They are now integrated into Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">http://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>) in the package <italic>puma</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007144-Pearson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, an open source and open development software project for the analysis of genomic data.</p><p>We compared the temporal expression profile for <italic>gata3</italic> derived by Taqman qRT-PCR from the cell line OC-1 with the same samples hybridized to the MU11k GeneChips and analysed with either gMOS, mgMOS, MASv.5 or Robust Microarray Analysis (RMA). The results from RMA were obtained with a single call of the algorithm in which all of the files were processed together. The qRT-PCR profile showed that <italic>gata3</italic> was expressed at very low levels before day 7, peaked at days 8&#x02013;9 and then decreased to about half of the peak value by day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007144-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The presence of gata3 protein at all time points was confirmed both by immunocytochemistry and by immunoblotting. Signal detection from the array data through the first 7 days was variable. MAS v.5 did not preserve the RT-PCR profile for <italic>gata3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007144-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The RMA profile oscillated during the first week but the peak expression level was less than 2-fold higher than that at the start and not significantly better than the biological noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007144-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). gMOS did not detect a signal for the probe set at selected time points, which made the expression profile very irregular through the first 7 days, although it represented the peak as significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007144-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). mgMOS took account of the correlation between Perfect Match (PM) and MisMatched (MM) values on the arrays and provided a more accurate estimate than gMOS of low levels of expression as well as revealing the overall profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007144-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The difference in the estimated level of gene expression between the first time points and the peak expression was about 5-fold which is substantially higher than the background noise.

However, PKB&#x003b2;/Akt2 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm with some evidence for down-regulation of the protein. An exclusive transcriptional link is unlikely because although the expression patterns for the two proteins were similar throughout the ear they were not identical and PKB&#x003b2;/Akt2 was clearly expressed in groups of cells that lacked gata3. Nevertheless, nuclear localisation in vivo coincided with cells expressing high levels of gata3, consistent with the in vitro data.

RNA was assessed and quantified spectrometrically and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. cDNA was prepared with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) with 1 &#x000b5;g of total RNA for a final 20 &#x000b5;L reaction volume. After cooling on ice for 5 min, the cDNA was stored a &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. TaqMan probe and primer sets, including 18S rRNA for use as a reference, were selected from the Applied Biosystems web site following the UNIGENE accession number and/or Affymetrix probe set ID for each target. TaqMan Low Density Arrays (TLDAs) were custom designed on Applied Biosystems 7900HT 348-well 96a Micro Fluidic Card platforms. 5 &#x000b5;L of single-stranded cDNA (equivalent to 250 ng of total RNA) were mixed with 45 &#x000b5;L of nuclease-free water and 50 &#x000b5;L of TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and loaded into one sample port. The cards were centrifuged twice for 1 minute at 330 g and sealed to prevent well-to-well contamination. They were placed in the Micro Fluidic Card sample block on an ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) following the &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; thermal cycling option. Three controls with related RNAi cell cultures were used in duplicate on three different cards and the data analyzed together as a relative quantity (RQ) study. Expression values for target genes were normalized to the concentration of 18S rRNA. Estimates for gene expression were based on the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method. The Ct data for all targets were used to evaluate the &#x00394;Ct values as (Ct<sub>target</sub> - Ct<sub>18S rRNA</sub>) and then averaged across replicates. Standard deviation values were also calculated for each &#x00394;Ct. Subsequently, &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct values were calculated as &#x00394;Ct<sub>target</sub> &#x02013; &#x00394;Ct<sub>calibrator</sub>. The Control cultures were used as calibrators.
