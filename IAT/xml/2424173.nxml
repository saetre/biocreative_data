Experiments in tissues and single myocytes indicated that mechanical stretch significantly increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the amplitude and duration of muscle contraction. Stretch- induced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks and contractility increases were abrogated by the NO inhibitor L-NAME and were also absent in eNOS knockout mice. Furthermore, exposure of eNOS null mice to exogenously generated NO induced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks. The soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ did not inhibit SICR, but this process was effectively blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitors LY494002 and wortmannin; the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS were up-regulated by 204&#x000b1;28.6&#x00025; and 258&#x000b1;36.8&#x00025; by stretch, respectively.

NOS activation by stretch of cardiac muscle is mediated by activation of the PI(3)K&#x02212;Akt&#x02212;endothelial NOS axis, and contributes to myocardial contractile activation during heart stretch. Recently we demonstrated that cell stretch induces Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release in the form of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks in smooth muscle cells isolated from the urinary bladder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Ji1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The upstream transduction mechanism linking cell elongation to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release in smooth muscle is not known, however. In the present study we investigated the signaling pathways mediating stretch-induced Ca2&#x0002b; release in smooth muscle. We report that smooth muscle stretch enhances NO production and that this increase correlates with augmented RYR -mediated Ca2&#x0002b; sparks. The production of NO is both necessary and sufficient to trigger Ca2&#x0002b; sparks, as stretch &#x02013;induced Ca2&#x0002b; sparks were not activated under conditions of NOS inhibition or in eNOS knockout smooth muscle, and exogenous NO restored stretch &#x02013;induced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release in eNOS knockout cells, indicating that, NO mediates stretch-induced Ca2&#x0002b; release through activation of PI(3)K-Akt&#x02212;endothelial NOS axis in smooth muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Single Cell and Tissue Strip Preparation</title><p>Mice including eNOS knockout mice that were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized and euthanized in accordance with an approved laboratory animal protocol of Cornell University and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Moreover, elongation of smooth muscle resulted in an increase in NO production in tissue segments and single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002526-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) and eNOS gene inactivation resulted in the loss of SICR, but not CICR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002526-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). We have also demonstrated a functional role for NO coupling to SICR: stretch &#x02013;induced contractions were inhibited by L-NAME and enhanced by SNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002526-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The production of NO preceded the induction of Ca2&#x0002b; sparks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002526-g006">Fig. 6 C&#x00026;D</xref>), but its action was not dependent on soluble guanylyl cyclase activity and the activation of PKG, as SICR occurred in the presence of sGC and PKG inhibitors, and was not augmented by a cell permeant cGMP analogue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002526-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). On the other hand, release was inhibited by the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY492004 and wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002526-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Moreover, phosphorylation assay of Akt and eNOS demonstrated that both phospho-Akt and phospho-eNOS levels were greatly up-regulated by stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002526-g008">Fig. 8</xref>), suggesting the activation of PI(3)K/Akt pathway by stretch further.</p><p>These findings establish NO as a critical coupling molecule linking membrane tension to SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release. NO has been shown to increase the activity of ryanodine receptors in cardiac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-vanderWees1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Petroff1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and skeletal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Sun1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Eu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> muscle. As the stimulation of guanylyl cyclase by NO is a prominent smooth muscle relaxant mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Rybalkin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, the role of NO in SICR seems counter intuitive. However, similar to cardiac muscle, SICR is independent of the activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG, indicating a compartmentalization of NO signaling. Wees et al linked stretch &#x02013;induced NO formation and Ca2&#x0002b; release to the stimulation of integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-vanderWees1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, presenting evidence that release occurs through the stimulation of cardiac type, RYR2, ryanodine receptors. We have previously shown that SICR in smooth muscle also occurs through the activation of RYR2 SR channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Ji1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Ji2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. it has been known that FKBP12.6 is closely associated with RYR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Xin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, we, therefore, further examined SICR in FKBP12.6 deletion urinary bladder smooth myocytes in order to supporting SICR occurs through activation of RYR2 in smooth muscle. The results indicated that Ca2&#x0002b; spark property and kinetics were significantly altered by stretch in FKBP12.6 null myocytes compared to that in wildtype myoccytes (data not shown). Thus SICR in smooth muscle bears essential similarities to that of cardiac muscle. Although recent work in mouse embryo bladder myocytes demonstrated that RYR1 is required for depolarization-induced Ca2&#x0002b; spark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002526-Fritz1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, our conclusion that stretch-induced Ca2&#x0002b; spark was mediated by activation of RYR2 does not oppose the voltage depolarizing induced Ca2&#x0002b; release through RYR1 in mouse embryo bladder smooth muscle. This was also proved by the parallel experiments of stretch and voltage depolarization carried out in eNOS-/- myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002526-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) in the present study that stretch did not cause Ca2&#x0002b; spark but membrane voltage depolarization did, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms of stretch-induced Ca2&#x0002b; spark and voltage depolarization induced Ca2&#x0002b; spark are different.</p><p>It remains unclear how NO affects Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release via RyR2.

In this regard, future studies on mechanical activation of muscle should focus on the mechanism by which the action of NO remains tightly linked to RYR2 activation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0002526-BaylissW1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
