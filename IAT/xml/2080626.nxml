Here we sought to identify those mediators by interrogating the transcriptomes of a panel of NSCLC cell lines that have been characterized for the presence of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations. We found a transcriptional profile of <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant NSCLC cells that included genes not previously been known to be EGFR-dependent. Although the range of cellular functions attributed to these genes is broad, many of them are linked through known or predicted protein interaction networks.
