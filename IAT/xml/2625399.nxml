This condition results in hyperphenylalaninemia and elevated levels of abnormal phenylalanine metabolites, among which is phenylacetic acid/phenylacetate (PA). In recent years, PA and its analogs were found to have anticancer activity against a variety of malignancies suggesting the possibility that PKU may offer protection against cancer through chronically elevated levels of PA. We tested this hypothesis in a genetic mouse model of PKU (PAH<sup>enu2</sup>) which has a biochemical profile that closely resembles that of human PKU. Plasma levels of phenylalanine in homozygous (HMZ) PAH<sup>enu2</sup> mice were &#x0003e;12-fold those of heterozygous (HTZ) littermates while tyrosine levels were reduced. Phenylketones, including PA, were also markedly elevated to the range seen in the human disease. Mice were subjected to 7,12 dimethylbenz&#x0005b;a&#x0005d;anthracene (DMBA) carcinogenesis, a model which is sensitive to the anticancer effects of the PA derivative 4-chlorophenylacetate (4-CPA). Tumor induction by DMBA was not significantly different between the HTZ and HMZ mice, either in total tumor development or in the type of cancers that arose. HMZ mice were then treated with 4-CPA as positive controls for the anticancer effects of PA and to evaluate its possible effects on phenylalanine metabolism in PKU mice. 4-CPA had no effect on the plasma concentrations of phenylalanine, phenylketones, or tyrosine. Surprisingly, the HMZ mice treated with 4-CPA developed an unexplained neuromuscular syndrome which precluded its use in these animals as an anticancer agent. Together, these studies support the use of PAH<sup>enu2</sup> mice as a model for studying human PKU. Chronically elevated levels of PA in the PAH<sup>enu2</sup> mice were not protective against cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>About the time of the discovery of phenylketonuria (PKU) in 1934 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Flling1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, it was reported that patients with this disease excreted abnormally high levels of phenylalanine metabolites in their urine. These metabolites included a variety of compounds that normally arise when phenylalanine is not broken down in the normal fashion by the liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), resulting in an alternate pathway of phenylalanine metabolism. These observations led to the discovery of the causative factor of PKU as being a lack of PAH activity due to one or more mutations in the gene coding for this enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Guldberg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the compounds that was shown to be markedly elevated in the urine of PKU subjects was the phenylalanine metabolite phenylacetic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Michals1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This compound, or the ionized form of the molecule, phenylacetate (PA), is usually undetectable in plasma of normal individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Tuchman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. PA has been used for a long time in the treatment of conditions associated with hyperammonemia (e.g. urea cycle disorders) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Brusilow1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Scaglia1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This experience has indicated that millimolar blood serum levels of PA can be achieved without significant adverse effects; prolonged treatment with PA (up to 6 years) of children with inborn errors of urea synthesis have not shown significant signs of toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Batshaw1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This lack of toxicity, along with studies demonstrating the anticancer properties of PA derivatives against a variety of malignancies, prompted intense investigation of these compounds in anticancer applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Samid1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sawatsri1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. To this end, our previous work demonstrated that PA and its halide derivative 4-chlorophenylacetate (4-CPA), can retard the growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells in vitro, and the development of breast cancer in an in vivo mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sawatsri1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sidell2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Utilizing transgenic mice which exhibit chronically elevated levels of estrogen in their mammary glands, these latter studies showed that 4-CPA inhibited the development and growth of estrogen-driven breast tumors. This antiestrogenic activity may be due to the ability of PA and 4-CPA to interfere with estrogen signaling through their direct binding to estrogen response element regulatory sites in the promoters of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sidell3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This information inexorably leads one to ask the following question. Since PA is one of the metabolites of phenylalanine that is elevated in individuals with PKU, is the cancer incidence/types/cancer mortality different in this population of people? If so, PKU may be &#x0201c;nature's model&#x0201d; for assessing the anticancer properties of this compound. To our knowledge, no such study has yet been conducted. One reason for the dearth of information on this subject may be that the oldest early-detected adults with PKU are only now in their 40&#x02032;s, since national newborn screening did not start until 1963 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Guthrie1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. With a population that young, and the cancer incidence among such a young group very low, coupled with the small population size to begin with (total PKU population of all ages of early-treated persons is probably less than 15,000 nationally), it may be difficult to discover anything definitive about the protective effects of phenylacetate among these individuals. A more interesting population to look at might be the older untreated adults with PKU, where one would expect more cancer due to age. In addition, given their untreated PKU, this population would likely have the highest amounts of phenylacetate in their blood. However, for the most part these untreated individuals are institutionalized, and tracking down significant number would be difficult. Thus, although there are some states (e.g. California and Minnesota) which maintain PKU registries to facilitate acquisition of this data, it is clear that, at this time, obtaining a definitive answer to these questions may not be possible. As a result, we have tested our hypothesis that PKU may protect against certain kinds of cancers by utilizing a well-characterized PKU mouse model and a 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced tumor induction protocol. Our results did not show a significant difference between the development of tumors in PKU and control mice, and therefore do not support the above hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Phenylalanine, phenyketone, and CYP1B1 levels</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004292-t001">Table 1</xref> shows that phenylalanine and phenylketone levels, known to be elevated in human PKU, were elevated in the PKU homozygous PAH<sup>eun2/eun2</sup> (HMZ) mice and in the range reported in the human disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Tuchman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Michals2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The main enzyme responsible for the catalytic conversion of DMBA to an active carcinogen is the P450 enzyme CYP1B1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Buters1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This conversion takes place mainly in the liver. CYP1A1, although also contributing to the metabolism of DMBA, is thought to only play a minor role in this process. Thus, potential differences in tumor induction between HMZ and control animals could reflect differences in the levels of these enzymes which would correspondingly affect the carcinogenic potential of administered DMBA. To address this potential complication in our study, we measured the activity of these enzymes using ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) as a surrogate substrate for DMBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sidell2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, there was no significant difference between HTZ and HMZ mice in the conversion of DMBA to its carcinogenic metabolite that might otherwise have complicated the interpretation of possible differences in tumor induction between the groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Tumor development</title><p>To determine whether the HMZ mice show a reduced incidence of tumor induction, we employed a protocol similar to that previously used in our aromatase transgenic mouse study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sidell2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, with the exception that slow release (90 day) MPA pellets were added to the treatment to increase the incidence of tumors induced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Aldaz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. MPA treatment was not necessary in the transgenic mouse study due to the chronically elevated estrogen levels in the mammary tissue of these mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Keshava1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. For these experiments, 4 mice in the HTZ group and 5 in the HMZ group expired before the experiment was terminated and no tumors were discovered upon necropsy. Therefore, these mice were not counted. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004292-g001">figure 1</xref>, tumors started to appear in both the HTZ and HMZ groups between 12 and 16 weeks after the last dose of DMBA and there were no significant differences in subsequent tumor development between the groups at any time point (two-tailed Fisher's exact test). The mean tumor latency (&#x000b1;s.d.) for the HTZ and HMZ mice was 22.9 (7.4) and 27.1 (6.9) weeks, respectively. Using the log-rank test, the development of tumors between the two groups is not significant (p-value of 0.37) which is consistent with the results from the Fisher's exact test. In contrast to our previous study in which the overwhelming majority of tumors that were induced in DMBA-treated aromatase transgenic mice were breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sidell2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, a variety of tumor types developed in both the HTZ and HMZ mice including ovarian, uterine, mammary cancers, and lymphomas.

However, it should be noted that the number of mice used in these experiments was not sufficient for detecting differences in the development of the specific tumor types found in the study groups. Indeed, based on the tumors showing the largest prevalence as well as the greatest difference in occurrence between the HMZ and HTZ groups (mammary tumors), at least 220 mice in each group would be required to detect significant differences relating to the development of specific tumor types (two-tailed Fisher's exact test).

As such, these results did not provide evidence that PKU can protect against cancer. A possible reason for the lack of PA effects in this study versus the potent suppression of 4-CPA on tumor induction in aromatase-transgenic mice could be that tumors induced in the latter are almost exclusively estrogen-driven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sidell2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Keshava1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

This plasma concentration of 4-CPA was similar to that achieved in our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sidell2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004292-Sidell4">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004292-t002">Table 2</xref> also shows that administration of 4-CPA did not significantly affect the levels of phenylketones, tryrosine, or phenylalanine in the plasma of the HMZ or HTZ mice. Therefore, administration of PA derivatives did not alter the metabolic degradation of tyrosine such as to result in its increased plasma levels. However, in contrast to the complete lack of side effects of 4-CPA seen in our previous study and in the HTZ mice in the present work, the HMZ mice developed an unexplained neuromuscular syndrome which became apparent after the first week of 4-CPA treatment. This syndrome was characterized by limb weakness, hypermetria, and ataxia, and was progressive; by two weeks, weight lose of the mice was evident which appeared to be due to difficulty in walking and feeding. These adverse effects were only observed in the HMZ mice and prevented our testing of the anticancer properties of 4-CPA in these animals. Necropsy of the mice and histological analysis of the limb musculature did not reveal any lesions or apparent abnormalities. This interesting phenomenon was reversible; when the 4-CPA-containing water was replaced by normal water, all symptoms dissappeared within a few days. The characterization of this interesting syndrome and the determination of its cause will be the goal of future studies.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004292-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004292.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Amino Acid and Phenylketone Levels in Plasma of Treated Mice<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">a</xref>,<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt105">b</xref></title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004292-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0004292.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004292-t002-2"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenylacetate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenyllactate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenylpyruvate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4-CPA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt106">c</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tyrosine</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenylalanine</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Heterozygous</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Untreated</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt107">d</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.0&#x000b1;9.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">111.3&#x000b1;23.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4-CPA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt108">e</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">517.5&#x000b1;38.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">107.7&#x000b1;8.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">107.3&#x000b1;9.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Homozygous</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Untreated</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.0&#x000b1;1.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.3&#x000b1;2.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.9&#x000b1;7.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.0&#x000b1;9.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1453.7&#x000b1;5.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4-CPA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.1&#x000b1;0.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.8&#x000b1;2.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.2&#x000b1;2.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">428.6&#x000b1;62.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.0&#x000b1;6.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1051.3&#x000b1;77.9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt104"><label>a</label><p>All values are in &#x003bc;M/L and represent mean&#x000b1;SEM of three mice in each group.</p></fn><fn id="nt105"><label>b</label><p>Determined by GC/MS as reported in our earlier work (34).</p></fn><fn id="nt106"><label>c</label><p>4-chlorophenylacetate</p></fn><fn id="nt107"><label>d</label><p>not detected</p></fn><fn id="nt108"><label>e</label><p>4-CPA added to drinking water for 2 weeks at a concentration of 6 ng/ml.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Maintenance and treatment of mice</title><p>All procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the Care and Use of Animals and an animal study protocol approved by Emory University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

One month after the administration of DMBA, the mice were palpated for tumors and weekly observations were continued up until 10 months after DMBA treatment.
