We found that the p53 family members were functionally associated with Daxx, which was described originally as a cytoplasmic mediator of Fas signaling, but has been identified recently as a nuclear protein that co-localizes with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and regulates transcription. Extensive yeast two-hybrid assays indicated a physical interaction between a region including the oligomerization domain (OD) of p73&#x003b1; (amino acids 345&#x02013;380) or p53 (amino acids 319&#x02013;360) and amino acids 161&#x02013;311 and 667&#x02013;740 (C-terminal S&#x0002f;P&#x0002f;T-rich domain) of hDaxx, which is the common binding region of Fas, ASK1 and PML. This interaction was further confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down and <italic>in vivo</italic> immunoprecipitation assays. Both Daxx and p73&#x0002f;p53 co-localized in nuclear dot-like structures, which are probably nuclear PML oncogenic domains (PODs) or the nuclear domain NB10. Transient co-expression of Daxx resulted in strong inhibition of p73- and p53-mediated transcriptional activation of the synthetic p53-responsive and p21WAF1 promoters. Consequently, Gal4-Daxx repressed basal transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with trichostatin A, which is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, or PML over-expression relieved Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression of p53. The mechanism underlying PML-mediated derepression appears to be competitive binding between Daxx, p53 and PML. Taken together, these findings delineate a transcriptional regulatory network that is modulated by differential Daxx&#x02013;p53&#x02013;PML interactions in the nuclear PODs. Therefore, Daxx is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of p53 and possibly its family members.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The tumor suppressor p53 plays significant roles in growth arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis, by acting as a transcription factor to modulate the expression of various genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c1">1</xref>). Depending on the promoter context, the stimulus type and the cellular environment, p53 functions not only to activate gene transcription, but also to repress the expression of responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c2">2</xref>). The repression mechanism is mediated either by direct binding to the response element or by indirect interactions with other transcriptional regulators, depending on the promoter context. It has been reported that the C-terminal oligomerization domain (OD) of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c5">5</xref>), histone deacetylase (HDAC) and mSin3a are involved in p53-mediated repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Recently, p73 and p63 were identified as members of the p53 family, and their activities have been reviewed extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c12">12</xref>). As is the case with p53, both p73 and p63 can form oligomers, bind to canonical p53 DNA-binding sites, modulate the transcription of p53-responsive genes, and suppress growth or induce apoptosis when over-expressed in certain human tumors. However, unlike p53, the p73 and p63 isomers harbor sterile &#x003b1;-motif (SAM) domains, which may be involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions, at their C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c13">13</xref>). In addition, since p73 and p63 mutations are rarely found in tumors, they are unlikely to represent classical tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, the p53 family members share certain functions, but have distinct responses to extracellular signals and developmental cues at the physiological level. Thus, it is of interest to determine how the p53 family is regulated differentially at the molecular level. With this in mind, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen, and found that hDaxx interacted with p73.</p><p>Daxx was identified initially in yeast two-hybrid screens as the protein whose C-terminal region associated with the death domain of the Fas receptor and promoted Fas-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c14">14</xref>). Later, it was reported that Daxx mediated apoptosis by linking Fas signaling to the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway via apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activation in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c16">16</xref>). Subsequent studies have suggested that, in response to Fas activation, Daxx translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with ASK1 to promote caspase-independent cell death, thus preventing Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c18">18</xref>). In contrast to the original findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c16">16</xref>), most recent studies have indicated that Daxx is present exclusively in the nucleus, where it may play a direct role in regulating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c22">22</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that Daxx is anti-apoptotic rather than pro-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c24">24</xref>). In the nucleus, Daxx is recruited to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) oncogenic domains (PODs) through interaction with the SUMO-1-modified PML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c25">25</xref>), whereby both proteins appear to participate in a novel apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c26">26</xref>). Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression may be due to interactions with DNA methyltransferase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c23">23</xref>) and HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c27">27</xref>). PML appears to inhibit the repressive function of Daxx by transporting it from the condensed chromatin to PODs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c20">20</xref>). In a similar manner, SUMO-1-modified PML can derepress Pax3 transcriptional activity, which is subject to repression by Daxx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c28">28</xref>). Reminiscent of PML sequestration of Daxx to PODs, it has been reported recently that MSP58 translocates Daxx to the nucleolus, and thus inhibits Daxx-mediated repression of the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c29">29</xref>). Furthermore, it is of interest to note that PML also binds and targets p53 into PODs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c31">31</xref>). The C-terminal sequences of PML outside of the sumoylation sites interact with the DNA-binding domain of p53. The splice variants of PML, PML-L and PML-RAR&#x003b1;, lack this region, and thus <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down assays did not detect any interactions. The PML sequestration of p53 results in the activation of p53 target genes that are involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c30">30</xref>). This mode of PML activity depends on the abilities to form the nuclear PODs and to become sumoylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. These observations suggest that POD is a dynamic site that modulates transcriptional activities, thereby affecting cellular processes such as apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c32">32</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that Daxx plays a regulatory role in linking the functions of PML and p53.</p><p>Daxx was identified from our yeast two-hybrid screening, which used p73 as the bait, and subjected to further investigation. We examined the sites of interaction of the p73&#x0002f;p53 and Daxx proteins, the biological significance of this interaction, and the role of PML in the p53&#x02013;Daxx interaction. We observed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> physical interactions between the ODs of the p53 family proteins and a region near the C-terminus of hDaxx. These proteins co-localized in the nuclear bodies, and Daxx inhibited the transcriptional activities of p73 and p53 in a dose-dependent manner. The co-repressor activity of Daxx was abrogated in the presence of trichostatin A (TSA), which is an inhibitor of HDAC-1. Finally, we found that Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression was relieved by competitive association of PML3 with the Daxx co-repressor. Taken together, these observations suggest that Daxx functions as a transcriptional repressor of p53 and members of the p53 family, and that this repressive effect can be modulated by PML.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>All cells used in our experiments were routinely maintained in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10&#x00025; heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin&#x0002f;streptomycin (all from Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD).</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA constructions</title><p>Most cDNA constructs were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c8">8</xref>).

The yeast two-hybrid screening has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c8">8</xref>). A total of 42 unique library plasmids were obtained from the initial screen. DNA sequencing and subsequent GenBank searches indicated that four of these clones contained partial sequence of hDaxx, which comprised amino acids 526&#x02013;740 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f1">1</xref>B). This protein interacted strongly with p73&#x003b1; (amino acids 49&#x02013;636), but not with the unrelated IRF-2 protein in the yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f2">2</xref>A). Further yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that hDaxx interacted with other members of the p53 family, which included p73&#x003b2;, p53, p63&#x003b1; and p63&#x003b3;, the transactivation domains of which were deleted for the purpose of the assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f2">2</xref>B).</p><p>In order to map the Daxx interaction domains of the p53 family members, deletion derivatives were fused to the LexA DBD in the pBTM116 vector, and these constructs were co-transformed into the yeast strain L40, together with the original fusion of hDaxx with the Gal4 AD. Although the full-length p73&#x003b1; fused to the DBD showed transcriptional activity due to the presence of the transactivation domain, the interaction with Daxx was evident as shown by increased &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity when DBD-fused p73&#x003b1; was co-expressed with AD-Daxx. Assays using a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of p73&#x003b1; indicated that the region around the OD was required for the interaction with Daxx (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f3">3</xref>A). Further analysis with the p73&#x003b1; (amino acids 49&#x02013;380) and p73&#x003b1; (amino acids 345&#x02013;400) domains revealed that the minimal interaction domain lay between amino acids 345 and 380. Interestingly, another independent interaction domain, which included the SAM domain, was located near the C-terminus. Further deletions in these regions abolished the interaction with Daxx. As was the case with p73, p53 strongly associated with Daxx. Like p73, the OD (amino acids 319&#x02013;360) of p53 appeared to be at least sufficient for the interaction with Daxx. However, in the case of p53, the C-terminal regulatory region (amino acids 361&#x02013;393) appeared to contribute on the increased interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f3">3</xref>B). Likewise, the interaction domain of p63 was mapped between amino acids 352 and 388, in a region that encompassed the OD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f3">3</xref>C). In addition, we mapped a second interaction domain near the C-terminus, in an area that included the SAM domain of p63&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping the interaction domains of Daxx</title><p>Various deletion mutants of hDaxx were fused to the VP16 AD in the pASV3 vector, and analyzed for interactions with LexA DBD&#x02013;p73&#x003b1; (amino acids 49&#x02013;636) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f4">4</xref>). Neither LexA&#x02013;p73&#x003b1; (amino acids 49&#x02013;636) nor LexA alone interacted with VP16 AD. Assays with a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of hDaxx revealed that the C-terminal region between amino acids 667 and 740 was required and sufficient for the interaction with p73&#x003b1;. Further deletions in this region abolished the interaction with p73&#x003b1;. However, further deletions at the N-terminus uncovered an additional interaction domain. Interestingly, the C-terminal portion of Daxx is known to interact with several proteins, such as Fas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c14">14</xref>), ASK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c15">15</xref>), HSP27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c16">16</xref>), Pax3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c19">19</xref>), ETS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c21">21</xref>), Pax5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c22">22</xref>), PML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c25">25</xref>) and CENP-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c34">34</xref>), which indicates the dynamic regulatory role of Daxx.</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of the p53&#x02013;Daxx interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mammalian cells</title><p>To determine whether the p53&#x02013;Daxx interaction occurs <italic>in vitro</italic>, we performed GST pull-down assays in which either the GST&#x02013;p53 (amino acids 319&#x02013;393) or GST&#x02013;Daxx (amino acids 607&#x02013;740) protein was induced in <italic>E.coli</italic>, purified, and mixed with <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine-labeled Daxx, p53, p73&#x003b1;, p73&#x003b2;, p63&#x003b1; or p63&#x003b3; in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Binding of the p53 family members to Daxx was assessed using GST pull-down assays. Consistent with the results of the yeast two-hybrid experiments, the labeled p53 and its relatives were retained by glutathione beads that contained GST&#x02013;Daxx (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f5">5</xref>). In the reciprocal experiment, where the GST fusion was replaced with p53, the interaction between p53 and Daxx also occurred, albeit the effect was relatively weak (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f5">5</xref>B).

Thus, p53-null Saos2 cells were co-transfected transiently with plasmids that encoded HA-p73&#x003b1; or HA-p53 and GFP&#x02013;Daxx, and analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy. Consistent with previous reports, Daxx localized primarily to the nuclear spots, which probably correspond to PML bodies or PODs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c26">26</xref>). Both p73&#x003b1; and p53 yielded diffuse nuclear red fluorescence following Texas red staining (data not shown). However, when the p53 family members and Daxx were co-expressed, the p53 family members localized to distinct spots within the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f7">7</xref>A and B). These findings are reminiscent of previous reports that showed that PML targets p53 into the PML nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c31">31</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction data suggested that the p53 family members are associated physiologically with Daxx, which prompted us to investigate the biological significance of this interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Daxx modulates the transcriptional activity of p53 family proteins</title><p>To determine the effect of Daxx on the transcriptional activities of members of the p53 family, p53-null C33A cervical carcinoma cells were transfected transiently with a fixed amount of p73&#x003b1; or p53 and increasing amounts of hDaxx, along with the G5p53-CAT reporter construct (the CAT reporter gene under the control of a p53-responsive element; a gift from Dr Robbins, Pittsburgh, PA). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f8">8</xref>A, Daxx inhibited the transactivation of both p73&#x003b1; and p53 in a dose-dependent manner. Additional transfection assays, in which the yeast Gal4-responsive 17m5-TATA-CAT reporter was used instead of G5p53-CAT, showed that Daxx also repressed the transcriptional activities of Gal4-fused p73&#x003b1; and p53, without affecting Gal4 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f8">8</xref>B), which suggests that Daxx functions as a co-repressor of the p53 proteins through protein&#x02013;protein interactions. To rule out the possibility that apoptosis induced by the transfected Daxx might cause transcriptional downregulation, we measured the total protein concentrations produced by each of the transfections. No differences in the total protein levels might indicate that Daxx does not induce apoptosis under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, western analysis indicated no differences in the levels of p73&#x003b1; and p53 regardless of increased expressions of Daxx (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f8">8</xref>A, inset), suggesting that Daxx neither induces apoptosis of transfected cells nor modulates downregulation of p73&#x003b1; and p53. Overall, these data suggest that Daxx represses specifically the transcriptional activity of the p53 family members, probably through specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p>HDAC involvement in Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression was also studied. TSA, which is a well known inhibitor of HDAC, was added to cells that were transfected with p73&#x003b1; or p53, the Daxx expression vectors and the G5p53-CAT reporter plasmid. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f8">8</xref>C, downregulation of the reporter gene was relieved by TSA in a dose-dependent manner. We observed similar responses in transfection assays using p21WAF1-CAT, which is a natural p53-responsive reporter (data not shown). A previous report indicated that Daxx repressed basal transcription by recruiting HDAC to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c20">20</xref>). To confirm this finding under our experimental conditions, we performed transient transfections with Gal4-Daxx expression vector and the yeast Gal4-responsive 17m5-<italic>tk</italic>-CAT reporter plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f8">8</xref>D). Increasing amounts of Gal4-Daxx had titratable inhibitory effects on basal transcription, resulting in &#x0223c;70&#x00025; repression. Furthermore, TSA reversed Gal4-Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, our transfection data suggest that histone deacetylation by HDAC is involved in Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression of the p53 family members.</p></sec><sec><title>PML relieves Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression</title><p>Since PML inhibits Daxx-mediated repression of basal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c20">20</xref>), and Pax3 activates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c28">28</xref>), and particularly activates p53 transcription by targeting it to the PML body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c31">31</xref>), we investigated whether PML also played a role in modulating Daxx-mediated repression of p53-mediated activation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f9">9</xref>A, the p53-responsive reporter activity of p21WAF1-CAT was gradually inhibited by increasing amounts of Daxx. This repression was relieved in a dose-dependent manner by PML3, but not by PML-L, which is another PML splice variant. This suggests that the effect is specific for PML3. When PML was expressed along with p53 in the absence of Daxx, PML3 (but not PML-L) increased the p53 activity slightly. This phenomenon may be attributed to the ability of PML3 to relieve p53 repression of endogenous Daxx. These observations corroborate the finding that PML3 (but not PML-L) interacts specifically with p53 for targeting to the PML body, thus promoting its biological functions, such as transactivation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c31">31</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into the underlying mechanism through which PML3 rescues Daxx-mediated repression of p53-activated transcription, we performed GST pull-down assays using GST&#x02013;Daxx, &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;p53 and PMLs. Both &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;p53 and PMLs were synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> using rabbit reticulocytes, while GST&#x02013;Daxx was purified as described previously. In the absence of PMLs, Daxx was able to interact with p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f9">9</xref>B and C). However, the addition of increasing amounts of PLM3 to the reaction mixture progressively inhibited the interaction of Daxx with p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f9">9</xref>B). In contrast, PLM-L was not as effective as PML3 in disrupting the Daxx&#x02013;p53 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg741f9">9</xref>C). These results indicate that PML3 competes specifically with Daxx for p53 binding, which is related to the previous finding that PML3, but not PML-L or RML-RAR&#x003b1;, interacts strongly with p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c31">31</xref>). Since our assays were performed <italic>in vitro</italic> under conditions that lacked the components necessary for sumoylation, it is not possible to speculate on the potential interactions between PML and Daxx, for which sumoylation of PML is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c26">26</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Daxx-mediated repression of p53 activation is relieved by PML3 binding to p53, which results in the observed release of p53 and the activation of p53-dependent transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we identified hDaxx as a p73-interacting protein, and found that Daxx could interact with other members of the p53 family. Daxx was originally described as a cytoplasmic mediator of Fas signaling, but was recently identified as a nuclear protein that co-localizes with PML and regulates transcription. On the basis of our yeast studies, we mapped the interaction domains of the p53 family proteins and the C-terminus of Daxx. These interactions were confirmed by GST pull-down assays <italic>in vitro</italic>, and by immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. Immunofluorescence assays using confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins co-localized in nuclear bodies, which were probably PML bodies or PODs. Various transfection assays indicated that the transcriptional activities of p73 and p53 from p73&#x0002f;p53-responsive promoters were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by Daxx co-expression. The co-repressor activity of Daxx appeared to be HDAC dependent, as demonstrated by treatment with TSA, which is an inhibitor of HDAC. Furthermore, PML co-expression, specifically that of PML3, relieved Daxx-mediated repression of p53 activity, due to specific disruption of the Daxx&#x02013;p53 complex by PML3. Taken together, these observations suggest that Daxx functions as a transcriptional repressor of members of the p53 family, and that the repressive effect is modulated specifically by PML3.</p><p>It has been proposed that PODs form a nuclear substructure that directs various cellular regulatory networks. PML, which is one of the major components of the nuclear PODs, is associated and co-localizes with several proteins, such as Sp100, Blm, p53, Rb, Mre11, NBS, CBP, Daxx and viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c36">36</xref>). These associated proteins may direct the cellular functions of PODs, which include translation, transcription, and DNA repair processes that influence apoptosis, cell proliferation and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c37">37</xref>). Recently, new roles in transcriptional regulation have been reported for PODs, based on studies showing that transcriptional regulators, such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c31">31</xref>), CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c39">39</xref>), HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c40">40</xref>) and HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c42">42</xref>), interact with PML in PODs. In addition, the location of Daxx in the nucleus appears to determine its role in transcriptional regulation. In the absence of PML, Daxx is located mainly in the condensed chromatin, where it may associate with HDAC to repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c20">20</xref>). However, when PML is expressed by either transfection or As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> induction, it targets Daxx to the PODS, which relieves the Daxx-mediated repression. This type of sequestration requires interaction between the N-terminal portion of PML, which includes the three sumoylation sites, and the C-terminal S&#x0002f;P&#x0002f;T-rich region of Daxx. Studies with PML mutants have indicated that the sumoylation of PML is essential not only for proper formation and stability of PODs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c26">26</xref>), but also for the reversal of Daxx activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c28">28</xref>). Although PML-RAR&#x003b1; shares the Daxx interaction domain with PML, it is not capable of reversing transcriptional repression caused by Daxx. This is probably because PML-RAR&#x003b1; disrupts the POD structure, thereby directing Daxx to the disrupted microparticulate structures, where it retains the ability to repress transcription. It is noteworthy that PML binds p53 and targets it into PODs via the interaction between its C-terminus, which lacks sumoylation sites, and the DBD of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c31">31</xref>). This interaction appears to be specific for PML3, since no interactions have been noted between p53 and the splice variants PML-L and PML-RAR&#x003b1;. However, in addition to the interactions that were determined <italic>in vitro</italic>, the sumoylation and POD localization of PML are required for p53 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recently, it has been reported that HIPK2, which co-localizes with PML in PODs, interacts directly with and phosphorylates p53 at Ser46. The phosphorylated p53 promotes CBP-mediated acetylation at Lys382, which results in p53 transcriptional activation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c42">42</xref>). In this respect, our studies indicated that HIPK2 could associate functionally with HDAC, and act as a co-repressor of the p53-repressible promoters, while enhancing apoptosis and growth repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c8">8</xref>). Interestingly, a more recent report indicates that the HIPK2 isoform HIPK1 interacts with and phosphorylates Daxx, thereby modulating both Daxx translocation from PODs and Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c43">43</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that PODs represent a dynamic site that modulates a network of regulatory pathways, which involve PML&#x02013;HIPK&#x02013;Daxx&#x02013;p53&#x02013;CBP interactions and protein modifications, such as the sumoylation of PML and p53, the phosphorylation of Daxx and p53, and the acetylation of p53, in response to various extracellular signals.</p><p>In terms of potential pathways in PODs, our current results describe how Daxx modulates the transcriptional activities of the p53 family. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> binding assays revealed that Daxx associated directly with the p53 family. What are the consequences of p73&#x0002f;p53 interaction with Daxx and its recruitment to PODs, as described above? Our initial evidence suggests that Daxx modulates the p73&#x0002f;p53 transactivation activity. Co-expression of Daxx partly inhibited the transactivation function of p53 and other members of the p53 family when p53-positive CAT reporter genes were used for transfection in p53-null C33A cells. The response was HDAC dependent, as determined by treating the cells with TSA, which is an inhibitor of HDAC. The co-repressor function of Daxx was inhibited selectively by the co-expression of PML3. In corroboration of the transfection data, our GST pull-down assays indicated that PML3, but not PML-L, disrupted the Daxx&#x02013;p53 complex, presumably by binding preferentially to p53, thereby freeing p53 from the repression complex and restoring its transcriptional activity. Previously, it was reported that PML sumoylation was required for proper targeting to PODs, which would relieve both Daxx-mediated repression of basal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c20">20</xref>) and Pax3-activated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c28">28</xref>). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether SUMO-1 conjugation is a prerequisite for PML to relieve Daxx-mediated repression of p53 activity, and whether targeting of PML to PODs is necessary for derepression. Nevertheless, we speculate that PML sumoylation is not required for derepression, because our GST pull-down assays were performed <italic>in vitro</italic> under conditions where the components required for sumoylation and PML targeting to PODs were lacking.</p><p>Daxx was originally identified as a cytoplasmic protein that promoted Fas-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c14">14</xref>). However, recent studies have indicated that Daxx is present exclusively in the nucleus, where it appears to play a direct role in regulating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c22">22</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that Daxx is anti-apoptotic rather than pro-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c24">24</xref>). Therefore, it remains unclear whether Daxx is pro- or anti-apoptotic. Reflecting these complexities, our data suggest that Daxx is anti-apoptotic, since it represses the transcriptional activity of p53, which is a critical inducer of apoptosis. However, it appears that PML, which is an inducer of both p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis, can restore p53 activity in the presence of Daxx. In support of the pro-apoptotic role of Daxx, we found that in addition to its repressive role in p53-activated transcription, it could also enhance p53-repressible transcription of the Coll-CAT and MDR-CAT reporters (data not shown). In addition to repressing collagenase and MDR genes, p53 also regulates negatively the transcription of growth regulation genes, such as cyclin B, Bcl-2, Map4, survivin and presenilin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c48">48</xref>). The C-terminal OD of p53 is necessary for p53-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c5">5</xref>), and the HDACs and mSin3a also appear to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c8">8</xref>). These observations correlate with our finding that Daxx associates with the OD of p53, and utilizes HDAC as part of its repression mechanism. However, it remains to be determined whether Daxx expression can further repress the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes that are regulated negatively <italic>in vivo</italic> by p53. Interestingly, Daxx appears to be both pro-apoptotic and growth suppressive when overexpressed in p53-positive U2OS cells, as determined by 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and colony formation analyses (data not shown). Although it is not clear whether or not the Daxx response is p53 dependent, it is possible that Daxx suppresses tumor cell growth through other members of the p53 family, such as p73 and p63. In support of this possibility, we found additional Daxx interaction domains (including the SAM domains) at the C-termini of p73 and p63. It will be interesting to determine whether such interactions are critical for Daxx function in apoptosis.</p><p>In contrast to our observations, a recent report indicated that tumorigenic mutants of p53 bind to Daxx and inhibit Daxx-dependent activation of ASK1, thereby preventing apoptosis that leads to cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c49">49</xref>). Under our experimental conditions, we were able to demonstrate clearly the interaction between the wild-type p53 and Daxx, which suggests a role for this interaction in the transcriptional regulation of p53. Consistent with our data, another report suggested a physical interaction between p53 and Daxx, although further investigations of the role of this complex in the regulation of transcription and apoptosis were not described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg741c31">31</xref>). The discrepancies noted between our study and the other studies may be due to differences in the experimental conditions and thus need to be clarified.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg741f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structural characteristics of p53 family proteins and Daxx homologs.
