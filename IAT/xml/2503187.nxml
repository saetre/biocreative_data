The proteasome is the major cellular proteolytic machinery responsible for the selective elimination of damaged proteins, thus preventing or delaying the accumulation of cross-linked protein aggregates. Lens fibers and lens epithelia have been demonstrated to have a completely functional ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which can selectively eliminate oxidized proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. An important factor that may contribute to the accumulation of cross-linked protein aggregates is the decrease in proteasome activity observed in aging lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Although some initial studies have indicated no correlations between proteasome activity and age in human lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], a more broad age range study demonstrated that aging of the human lens is accompanied by a decline in proteasome activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. This age-related decline in proteasome function has been correlated with cataract formation and is thought to contribute to the accumulation of carboxymethylated and ubiquitinated proteins observed in elderly lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. While this decline in proteasome activity affects preferentially trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities in bovine lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], studies in human lenses showed that the decrease in proteasome function with age is mainly associated with lower levels of peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Despite the potential importance of enhancing the activity of the proteasome as a means to prevent the accumulation of oxidized proteins and delay cataract formation, there is currently little information about the specific mechanisms by which such an increase in proteasome activity can be accomplished and whether it actually has protective effects in lens cells. Recent results conducted in human fibroblasts have shown that overexpression of just one &#x003b2;-type subunit may be sufficient to increase proteasome assembly and function. Overexpression of either &#x003b2;5 or &#x003b2;1 alone will result in the coordinated overexpression of the other two beta catalytic subunits, and the presence of &#x003b2;-type subunits leads to the recruitment of free (nonintegrated) &#x003b1; subunits and an increased number of proteasomes assembled in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. The increase in proteasome activity that results from overexpression of single &#x003b2;-type subunit has been shown to exert beneficial effects by delaying cellular senescence and increasing cell survival in response to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>Given the importance of understanding the role that the age-related decline in proteasome function may have in cataract formation, the objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to determine whether the overexpression of the proteasome catalytic &#x003b2;5 subunit (PSMB5) alone is sufficient to increase the expression of the subunits &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 and enhance proteasome activity in lens epithelial cells; and (2) to evaluate the potential cytoprotective role of increased proteasome activity in lens epithelial cells by measuring the effects on accumulation of oxidized protein and cell survival following oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; and the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA-3.1 were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

The reason for this age-related decrease in PGPH activity in human lens and other tissues is not clear yet. Proteasome subunits, similar to other proteins, may undergo oxidation reactions that result in both structural and functional changes. It has been suggested that preferential decline of PGPH activity with age results from a higher susceptibility of the &#x003b2;1 subunit to inactivation by oxidative processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, cross-linked proteins resulting either from prolonged oxidation or from reactions with lipid peroxidation products, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, have previously been reported to inhibit the proteasome activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>] and may also contribute to the overall decline in proteasome function in the lens.</p><p>The proteasome is believed to play a major role in preventing accumulation of damaged proteins in the lens; therefore identifying the means to modulate proteasome function and revert the age-related decline in PGPH activity should help to assess the relative importance of proteasome function in cataract progression and evaluate the potential therapeutic value for strategies based in proteasome upregulation.</p><p>One method that has been proven successful in generating an experimental increase in proteasome activity is the overexpression of the &#x003b2;5 subunit. Overexpression of this subunit in WI38/T and HL60 cells has been shown to elevate the levels of other &#x003b2;-type subunits and increase all three proteasome activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Functional studies have also shown that overexpression of &#x003b2;5 confers enhanced survival following oxidative stress that is associated with decreassed accumulation of oxidized proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>Our results showed that overexpression of the &#x003b2;5 subunit alone was sufficient to induce the expression of the subunits &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 in LECs. These results are in concordance with what has been reported in human fibroblasts and support that there is a dependent regulation mechanism among the &#x003b2;-type subunits. Although the mechanisms responsible for such coordinated expression of &#x003b2;-subunits are not known, their existence is supported by a number of studies conducted in vertebrate and invertebrate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].</p><p>At the functional level, the coordinated expression of &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 subunits induced by the overexpression of &#x003b2;5 was reflected in the increase in CT-L and PGPH catalytic activities. While CT-L activity is dependent on &#x003b2;5, PGPH activity is associated with the &#x003b2;1 subunit. The observed increase in PGPH activity is particularly relevant, since this is the proteasomal catalytic activity that experiences a more noticeable decline with age in the human lens. Such increase in activity is expected to require the incorporation of &#x003b2;5 subunits into complete proteasomes. Our results did not show any significant effect of &#x003b2;5 overexpression on the levels of constitutive alpha subunits. However, analysis by gel filtration has revealed a higher level of proteasome assembly following expression of &#x003b2;5 subunit in human fibroblasts that is directly linked to the efficient integration of "free" (not integrated) &#x003b1;-type subunits identified to accumulate in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. There is also evidence that the reported loss of proteasome function upon aging of several human tissues and senescent primary cultures is due to lower levels of &#x003b2;-type subunits, which appear to be "rate-limiting", whereas &#x003b1;-type subunits remain in excess as "free" subunits in senescent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Therefore, synthesis of additional &#x003b1; subunits may not be needed to assemble new functional proteasomes following the increased expression of &#x003b2;5 and the concomitant increase in expression of &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 subunits. Other alternative explanations for the observed increase in catalytic activity associated with overexpression of the &#x003b2;5 subunit in absence of a concomitant increase in the expression of &#x003b1; subunits are also possible. For example, some proteasome subunits have been reported to act as free monomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. Given the complexity of the proteasome maturation process and its regulation, the specific mechanisms by which overexpression of &#x003b2;-5 might result in an increase of proteasome activity and exert cytoprotective effects will require further investigations to be fully clarified.</p><p>The phenotypic effects of overexpression of &#x003b2;5 in lens cells included both: a significant decrease in the accumulation of oxidized proteins and enhanced cell viability and survival after oxidative stress. These results emphasize the importance of proteasome function as a defensive mechanism against oxidative insults and support the concept that the observed decline of proteasome functionality with age may be a relevant contributing factor leading to cataract formation. Accumulation of abnormal proteins in the lens is not only determined by their rates of formation, but also by their rates of elimination. Therefore, the rates of degradation of damaged proteins by the proteasome may constitute a critical factor in crosslinked protein accumulation and cataract formation. Increasing evidence supports the idea that the ability of the proteasome to degrade oxidized proteins serves as a secondary cellular antioxidant defense system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. Consistent with this notion, once the first line of defense constituted by antioxidant mechanisms, such as the presence of reduced glutathione, is over-run, the maintenance of proper protein structure and configuration in the lens may relay in the ability of the proteasome system to selectively eliminate damaged proteins and prevent their accumulation.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the proteasome can be genetically "upregulated" in lens cells by over expression of the &#x003b2;5 catalytic subunit, and the resulting increase in proteasome activity enhances capacity of the cells to cope with oxidative stress. Because the proteasome is down regulated during the process of aging of the lens, the ability to experimentally increase proteasome activity should be helpful to study the relative importance of the age-related decline of proteasome function in cataract formation and could potentially lead to new therapeutic approaches to delay the progress of this disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Y.L.; No. 30070802) and a grant from Science Foundation of Guangzhou (No.2002Z1-Z0141; Y.L.).
