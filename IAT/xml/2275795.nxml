The need for novel small molecule modulators of biological processes has driven a number of targeted screens on large diverse libraries. However, due to the specific focus of such screens, the majority of the bioactive potential of these libraries remains unharnessed. In order to identify a higher proportion of compounds with interesting biological activities, we screened a diverse synthetic library for compounds that perturb the development of any of the multiple organs in zebrafish embryos. We identified small molecules that affect the development of a variety of structures such as heart, vasculature, brain, and body-axis. We utilized the previously known role of retinoic acid in anterior-posterior (A&#x02013;P) patterning to identify the target of DTAB, a compound that caused A&#x02013;P axis shortening in the zebrafish embryo. We show that DTAB is a retinoid with selective activity towards retinoic acid receptors &#x003b3; and &#x003b2;. Thus, conducting zebrafish developmental screens using small molecules will not only enable the identification of compounds with diverse biological activities in a large chemical library but may also facilitate the identification of the target pathways of these biologically active molecules.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small molecules have proved to be powerful tools for understanding the importance of molecular pathways in development and disease. When compared to traditional genetic mutations, they have the advantage that they can be used to reversibly perturb the functions of molecules at different points of embryonic development or disease progression. Due to the concentration-dependent effects of small molecules on their targets, it is also possible to uncover phenotypes that result from partial inactivation of a pathway. Their intracellular permeability permits their use in cultured cells as well as whole organisms and makes them candidates for use in therapeutics. This has made the identification of novel small molecule modulators of important genetic networks an area of intense interest.</p><p>In an effort to discover novel disease modulators, a number of synthetic and natural chemical libraries have been assembled in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Ortholand1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Schreiber1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The relative simplicity of purified proteins, cultured cells, and other <italic>in vitro</italic> systems has been utilized successfully in many targeted small molecule screens, resulting in the identification of novel biological tools and therapeutic candidates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Mayer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Kawasumi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, such screens interrogate a library for very specific interactions with one or a few protein targets, and hence only the small percentage of the library with one specific activity is uncovered. Thus, to explore the full potential of a diverse chemical library, a vast number of targeted screens would be essential. In contrast, the use of a complex but sensitive assay capable of identifying perturbations in thousands of potential targets simultaneously affords the possibility of uncovering a large proportion of all unknown modulators of biological pathways contained in these libraries. Zebrafish embryos make an ideal model system for in vivo small molecule screens due to their small size, optical transparency, accessibility during development <italic>ex utero</italic>, and permeability to small molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-MacRae1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, since embryonic development and patterning require the precise regulation of myriad different genetic networks, they are extremely sensitive to perturbations by small molecule modulators.</p><p>A major challenge of employing phenotypic screens for identifying small molecules is delineating their molecular targets. Zebrafish embryogenesis progresses through a strictly stereotypical sequence of events choreographed by numerous signaling pathways. Perturbation of these molecular pathways leads to distinct and predictable defects in the embryos that are easily detectable and have been extensively characterized for thousands of genetic mutants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zfin.org">www.zfin.org</ext-link>). Therefore, in many cases, the developmental defects caused by a small molecule can be linked with high resolution to a specific genetic pathway known to cause the same defect.</p><p>Many biological pathways that govern embryonic development remain active in the adult, and the study of embryonic development has led to important insights into the role of these pathways in adult physiology and perturbations that lead to disease. Therefore, small molecule modulators of gene networks active in early development can lead to a better understanding of, and design of therapeutics for, adult diseases.</p><p>Large-scale genetic screens in zebrafish have traditionally not focused on a specific biological process but rather have searched broadly for all mutations causing visible phenotypes of any kind. These screens have identified phenotypes ranging from subtle morphological defects of the ear to cardiac arrhythmias. Subsequently, positional cloning has linked many of these phenotypes to specific gene mutations. In a similar way, zebrafish small molecule screens can interrogate a small molecule library broadly for all compounds causing visible phenotypes of any kind, and comparison to known mutant phenotypes can link specific small molecules with genes that cause similar phenotypes. We screened a small molecule library for compounds that affect patterning and organ development in zebrafish embryos. We have identified more than 100 compounds that perturb a number of different aspects of development, including body-axis, brain, heart, and vascular development. In this report, we examine one of these compounds, DTAB, as an illustration of how zebrafish phenotypes can connect small molecules with their molecular targets. DTAB was identified for its ability to cause an anterior-posterior (A&#x02013;P) axis-patterning defect in the embryos. Guided by the known role of retinoic acid (RA) in A&#x02013;P patterning in embryos we were able to show that DTAB exhibits a retinoid-like activity and is able to phenocopy the effects of RA treatment on zebrafish embryos. Using receptor activity assays, we demonstrate that DTAB is also able to activate the retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs) with selectivity for RAR-&#x003b3;.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Developmental screen for small molecule modulators of development</title><p>To identify small molecule modulators of development, 5760 compounds from a diverse synthetic chemical library (Chembridge Corporation, Diverse set E) were screened. Embryos at 1&#x02013;4 hours post fertilization (hpf) were treated with the compounds and scored for obvious developmental defects in the body-axis, brain, heart, blood and vasculature at 24, 48 and 72 hours. 5540 compounds out of the 5760 tested (96&#x00025;) caused no discernible phenotype at 72hpf and 45 compounds (0.8&#x00025;) resulted in toxicity leading to death. 175 (3&#x00025;) compounds affected normal development of the zebrafish embryos. Of these, 61 caused general developmental delay or embryos failed to hatch out of the chorion and 8 compounds caused severe disruption of multiple structures during development. The remaining 106 compounds caused phenotypes that included effects on the brain (21), heart morphology and function (43), blood and vasculature (28), gut (3), trunk and tail (20), pigment formation (3), and touch responsiveness (3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001947-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

The ability of a compound to produce a phenotype in embryos depends on its physico-chemical properties as well as its interaction with developmentally relevant molecules. In terms of their size distribution the active compounds exhibited no bias and included the full size-range of the library, from 200 daltons (Da) to 700 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001947-g001">Fig. 1B&#x02013;C</xref>). The partition coefficient between octanol and water (logP) of the total library screened ranged from &#x02212;10 to &#x0002b;15, thus containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001947-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, the logP of the active compounds clustered between 0 and &#x0002b;15 with a marked absence of hydrophilic compounds. Within the hydrophobic range, there appeared to be no bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001947-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Thus we speculate that hydrophilic compounds, as measured by a negative log P value are rarely active in embryonic zebrafish screens, perhaps because they penetrate zebrafish embryos less effectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>DTAB causes a shortening of anterior-posterior axis</title><p>Treatment of embryos with DTAB (12.5 &#x000b5;M) at 1hpf caused a severe patterning defect resulting in embryos with almost no identifiable morphological features except scattered melanocytes across the skin surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001947-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). At 3 &#x000b5;M the head and tail structures were still reduced but a number of somite boundaries were apparent. At 1.5 &#x000b5;M there was evidence of head structures with brain folds and poorly developed eyes. There was no blood circulation and embryos exhibited pericardial edema. At the lowest concentration tested (0.75 &#x000b5;M) the A&#x02013;P axis was extended to nearly normal lengths and anatomical structures appeared normal. Blood circulation was also normal.</p><p>In order to determine if the molecular target of DTAB was functional early or late in development, the embryos were exposed to 3 &#x000b5;M DTAB at different developmental stages from 1hpf to 24hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001947-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). DTAB appeared to affect development at all stages, but embryos exposed later in development exhibited weaker phenotypes, indicating a cumulative effect over time. Severity of the phenotype was also a function of the length of exposure. Embryos exposed for longer time periods showed more severe phenotypes compared to those incubated in the compound for shorter time intervals followed by removal of the compound from the water (data not shown).</p><p><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization for early developmental markers was performed in order to elucidate the molecular nature of the short-axis phenotype.

DTAB also activated a number of RARs and RXRs, but exhibited strongest activity toward RAR&#x003b3;, with significant activity toward RAR&#x003b2;. DTAB caused a very modest activation of RAR&#x003b1;, RXR&#x003b1;, and RXR&#x003b3;, and no significant activation of RXR&#x003b2; at concentrations tested. Thus, we conclude that DTAB is a retinoid that exhibits differential selectivity for RAR&#x003b3; over all the other receptors tested.</p><fig id="pone-0001947-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001947.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>DTAB selectively activates RAR&#x003b2; and RAR&#x003b3; receptors.</title><p>RA showed high efficiency in activating the RAR and RXR receptors. DTAB was a potent activator of RAR&#x003b2; and RAR&#x003b3;, but showed reduced efficiency towards RAR&#x003b1; and RXRs. Hek293T cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid, a &#x003b2;-gal transfection-control plasmid and an RA receptor plasmid, as indicated. Cells were treated with 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M to 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M concentrations of DTAB or RA at 24 hours after transfection and harvested at 48 hours post transfection for luciferase and &#x003b2;-gal reporter assays. RA treated cells are shown by solid green squares and line and DTAB treated cells by solid blue triangles and line. Control cells transfected with only the luciferase and &#x003b2;-gal reporter plasmids (with no RA receptor plasmid) and treated with various concentrations of RA are shown by dashed gray line and gray circles. All luciferase readings were normalized to &#x003b2;-gal transfection controls. &#x003b2;-gal readings remained approximately equal throughout each experimental set showing equal transfection efficiency and cell viability. X-axis denotes RA or DTAB concentration. Y-axis represents arbitrary luminescence values. All RA and DTAB activities were normalized to the respective no-treatment controls.

It has become increasingly evident that the same pathways that are involved in early development are also employed in controlling adult physiology, and that misregulation of these pathways leads to disease. Thus, small molecule modulators of genetic networks involved in early development can be instrumental in understanding and designing therapeutics for adult diseases. This connection between developmental defects and discovery of novel therapies is well demonstrated by the use of cyclopamine, a hedgehog signaling antagonist, in prostate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Shaw1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, gastric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Katoh1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Katano1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> therapies. Cyclopamine was serendipitously discovered as a plant compound that caused cyclopia in the progeny of sheep that grazed on the plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Keeler1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously employed the same reasoning in identifying dorsomorphin, a novel small molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling, that caused dorsalization in zebrafish embryos and shows promise in developing therapeutics for anemia of chronic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Yu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to uncover the richness of biological activities within existing chemical libraries, we performed a broad, phenotype-based screen on zebrafish embryos and identified numerous small molecules that perturbed a wide variety of different processes during development. We also observed that all the bioactive compounds identified in this screen clustered into a group with higher hydrophobicity when compared to the uniform distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds in the whole library. We speculate that the increased hydrophobicity of compounds increases their permeability in zebrafish and that designing libraries enriched for compounds with log P values &#x0003e;0 could increase the &#x02018;hit-rates&#x02019; of such libraries in zebrafish assays. However, it is worth noting that using zebrafish-based screens exclusively for small molecule discovery would preclude the identification of hydrophilic compounds with potentially interesting biological activities.</p><p>Our broad, high-content screen identified compounds affecting development of heart, blood, vasculature, brain, and body-axis. However, identifying target pathways of small molecules that cause complex phenotypes is often a challenge. To illustrate the strength of zebrafish in target identification, we selected DTAB, which causes anterior-posterior patterning defects in embryos, as a test case. As the retinoic acid pathway is known to be involved in A&#x02013;P patterning, we deduced and were able to confirm that DTAB indeed functions as a retinoid. Thus, we demonstrate that the use of previously characterized mutant phenotypes and known roles of pathways in zebrafish embryogenesis can expedite the identification of molecular targets of small molecules.</p><p>Retinoic acid, a product of Vitamin A (retinol) metabolism, is a very important regulator of development and differentiation. In the vertebrate embryo, RA plays a crucial role in a variety of processes such as patterning of the anterior-posterior axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Schier1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and development of organs including heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Wagner1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Begemann1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and limb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001947-Robert1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.
