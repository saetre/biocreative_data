For example, CNC-bZIP factors can regulate the expression of detoxification proteins through AREs, such as expression of human gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetases (GCS), glutathione S-transferases (GST), UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UDP-GT), NADP (H) quinone oxidoreductase (NQOs), etc. To further explore other factor(s) in cells related to the function of Nrf1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening assay to identify any Nrf1-interacting proteins. In this study, we isolated a cDNA encoding residues 126&#x02013;475 of MCRS2 from the HeLa cell cDNA library. Some functions of MCRS1 and its splice variant-MSP58 and MCRS2 have been previously identified, such as transforming, nucleolar sequestration, ribosomal gene regulation, telomerase inhibition activities, etc. Here, we demonstrated MCRS2 can function as a repressor on the Nrf1-mediated transactivation using both in vitro and in vivo systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To find other proteins interacting with the CNC bZIP domain of Nrf1, the CNC-bZIP region of Nrf1 was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening assay. MCRS2, a splicing variant of p78/MCRS1, was isolated as the Nrf1-interacting partner from the screenings. The interaction between Nrf1 and MCRS2 was confirmed <italic>in vitro </italic>by GST pull-down assays and <italic>in vivo </italic>by co-immunoprecipitation. Further, the Nrf1-MCRS2 interaction domains were mapped to the residues 354&#x02013;447 of Nrf1 as well as the residues 314&#x02013;475 of MCRS2 respectively, by yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. By immunofluorescence, MCRS2-FLAG was shown to colocalize with HA-Nrf1 in the nucleus and didn't result in the redistribution of Nrf1. This suggested the existence of Nrf1-MCRS2 complex in vivo. To further confirm the biological function, a reporter driven by CNC-bZIP protein binding sites was also shown to be repressed by MCRS2 in a transient transfection assay. An artificial reporter gene activated by LexA-Nrf1 was also specifically repressed by MCRS2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>From the results, we showed MCRS2, a new Nrf1-interacting protein, has a repression effect on Nrf1-mediated transcriptional activation. This was the first ever identified repressor protein related to Nrf1 transactivation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Nrf1 (NF-E2 related factor1) belongs to the Cap'n'Collar-basic leucine zipper proteins (CNC-bZIP). The CNC-bZIP family is identified by its homology region, named the CNC domain, immediately N-terminal to the bZIP domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This family contains a basic domain interacting with sequence-specific DNA and a leucine zipper domain (bZIP) involved in protein-protein dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The members of Cap'n'Collar (CNC) family contain Nrf1, Nrf2, Nrf3, p45 NF-E2, <italic>Drosophila </italic>CNC protein, as well as <italic>C. elegans </italic>Skn-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There are two known transcriptional roles of the CNC-bZIP family. First, they are involved in globin gene expression. Transcriptional control of the human beta-globin gene cluster is mediated by four DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS1&#x02013;4) spanning approximately 6&#x02013;22 kb upstream of the epsilon-globin gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A similar gene structure (HS-40) is also present in alpha-globin gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The locus control region (LCR) appears to be necessary for high protein level expression from the entire globin gene clusters. The LCRs contain a direct sequence repeats 5'-(A/G)TGA(C/G)TCAGC(A/G)-3', which is the binding site for CNC-bZIP transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Second, they play a role in the antioxidant response. The consensus antioxidant response element (ARE) core sequence 5'-TGA(C/G)NNNGC-3' shows remarkable similarity to the aforementioned binding sequence for CNC-bZIP proteins. This similarity has led to the proposal CNC-bZIP factors can regulate detoxification proteins expression through AREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], such as expression of human gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetases (GCS), glutathione S-transferases (GST), UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UDP-GT), NADP (H) quinone oxidoreductase (NQOs), etc.</p><p>Like the other members of CNC-bZIP factors, Nrf1 can heterodimerize with small Maf proteins to bind the cis-elements more efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The small Maf proteins, including MafK, MafG and MafF, are identified by their homology to the avian transforming retroviral oncogene, v-maf with lacking of transactivation domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Transcriptional repression by Maf-Maf homodimers, yet activation by Maf-Nrf heterodimers, is shown in LCR-regulated gene regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To further explore other factor(s) in cells related to Nrf1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening assay using the CNC-bZIP region of Nrf1 as a bait to identify any Nrf1-interacting proteins. In this study, cDNAs encoding residues 126&#x02013;475 of MCRS2 (or residues 185&#x02013;534 of p78/MCRS1, or residues 113&#x02013;462 of MSP58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] were isolated from the HeLa cell cDNA library. In this paper, we characterized the physical and functional interactions between Nrf1 and MCRS2.</p><p>Some functions of MCRS1 and its splice variant-MSP58 and MCRS2 have been reported before, such as transforming, nucleolar sequestration, ribosomal gene regulation, and telomerase inhibition activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For example, TOJ3, a protein with high structural similarity to MCRS1, display transformation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In addition, the tumor suppressor gene PTEN suppresses the transformation activity of MCRS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It was reported MSP58 can relieve the repressor activity of Daxx, an adaptor protein that links Fas signaling to the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway by a nucleolar sequestration mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Further, MCRS2 is also shown to be involved in telomere shortening by interacting with telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although these studies illustrates several functions of MCRS1/p78 and its splice variant, the roles of MCRS2 on Nrf1 transactivation activity have not been previously identified. Here we will show MCRS2 can function as a repressor on the Nrf1-mediated transactivation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of MCRS2 as a Nrf1-interacting protein</title><p>In searching for proteins specifically interacting with the important domain of Nrf1, we screened a <italic>HeLa </italic>MATCHMAKER activation domain library (Clontech) using a chimeric protein construct composed of the CNC-bZIP domain (<italic>residues 276&#x02013;447</italic>) of Nrf1 fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain as a bait [GAL4DB-Nrf1(276&#x02013;447)]. Fusion protein GAL4DB-lamin and GAL4DB-Lef1&#x025b2;N105 were also included in assays to remove possible false positive clones. Roughly 10<sup>6 </sup>colonies were screened with this yeast two-hybrid system. Among the clones identified and sequenced, a few clones contained cDNA encoding the C-terminal region of either MSP58 protein (<italic>residues 113&#x02013;462</italic>), p78/MCRS1 (<italic>residues 185&#x02013;534</italic>), or MCRS2 (<italic>residues 126&#x02013;475</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To examine whether Nrf1 interacted with full-length MCRS2, the interaction between Nrf1 and MCRS2 was also confirmed in a yeast two hybrid system. As summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, MCRS2, consistent with the data obtained with truncated versions of MCRS2, interacted quite well with Nrf1 (276&#x02013;447) (<italic>row 6</italic>). Control experiments confirmed the specificity of the Nrf1-MCRS2 interactions: introducing plasmid pGAL4DB-Nrf1 (276&#x02013;447) alone into yeast produced no colony (<italic>row 4</italic>). Similarly, no colony was observed upon co-transformation of pGAL4DB-Nrf1 (276&#x02013;447) with pGAL4AD-TCF4 (<italic>row 5</italic>), which was the negative control. Thus, two conclusions could be drawn from the above experiments. First, there was a specific interaction between Nrf1 and MCRS2. Second, the bZIP to C-terminus domain of Nrf1 was involved in the binding to MCRS2.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction of MCRS2 with Nrf1</bold>. <italic>Left column</italic>, GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;147) hybrids. <italic>Middle column</italic>, GAL4 activation domain (amino acids 768&#x02013;881) hybrids. <italic>Right column</italic>, yeast colony color after transformation.

As summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, the residues 276&#x02013;447 of Nrf1 interact with MCRS2 (<italic>row 1</italic>). The CNC region of Nrf1 (<italic>residues 276&#x02013;330</italic>) failed to interact with MCRS2 (<italic>row 2</italic>). While <italic>residue 331&#x02013;447 </italic>of Nrf1, composed of the basic region, the ZIP region and the most C-terminal region contributed to the binding of MCRS2 (<italic>row 3</italic>). Thus, <italic>residues 354&#x02013;447 </italic>of Nrf1, including the zipper region and the most C-terminal region, constituted the minimal MCRS2-binding domain (compare <italic>row 3 </italic>and <italic>5 </italic>to <italic>row 4</italic>, <italic>6</italic>, <italic>7 </italic>and <italic>8</italic>). These findings suggest the CNC region (compare <italic>row 1 </italic>to <italic>row 2 </italic>and <italic>3</italic>) and basic region (compare <italic>row 3 </italic>to <italic>row 5 </italic>and <italic>6</italic>) of Nrf1 were not required to interact with MCRS2.

The N-terminal region of MCRS2 (<italic>residues 1&#x02013;253</italic>) failed to interact with Nrf1 (<italic>row 2</italic>). Further, the minimal Nrf1-interacting domain of MCRS2 was mapped to the residues 314&#x02013;475 (contain the coiled-coil domain, FHA, and the most C-terminal reagion), and the C-terminus of MCRS2 (<italic>residues 433&#x02013;475</italic>) was required for Nrf1-MCRS2 interaction (<italic>row 5&#x02013;7</italic>).

MCRS2 was also reported to be co-localized with LTPS/PinX1 in the nucleus, especially in nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We used the HA-Nrf1 and MCRS2-FLAG fusion proteins as well as corresponding fluorescent antibodies as the dynamic fluorescent markers to facilitate detection of the two partner's subcellular distribution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Immunofluorescence detection of HA-Nrf1 (green) and MCRS2-FLAG (red) was obtained by rabbit anti-HA and mouse anti-FLAG antibodies and followed by the corresponding species-specific labelled antibody. In our study, Nrf1 was colocalized with MCRS2 in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel h and p).

To address this question, two complementary experiments were performed. First, a reporter activity driven by HS40 element of &#x003b1;-globin Locus Control Region, containing the CNC-bZIP protein binding sites, was measured under the influence of MCRS2. As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, transcription of the reporter, HS40-TK-Luc, was inhibited by MCRS2 but not by another unrelated protein &#x003b2;-catenin (S33Y) (compare <italic>lane 2&#x02013;4, white bar</italic>). Substitution of the Nrf1 binding sites with the minimal TK promoter rendered the resultant reporter, TK-Luc, unresponsive to MCRS2 (compare <italic>lane 3 </italic>and <italic>lane 4</italic>, <italic>black bar</italic>). We concluded the MCRS2-mediated repression depended on the presence of the NF-E2 binding sites (compare <italic>black bar </italic>with <italic>white bar</italic>). Second, because multiple CNC-bZIP factors can interact with the NF-E2 site, the identity of CNC-bZIP factors involved in the repression was determined by measuring the effect of MCS2 on the transcription activities of LexA-CNCbZIP fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, the transcriptional activity of the LexA-Nrf1 was largely reduced in the presence of MCRS2 in 293 T cells (compare <italic>lanes 6</italic>-<italic>7</italic>). The reduction was specific, because MCRS2 had little effect on LexA-VP16 and LexA-NFE2. Based on data obtained from the aforementioned experiments, we believe a direct interaction between Nrf1 and MCRS2 was required for the observed specific repression.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Transcription driven by NF-E2 binding sites is repressed by MCRS2</bold>.

Since Nrf1-mediated transactivation plays an important role in antioxidant response and embryo development, its activities need to be well controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Small Maf protein is a well-known interaction partner of Nrf1. Nrf1/Maf heterodimer recognizes the NF-E2/AP1-like motif and activates downstream gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Other Nrf1-interacting proteins such as AP1 proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) also regulate antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated detoxifying enzymes expression in response to antioxidants and xenobiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Until now there has never been any report of a protein repressing the Nrf1-mediated transactivation. Here, we found MCRS2 has a high tendency to repress Nrf1-mediated transactivation.</p><p>CNC-bZIP factors binding site is also reportedly involved in the transcriptional regulation of many cellular protective and antioxidant genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, by interacting with Nrf1, MCRS2 may shift the balance between activation and repression of these regulatory genes and result in the modulation such as detoxifying mechanisms. In fact, we believe the promoters of NQO1 and other detoxifying enzyme genes are possibly regulated by Nrf1/MafG; and the differential effects of Nrf2 and Nrf1 with small Maf proteins on NQO1 gene activation remain unknown. Therefore, the unpredictable interaction between MCRS2 and Nrf1 may play some role in the upper issue.</p><p>The c-terminus (719&#x02013;772) of the long Nrf1 behind the zipper domain is the Neh3 domain of Nrf1. This domain is required but not sufficient for interaction with MCRS2 (containing coiled-coil domain, FHA domain, and C-terminus) in the yeast two-hybrid system. The specific interaction between MCRS2 and the Neh3 domain appears to be important for the interaction with Nrf1 and suggests Neh3 of Nrf1 may be involved in recruiting accessory proteins or serve to bridge the transcription factor to the active transcription apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The precise mechanism of the interactions between Neh3 of Nrf2 and CHD6 leading to gene transcription has been demonstrated but is not fully understood by a previous study (Nioi et al, 2005). The findings of that paper provide strong evidence suggesting the Neh3 domain may act as a TAD. The activity of the Neh3 domain relies on the VFLVPK motif, which is chiefly hydrophobic in nature and could be a site of interaction with a novel partner molecule. Further, sequences from N terminal to the VFLVPK motif of Neh3 domains are also very highly conserved among the CNC-bZIP family and critical for the interaction of Nrf1 with MCRS2. The interaction of MCRS2 with other members of the CNC-bZIP family needs to be further explored. The critical F591 residue of Nrf2 Neh3 domain is changed to L748 residue on Nrf1. It is worth exploring whether this change influences the interaction between Nrf1 and CHD6 or determines the different interactions of Nrf1 with MCRS2 and CHD6. The Neh3 domain functions as a protein-protein interaction module to facilitate the recruitment of putative coactivator proteins, such as MCRS2, to Nrf1-dependent genes. This phenomenon is similar to the interaction between CHD6 and Nrf2, but MCRS2 negatively regulates Nrf1, while CHD6 positively regulated Nrf2. It is an interesting question of whether Nrf1 could be regulated by both MCRS2 and CHD6 and if the contrast effects of MCRS2 and CHD6 influence Nrf1-mediated ARE-driven gene expression.</p><p>The Nrf1 protein utilized in this study is slightly shorter than TCF11 and contains 447 amino acids without its N-terminal domain. The protein was obtained by alternative splicing of mRNA. In particular, the peptide sequence GLLQFTILLSLIGVRVD termed the NHB1 (N-terminal homology box 1) found between residues 11 and 27 of Nrf1 shares 35% of its identity with the MLLSVPLLLGLLGLAAA leader sequence found between residues 1 and 17 of mouse calreticulin. The latter sequence has been implicated in the translocation of calreticulin into the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The data of Zhang et al (2006) has shown artificial Nrf2 with this N-terminal domain can anchor on endoplasmic reticulum and display less transactivation activity towards the ARE-reporter gene than wild-type Nrf2, suggesting, targeting these bZIP proteins to membranes inhibits their activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. From the data of Zhang et al, we also know Nrf1 can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum and is not regulated by Keap1, whereas Nrf2 does not associate with this organelle and is regulated by Keap1. The two observations suggest these two bZIP factors mediate adaptation to redox stress in different subcellular compartments. We found the interaction between Nrf1 and MCRS2 probably played certain roles in redox stress. Our finding in this paper could explain, at least in part, the distinct regulation phenomona noted in the Nrf1 and Nrf2 KO mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have shown the close interaction between CNC-bZIP transcription factor Nrf1 and MCRS2. From our study, the repression of Nrf1 transactivation by MCRS2 is reported for the first time. The identification of Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) as a repressor of Nrf2 activity defines the current regulatory pathway for Nrf2 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Keap1 acts by directly interacting with Nrf2 and preventing its nuclear accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In this study, we find the new repressor-MCRS2 acts as a regulator on Nrf1 transcriptional activities and the C-terminus of Nrf1 containing ZIP domain interacts with MCRS2. We show MCRS2 and Nrf1 interact through the ZIP domain of Nrf1 and the C-terminal region of MCRS2 containing coiled-coil and FHA domain. Note, the most C-terminus of Nrf1 and MCRS2 do not directly bind to each other (<italic>row 8 </italic>of Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <italic>row 7 </italic>of Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), but it is absolutely required for this interaction. The FHA domain in MCRS2 is well conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and presumably mediates protein-protein interactions in some cellular processes. FHA domains are found almost exclusively in nuclear proteins, which are linked to the control of transcription, DNA repair, or cell-cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. So the interaction between Nrf1 and MCRS2 may play some important roles related to the repression of Nrf1-related transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>For the yeast two-hybrid system, Nrf1 (276&#x02013;447) and its derivatives were cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pAS2-1 (CLONTECH).
