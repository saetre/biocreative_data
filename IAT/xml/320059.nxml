The results suggest that each gene has its own promotor, but that there is coexpression of rpsO and pnp. The nucleotide sequence of rpsO and of the beginning of pnp is presented and includes the presumed regulatory regions of these genes. Several features of the sequence support the mapping experiments and are discussed in relation to the expression of the ribosomal and pnp genes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0147-a" xlink:role="6095"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6091"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6092"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6093"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6094"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6095"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6096"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6097"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6098"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6099"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6100"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6101"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00333-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6102"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
