These changes are also associated with defects in cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, in healthy normal glucose-tolerant relatives of type 2 diabetic patients, impairments in skeletal muscle insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity occur without alterations in the phosphorylation of Akt or its downstream target protein AS160 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In rodents, marked impairments in insulin signaling to glycogen metabolism occur as a consequence of skeletal muscle GLUT4 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), suggesting that defects in GLUT4 traffic have the potential to feed back and inhibit early steps in insulin signaling. Changes in GLUT4 translocation may be one of the earliest molecular defects in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thus, it is important to determine molecular mechanisms that link insulin signaling to GLUT4 translocation.</p><p>Skeletal muscle represents the major site of postprandial glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>); therefore, kinetic studies of GLUT4 trafficking in this tissue are important to determining the major sites of insulin action, particularly because GLUT4-trafficking defects have been observed in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In adipose tissue, GLUT4-trafficking kinetic studies have identified the exocytic limb of the translocation pathway as the major site of insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In contrast to adipocytes, skeletal muscle is a complex tissue, with diverse GLUT4 storage sites, including multiple perinuclear and satellite compartments that are close to the transverse tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Moreover, skeletal muscle GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport are increased in response to a wide range of stimulatory factors including contraction, changes in calcium release, and changes in the cellular energy status and AMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>To determine the extent to which insulin action stimulates the exocytosis limb of the GLUT4 translocation pathway, and thereby account for the net increase in translocation, we have developed new methods for studying GLUT4 translocation in rat epitrochlearis and human vastus lateralis skeletal muscle.

Conversely, in response to AICAR, the maximum level of stimulation is slower in onset and only reaches a level of stimulation &#x0223c;2.5-fold above basal after 60 min. The maximum levels of stimulation by insulin and AICAR are maintained at a steady state for a further 30 min. At the steady state, the stimulation of glucose transport activity by insulin is slightly higher than that induced by AICAR. We assessed whether changes in the kinetics of GLUT4 trafficking induced by these treatments could account for the differences observed in glucose transport activity. We used an impermeable probe (GP15) to tag GLUT4 transporters at the cell surface. GP15 consists of a glucose moiety that is recognized by the GLUT4 binding site and a biotin tag that can interact with avidin or streptavidin. The biotin and glucose moieties are separated by a very long spacer that allows access of avidin to the tagged transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We found that the higher increase in glucose transport activity following insulin stimulation versus AICAR stimulation is matched by a slightly but insignificantly higher level of steady-state GLUT4 labeling by GP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of the stimulation of glucose transport and cell-surface GLUT4 levels by insulin and AICAR in rat epitrochlearis muscle. <italic>A</italic>: Transport rates were determined from measurements of 3-O-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-[<sup>3</sup>H]-glucose uptake into muscle specimens incubated for the indicated times in the presence of 120 nmol/l insulin or 1 mmol/l AICAR.

Insulin, but not AICAR, action leads to a marked stimulation of Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>).

Alternatively, GLUT4 could continue to recycle under steady-state conditions, and the cell-surface GLUT4 level could be maintained by a net balance of a fast exocytosis and a fast endocytosis rate of translocation. In adipocytes, GLUT4 appears to continuously recycle during insulin-stimulated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Therefore, we determined whether GLUT4 continues to recycle in rat skeletal muscle. The rate of net internalization of GP15-tagged GLUT4 under steady-state stimulation by either insulin or AICAR has been measured by separating the GLUT4 that remains at the cell surface from that which has been internalized. To do this, avidin is added to the muscle specimens after labeling. The initial cell-surface labeling (first lane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>) is reduced by the avidin addition at the beginning of the time course (second lane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). At subsequent times of incubation, GLUT4 internalizes and escapes the extracellular avidin. This gives a steady rise in the internal signal from the tagged GLUT4 at 5&#x02013;60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). The steady-state insulin stimulation is associated with rapid internalization that is almost complete within 10 min. The final level of net internalization occurs when approximately half the initial cell-surface GLUT4 is internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). At this point, the exocytosis and endocytosis are balanced to maintain the surface levels of GLUT4. Conversely, the steady-state AICAR stimulation is associated with a slower initial net internalization, particularly over the first 5 min where the fraction of internalization is lower than that occurring in insulin-stimulated muscle. Additionally, the rate of progress to the equilibrium level is not complete until 30&#x02013;60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). This is associated with a slower rate constant for net internalization between AICAR- and insulin-stimulated muscles (0.059 vs. 0.134 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively). Furthermore, the final equilibrium level of internalized GLUT4 is reached at a lower cell-surface fraction (0.29) than that associated with insulin stimulation (0.52) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Further analysis of the steady-state data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>) indicates that AICAR treatment is associated with a slower endocytosis rate constant (0.042 vs. 0.068 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and a much slower exocytosis rate constant (0.017 vs. 0.067 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). These kinetic parameters predict that the levels of glucose transport activity and cell-surface GLUT4 in AICAR-treated muscle will be 55% of those in insulin-treated muscle.

To internalize the GP15-tagged GLUT4, it was necessary to first label insulin-stimulated muscle and then reverse the stimulated state by washing with a low pH buffer that disassociates insulin from its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). To check that this procedure is adequately effective, we monitored the reversal of Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Akt phosphorylation is reduced toward basal levels within 100 min. The return to basal levels of phosphorylation is incomplete; however, it is only necessary that the reversal process is sufficient to allow a detectable portion of GP15-GLUT4 to be internalized, and this was found to be adequate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIG. 4.</label><caption><p>Exocytosis of GP15-tagged GLUT4 in rat epitrochlearis muscle.

Muscle specimens were maintained in the basal state or stimulated with either 120 nmol/l insulin or 1 mmol/l AICAR for the indicated times. Avidin was added at the cell surface throughout the restimulation time courses; this reduced the signal for GLUT4 that exocytosed to the cell surface, thereby reducing the signal from internal GLUT4.

As the GLUT4 reaches the cell surface, its signal is quenched by avidin binding. The GLUT4 signal that remains in the cell, therefore, represents the fraction of GLUT4 remaining internally, and this decreases with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). This allows curve fitting to a single exponential function even when the scatter in the data points is quite large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). The scatter is an unavoidable consequence of working with single muscle samples for each time course data point. Insulin treatment increases the rate constant for exocytosis sixfold (0.010 in the basal state to 0.067 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the insulin-stimulated state; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, AICAR treatment does not significantly increase the apparent exocytosis rate constant. The rate constant is 0.012 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is close to the basal value. This exocytosis rate constant is in reasonable agreement with the steady-state exocytosis rate constant in AICAR-treated cells (0.017 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p><p>A limitation of the fitting of a single exponential function is that it assumes that the internal GLUT4 signal decreases continuously to zero. However, it may not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the basal and AICAR-treated cells, the release of GLUT4 may occur in a pulse and the internal GLUT4 signal may reach a plateau point at which no further release occurs. Thus, AICAR may stimulate a portion of the internal GLUT4 to be released. The fitting method we have employed may lead to an underestimate of the rate constant for this partial release. Unfortunately, the data are insufficiently precise for further analysis of this possibility. The more limited exocytosis response to AICAR cannot be due to a slow onset in AMPK activation, as we have compared basal and AICAR at times of exocytosis up to 120 min. Furthermore, the steady-state parameters were obtained following an extensive treatment with AICAR. Taking into consideration both the steady-state and the direct exocytosis measurements, we cannot exclude the possibility of an AICAR-mediated increase in exocytosis; however, this effect is clearly smaller, or more limited as a pulse of release of GLUT4, than that occurring in insulin-treated muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Exocytosis of GLUT4 in insulin- and AICAR-stimulated human vastus lateralis muscle.</title><p>The exocytosis approach characterized in the isolated rat epitrochlearis muscle system was applied to human muscle strips. We confirmed that the reversal procedure adopted for the rat epitrochlearis was also applicable to human muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). A comparison of basal and insulin-treated muscle revealed clear insulin stimulation in the GP15-tagged GLUT4 movement out of the internal compartment and toward the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). Curve-fitting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>) and analysis of separate experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>) revealed that the exocytosis rate constant was increased six- to sevenfold (from 0.011 to 0.075 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). These rate-constant values and the six- to sevenfold stimulation are very similar to the changes occurring in rat epitrochlearis muscle. This suggests that the same kinetic process is present, even under conditions in which the levels of glucose transport are quite different. The six- to sevenfold increase in glucose transport activity does not occur in human muscle, but this is not necessarily inconsistent with a large change in GLUT4 translocation, as additional factors may influence the glucose transport activity. The effect of AICAR on GLUT4 exocytosis in human muscle is less clear, partly because of the large scatter in data points derived from the samples available in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). Calculation of the exocytosis rate constants (0.017 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>) indicated that there may be some slight, but statistically insignificant, stimulation of exocytosis above basal levels following AICAR treatment of the muscle strips.

If the site of insulin action is more fully resolved, this would help define where defects in GLUT4 traffic occur in insulin-resistant states and type 2 diabetes. By applying and extending use of our GLUT4-labeling technique, we have provided some of the first evidence that GLUT4 exocytosis in rat and human skeletal muscle is the major site of insulin action and that the magnitude of the stimulation of the exocytosis rate constant is sufficient to account for the observed insulin stimulation of glucose transport.</p><p>Studies on relatively simpler cell-culture systems have revealed that GLUT4 traffics through multiple compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In skeletal muscle, additional complexities in the trafficking route occur because of the large fibrous cell structures and the presence of a more complex transverse-tubule network of membranes. Recent studies on green fluorescent protein&#x02013;tagged GLUT4 in skeletal muscle have highlighted the importance of the transverse-tubule system and have led to the hypothesis that GLUT4 is not translocated over long distances in skeletal muscle but is recruited from GLUT4 satellite compartments localized close to the transverse tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Our photolabeling approach is complementary to studies on GFP-GLUT4, because we tag endogenous GLUT4, rather than expressed recombinant protein. However, the approach does not provide information on any potential differences in trafficking at the sarcolemma or the transverse tubules. Previous autoradiography studies using a tritiated version of a GLUT4 photolabel have provided evidence that the label does penetrate and label GLUT4 in the transverse-tubule locations in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Additionally, molecules as large as a fragment antigen binding of an antibody can permeate into transverse-tubule spaces in heart muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>The six- to sevenfold stimulation of the GLUT4 exocytosis rate in the present study is greater than the fold stimulation of glucose transport. This effect is consistent with data on cell-surface GLUT4 labeling in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) skeletal muscle. This may occur because glucose transport is dependent on additional transporters such as GLUT1 that respond less effectively to insulin. Changes in GLUT4 endocytosis and storage will also influence the level of stimulation of transport activity. The absolute values of the rate constants obtained from rat (0.01 for basal and 0.067 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for insulin at 30&#x000b0;C) and human (0.011 and 0.075 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 37&#x000b0;C) skeletal muscle studies are remarkably close to adipose cell studies. For example, basal and insulin-stimulated rate constants for GLUT4 exocytosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes are 0.01 and 0.09 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). When the GP15 photolabel in rat adipocytes was used, slightly higher values were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The similarity of these rate constants suggests that the same fundamental process rate limits GLUT4 movement in these diverse systems and that this process is relatively unaltered by divergent cell architecture and membrane tubule complexities in these differing cell types.</p><p>Our studies on the AICAR compound are less clear. There are several technical problems associated with its use, including its slow onset of action. Even when GLUT4 exocytosis is studied over 120 min, there is no clear evidence that this process is stimulated. In cardiac myocytes, AMPK activation following hypoxia, mitochondrial inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), or metformin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) is associated with a reduction in GLUT4 endocytosis. Mitochondrial inhibition and a combination of AICAR treatment and PKC stimulation also lead to inhibition of GLUT4 internalization in L6 muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). We find that the initial rate of net internalization and endocytosis of GLUT4 in rat skeletal muscle is also reduced, but these changes do not reach statistical significance. The reduction in net internalization that is evident at early time points is masked in the steady-state experiments by the progress to a lower equilibrium level for the equilibration of the GP15-tagged GLUT4 during AICAR treatment. The endocytosis of GLUT4 is always a more difficult kinetic parameter to obtain and interpret than the unidirectional exocytosis parameter. This is because internalization is a net process, involving both endocytosis and re-exocytosis, and some recycling of GLUT4 will inevitably occur. These limitations may account for some of the controversies that surround the issue of whether insulin markedly reduces GLUT4 endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>Whether the observed 50% reduction in GLUT4 net internalization is sufficient to account for the full magnitude of the AICAR stimulation of glucose transport (a two- to threefold stimulation) is incompletely resolved in this study. The slow onset of the increase in glucose transport is also consistent with a slowing of GLUT4 endocytosis. Our data suggest that a single site of convergence of AMPK- and Akt-signaling pathways on a single intermediate such as AS160 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) cannot fully and simultaneously account for regulation of GLUT4 traffic at the level of both exocytosis and endocytosis. Indeed, AS160 action is reported to be localized to the exocytosis rather than the endocytosis arm of GLUT4 traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>The steady-state recycling experiments are of interest and mechanistic importance because they show that in muscle, GLUT4 continues to recycle in both the insulin- and AICAR-stimulated states. In contrast to earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), but not later, versions of the translocation hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), GLUT4 is not released as a transitory pulse to the cell surface where it would then be resident while the stimulus remains. Instead, GLUT4 continues to recycle even when the stimulus is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, the observed recycling could be consistent with a variant of the pulse model in which GLUT4 is released in a pulse from a reservoir compartment to the cell surface and then on to the endosome system, within which it continues to recycle while the stimulus remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our demonstration that exocytosis is the major site of insulin action on GLUT4 traffic in rat and human skeletal muscle suggests that a focus on this limb of the GLUT4 traffic pathway in insulin-resistant conditions such as type 2 diabetes will be necessary and appropriate to resolve defects in glucose metabolism in future studies. Because of the technical challenges and limitations described above, the photolabeling approach will only give a partial and incomplete analysis in future studies. Nevertheless, the approach described is complementary to more dynamic studies in which GLUT4 is analyzed at a detailed subcellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
