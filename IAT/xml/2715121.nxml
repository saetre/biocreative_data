We have recently shown that recruitment of the interferon-&#x003b3; receptor (IFNGR) into the IS correlates with the capacity of Thps to differentiate into Th1 effector cells, an event regulated by signaling through the functionally opposing receptor to interleukin-4 (IL4R). Here, we show that, similar to IFN-&#x003b3; ligation, TCR stimuli induce the translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to IFNGR1-rich regions of the membrane. Unexpectedly, STAT1 is preferentially expressed, is constitutively serine (727) phosphorylated in Thp, and is recruited to the IS and the nucleus upon TCR signaling. IL4R engagement controls this process by interfering with both STAT1 recruitment and nuclear translocation. We also show that in cells with deficient Th1 or constitutive Th2 differentiation, the IL4R is recruited to the IS. This observation suggest that the IL4R is retained outside the IS, similar to the exclusion of IFNGR from the IS during IL4R signaling. This study provides new mechanistic cues for the regulation of lineage commitment by mutual immobilization of functionally antagonistic membrane receptors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Understanding how undifferentiated cells perceive and integrate signals that affect their developmental program is an important task. Specifically, T helper responses are orchestrated by differentiated cells originating from precursors that acquire their final phenotype under the instruction of professional APCs. Our efforts have focused on observing the synapses formed by T helper precursors (Thps), as opposed to differentiated Th cells, in an attempt to reproduce the molecular events at the initiation of adaptive immune responses rather than their reactivation. As extensively demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), only Thps have the potential to translate early signaling events in the adaptive immune responses into permanent epigenetic changes that define their cytokine secretion pattern, and therefore their function. Activation and differentiation of Thps require signaling through three major sets of receptors: the antigen recognition receptor (TCR), accessory or costimulatory receptors (e.g., CD28), and certain key cytokine (and perhaps chemokine) receptors. TCR and costimulatory receptors are necessary for activation, but not sufficient for full Th cell differentiation, whereas cytokine instruction is essential to achieve full in vivo Th skewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). TCR and CD28 coreceptors are redistributed during activation and organized in a molecular complex at the interface between the T cell and APC, which is designated the immunological synapse (IS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>Mature Th1 and Th2 subsets display differences in IS morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Although assembly of membrane clusters and the IS clearly optimizes signal transduction downstream of the TCR, leading to mature Th cell activation, the mechanisms by which such assembly contributes to the acquisition of helper function (the secretion of cytokines) remain poorly understood. However, recent studies by our group and others have highlighted the importance of receptor clustering and establishment of membrane asymmetry in the acquisition of specific effector (Th1, Th2, and Th17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) or memory phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Importantly, Chang et al. have shown that in addition to signaling optimization, synapse formation dictates the segregation of receptors by asymmetrical cell division of precursor cells, and therefore the function of the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Further, Yeh et al. have shown that this functional segregation may be perpetuated by the class I MHC&#x02013;restricted T cell&#x02013;associated molecule, an immunoglobulin superfamily transmembrane protein that coordinates Scrib-initiated polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>In vivo Th1 differentiation depends on signaling through the IFN-&#x003b3; receptor (IFNGR), the IL-12 receptor (IL12R), and their downstream transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT4, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Mice lacking any of these factors fail to generate type 1 immune responses. IL12R is not expressed by Thps, but is crucial for Th1 maintenance and survival, whereas IFNGR is expressed by these cells and initiates a positive feedback loop of Th1 differentiation. Thus, IFN-&#x003b3; signaling initiates the Th1 differentiation program and IL-12 perpetuates it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Similarly, mature Th2 cells arise after occupancy of the IL4R by its ligand and subsequent activation of STAT6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Both the IFN-&#x003b3; and IL4Rs undergo trans- and cis-tyrosine phosphorylation of their cytosolic domains by receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs). These activated JAK molecules phosphorylate STAT1 (on tyrosine 701 and serine 727) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) or STAT6, inducing their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus to initiate transcriptional regulation of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>Among these target genes are the key transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 required for the execution of the Th1 and Th2 differentiation programs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). However, these transcription factors and the cytokines that induce them are nearly absent during the activation of Thps. The other cellular component of the IS, the DC, does not secrete detectable levels of IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Hence, neither the source of early cytokine signaling nor how the Thp perceives the initial stimuli that initiate lineage commitment are well understood.</p><p>We addressed this issue by showing that only the pro-Th1 cytokine receptor IFNGR and not the pro-Th2 IL4R is recruited to the IS upon TCR activation. This corecruitment correlates with Th1 maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Further, we demonstrated that IL4R signaling leads to the blockade of IFNGR1 recruitment to the IS (and Th2 differentiation). This exclusion of IFNGR1 from the IS also provides a biophysical explanation for the well accepted dominance of Th2 over Th1 differentiation in a cytokine milieu where both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). These observations indicate that localization of receptors influences how T cells acquire effector functions during antigen recognition.</p><p>In this study, we have identified STAT1 as one of the molecular components of the IS. We show that STAT1 is recruited to the IS upon TCR signaling, similar to its recruitment to the IFNGR upon ligand occupancy. Unexpectedly, we observed that STAT1 is preferentially expressed and serine (727) phosphorylated (pS727-STAT1) in resting Thps, a posttranslational modification known to be required for successful IFNGR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) and STAT1 transcription. The constitutive phosphorylation of STAT1 in the Thp may explain the preferential mobilization of Th1-like signaling components during T cell activation. Remarkably, pS727-STAT1 molecules are required for optimal Th1 differentiation and recruited to the IS, and they translocate to the nucleus upon TCR signaling. Concomitant with IFNGR dynamics, STAT1 and pS727-STAT1 are blocked in the presence of IL-4. Finally, we demonstrate that in mirroring IFNGR exclusion from the IS by IL-4 signaling and Th2 differentiation, the IL4R is excluded from the IS and polarizes with the TCR only in cells with constitutive Th2 differentiation.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>STAT1 and IFNGR1 are corecruited to the IS</title><p>We have suggested that an alternative pro-Th1 pathway in which the corecruitment of IFNGR1 and TCR to the IS could elicit IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;like signaling and tip the T helper balance toward Th1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Although corecruitment does not require IFN-&#x003b3; or STAT1, mice deficient for STAT1 (<italic>stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) are severely impaired in their ability to mount Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). These observations led us to question whether STAT1 might be mobilized and activated as a functional consequence of the cross talk between IFNGR and TCR signaling pathways.</p><p>Thps isolated from 4&#x02013;6-wk-old OTII transgenic mice were sorted using magnetic bead negative separation, followed by FACS sorting of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>high</sup>CD44<sup>low</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells from LNs and spleen. DCs were purified using a CD11c magnetic bead positive selection and loaded or not with 1 &#x000b5;M of OVA peptide (323&#x02013;339 ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR). After eliminating debris by a density gradient and several washes, both cell populations were mixed, spun down to increase their interaction, fixed, and stained for the markers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>. For all the molecules analyzed in this study, negative control stainings were prepared using genetically deficient Thps (from <italic>ifngr1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and <italic>il4ra<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice; unpublished data). Imaging of these cells using confocal microscopy revealed that 100 of the 113 Thp-DC clusters (89%) in 2 independent experiments displayed accumulations of TCR toward the interface in the presence of OVA-loaded DCs, but not unpulsed, DCs (unpublished data). Strikingly, STAT1 was recruited to the T cell&#x02013;DC interface and colocalized with the TCR similar to the IFNGR, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Corecruitment of TCR, IFNGR1, and STAT1 to the IS.</bold> (a) Thps were purified from the LNs of young animals by magnetic negative separation using antibody-coupled microbeads and the MACS system, followed by FACS sorting of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62<sup>high</sup>CD25-CD44<sup>low</sup> cells.

In our hands, the cross-linking of TCR molecules on Thps recapitulates with high fidelity the multifocal aggregation of receptors observed in DC-Thp synapses observed in our experiments, while offering a clean system for quantification purposes. The prototypical concentric organization in supramolecular activation complexes is rarely observed in our Thp-DC co-cultures. Accordingly, Brossard et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) have also described that the synapses formed by naive T cells and DCs are different from those formed by mature Th cells and B cells. These and other studies suggest that when antigen presentation is abundant (like in our cultures), synapses formed by Thps are multifocal and very dynamic, with both cellular components being highly motile in complete media, collagen matrixes (unpublished data), and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref> shows a typical example of Thp activation by cross-linking, where the TCR and IFNGR1 are uniformly distributed at 0 min and rearranged in discrete regions of the surface 30 min after activation. Here again, STAT1 was recruited to TCR- and IFNGR1-rich regions of the membrane.</p><p>We quantified these images with an improved version of the &#x0201c;linearization&#x0201d; of the cell surface method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In our previous study, linearization of the cell surface was achieved by drawing regions around the single middle z axis optical section (z section) to include the plasma membrane and the adjacent cytoplasm of every cell to (line)scan their content within fluorescent markers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082900/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). An example of this traditional method is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref> (bottom), where the pixel intensities of the given markers (y axis) were plotted according to their position in the region (105 positions at the middle plane; x axis). Before activation (0 min), the distribution of the markers was uniform and the majority of positions scored low pixel intensities. After activation (30 min), the corecruitment of these molecules is translated by the single-peak appearance of the slopes and the condensation of the fluorescence in discrete areas of the histogram. To obtain a quantitative measure of the relationship between the distributions of the different molecules, their correlation coefficient was calculated (&#x003c1;; see Materials and methods for a detailed description). The usage of &#x003c1; normalizes the variability in expression (or pixel counts) of the different molecules by yielding values independent from scale and origin ranging from &#x02212;1 to 1 (&#x02212;1 &#x02264; &#x003c1; &#x02264; 1). Thereby all z sections, cells, and experiments can be cross-compared. A value of &#x003c1; = &#x02212;1 reflects inverse correlation; &#x003c1; = 0 reflects no correlation; and &#x003c1; = 1 reflects complete correlation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>, &#x003c1; was calculated for the distributions of STAT1/IFNGR1, IFNGR1/TCR, and STAT1/TCR before and after activation (0.33, 0.37, 0.32&#x02013;0.78, 0.80, and 0.89). This traditional linearization analysis corresponded only to the middle z section of the cell (plane z = 20 of 40), thereby excluding large portions of the membrane. Hence, we improved the quantification method to analyze the totality of the cell surface, &#x0223c;40 optical z sections (0.5 &#x000b5;m). 41&#x02013;105 positions were scanned per z section. The bottom and top z sections are smaller and contain fewer scanned positions, whereas the middle z sections are larger. The graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref> (top) represent surface scanning of the entire cell in a concatenated view where every 41&#x02013;105 positions in the x axis represents one z section. Every z section displays a very similar pattern to the z = 20 plane, with uniform low pixel counts for TCR, IFNGR1, and STAT1 before activation and binary distributions after activation, where most positions scored either high or null values of pixel intensities, thus reflecting the polarized nature of the surface of these cells. Notably, the cytoplasm of Thps is extremely small and our analysis most likely includes the majority of it.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Quantification of TCR, IFNGR1, and STAT1 corecruitment.</bold> (a) Linearization of the cell membrane.

This analysis results from combination of four independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20082900_RGB_Fig2"/></fig><p>This improved linearization analysis multiplied the amount of information available from a single cell by &#x0223c;200-fold and allowed us to measure &#x003c1; for all cell planes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082900/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref> shows the correlation values based on &#x0201c;whole-cell linearization&#x0201d; analysis from four individual experiments accumulating 89&#x02013;92 cells and 10&#x02013;40 z sections per cell. Values of &#x003c1; are shown as correlation plots, where every point represents one z section (<italic>n</italic> = 1,840&#x02013;2,670). In this familiar dot plot&#x02013;like representation, it is clear that before activation all molecules are independently dispersed as indicated by low correlations in the STAT1/IFNGR1 (y axis) and TCR/IFNGR1 (x axis) distributions. Only 11 and 6% of cell z sections scored &#x003c1; &#x02265; 0.8, respectively. A score of the correlation coefficient &#x0003e;0.8 is generally considered strong, whereas a correlation &#x0003c;0.5 is generally described as weak. For &#x003c1; &#x02265; 0.8, &#x003c1;<sup>2</sup> = 0.64 (square of the coefficient), which means that 64% of the total variation in the y axis can be explained by the linear relationship between x and y. The association between STAT1 and the TCR before activation is minimal, with only 9% of cell sections with &#x003c1; &#x02265; 0.8 (bottom left). After 30 min, Thps have capped their TCR, IFNGR1, and STAT1 molecules, as reflected by the &#x0201c;double-positive&#x0201d; aspect of the correlation plots where 40, 42, and 46% of z sections scored &#x003c1; &#x02265; 0.8 for STAT1/IFNGR1, STAT1/TCR, and TCR/IFNGR1 distributions, respectively. In the presence of IL-4, this corecruitment is inhibited, and &#x003c1; values resemble those obtained before activation (3&#x02013;9% of cell sections have &#x003c1; &#x02265; 0.8). When averaged on a per cell basis, these correlation plots retain the previously described properties (Fig. S2). This new type of analysis and representation provides a quantitative and statistically rigorous examination of the distribution of receptors in the whole surface of a cell both on an individual and population scale. These results confirm with high confidence the recruitment of IFNGR to the IS and reveal STAT1 as a new member of this macromolecular complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation status of STAT1 during T cell development, activation, and differentiation</title><p>We showed in a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), as well as in this study, that IFNGR and STAT1 can be mobilized during T cell activation in the absence of IFN signaling, suggesting that this pro-Th1 stimulus can be triggered by TCR engagement alone. To test whether STAT1 expression and phosphorylation at the two known major sites, tyrosine 701 (pY701-STAT1) and serine 727 (pS727-STAT1), varied during T cell development and differentiation, we compared double-positive thymocytes (DPs), Thps, Th0, Th1, and Th2 cells for the expression of these molecules. DPs were purified by FACS sorting of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DX5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b3;&#x00394;TCR<sup>&#x02212;</sup>B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD19<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymic cells. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>high</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Thps were purified using magnetic negative separation complemented by cytofluorometric sorting (&#x0003e;99% pure). Thps were differentiated in vitro using standard protocols to induce Th0, Th1, and Th2 differentiation (see Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref> shows a representative experiment where the levels of expression of STAT1 vary significantly at different stages of T cell development and differentiation (see quantification in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082900/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Thps express markedly higher levels of STAT1 than thymic DP precursors or Th subsets (between 1.2- and 170-fold higher). Interestingly, DPs and Th2 cells expressed very low levels of STAT1 (174- and 67-fold less than Thps, respectively) and only prolonged exposures of the blots allowed their visualization (bottom), whereas Th0 and Th1 cells display 30&#x02013;50% reductions. To our surprise, pS727-STAT1 expression in Thps was detectable and preceded any activation, whereas its presence was barely detectable in DP and Th cells. As negative and positive controls, we used extracts from <italic>stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> or <italic>wt</italic> Thps incubated in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3; or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref> and Fig. S4). Although IFN-&#x003b3; only variably increased pS727-STAT1 levels, it was however, required for STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, as expected. The disparity in the capacity of IFN-&#x003b3; to induce pY701-STAT1 at different T cell activation stages has been observed before and can be explained by the down-regulation of IFNGR expression after T helper differentiation or the increased expression of SOCS inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Our sorting strategies for the aforementioned experiments cannot exclude the presence of small numbers of central memory T cells (T<sub>CM</sub>) among the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>high</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells. Further, serine phosphorylation has been demonstrated to be very sensitive to cell stress and manipulation. These considerations raised the possibility that the increased levels of pS727-STAT1 observed in Thps may correspond to contaminating T<sub>CM</sub> or an artifact resulting from extensive manipulation caused by magnetic and FACS sorting. To circumvent these problems and confirm preferential STAT1 and pS727-STAT1 expression by Thps, we performed intracellular stainings of STAT1 (unpublished data) and pS727-STAT1 on freshly isolated LN cells.

However, it has been suggested that Th1 differentiation can occur in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Isolating the contribution of IFNGR signaling in Th differentiation during in vivo responses can be challenging, as antigen clearance requires activation of multiple components of both adaptive and innate immune responses that are also dependent on IFNGR signaling (B cells, CD8 T cells, macrophages, etc). In vitro studies using purified naive T cells have clearly established that IFN-&#x003b3; alone, independent of IL-12 or IL-18, can induce full Th1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). To evaluate the contribution of the IFNGR1, STAT1, and pS727-STAT1 to Thp differentiation in the absence of exogenous cytokines, we isolated Thps from IFNGR1- or STAT1-deficient animals and mice bearing a serine 727 to alanine point mutation of STAT1 (STAT1-S727A) that abolishes STAT1 serine phosphorylation at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).

Our studies show that in the absence of supplementary cytokines in vitro, Thps display a natural tendency to differentiate along the Th1 pathway in an IFNGR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). The Th1-ness of naive T cells might be explained by their remarkably high expression of STAT1 and pS727-STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) when compared with DP thymocytes or mature Th cells. S727-phosphorylated STAT1 has been described as a primed monomeric form of STAT1 that may precede Y701-phosphorylation and is required for IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; biological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). More recent studies have shown that STAT1 requires preassembly into chromatin-associated transcriptional complexes to become S727-phosphorylated and fully biologically active in response to IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). However, these studies did not assess the phosphorylation status of STAT1 in different tissues, and especially Thps. Further, other reports have shown that STAT1 can shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus independently of IFN stimulation and Y701 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Our observations are consistent with a model in which STAT1 is &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; in Thps and shuttles in and out of the nucleus and is retained during IFN or TCR signaling. Additional experiments are required to investigate the expression of STAT1 at other stages of the differentiation process (after activation and thymic maturation).</p></sec><sec><title>Cross talk between the TCR and IFNGR pathways</title><p>We have shown TCR, IFNGR, STAT1, and pS727-STAT1 inclusion into the IS on naive Th cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).

Blockade of IFNGR or TCR signaling with PKC/PI3K or p38 MAPK inhibitors reduces STAT1-mediated gene transcription via the inhibition of this phosphoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, our data indicate that naive circulating Th cells express pS727-STAT1 and that only IFNGR, but not TCR, signaling elicits a modest increase of this phosphoform. These differences may be explained by the choice of cell model used in our experiments; all cells were purified, freshly isolated T cells and not transformed cell lines. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that TCR signaling regulates pS727-STAT1 in vivo, resulting in saturating levels of pS727-STAT1 in Thp ex vivo that cannot be further increased. TCR &#x0201c;tickling&#x0201d; or in vivo nonproductive continuous TCR self-recognition by Thps is required for their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>).

Similarly, asthmatic patients have elevated expression of SOCS-3 in their peripheral CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, correlating with the severity of the disease.

Further, despite the large body of research on vertebrate JAK&#x02013;STAT pathways, there is little precedent pointing toward polarized signaling. In a recent study, Sabatos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>) identified polarization of phospho-STAT5 upon IL-2 paracrine secretion among T cells. Along with our results, these data suggest that STAT signaling may generically operate in a polarizing fashion in T cells. In invertebrates, Sotillos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>) recently found that preassembly of this complex to discrete membrane domains primarily benefits signaling efficiency in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cells. In this same model, establishment of membrane asymmetry dictates unequal distribution of fate determinants like Numb, Pon, and Neuralized, which are a fundamental mechanism underlying cell specification after asymmetrical cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref>). T cells express the mammalian homologues of the proteins involved in asymmetrical cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>) and have been shown to divide asymmetrically, a process that determines their fate as effector or memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Importantly, confirmation of IFNGR capping in the IS has been provided from these studies and suggests that daughter cells that are proximal to the IS retain IFNGR molecules. Therefore, these cells also retain IFN-&#x003b3; sensitivity and function as effectors by limiting bacterial burden in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Further studies are required to evaluate whether this same principle can be applied to Th2 cells that fail to polarize their IFNGR during activation and to determine whether both effector versus memory and Th cell differentiation are determined during synapse formation.</p><p>Huang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>) found that <italic>ifngr1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> T cells have increased levels of STAT6 phosphorylation and association with the IL4R, providing evidence for the constitutive inhibition of IL4R&#x02013;STAT6 signaling by IFNGR. Zhu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>) have also reported that constitutive STAT6 inhibition early during T cell activation and signaling through the IL2R, IL6R, and IFNAR was inhibited by TCR engagement. These authors further demonstrated that calcineurin and PCK inhibitors known to decrease TCR-driven IFN-&#x003b3; production increase STAT6 phosphorylation during TCR and IL4R signaling. However, the mechanisms underlying these intriguing phenomena have remained uncertain. We hypothesize that receptor exclusion from the IS is mediated by sequestration of activating or inhibiting cofactors between IL-4 and IFNGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of receptor exclusion from the IS.</bold> (top) IFNGR, TCR, Stat, phospho-STAT1, JAK3, and eventually the common &#x003b3; chain (&#x003b3;c) colocalize after TCR signaling. Under these conditions, inhibitors could mediate the exclusion of IL4R from the IS. (middle) IL-4 signaling blocks the recruitment of IFNGR, STAT1, and phospho-STAT1 to the TCR-rich regions of the membrane. This phenomenon could be mediated by association of inhibitors to the IFNGR and/or recruitment of &#x003b3;c-JAK3 to the IL4R complex. Bottom panel. In the absence of pro-Th1 molecules, IFNGR, or STAT1, the IL4R is licensed to enter the IS to induce Th2 differentiation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20082900_RGB_Fig8"/></fig><p>TCR signaling also intersects with IL4R signaling. TCR stimulation has been reported to activate the common &#x003b3; chain (&#x003b3;c)&#x02013;associated JAK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref>). Our preliminary data show the presence of this important component for IL-2 and IL-4 signaling in the IS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082900/DC1">Fig. S6</ext-link>). Additionally, cross talk between the JAK&#x02013;STAT pathway, Erk, and PI3K has been demonstrated in Jurkat cells during IL-4 signaling. In this system, inhibition of Erk, PI3K, and Ras leads to inhibition of STAT6 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref>). These observations suggest that IL4R and TCR signaling pathways compete for multiple components. These complexes often operate as multitasking platforms that result from the association of several molecules. Mobilization and sequestration of &#x003b3;c&#x02013;JAK3&#x02013;STAT&#x02013;PI3K complexes could explain the inability of IL4R to enter the synapse and the transient inhibition of IL-4 signaling observed in Thp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>). Notably, we have shown partial IL2RA/TCR cocapping during T cell activation, suggesting another level of competition for &#x003b3;c-JAK3 between the IL2R in the IS and the IL4R. A reciprocal mechanism of inhibitor exchange could be accomplished by a swap of SOCS proteins. <italic>socs1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice succumb to severe lymphopenia and multiorgan degenerative macrophage infiltration. Strikingly, double-deficient <italic>ifng/socs1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice survive up to a year, and <italic>socs1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells display sustained IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;IL-4 signaling with impaired IFN-&#x003b3; inhibition of IL-4 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref>). In addition, TCR signaling controls SOCS1-mediated cytokine signaling inhibition during positive selection of thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref>). Both IFNGR and IL4R can bind SOCS proteins, thereby outcompeting JAK kinases. Exchanging adaptor molecules between receptors would allow mutual inhibition and restrict signaling to a single pro-Th cascade.</p><p>The observation that in <italic>nfatc2/c3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Thp the IL4R enters the IS after TCR triggering is intriguing. NFATs are expressed early in T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>) and regulate TCR-mediated IL-4 gene transcription, and the absence of NFATc2 and NFATc3 leads to constitutive nuclear localization of NFATc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">80</xref>). However, how these molecules modulate the arrangement of membrane receptors is unclear. NFATc2 or NFATc3 regulate the expression of JAK2 that phosphorylate STAT1, and thus affect its transactivation during IFNGR signaling (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Establishment of membrane asymmetry plays an essential role the in acquisition of effector versus memory capacities of T cells by unequal segregation of signaling molecules into daughter cells after cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Remarkably, this process is dependent on and subsequent to antigen presentation and IS formation, suggesting that in addition to controlling cell differentiation into major Th subsets, the IS directs the establishment of immunological memory. Exclusion of cytokine receptors from the IS may represent a general mechanism of specific inhibition by functionally opposing or competing signaling cascades similar to the mechanisms of cell polarity establishment mentioned above. We propose that the widely known inhibitory effect of IL-4 over pro-Th1 stimuli can be explained by the blockade of IFNGR and STAT1 mobilization. Reciprocally, the sole presence of IFNGR or STAT1 suffices to impede IL4R inclusion into the IS, and presumably its participation in the Th2 differentiation program. This latter result is particularly relevant in physiological situations where levels of IFNGR or STAT1 are naturally low, such as in activated Th1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) and Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), respectively.</p><p>These observations suggest that similar to invertebrate cells, the fate and differentiation program of mammalian T cells is regulated through the organization of membrane topography and receptor mobilization, wherein inclusion or exclusion from compartmentalized supramolecular structures affects the integrity of signaling cascades.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and cells.</title><p>Mice of the following backgrounds were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory or Taconic Farms: C57/B6, 129s6/SvEv, BALB/c, <italic>ifngr1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and <italic>il4ra<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>.

Typically, for one cell, 100 pixels were scanned per single z section. Between 10 and 40 z sections were analyzed per cell on a total of &#x0223c;100 cells in different experiments. This method allows us to assess the degree of capping of different molecules as opposed to the simple colocalization method that does not account for their spatial distribution in the cell membrane.

This representation allows simultaneous visualization of the correlation for three different molecules for every focal z plane. Calculating the average of the correlations for every cell allowed us to obtain the correlation on a per cell basis.
