We have previously shown that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the leukocyte integrin CD18 are required for these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. We also demonstrated that leukocyte-mediated retinal cell apoptosis is among the earliest pathological manifestations of diabetic retinopathy and results in the formation of acellular-occluded capillaries, microaneurysms, and vascular basement membrane thickening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The diabetic eye responds to the progressive vascular occlusions with an increase of vascular permeability, leading to macula edema, or the formation of neovessels that finally proliferate into the vitreous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Various mediators, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), contribute to the upregulation of the adhesive molecules of the endothelial cells and leukocytes. Although the role of VEGF in the development of diabetic complications in the eye is well established, the role of TNF-&#x003b1; is still unclear.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; is the prototypical member of a family of cytokines that also include Fas ligand (FasL), CD40 ligand (CD40L) and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), and induce apoptosis, differentiation, cell activation, and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; is found in the extracellular matrix, endothelium, and vessel walls of fibrovascular tissue of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] and is elevated in the vitreous from eyes with this complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. The susceptibility to diabetic retinopathy has been associated with TNF-&#x003b1; gene polymorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] and expression of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3 and HLA-DR4 phenotypes and HLA-DR4 phenotypes. The involvement of TNF-&#x003b1; in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] could be attributed, in part, to its proinflammatory activity. Indeed, we have demonstrated that TNF-&#x003b1; is elevated in the diabetic retina and that the soluble p75-Fc fusion protein (etanercept) suppresses leukocyte adhesion in diabetic retinal arterioles, venules, and capillaries, as well as blood-retinal barrier breakdown in a rat model of diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; is a potent inducer of endothelial cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Yet, its role in regulating endothelial cell apoptosis in diabetic retinopathy has not been studied. Our previous results have demonstrated a mechanism of leukocyte-mediated endothelial cell death depending on the TNF-related ligand FasL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. We now show that the soluble TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitor etanercept significantly reduces retinal cell apoptosis, caspase activation and long-term complications during the course of diabetes in the eye. Our data identify TNF-&#x003b1; as a key molecule in the pathogenesis of the early signature pathologies and later diabetic complications that characterize diabetic retinopathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Long-Evans rats purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME) weighing approximately 200 g at an age of 6 weeks were used. The animals were fed standard laboratory chow and allowed free access to water in an air-conditioned room with a 12h:12h light-dark cycle. Unless otherwise stated, the animals were anesthetized with 40&#x000a0;mg/kg ketamine (Ketalar; Parke-Davis, Morris Plains NJ) and 4&#x000a0;mg/kg xylazine (Rompun, Bayer Leverkusen, Germany) before all experiments. For long-term experiments, mice deficient for TNF-&#x003b1; receptor protein 55 (Rp55; Rp55<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, B6.129-Tnfrsf1a<sup>tm1Mak</sup>/J), and Rp75 (Rp75<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, B6.129S2-Tnfrsf1b<sup>tm1Mwm</sup>/J) were used (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Age-matched C57BL/6J mice served as controls. Rp55<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Rp75<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice possess normal retinas and are markedly hypomorphic rather than null alleles for tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNF-RI)-deficient mice and TNF-RII. Animal care guidelines comparable to those published by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) were followed and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Regierungspr&#x000e4;sidium, K&#x000f6;ln, Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes</title><p>Animals were allowed to undergo a 12 h fast, following which they received a single 60&#x000a0;mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 10&#x000a0;mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5 or citrate buffer alone. Then 24 h later, animals with blood glucose levels higher than 250&#x000a0;mg/dl were considered diabetic. In vivo experiments were performed two weeks following STZ injection, and blood glucose was measured again before the onset of the experiments. In previous studies, we had demonstrated that STZ nonconverters do not differ in term of gene expression, amount of blood-retinal barrier breakdown, or leukostasis from nondiabetic controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Thus, in the current study nondiabetic animals with confirmed glucose levels of less than 120&#x000a0;mg/dl were used as controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse model of galactosemia</title><p>Experimental galactosemia was produced by feeding Rp55<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Rp75<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and respective controls a diet of Teklad 7004 (Harlan, WI) enriched with 30% D-galactose as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. This results in hyperglycemia largely devoid the attendant metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes. Bodyweight was measured weekly. The level of the blood hexose elevation was estimated by measuring the levels of nonenzymatic hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) using affinity chromatography (Glyc-Affin, Pierce, Rockford, Il). Mice with HbA1c of &#x02265;6% in repeated measurements were considered galactosemic and included in the study. Using this animal model, we recently demonstrated a central role of adherent leukocytes in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment with a soluble TNF-&#x003b1; receptor</title><p>Soluble p75 TNF-&#x003b1; receptor/Fc fusion protein (Enbrel&#x02122;, etanercept; Wyeth-Pharma GmbH, M&#x000fc;nster, Germany) was reconstituted with sterile water according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Starting one day after the STZ treatment, confirmed diabetic rats were randomized to receiving either etanercept or solvent alone. The drug was administered subcutaneously. The dose was 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg at three times per week according to the recommendation of the manufacturer for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in humans and according to our previous studies in the rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].

Following the induction of deep anesthesia with 50&#x000a0;mg/kg intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital, 1&#x000a0;mg/ml PI in PBS (140&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 10&#x000a0;mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) was injected intravenously via the tail vein at a concentration of 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/kg (0.668&#x000a0;ml/200&#x000a0;mg bodyweight). After fixation by intracardiac perfusion with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS labeling with concanavalin A-lectin was performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. The identification of arterioles, venules, and capillaries was done based on morphological criteria. Venules are usually slightly larger than arterioles, and capillaries have the smallest diameter. Labeled endothelial cells were distinguished from surrounding cells, especially pericytes, by distinct cellular outline and nuclear shape of the endothelial cells on retinal flat mounts. All experiments were performed in a masked fashion.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA fragmentation ELISA</title><p>A cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA was used to determine cell death quantitatively (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). This ELISA detects apoptotic fragmentation in BrdU-labeled DNA. Within 24 h after the last injection of either etanercept or the solvent, the assay was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Briefly, the animals received a single i.p. injection of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg BrdU. Retinae were excised 24 h after injection of the BrdU, lysed in buffer (4 M urea,100&#x000a0;mM Tris, 20&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 200&#x000a0;mM EDTA, pH 7.4), and incubated with 4&#x000a0;mg/ml proteinase K at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Genomic DNA fragments were isolated using the Apoptotic DNA ladder kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and finally eluted in 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of elution buffer per retina. The amount of fragmented DNA that corresponded to each eluate, and therefore to each retina, was subsequently quantified using the DNA fragmentation ELISA (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Photometric readings were obtained at 450 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling and M30 staining</title><p>Whole eyes from normal and diabetic rats treated with either etanercept or vehicle were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and embedded in paraffin using standard histological procedures. Terminal Transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed in tissue sections as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] using the TUNEL kit (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, DNA fragments in the tissue sections were labeled with digoxigenin-nucleotide and then allowed to bind an anti-digoxygenin antibody conjugated to a rhodamine reporter molecule. Apoptotic cells were detected using a CD-330 charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Dage-MIT, Michigan, IN) attached to a Leica MZ FLIII microscope (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL). The images were captured on an Apple (Cupertino, CA) G4 Computer and analyzed using Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). The number of positive endothelial cells was quantified by calculating the ratio of positive endothelial cells to negatively stained endothelial cells in retinal vessels. This was done in each of 12 sections from different eyes and expressed as percentage of positive cells.</p><p>Cytokeratin 18 is cleaved by caspases in early apoptotic events. The M30 CytoDeath antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) is a monoclonal mouse IgG2b antibody that binds to a caspase cleaved formalin resistant epitope of the cytokeratin 18 (CK18) cytoskeletal proteins. Immunoreactivity of the M30 antibodies is confined to the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. It allows the determination of caspase-related enzymatic activity early in the course of apoptosis.</p><p>M30 Cytodeath immunoreactivity was evaluated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. In brief, 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m paraffin sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated, micro waved for 5 min in Dako antigen retrieval solution (Carpinteria, CA), treated for 30 min in methanol containing 0.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and then incubated for 1 h in incubation buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20). The M30 CytoDeath antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:50 dilution in incubation buffer. The sections were subsequently washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with an anti-fluorescein-POD (horse-radishperoxidase) antibody (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The peroxidase reaction was developed with DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride), and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis for caspase 3 and caspase 8</title><p>The levels of protein expression of caspase 3 and caspase 8 were evaluated by western blotting, performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Briefly, whole retinas were lysed for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer (50&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, with 120&#x000a0;mM NaCl and 1% NP-40), supplemented with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche Diagnostics). The samples were cleared by microcentrifugation (13,800x g, 30 min, 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and assessed for protein concentration. Thirty micrograms of protein per sample was electrophoresed in a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel (SDS&#x02013;PAGE), and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. After a 1 h incubation in blocking solution (20% IgG-free normal horse serum, in PBS), the membranes were exposed overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to an anti-caspase-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) or an anti-caspase-8 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). After washing in PBS, the respective secondary peroxidise-labeled antibody was applied at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Protein loading was assessed by &#x003b2;-actin immunostaining and Coomassie staining of the membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymatic activity of caspase 3 and caspase 8</title><p>The activity of caspase 3 and caspase 8 was measured by a colorimetric analysis of the enzymatic conversion of a specific substrate as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. The activity of caspases 3 and 8 was measured via the enzymatic conversion of a specific substrate. In brief, retinas were lysed in a buffer containing 20&#x000a0;mM PIPES, 100&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 10&#x000a0;mM DTT, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.2. After centrifugation of the homogenates at 13,800x g rpm for 10 min, 40&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l aliquots of the supernatants were pipetted into 96 well plates. Excess amounts (80&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l) of caspase 8 substrate (Bachem Biochemica GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) or caspase 3 substrate (Alexis Biochemicals, Gr&#x000fc;nberg, Germany) were added to the supernatants. The reaction product was quantified by fluorophotometry on a plate reader (Beckmann, Hamburg, Germany) at 480 nm after 1, 2, 5, and 15 min (caspase 3) or 1, 60, 120, and 180 min (caspase 8). The results were normalized to total protein per sample as determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Trypsin digests of the retinal tissue</title><p>Trypsin digestion of the retina was performed according to the method of Cogan et al.

Formaldehyd-fixed retinas were divided at the optic disk into four quadrants. The retinal tissue was incubated in 3% Trypsin, 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.8) for 1&#x02013;3 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until the medium became cloudy and the tissues showed signs of disintegration. The retinas were than transferred to water and shaken gently to free the vessel network from adherent retinal tissue, washed in fresh water, mounted on glass slides and allowed to dry. They were stained with hematoxylin. Endothelial cells have large, ellipsoid nuclei lying within the vessel wall along the axis of the capillaries whereas pericytes nuclei are smaller, darker and usually round nuclei situated on the outer portion of the vessel wall. Mice that were diabetic for 11, 16, or 20 months were used. A digital imaging system was used to analyze four quadrants per retina for histopathological changes, including acellular capillary microaneurysm formation, and these were then grouped together. Four retinas per group were analyzed. All measurements were performed in a masked fashion.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All results are expressed as the mean<bold>&#x000b1;</bold>standard deviation (SD).

During apoptosis, caspases are activated in a hierarchical manner to cleave structural and functional proteins needed for cell survival. Cleaved products for both caspase 8 and caspase 3 were found by western blot analysis in the retinal lysates of rats after two weeks of diabetes, proving the activation of these caspases in the diabetic retina in the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).

We have previously demonstrated that TNF-&#x003b1; increases early during the course of diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced mainly by monocytes, macrophages, activated endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and joint cartilage chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. The induction of TNF-&#x003b1; could be attributed to various conditions that operate in the course of diabetes, such as hyperglycemia and oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF or interleukins, which activate the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that treatment with high doses of antiinflammatory agents, such as aspirin and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor meloxicam, reduces the levels of TNF-&#x003b1; in the diabetic retina, proving that inflammatory mediators and COX-2 are central in the upregulation of this cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>Endothelial and pericyte cell loss is one of the earliest and key manifestations of diabetic retinopathy. It leads to blood-retinal barrier breakdown, formation of acellular capillaries, microaneurysms, and retinal ischemia that hallmark the transition to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. As we [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] have previously described, during the course of diabetes, injury and apoptosis occur early in endothelial cells, retinal ganglion cells, and astrocytes. Singh et al. detected apoptosis in endothelial cells in microvessels three days after the induction of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], and Emanueli et al. have shown that in the STZ model, endothelial cells die via apoptosis as early as two weeks after the induction of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Mizutani et al. noted accelerated death of endothelial cells in the retinas from diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], and Barber et al. demonstrated increased neural cell death as early as one month after the induction of diabetes in male Sprague-Dawley rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. In the current study, we found increased amounts of DNA fragmentation in diabetic versus non-diabetic retinas, confirming the increased incidence of apoptosis, and we localized this apoptotic activity in the endothelial, pericyte, and ganglion cell layer. The same areas demonstrated staining with the M30 antibody, indicating caspase activation, and resulting in apoptotic death.</p><p>Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, are both involved in activation of cytokines as well as in the initiation and execution of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Initiator caspases such as caspase 8, are known to activate proteolytically executioner caspases, such as caspase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. The activation of both the initiator as well as the effector caspases in complete retinal extracts was also shown. Our results correlate with Martin and coworkers, who found activation of caspase 3 in cells of the ganglion cells layer in diabetic retinas in a statistically higher degree than in retinas from nondiabetic controls in the STZ mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>].</p><p>According to our data, all the aforedescribed pathologies, including cellular loss, TUNEL reactivity, and caspase activation are significantly reduced in the anti-TNF-&#x003b1;-treated retinas. This leads us to the conclusion that TNF-&#x003b1; is a major player in retinal cell death in diabetic retinopathy. TNF-&#x003b1; is known to be a potent inducer of apoptosis in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. TNF signal transduction is mediated through two cell surface receptors, TNF-RI and TNF-RII. Until recently, it was believed that TNF-induced apoptosis was mediated exclusively by TNF-RI because TNF-RII lacks the death domain. However, it has been demonstrated that TNF-RII enhances TNF-RI-mediated apoptosis. The significant inhibition of the diabetes-induced activation of caspase 8 and 3 in our model leads to the conclusion that TNF-&#x003b1; induces retinal cell death in diabetes through these two caspases.</p><p>However, there might be also an indirect involvement for TNF-&#x003b1; in diabetic apoptotic cell death. In experimental diabetes, adhesion of leukocytes to the retinal vasculature is one of the earliest events and results in enhanced blood-retinal barrier breakdown, endothelial injury, and cell death as well as capillary nonperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. As we have previously shown, leukocyte-induced apoptosis is mediated by the Fas-FasL pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], and administration of soluble etanercept reduced leukocyte adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Since sequestration of TNF-&#x003b1; reduces retinal apoptosis, it is justified to hypothesize that TNF-&#x003b1; could induce apoptosis indirectly by increasing leukocyte adhesion. TNF-&#x003b1; has been shown to increase NF-&#x003ba;B in many models, whereas NF-&#x003ba;B is a known regulator of FasL expression. It is interesting to speculate that the early rise in TNF-&#x003b1; expression in diabetes results in activation of NF-&#x003ba;B that in turn upregulates FasL expression in leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. Subsequently, these leukocytes are better equipped to induce Fas-mediated apoptosis in their targets as demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. During inflammation, TNF-&#x003b1; and VEGF induce endothelial cell downregulation of FasL and upregulate Fas and adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. This downregulation of FasL in the endothelium, combined with the increased apoptotic threshold of leukocytes in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>], could result in a relative increase of surviving leukocytes in immunoprivileged areas such as the retina. In addition, the converse upregulation of adhesion molecules and Fas on the endothelium, and increases in FasL on the leukocytes, could function together to drive the balance toward a significantly increased leukocyte-induced endothelial death in diabetes. This effect might be mediated by circulating factors such as VEGF, TNF-&#x003b1;, or oxidative stress. The activation of caspase 8 and caspase 3 in retinas of diabetic rats according to our results and the reduction of this activation by inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; activity fit in the model of a TNF-&#x003b1; initiated receptor-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>In this study, apoptosis was significantly reduced in endothelial cells as well as in the inner nuclear layer in the retinas of diabetic rats upon the administration of the TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitor and the concomitant reduction of leukocyte adhesion. This leads to the conclusion that leukocytes that adhere to the vasculature might be responsible for the observed endothelial apoptosis, whereas leukocytes extravasating to the retinal tissue are responsible for the apoptotic death observed in other cell layers. This is in accordance with our previous data in diabetes, where inhibition of leukocyte-mediated death by neutralizing FasL reduced apoptotic death not only in the endothelial cell layer but also in the ganglion and inner cell layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>].</p><p>To establish a role for TNF-&#x003b1; in the pathogenesis of signature lesions in diabetic retinopathy and to address the question whether the demonstrated effects are only due to its transient overexpression in early diabetes, we used a long-term mouse model of diabetic retinopathy. The course of diabetes in rodents includes the formation of signature lesions similar to those in humans, such as acellular capillary formation, microaneurysms breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, and macular edema. These similarities allow extrapolating valuable conclusions from the rodent models of long-term diabetes relevant to human diabetes. We have examined the vascular pathology in a mouse model of galactose-induced diabetes that allows for the analysis of the histopathological alterations up to two years after the induction of diabetes. We [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>] have found that throughout the course of experimental galactosemia the number of endothelial cells and pericytes decreased significantly, whereas the formation of acellular capillaries and microaneurysms increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Pericyte loss is in the center of the pathogenesis of diabetes, allowing for microaneurysm formation possibly by local weakening and out-pouching of the capillary wall, and contributing to the endothelial dysfunction and damage that leads to cellular death and formation of acellular capillaries. Surprisingly enough, the formation of acellular capillaries was not reduced in the TNF-RI- and TNF-RII-deficient mice although the pericyte and endothelial cell loss was significantly inhibited. This observation could lead to the conclusion that other factors apart from the net cellular loss contribute to the formation of acellular capillaries.</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicate that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x003b1; plays a major role in endothelial and retinal cell injury and apoptosis during diabetes. TNF-&#x003b1; is involved in endothelial apoptosis directly via death receptor-mediated apoptosis and indirectly via an increased leukostasis. Together with our previous data demonstrating the role of TNF-&#x003b1; on diabetic vascular leakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], we can conclude from this study that TNF-&#x003b1; is one of the major cytokines in diabetic retinopathy both involved in leukocyte activation as well as in endothelial cell apoptosis. The inhibition of both initiation- and execution-caspase activation in the diabetic model by etanercept demonstrates the potential of the TNF-&#x003b1; antagonist to inhibit diabetic apoptosis, including the death-inducing signaling complex. However, the exact death receptor pathways either triggered by FAS (CD95) or via TNF-RI remain to be elucidated. Given their established efficacy and safety profile, biologic agents that neutralize TNF-&#x003b1; have received approval from the USA Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. These drugs could be of potential benefit in preventing early diabetic vascular damage.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG JO 324/6&#x02013;1 (ENP), DFG JO 324/4&#x02013;1, DFG JO 324/10&#x02013;1, Ernst und Berta Grimmke Stiftung, Meyer-Schwarting Stiftung, Gertrud und Werner M&#x000fc;ller Stiftung, and the Foundation Fighting Blindness (to V.P.).
