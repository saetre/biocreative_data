This homology region is preceded by an N-terminal extension and followed by a C-terminal extension. The role of these extensions on the binding of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to mitochondrial small ribosomal subunits (28S) was studied using derivatives in which the extensions had been deleted. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the binding of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to 28S subunits is &#x0223c;30 nM. Removal of either the N- or C-terminal extension has almost no effect on this value. IF3<sub>mt</sub> has very weak interactions with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (39S) (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.5 &#x003bc;M). However, deletion of the extensions results in derivatives with significant affinity for 39S subunits (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.12<bold>&#x02212;</bold>0.25 &#x003bc;M). IF3<sub>mt</sub> does not bind 55S monosomes, while the deletion derivative binds slightly to these particles. IF3<sub>mt</sub> is very effective in dissociating 55S ribosomes. Removal of the N-terminal extension has little effect on this activity. However, removal of the C-terminal extension leads to a complex dissociation pattern due to the high affinity of this derivative for 39S subunits. These data suggest that the extensions have evolved to ensure the proper dissociation of IF3<sub>mt</sub> from the 28S subunits upon 39S subunit joining.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The protein synthesizing machinery of mammalian mitochondria has several distinct differences from the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasmic systems. The mammalian mitochondrial genome consists of only 16 000 bp that encode 13 polypeptides, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. These 13 polypeptides are essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial ribosomes are 55S particles with 28S small and 39S large subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are protein rich and have a number of distinguishing features as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Very limited information has been reported on the mechanism of translational initiation in this organelle. Only two initiation factors have been identified to date, initiation factor 2 (IF2<sub>mt</sub>) promotes the binding of fMet-tRNA to the ribosome, while mitochondrial initiation factor 3 (IF3<sub>mt</sub>) facilitates the dissociation of the mitochondrial 55S ribosome into subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">3&#x02013;11</xref>).</p><p>In bacteria, IF3 plays a vital role in translational initiation. This highly basic protein promotes the dissociation of 70S ribosomes into 30S and 50S subunits. This factor also enhances codon&#x02013;anticodon interactions at the P-site, promotes the shift in position of the mRNA on the 30S subunit from the standby to a decoding position and increases the rate of dissociation of non-canonical 30S initiation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">12&#x02013;20</xref>). IF3 maximizes the advantage of the initiator tRNA for binding to 30S subunits and for subunit joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>A considerable amount of information is available on the binding of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> IF3 to 30S subunits, and several views of its location on the ribosome have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). A number of biochemical and biophysical studies suggest that <italic>E. coli</italic> IF3 interacts with 30S subunits in the region of the platform, cleft and the head, facing the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). A range of equilibrium dissociation constants (from 30 to 100 nM) have been reported for the binding of IF3 to 30S subunits The association rate constants reported (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and the reported dissociation rate constants (0.44 to 20 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) vary considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>).</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> IF3 consists of two domains (N- and C-terminal) that are joined by a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The C-terminal domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> IF3 is thought to perform most of the functions of this factor while the N-terminal domain stabilizes the binding of IF3 to the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Recent studies indicate that the N-terminal domain modulates the association and dissociation of IF3 from the 30S subunit through a fluctuating interaction with the neck region of the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of the domain structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> IF3 to that of human IF3<sub>mt</sub> and its deletion derivatives. IF3<sub>mt</sub> is shown without the import signal which was removed in the preparation of the full-length factor. The three deletion derivatives used here are shown schematically and were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The numbers represent the amino acid residue at the beginning of the indicated domain. The numbering for IF3<sub>mt</sub> is based on the complete protein-coding region including the mitochondrial import sequence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm1072f1"/></fig></p><p>The IF3<sub>mt</sub> has a central region with homology to the bacterial factor that is surrounded by N-terminal and C-terminal extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The crystal structure of IF3<sub>mt</sub> is not known, but the N-domain has been modeled to have a structure similar to that of the bacterial factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The C-domain of human IF3<sub>mt</sub> cannot be modeled on the structure of the bacterial factor due to the low degree of homology. However, the structure of the C-domain (without the C-terminal extension) of mouse IF3<sub>mt</sub> has been determined using NMR (PDB coordinates 2CRQ, to be published). This region of the mitochondrial factor has a similar overall structure to that of the C-domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> IF3 although IF3<sub>mt</sub> has an additional &#x003b2;-sheet and a small extra helical turn. The structures of the linker region and of the N-terminal and C-terminal extensions remain unknown. The mature form of IF3<sub>mt</sub> and derivatives in which the extensions have been deleted are active in initiation complex formation on both mitochondrial 55S ribosomes and on bacterial 70S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) but the C-terminal extension appears to play a role in the dissociation of fMet-tRNA bound to 28S subunits in the absence of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In the present study, we have investigated the interactions of IF3<sub>mt</sub>, and derivatives of this factor lacking the extensions, with mitochondrial 28S and 39S subunits and with 55S ribosomes. Our results suggest that the extensions help to ensure the proper dissociation of IF3<sub>mt</sub> from the 28S subunits upon 39S joining.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Regular chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific.

The gradients were centrifuged for 1 h 45 min at 48 000 r.p.m. in a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor. Sucrose gradients were fractionated on an ISCO gradient fractionator at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min and fractions (&#x0223c;200 &#x003bc;l) were collected. The material in appropriate fractions was applied to the dot blot apparatus and analysed as described subsequently. Two control experiments were performed: IF3<sub>mt</sub> alone and ribosomes or ribosomal subunits alone. The material in these control fractions was also analysed using the dot blot for the determination of background intensity and this background was subtracted from the intensity obtained when ribosomes were incubated with IF3<sub>mt</sub>. The presence of sucrose in the gradient fractions increased the background in the dot blot considerably. A comparison of the dot blot signal from the samples-containing ribosomes and IF3<sub>mt</sub> together to the signal from the controls allowed an estimation of the amount of IF3<sub>mt</sub> bound to ribosomes or ribosomal subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative immunological detection for IF3<sub>mt</sub></title><p>Dot blots were performed basically as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).

The rates of association and dissociation were measured by recording the change in refractive index with time. The Running Buffer composition was 20 mM HEPES&#x02013;KOH, pH 7.6, 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% glycerol and 0.01% surfactant P20 at a flow rate of 20 &#x003bc;l/min. CM5 chips (research grade) were activated by injecting 60 &#x003bc;l of 1:1 mixture of <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) at a flow rate of 10 &#x003bc;l/min using the standard amine-coupling protocol (BIAapplication Handbook, Biacore). Following CM5 surface activation, 60 &#x003bc;l IF3<sub>mt</sub> (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) diluted in 5 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 was injected at a flow rate of 10 &#x003bc;l/min. Subsequently, 60 &#x003bc;l ethanolamine&#x02013;hydrochloride was injected to deactivate any unreacted groups remaining. The extent of immobilization was &#x0223c;200&#x02013;400 RU on the surface including a control surface with avidin. A &#x0223c;2000 RU surface was also prepared to examine the effect of high protein concentrations on the association and dissociation rates. The apparent rate of dissociation of 28S subunits from IF3<sub>mt</sub> on the surface depends on the concentration of coupled IF3<sub>mt</sub>. The 2000 RU surface showed a 10-fold greater RU change after 28S injection than the 200 RU surface. However, abnormal dissociation rates were observed from these high density surfaces due to the rebinding of 28S subunits during the dissociation phase. Therefore, the surface with the lower level of immobilized IF3<sub>mt</sub> was used to study the interaction of IF3<sub>mt</sub> with 28S subunits. Small subunits were diluted in 200 &#x003bc;l Running Buffer to obtain a concentration either 25 or 75 nM and 60 &#x003bc;l of each solution was injected at a flow rate 20 &#x003bc;l/min. The RU change due to the binding of 28S subunits was obtained by subtracting the RU of the control surface (avidin bound at 200 RU) from the RU obtained from the surface containing IF3<sub>mt</sub>. Surfaces were regenerated by injecting 10 &#x003bc;l of 20 mM HEPES&#x02013;KOH, pH 7.6, 1 M KCl, 10 mM EDTA and 0.1% surfactant P20. The surface activity was tested after regeneration to verify that IF3<sub>mt</sub> remained active.</p><p>The association and dissociation rate constants were also verified by cysteine coupling. For cysteine coupling, the Running Buffer above was used except that no DTT was present. For thiol-coupling, the surface was activated with EDC/NHS and reactive disulfides were introduced with 80 mM PDEA in borate buffer at pH 8.5. IF3<sub>mt</sub> was coupled to the surface by disulfide exchange. The unreacted disulfides were deactivated by injecting 60 &#x000b5;l of a solution containing 50 mM cysteine and 1 M NaCl in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 at a flow rate of 10 &#x000b5;l/min.</p><p>Calculation of the association and dissociation rate constants and the detailed analysis of surface plasma resonance (SPR) data was based on the approach described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and is described in detail in Supplementary Data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Estimation of the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the binding of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to 28S subunits and the role of the N- and C-terminal extensions on this binding using Microcon centrifugation</title><p>IF3<sub>mt</sub> contains N- and C-domains joined by a linker.

The values obtained are quite similar to those obtained by the Microcon and sucrose density gradient methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This observation indicates that there are no hidden intermediates in the interaction of IF3<sub>mt</sub> with 28S subunits.

IF3<sub>mt</sub> has one cysteine residue in the C-domain which was used for the thio-coupling reaction. Interestingly, all of the truncated derivatives were better ligands for thio-coupling than IF3<sub>mt</sub>. However, the coupling of the derivatives to the surface was not stable and they were exchanged with cysteine during the surface deactivation step used to remove excess thio groups. Thus, we are not able to measure the rate of association and dissociation of 28S subunits on the thio-coupled truncated derivatives of IF3<sub>mt</sub>. The association and dissociation rate constants for the interaction of full-length, thio-coupled, IF3<sub>mt</sub> with 28S subunits are 2.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1.28 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. These values are very similar to those obtained with amine coupling indicating that the amine coupling does not change the conformation of IF3<sub>mt</sub> or deactivate the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of IF3<sub>mt</sub> and its deletion derivatives with the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunits (39S)</title><p>For the determination of binding constants, ribosomes or ribosomal subunits must be nearly pure. Samples of 39S subunits were purified through two successive sucrose density gradients. The amount of 28S contamination in these 39S preparations was estimated to be 2% based on an fMet-tRNA binding assay and &#x0223c;6% using peak fits of the sucrose density gradient absorbance profile. In addition, there was a small amount of contamination with 55S monosomes. As a result of this level of cross-contamination, neither the Microcon nor the SPR method could be used for the determination of the binding constant of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to 39S subunits. The binding of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to 39S subunits was, therefore, examined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation followed by immunological detection (Supplementary Data, Figure S2). This analysis clearly indicates that IF3<sub>mt</sub> binds to 39S subunits to a small extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for this interaction was estimated assuming that the 39S subunits are 100% active and was calculated to be 1.5 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This value is 50-fold weaker than the binding of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to 28S subunits indicating that, as expected, the main site of interaction between IF3<sub>mt</sub> and the ribosome is with the small subunit. Surprisingly, removal of the N-terminal extension, the C-terminal extension or both extensions enhanced the interaction of IF3<sub>mt</sub> with 39S subunits considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed without the N- and C-terminal extensions IF3<sub>mt</sub> has only a four-fold greater affinity for 28S subunits than for 39S subunits. This observation suggests that the extensions on IF3<sub>mt</sub> may have evolved, in part, to reduce the affinity of this factor for 39S subunits. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effects of the N-terminal, C-terminal or both extensions on the binding of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to mitochondrial 39S subunits.

Due to the equilibrium between the 55S ribosome and its subunits, and the effect of IF3<sub>mt</sub> on this equilibrium, neither the Microcon assay nor SPR could be used to examine whether IF3 interacts with 55S particles. Hence, the interaction between 55S ribosomes and IF3<sub>mt</sub> was examined using sucrose density gradient centrifugation followed by immunological detection. Two Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (7.5 and 20 mM) were used. At 7.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, most of the IF3<sub>mt</sub> was bound to 28S subunits, and only small amounts of IF3<sub>mt</sub> were detected in 39S and 55S regions of the gradient (data not shown). At 20 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the ribosomes were primarily present as 55S particles. No binding of IF3<sub>mt</sub> could be detected to the intact monosomes (data not shown). IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;NC had weak interactions with 55S monosomes even with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value obtained of 1.3 &#x003bc;M. The strong affinity of this derivative for 28S and 39S subunits apparently gives rise to a detectable interaction with tightly coupled 55S monosomes. <italic>E. coli</italic> IF3, which corresponds structurally to IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;NC also binds weakly to 70S ribosomes (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 3 &#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dissociation of 55S ribosomes by IF3<sub>mt</sub> and its deletion derivatives</title><p>Bacterial IF3 has five different roles in initiation complex formation, one of which is to dissociate 70S ribosomes into 30S and 50S subunits, thus supplying 30S subunits for initiation complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) suggest that IF3<sub>mt</sub>, like bacterial IF3, can promote the dissociation of ribosomes. To examine the role of the N- and C-terminal extensions on this activity, mitochondrial ribosomes were incubated with IF3<sub>mt</sub> or its deletion derivatives, and the distribution of ribosomal particles was examined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). At the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration used in these experiments (5 mM), most of the ribosomes are present as 55S particles in the absence of IF3<sub>mt</sub>. As expected, incubation of the ribosomes with IF3<sub>mt</sub> leads to a significant shift in the equilibrium resulting in the accumulation of 28S and 39S subunits. Deletion of the N-terminal extension had only a minor effect on the ability of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to promote dissociation. However, removal of the C-terminal extension (IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;C) or both the N- and C-terminal extensions (IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;NC) reduced the ability of IF3<sub>mt</sub> to promote subunit dissociation. Further, the gradient patterns obtained with these derivatives were broad and complex suggesting that the subunits had a tendency to partially reassociate during centrifugation when these derivatives were used. This result agrees with the idea that the C-terminal extension plays a role in preventing the interaction of IF3<sub>mt</sub> with the 39S subunit creating cleaner subunit dissociation patterns. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of IF3<sub>mt</sub> and its truncated derivatives on the dissociation of mitochondrial ribosomes.

In these experiments, the deletion derivatives were somewhat more active than full-length IF3<sub>mt</sub>. The promotion of initiation complex formation could be due to an increase in 39S joining forming the more stable 55S initiation complex, which occurs more readily, particularly when the C-terminal extension is deleted. IF3<sub>mt</sub> also destabilizes the binding of fMet-tRNA to 28S subunits in the absence of mRNA. Deletion of the C-terminal extension removes this destabilizing effect and allows the detection of fMet-tRNA bound in the absence of mRNA which would be measured in this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>When GDPNP was substituted for GTP in the fMet-tRNA binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), significantly less binding was observed in the presence of IF2<sub>mt</sub> as expected. This difference reflects the inability of IF2<sub>mt</sub> to recycle when GDPNP is used. IF3<sub>mt</sub> had no significant effect on fMet-tRNA binding to 55S particles in the presence of GDPNP since the amount of IF2<sub>mt</sub> used in this experiment was limited and IF2<sub>mt</sub> remained trapped on ribosomes in the presence of GDPNP. However, when the N- and C-terminal extensions were deleted (IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;NC) the amount of fMet-tRNA bound in the presence of GDPNP was enhanced and approached the value obtained in the presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Both the N- and C-terminal extensions appeared to have a partial effect in this process. This observation suggests that deletion of the extensions in IF3<sub>mt</sub> facilitates the formation of the 55S complex and may reduce the affinity of IF2<sub>mt</sub> for the ribosome or for the small subunit allowing this factor to recycle even in the presence of GDPNP. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effect of IF3 and derivatives on initiation complex formation with GDPNP.

The extensions observed in human IF3<sub>mt</sub> are reminiscent of the large extensions present in <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic> chloroplast IF3 (IF3<sub>chl</sub>), which has an N-terminal extension of over 100 residues and a C-terminal extension of just over 60 residues. The extensions in IF3<sub>chl</sub> reduce the binding of this factor to chloroplast 30S ribosomal subunits &#x0223c;100-fold and inhibit its activity in initiation complex formation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> IF3 has a C-terminal extension of over 60 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). This extension is important for vegetative and developmental functions in this organism but is not required for cell viability.</p><p>Removal of the N- and C-terminal extensions in human IF3<sub>mt</sub> slightly promotes initiation complex formation on 55S ribosomes. The first difference between the full-length IF3<sub>mt</sub> and its truncated derivatives was the observation that the C-truncated derivative cannot dissociate fMet-tRNA bound to 28S subunits in the absence of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). This observation suggests that there may be a role for this region of IF3<sub>mt</sub> in the destabilization of incorrect initiation complexes. In the current work, we have shown that, unlike the extensions in <italic>E. gracilis</italic> IF3<sub>chl</sub>, the extensions on IF3<sub>mt</sub> do not affect the binding of this factor to the small ribosomal subunit. However, the extensions appear to play a major role in preventing this factor from binding to the large ribosomal subunit. Full-length IF3<sub>mt</sub> has a very weak interaction with 39S subunits. Deletion of either the N- or C-terminal extension leads to a factor with a significantly higher affinity for the large subunit. The extensions appear to work together in reducing affinity for the 39S subunit. Further, deletion of the extensions results in the formation of a 55S initiation complex in which IF2<sub>mt</sub> appears to be more readily released.</p><p>These observations lead us to propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) in which a 28S initiation complex, including IF2<sub>mt</sub>, IF3<sub>mt</sub>, fMet-tRNA and mRNA is first formed. Upon binding of the 39S subunit, IF3<sub>mt</sub> is normally released and a stable 55S initiation complex forms. In the presence of GDPNP, IF2<sub>mt</sub> is not released and IF2<sub>mt</sub> does not recycle. However, when the N- and C-terminal extensions of IF3<sub>mt</sub> are removed, the remaining region of IF3<sub>mt</sub> has a significant affinity for 39S subunits. Under these conditions, the large subunit joins the 28S subunits readily but is probably not correctly positioned. Under these conditions, the binding of IF2<sub>mt</sub> is destabilized leading to the release of this factor even in the presence of GDPNP. Thus, one role for the extensions that have evolved at the termini of IF3<sub>mt</sub> is to reduce the affinity of this factor for the protein-rich 39S subunit preventing improper joining of the large and small ribosomal subunits during initiation complex formation. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Model for the proposed role of the extensions of IF3<sub>mt</sub> in initiation complex formation. IF3<sub>mt</sub> binding and dissociation is shown in the left panel and IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;NC in the right panel. IF3<sub>mt</sub> and IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;NC dissociate 55S ribosomes and bind to 28S subunits. IF3<sub>mt</sub> has very weak interactions with 39S subunits and is released rapidly upon 39S subunits joining. In the presence of GDPNP, IF2<sub>mt</sub> is then frozen on the ribosome and cannot recycle properly. IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;NC has a strong affinity for 39S subunits and its rate of dissociation from ribosomes is slow when 39S subunits join. Therefore, IF3<sub>mt</sub>&#x02212;&#x00394;NC does not permit the proper joining of the 39S subunit. Under these conditions, IF2<sub>mt</sub> binding is destabilized and is released from the initiation complex even in the presence of GDPNP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm1072f6"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm1072_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm1072_nar-02287-w-2007-File008.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm1072_nar-02287-w-2007-File009.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm1072_nar-02287-w-2007-File010.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr Ashutosh Tripathy for technical assistance with the SPR measurements.
