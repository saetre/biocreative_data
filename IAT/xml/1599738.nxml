Infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild self-limited illness (dengue fever, DF) to a severe disease with spontaneous hemorrhaging (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF), or, most seriously, to DEN shock syndrome (DSS) characterized by circulatory failure. Fifty million DEN infections with 500,000 cases of DHF and 12,000 deaths occur each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the years 2002 to 2004, 23,826 cases of DEN and 5,557 of DHF were reported in Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The Dengue virus (family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, species <italic>Dengue virus</italic>) infects mammalian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and vector cells. Neutralizing antibodies facilitate the binding and penetration of DENV into human macrophages; the virus-antibody complex binds Fc receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This mechanism does not explain virus entry in primary infections or in cells with non-Fc receptors. Transmission electron microscopy shows that DEN viruses must attach to the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that the cells must have virus receptor(s) on their surfaces to be susceptible to infection. Proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], heparan sulfates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], LPS/CD14-associated binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and other glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] have been proposed as cellular receptors for DENV. In addition, DC-SIGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] has been suggested as a mediator of DENV infection in dendritic cells and could participate in binding large numbers of other viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola and CytoMV to host cell surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In C6/36 cells, two major polypeptides have been described with apparent molecular weights of 67 and 80 kDa, which bind to DEN virus serotype 2 (DENV2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The mechanism by which the virus enters mosquito cells is unknown. The presence of receptor(s) on the surface does not necessarily render a cell susceptible to infection. In natural infection, DENV is first deposited in the mosquito vector and then in a human host bitten by the vector during a blood meal. Therefore, it is necessary to study receptors in the mosquito midgut (MG) to determine which binding proteins serve as true virus receptors; they may be relevant to treating DEN infection and in designing control strategies. This is especially important because mosquitoes differ in their susceptibilities to infection, resulting in different vector competences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The present study shows that the proteins R80 and R67 are the putative receptors in the MG of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Moreover, proteins with the same apparent molecular weights were purified by DENV2 affinity chromatography from the MG of this mosquito and from C6/36 cells. In addition, a protein with molecular weight of 57 kDa was also purified from mosquito MG extracts by affinity chromatography. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled membranes using <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>anti-MG antibodies showed that R80 and R67 are contained in mosquito cell membranes. Furthermore, the four serotypes of DENV recognized the same proteins on <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>and C6/36 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification and purification of the putative DENV2 receptors in Ae. aegypti midgut by the virus overlay protein binding assay</title><p>Mosquito MG proteins were extracted with 0.05% of Triton X-100, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted on to a PVDF membrane and incubated with biotinylated DENV2 virus to identify the putative receptors.

All four serotypes led to the immunoprecipitation of proteins with molecular masses of 80 and 67 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;10). Labeled C6/36 apical membrane proteins were precipitated by anti-EP antibodies as a positive control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lane 11).

Anti-EP recognized two polypeptides with molecular masses of 80 and 67 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lane 2) and anti-R80 and anti-R67 recognized polypeptides of 80 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lane 3) and 67 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lane 4), respectively.

Anti-R80 also stained the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>).</p><p>In order to test antibody blocking of DENV binding, C6/36 cell monolayers were incubated with anti-EP, anti-R67, anti-R80 or anti-MG antibodies or pre-immune serum, then with <sup>125</sup>I- DEN2 virus as described in the methods section (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Anti-EP, anti-R67 and anti-R80 decreased virus binding by up to 40%. Binding was inhibited by 70% when anti-MG was diluted 1:10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>To test the inhibition of DENV2 infection by the specific anti-receptor antibodies, C6/36 cell monolayers were incubated separately for 1 h in media containing pre-immune serum, anti-EP, anti-R67 or anti-R80 diluted 1:10 or 1:50, before being infected with DENV2. Infection was allowed to proceed for 8 days and the amount of infectious virus was determined by viral plaque assays in LLC-MK2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Maximal inhibition of infection was obtained with anti-EP and anti-R67 diluted 1:10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These antibodies inhibited DEN 2 replication in the C6/36 cells nearly 1000-fold. Anti-R80 showed a relatively minor inhibitory effect of approximately 100-fold. Anti-EP, anti-R67 or anti-R80 diluted 1:50, and pre-immune serum, did not inhibit DEN2 replication in these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>When a mosquito takes a viremic blood meal, virions interact with receptors on the midgut epithelial cells and penetrate and infect them. Arbovirus blocked at early stages of midgut infection is considered a midgut infection barrier (MIB). A midgut escape barrier (MEB) is considered when infectious virions do not disseminate to hemoceles, or disseminate but do not infect secondary target organs.</p><p>Most studies of flavivirus vector competence in <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>indicate that MIB is a major determinant of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and shows wide variation both among and within <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>populations for flaviviruses including DENV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>MG is generally considered the best candidate tissue for disrupting the virus life cycle within the mosquito because it is the earliest interface between insect and virus (see above). This strongly suggests that DENV attachment to MG epithelial cell receptors is critical for understanding the initial virus-vector interactions and will help to explain MIBs to DENV infection and variations in vector competence. Furthermore, we would expect that virus serotype and genotype would influence virus attachment to midgut receptors.</p><p>Thus, identification of viral receptors in the MG represents a critical step in understanding vector competence and designing possible targets for preventing viral entry to cells and therefore inhibiting the infection. Feasible approaches to intervention are monoclonal antibodies blocking the receptor, and synthetic peptides mimicking the viral receptor and thus competing with the host receptor for virus attachment. This will allow novel strategies for the control and prevention of DEN to be developed. Published data have shown that the viral E protein is involved in target cell recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recent structural and genetic evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] suggests that the prM/M stem-anchor region is also likely to play a role in virion entry to cells. Purification by DENV 2 affinity chromatography using native virus is a novel approach to obtaining the putative protein receptors for DENV.</p><p>Several authors using the overlay assay have identified polypeptides with molecular masses of 27, 45, 67 and 87 in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], 40 and 70 in myelomonocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], 45 and 72 kDa in B and T cells from humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and two heparan sulfate containing cell-surface binding proteins resolving at 19 and 37 kDa in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The data in the present paper strongly support the view that the 67 and 80 kDa proteins are receptors for DENV 1, 2, 3 and 4 in MG cells from <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Furthermore, we have purified these proteins for the first time from both <italic>Ae. albopictus </italic>C6/36 cells and <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>MGs using DENV2 affinity chromatography; we also generated specific antibodies against them, which inhibited binding and infection of cultured cells by DENV 2. These results contrast with those of Yazi-Mendoza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], who showed that DENV 4 binds to a 45 kDa protein in mosquito tissues. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> clearly demonstrate that DENV 4 recognizes R67 and R80 in C6/36 cell membranes. A plausible explanation is that Yazi-Mendoza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] used total cell extracts for their VOPBA, while our results were obtained from plasma membranes, although viruses are known to have several receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In any event, further experiments are needed to settle the point. Interestingly, Jindadamrongwech &#x00026; Smith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] found a serotype-specific heterogeneity among DENV binding proteins on HepG2 human Liver cells. It is therefore possible that different cell lines have different specificities for virus serotypes.</p><p>The specific antibodies against R67 and R80 inhibited radiolabeled DEN virus binding and the highest inhibition was observed with anti-MG antibodies, suggesting that other cell membrane molecules may participate in virus binding. Candidates include non-sialic acid carbohydrates, since we previously showed that sialic acid does not participate in virus binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In agreement with our results, Zieler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] failed to detect sialic acid in <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>MG. More recently, Thaisomboonsuk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] reported the inability of neuroaminidase to inhibit DEN-2 virus binding to insect cells.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, DC-SIGN has also been reported as a functional receptor on human dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] for DENV and other flaviviruses. Further studies are needed to determine the involvement of DC-SIGN as receptor in DENV infection in <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>mosquitoes.</p><p>Collectively, the results corroborate the notion that DENV utilizes multiple cell surface molecules for binding to and infection of target cells, some of which may be common to all cells and shared among several viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, Sakoonwtanyoo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] suggested that one of these protein receptors for DENV 2, 3 and 4 may be a laminin-binding protein with an apparent mass of 50 kDa. Although we failed to detect a protein with this molecular mass, this does not eliminate the possibility.</p><p>In summary, specific membrane molecules are required for DENV binding and the nature of these molecules seems to depend on cell type. Interestingly, our results show that R67 and R80 are the putative receptors in the MG of <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>mosquitoes, the principal DENV vector in America, and in <italic>Ae. albopictus </italic>C6/36 cells. In addition, these receptors are specific for all four serotypes of DENV.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper documents for the first time that the proteins R67 and R80 are putative receptors for dengue virus in the midgut of <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>and in <italic>Ae. albopictus </italic>C6/36 cells, since specific antibodies against these proteins inhibited the binding and cytopathic effects of the virus.

After silver staining, each of the two main protein species (R80, R67) was excised from the gel, cut in small pieces, suspended in PBS and mixed with an equal volume of Titer-Max adjuvant (CyTRx Corporation) to immunize two groups of BALB/c mice. Pre-immune sera were obtained before immunization. Proteins eluted (EP) from the DENV2 affinity column were used to obtain specific polyclonal antibodies. A total of 10 &#x003bc;g of this protein was used to immunize the mice. MG extracts (100 &#x003bc;g), or C6/36 cell membrane extracts (50 &#x003bc;g), were also used to immunize mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. After fifteen days, the mice received a booster; they were bled after thirty days. Sera were stored at -70&#x000b0;C until use. Antibody specificity was tested by ELISA and immunofluorescence.
