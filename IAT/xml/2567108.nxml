In mouse brain, <italic>kf-1</italic> mRNA is detected predominantly in the hippocampus and cerebellum, and <italic>kf-1</italic> gene expression is elevated also in the frontal cortex of rats after chronic antidepressant treatments. KF-1 mediates E2-dependent ubiquitination and may modulate cellular protein levels as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, though its target proteins are not yet identified. To elucidate the role of <italic>kf-1</italic> in the central nervous system, we generated <italic>kf-1</italic> knockout mice by gene targeting, using Cre-lox recombination. The resulting <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were normal and healthy in appearance. Behavioral analyses revealed that <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed significantly increased anxiety-like behavior compared with <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> littermates in the light/dark transition and elevated plus maze tests; however, no significant differences were observed in exploratory locomotion using the open field test or in behavioral despair using the forced swim and tail suspension tests. These observations suggest that KF-1 suppresses selectively anxiety under physiological conditions probably through modulating protein levels of its unknown target(s). Interestingly, <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited significantly increased prepulse inhibition, which is usually reduced in human schizophrenic patients. Thus, the <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice provide a novel animal model for elucidating molecular mechanisms of psychiatric diseases such as anxiety/depression, and may be useful for screening novel anxiolytic/antidepressant compounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd>knockout mouse</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="8818"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the 1990s, a comprehensive search was conducted for the genes responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of dominantly inherited causative mutations were then discovered in the genes encoding &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 (PS1), and presenilin-2 (PS2) (for reviews, see Hashimoto-Gotoh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>; Lundkvist and N&#x000e4;slund, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>). At the same time, we also sought to identify genes that were involved in AD pathogenesis, and we identified two genes whose transcripts were found more frequently in the cerebral cortex of an AD patient than in a non-AD subject. One of these genes, <italic>kf-1</italic>, was a novel gene that encoded a zinc-binding membrane protein with a RING-H2 finger domain at the C-terminus (Yasojima et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1997</xref>). The <italic>kf-1</italic> gene is conserved in chordates/vertebrates but not in invertebrates such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Control of the half-life of <italic>kf-1</italic> mRNA may be critical for its biological function, since nucleotide sequences in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region, consisting entirely of a stable two-fold-sheet structure, are highly conserved to an unusual extent between humans and mice. This may suggest that the level of KF-1 protein synthesis is regulated strictly in a cell. Northern blot analysis indicates that the <italic>kf-1</italic> gene is expressed most prominently in the brain but more or less throughout the body, except in the liver (Yasojima et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1997</xref>). KF-1 mediates E2-dependent ubiquitination, and thus may play a role in modulating cellular protein levels as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Lorick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1999</xref>). Expression of the <italic>kf-1</italic> gene is also elevated in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, but not hypothalamus, of rats after chronic antidepressant treatments such as the administration of a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) (Yamada et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2000</xref>), electroconvulsive therapy (Nishioka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2003</xref>), and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (Kudo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2005</xref>). Concerning a possible link of the <italic>kf-1</italic> gene expression to other neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases, we are not aware of any reports appearing in the NIH databases (PubMed and GEO profiles). It is known that depression can be a heralding symptom or prodrome rather than a separate and distinct disorder for AD or dementia (for a review, see Katz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1998</xref>). In fact, it has been reported that depression can occur early in the course of AD in <italic>ps1</italic> mutation carriers unaware of their genetic status (Ringman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2004</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that KF-1 plays some role or roles in the regulation of mental disorders such as depression, which include anxiety and mood disorders as the core symptoms.</p><p>Anxiety is an instinct that may have been developed in vertebrates to promote adaptive survival by evasion of unnecessary danger. However, excessive anxiety is disadvantageous, because it reduces even behavioral activity that is necessary for adaptation. Thus, there must be underlying mechanisms that have developed as to appropriately regulate anxiety in response to environmental circumstances. For example, the amygdala is thought to be important in the expression of anxiety or fear, and the medial prefrontal cortex plays a key role for fear extinction by regulating amygdala-mediated expression of fear (for a review, see Bishop, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2007</xref>).</p><p>All the antidepressant drugs developed so far are based on the monoamine hypothesis, which assumes that the pathogenesis of depression could be caused by depletion of monoamines like serotonin in the brain, although some recent approaches to the treatment of depression try to move beyond this hypothesis (Norman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2006</xref>). Nevertheless, there is no convincing evidence of a primary dysfunction of a specific monoamine system in depression; on the contrary, monoamine depletion does not worsen depression in patients and does not cause depression in healthy volunteers. Testing systems to measure behavioral despair have been developed in rats/mice for screening antidepressant compounds. These model systems include the forced swim test and the tail suspension test, and compounds that elevate monoamine levels in the brain have been found to reduce the immobility time of animals under these conditions of fear and despair (Porsolt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1978</xref>; Steru et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1985</xref>). It is worth noting that in humans, approximately one-third of patients with depression do not respond to the drugs developed using these tests. To develop drugs to help patients who are unresponsive to currently available antidepressants, it is therefore desirable to have an animal model that mimics the core symptoms of depression, but that does not involve regulation of monoamine levels in the brain.</p><p>In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive behavioral test battery on the mice lacking KF-1 and found that <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed decreased stay time in and number of transitions to the light box in the light/dark transition test, decreased locomotor activity in the elevated plus maze test, and increased immediate freezing in the fear conditioning test, indicating overall increased anxiety-like behavior under stressful situations in these mutant mice. No significant cognitive abnormalities were found in the fear conditioning test and in the forced alternation test using the automatic T-maze. Based on the effect of KF-1 depletion on these anxiety-like behaviors, we propose that <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may suppress selectively anxiety under physiological conditions, and be useful for both investigating the molecular mechanisms of anxiety/depression and screening novel anxiolytic/antidepressant compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Targeting vector</title><p>Mouse <italic>kf-1</italic> genomic clones were isolated from a 129/Sv &#x003bb; Fix III genomic DNA library (Stratagene) using mouse <italic>kf-1</italic> cDNA as a hybridization probe.

One of the clones was expanded and microinjected into BDF1 blastocysts. Male chimeras derived from the clone were mated with C57BL/6N females.

The righting, whiskers touch, and ear twitch reflexes were evaluated, and a number of physical features including body weight and temperature, and the presence of whiskers or bald hair patches were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Neuromuscular examination</title><p>The neuromuscular strength was examined by the grip strength and wire-hanging tests. The grip strength meter (O'Hara &#x00026; Co.) was used to assess forelimb grip strength. Mice were lifted and held by their tail so that their forepaws could grasp a wire grid. Mice were then gently pulled backward by the tail with their posture parallel to the surface of the table until they released the grid. The peak force applied by mouse forelimbs was recorded in newtons (N). Each mouse was tested three times and the greatest value measured was used for statistical analysis. In the wire-hanging test, mice were placed on a wire mesh, which was then inverted and waved gently, so that the subject gripped the wire. Latency to fall was recorded, with a 60&#x02009;s cut-off time.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Light/dark transition test</title><p>The apparatus used for light/dark transition test consisted of a cage (21&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;42&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;25&#x02009;cm) divided into two sections of equal size by a partition with door (O'Hara &#x00026; Co., Tokyo). One chamber was brightly illuminated (390&#x02009;lx), whereas the other chamber was dark (2&#x02009;lx). Mice were placed into the dark side, and allowed to move freely between the two chambers with door open for 10&#x02009;min. The total number of transitions, time spent in each compartment, first latency to light side, and distance traveled were recorded automatically. On-line material describing this method is available visually (Takao and Miyakawa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Open field test</title><p>Locomotor activity was measured using the open field test.

Total distance traveled (centimeters), vertical activity (rearing measured by counting the number of photobeam interruptions), time spent in the center, the beam-break counts for stereotypic behaviors, and the number of fecal boli were recorded. Data were collected for 120&#x02009;min. Photo beams were positioned 1&#x02009;cm inside apart from walls at the edge of the open field. If any of these beams was not interrupted, mice were considered to be in the center area.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Elevated plus maze test</title><p>The elevated plus-maze consisted of two open arms (25&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5&#x02009;cm) and two enclosed arms of the same size, with 15&#x02009;cm high transparent walls. The arms and central square were made of white plastic plates, and were elevated to a height of 55&#x02009;cm above the floor. In order to minimize the likelihood of animals falling from the apparatus, 3-mm high plexiglas ledges were provided for the open arms. Arms of the same type were arranged at opposite sides to each other. Each mouse was placed in the central square of the maze (5&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5&#x02009;cm), facing one of the closed arms. Mouse behavior was recorded during a 10&#x02009;min test period. The number of entries into, and the time spent on open and enclosed arms were recorded. For data analysis, we employed the following four measures: the percentage of entries onto open arms, the stay time on open arms (seconds), the number of total entries, and total distance traveled (centimeters). Data acquisition and analysis were performed automatically, using Image EP software.</p></sec><sec><title>Hot plate test</title><p>The hot plate test was used to evaluate the nociception or the sensitivity to a painful stimulus. Mice were placed on a hot plate at 55.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.3&#x000b0;C (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA), and latency to the first hind-paw response was recorded.

Social behavior was monitored by a CCD camera, which was connected to a Macintosh computer. Analysis was performed automatically using Image SI software. Number of contacts, duration of contacts, and total distance traveled were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Rotarod test</title><p>Motor coordination and balance were tested with the rotarod test. We performed the rotarod test using an accelerating rotarod (UGO Basile Accelerating Rotarod) by placing a mouse on a rotating drum (3&#x02009;cm diameter) and measuring the time during which each animal was able to maintain its balance on the rod as latency time to fall (seconds). Speed of the rotarod was accelerated from 4 to 40&#x02009;rpm over a 5-min period.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Startle response/prepulse inhibition test</title><p>A startle reflex measurement system was used (O'Hara &#x00026; Co., Tokyo). A test session began by placing a mouse in a plexiglas cylinder where it was left undisturbed for 10&#x02009;min. The duration of white noise that was used as the startle stimulus was 40&#x02009;ms for all trial types. The startle response was recorded for 140&#x02009;ms (measuring the response every 1&#x02009;ms) starting with the onset of the prepulse stimulus. The background noise level in each chamber was 70&#x02009;dB. The peak startle amplitude recorded during the 140&#x02009;ms sampling window was used as the dependent variable. A test session consisted of six trial types [i.e., two types for &#x02018;startle-stimulus-only&#x02019; trials, and four types for prepulse inhibition (PPI) trials]. The intensity of startle stimulus was 110 or 120&#x02009;dB. The prepulse sound was presented 100&#x02009;ms before the startle stimulus, and its intensity was 74 or 78&#x02009;dB. Four combinations of prepulse and startle stimuli were employed (74&#x02013;110, 78&#x02013;110, 74&#x02013;120, and 78&#x02013;120&#x02009;dB). Six blocks of the six trial types were presented in pseudo-random order such that each trial type was presented once within a block. The average inter-trial interval was 15&#x02009;s (range: 10&#x02013;20&#x02009;s).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Porsolt forced swim test</title><p>The Porsolt forced swim test was done essentially as described previously (Miyakawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2001</xref>). The apparatus consisted of four plexiglas cylinders (20&#x02009;cm height&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x02009;cm diameter). The cylinders were filled with water at 23&#x000b0;C, up to a height of 7.5&#x02009;cm. Mice were placed into the cylinders, and their behavior was recorded over a 10-min test period (days 1 and 2). Data acquisition and analysis were performed automatically, using Image PS software (see Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s13">&#x02018;Image analysis&#x02019;</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>T-maze forced alternation task test</title><p>The forced alternation task test was conducted using an automatic T-maze (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It was constructed of white plastics runways with walls 25-cm high. The maze was partitioned off into six areas by sliding doors that can be opened downward. The stem of T was composed of area S2 (13&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;24&#x02009;cm) and the arms of T were composed of area A1 and A2 (11.5&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20.5&#x02009;cm). Area P1 and P2 were the connecting passage way from the arm (area A1 or A2) to the start compartment (area S1). The end of each arm was equipped with a pellet dispenser that could provide food reward. The pellet sensors were able to record automatically pellet intake by the mice. One week before the pre-training, mice were deprived of food until their body weight was reduced to 80&#x02013;85% of the initial level. Mice were kept on a maintenance diet throughout the course of all the T-maze experiments. Before the first trial, mice were subjected to three 10-min adaptation sessions, during which they were allowed to freely explore the T-maze with all doors open and both arms baited with food. On the day after the adaptation session, mice were subjected to a forced alternation protocol for 16 days (one session consisting of 10 trials per day; cutoff time, 50&#x02009;min). Mice were given 10 pairs of training trials per day. On the first (sample) trial of each pair, the mouse was forced to choose one of the arms of the T (area A1 or A2), and received the reward at the end of the arm. Choosing the incorrect arm resulted in no reward and confinement to the arm for 10&#x02009;s. After the mouse consumed the pellet or the mouse stayed &#x0003e;10&#x02009;s without consuming the pellet, the door that separated the arm (area A1 or A2) and connecting passage way (area P1 or P2) would be opened and the mouse could return to the starting compartment (area S1), via connecting passage way. The mouse was then given 3&#x02009;s delay there and a free choice between both T arms and rewarded for choosing the other arm that was not chosen on the first trial of the pair. The location of the sample arm (left or right) was varied pseudo-randomly across trials using Gellermann schedule so that mice received equal numbers of left and right presentations. A variety of fixed extra-maze cues surrounded the apparatus. On the 17th to 20th day, delay (10, 30, or 60&#x02009;s) was applied after the sample trial.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Apparatus of T-maze forced alternation task test</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnbeh-02-004-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Contextual and cued fear conditioning</title><p>Each mouse was placed in a test chamber (26&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;34&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;29&#x02009;cm) inside a sound-attenuated chamber (O'Hara &#x00026; Co., Tokyo) and allowed to explore freely for 2&#x02009;min. A 60&#x02009;dB white noise, which served as the conditioned stimulus (CS), was presented for 30&#x02009;s, followed by a mild (2&#x02009;s, 0.5&#x02009;mA) foot shock, which served as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Two more CS&#x02013;US pairings were presented with 2&#x02009;min inter-stimulus interval. To examine shock sensitivity, we measured distance traveled when the foot shock were delivered sensitivity (from 2&#x02009;s before the shock to 2&#x02009;s after the shock, total 6&#x02009;s). Context testing was conducted 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after conditioning in the same chamber. Cued testing with altered context was conducted 1 day after conditioning using a triangular box (35&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;35&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;40&#x02009;cm) made of white opaque plexiglas, which was located in a different room. Data acquisition, control of stimuli (i.e., tones and shocks), and data analysis were performed automatically, using Image FZ software. Images were captured at one frame per second. For each pair of successive frames, the amount of area (pixels) by which the mouse moved was measured. When this area was below a certain threshold (i.e., 20 pixels), the behavior was judged as &#x02018;freezing&#x02019;. When the amount of area equaled or exceeded the threshold, the behavior was considered as &#x02018;non-freezing&#x02019;. The optimal threshold (amount of pixels) to judge freezing was determined by adjusting it to the amount of freezing measured by human observation. &#x02018;Freezing&#x02019; that lasted less than the defined time threshold (i.e., 2&#x02009;s) was not included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Tail suspension test</title><p>The tail suspension test was performed for a 10-min test session according to the procedures described by Steru et al.

Subsequently, we analyzed the mouse <italic>kf-1</italic> gene using four independent mouse <italic>kf-1</italic> genomic clones covering an &#x0223c;30.3-kb genomic region (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Materials and Methods</xref>). The mouse <italic>kf-1</italic> gene lies within an &#x0223c;18&#x02009;kb segment containing four exons. Ex 4, which codes for the 522 C-terminal amino acids of the 683 amino acid KF-1 protein, was chosen as a target for deletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Ex 4 includes the coding sequences for the transmembrane regions, the ubiquitination site, and the zinc-binding RING-H2 finger domain. F1&#x02009;heterozygotes, <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup>, were obtained as described in Materials and Methods.

KF-1 was not detectable even in <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice using immunohistochemistry or Western blotting due to the low level of KF-1 protein synthesis and also due to KF-1 ubiquitination, although the anti-mKF-1 antibodies we used could detect mouse KF-1 that was exogenously expressed in COS cells. Similar to PS1 and PS2, immunostaining showed that exogenous mouse KF-1 protein was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and to Golgi bodies (data not shown). For the success of immunohistochemistry against native KF-1 protein, one might need monoclonal antibodies with higher and/or more specific affinity.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of the <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> genotype on somatic parameters and general behavior</title><p>KO mice lacking the <italic>kf-1</italic> gene appeared normal and healthy; there were no evident abnormalities in the physical aspects of <italic>kf-1</italic> KO mice, including reproductive capability.

By a factor analysis using our large set of data using &#x0003e;5,000 mice, we are aware that these two tests assesses different aspects of anxiety-like behavior, although there are significant correlations between indices in these tests (Yamasaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2006</xref>). There are also published data indicating that different anxiety tests measure different aspects of anxiety-like behaviors (Holmes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2003a</xref>; Ramos and Morm&#x000e8;de, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">1998</xref>; Turri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2001</xref>). One but not another assay could provide evidence of altered anxiety-like behavior. To distinguish different anxiety-related behavioral dimensions, <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice would have to be tested further by another anxiety-related behavioral tests including elevated plus maze with opaque walls, square maze, mirror chamber, and so on.</p><p>Considering the fact that the level of <italic>kf-1</italic> gene expression is augmented in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, but not in the hypothalamus, after chronic antidepressant treatments (Kudo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2005</xref>; Nishioka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2003</xref>; Yamada et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2000</xref>), these results suggest that <italic>kf-1</italic> gene may play a role(s) in the emotional regulation such as the suppression of anxiety or fear under stressful conditions. In this context, it is worth to note that roles of prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in modulating amygdala activity have been reported to be responsible for adaptive emotional regulation of context-specific retrieval of anxiety or fear extinction (Corcoran et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2005</xref>; Sotres-Bayon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2006</xref>). Therefore, our observations suggesting a possible &#x02018;antianxiety&#x02019;-like effect of KF-1 seem to be consistent with all these reports. Since KF-1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase to modulate cellular protein level (Lorick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1999</xref>), it appears to be crucial to identify what is (are) the target protein(s) degraded depending on KF-1 ubiquitination in the future studies. Cellular concentration of this putative target protein(s) may have played an important role during the vertebral evolution to determine the anxiety level to defy or evade potential dangers in various environmental circumstances.</p><p>The <italic>kf-1</italic> gene expression is up-regulated in the frontal cortex of rats treated by chronic SSRI administration (Yamada et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2000</xref>). It may be possible that the effect of KF-1 depletion on anxiety-like behavior could be associated with the dysregulation of serotonergic system in these mutant mice. Increased anxiety-like behavior has been reported in mice lacking serotonin-related genes. For example, mice (C57BL/6J) lacking the serotonin receptor gene (<italic>5-HT<sub>1A</sub></italic>) displayed increased &#x02018;anxiety&#x02019; levels in the open-field, elevated zero maze, and novel-object tests (Heisler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1998</xref>). Similarly, mice lacking the gene (<italic>5-HTT</italic>) for serotonin transporter were shown to have increased &#x02018;anxiety&#x02019;-like behavior in the light/dark transition, elevated plus maze, and open-field tests on the C57BL/6J background (Holmes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2003b</xref>). It has been pointed out that the absence of the <italic>5-HT<sub>1A</sub></italic> gene during the postnatal developmental period, but not in adult mice, affects anxiety-like behavior (Gross et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2002</xref>). It would be necessary, therefore, to determine in the future studies whether the behavioral abnormality of <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is caused by a developmental impairment by KF-1 depletion or its absence at adulthood.</p><p>Concerning the possible association of the <italic>kf-1</italic> gene with AD, no significant effects of genotype were observed on memory or cognitive function in the present studies (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited significantly increased PPI values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>), which are usually reduced in human schizophrenic patients (Geyer and Ellenbroek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2003</xref>). PPI deficit has been reported also in mouse models of schizophrenia (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2008</xref>; Clapcote et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2007</xref>; Miyakawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2003</xref>). Taking these reports into account, agents that can inhibit the expression or function of the <italic>kf-1</italic> gene, if any, could possibly ameliorate sensorimotor-gating deficits that are seen in patients of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Finally, it will be interesting to see whether or not the G/A transition in front of the initiation codon of the human <italic>kf-1</italic> gene influences the mRNA translation efficiency. In conclusion, the <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and cells derived thereof may be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanism of anxiety/depression, and furthermore, the <italic>kf-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may provide a useful tool for finding novel anxiolytic/antidepressant compounds, which may compensate KF-1 by antagonizing its target protein(s).</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank M.
