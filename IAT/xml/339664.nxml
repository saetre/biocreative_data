Comparisons have been made with the nucleotide sequences of the germ line BALB/c mu a and the plasmacytoma TEPC-183 mu a alleles reported elsewhere over the entire length of the coding and the 3' untranslated region. In contrast to the extensive differences between the gamma 2a a and b alleles we have reported earlier we see a very high degree of homology between the mu alleles. Only one of the nucleotide differences between C57BL/6 mu b and BALB/c mu a leads to an amino acid substitution. This single amino acid exchange must form the allotypic determinant of the mu b allele. A comparison of four different DNA sequences indicates that they are all distinct IgM alleles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0446.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2381"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0447.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2382"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0448.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2383"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0449.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2384"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0450.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2385"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0451.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2386"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0452.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2387"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0453.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2388"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0454.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2389"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
