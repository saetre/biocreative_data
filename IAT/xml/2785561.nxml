Friend of GATA1 (FOG1), a protein interaction partner of GATA1, is critical for GATA1 function in multiple contexts. Previous work has shown that FOG1 recruits two multi-protein complexes, the nucleosome remodeling domain (NuRD) complex and a C-terminal binding protein (CTBP)-containing complex, into association with GATA1 to mediate activation and repression of target genes. To elucidate mechanisms that might differentially regulate the association of FOG1, as well as GATA1, with these two complexes, we characterized a previously unrecognized translational isoform of FOG1. We found that an N-terminally truncated version of FOG1 is produced from an internal ATG and that this isoform, designated FOG1S, lacks the nucleosome remodeling domain-binding domain, altering the complexes with which it interacts. Both isoforms interact with the C-terminal binding protein complex, which we show also contains lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). FOG1S is preferentially excluded from the nucleus by unknown mechanisms. These data reveal two novel mechanisms for the regulation of GATA1 interaction with FOG1-dependent protein complexes through the production of two translational isoforms with differential interaction profiles and independent nuclear localization controls.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">HL32259</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">HL32262</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Erythropoietic and megakaryocytic programs are specified from multipotential progenitors by the transcription factor GATA1, a zinc finger transcription factor first identified by its ability to bind globin gene regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).

Plasmids for expression of untagged wild type or mutant FOG1 cDNA in 293T (pEF1&#x003b1;-V5his series) were purchased from Invitrogen. Wild type FOG1 cDNA was cloned into the pEF1&#x003b1; vector using EcoR1 from MT2-FOG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) to generate pEF1&#x003b1;-FOG1 (cDNA). To generate constructs containing wild type or N-terminal truncations of FOG1 with 5&#x02032;-UTR replacement, forward primers containing a 5&#x02032; BamHI site spanning the start codon of interest were used in conjunction with a common reverse primer to generate a BamHI/PflMI fragment, which was cloned into pEF1&#x003b1;-FOG1, replacing the wild type FOG1 N terminus and nascent 5&#x02032;-UTR. To generate constructs lacking the endogenous 3&#x02032;-UTR, an internal forward primer and a reverse primer spanning the stop codon with a 3&#x02032; engineered XbaI site were used to generate an Sbf1/XbaI fragment that was cloned into pEF1&#x003b1;-FOG1, replacing the wild type FOG1 C terminus and nascent 3&#x02032;-UTR. To generate constructs containing N-terminally FLAG-tagged FOG1L and FOG1S, forward primers containing a 5&#x02032; BamHI site spanning the start codon of interest were used in conjunction with a common reverse primer to generate a BamHI/PflMI fragment that was cloned into the pEF1&#x003b1;-FOG1 vector. A BamHI/XbaI fragment was then cloned into the FL-Bio vector to allow for generation of in-frame tagged FOG1. Mutant versions of FOG1 were generated from FOG1 cDNA or fragments thereof using the QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions.

Previous studies from our lab using Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) detected a single transcript from the FOG1 locus. To ascertain whether both FOG1 isoforms could be generated from a single transcript, we transiently expressed full-length cDNA in 293T cells under control of the pEF1&#x003b1; promoter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>, protein species corresponding to FOG1L and FOG1S, as seen in MEL cells, were also evident upon expression of a unique cDNA in heterologous cells. These data provide initial evidence on behalf of a translational mechanism for the generation of the two FOG1 isoforms.</p><p>In principle, other potential mechanisms might account for isoform generation. For example, alternate spliced transcripts of similar size might differ in exon utilization <italic>in vivo</italic>. To exclude this possibility we performed 5&#x02032;-rapid amplification of cDNA ends with RNA from MEL cells. We found no evidence for transcripts of different coding exon composition that could lead to an N-terminal truncation (data not shown). Interestingly, this contrasts with findings reported for FOG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In addition, a previous <italic>in silico</italic> study found no evidence for alternate first exon usage for FOG1 using human genome sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Furthermore, it is possible that FOG1S might be generated by proteolytic cleavage of full-length FOG1. However, upon treatment of MEL cells with cycloheximide to interrupt translation initiation and production of new FOG1 protein, we failed to observe an increased ratio of FOG1S, arguing against a proteolytic mechanism (data not shown). Finally, although FOG1 is heavily modified by post-translational modifications, these modifications do not play a role in the production of the two isoforms described here.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>5</sup></xref> Taking these data <italic>in toto</italic>, the generation of FOG1S appears to be mediated through a translational mechanism.</p><p>The canonical translation initiation sites for mouse and human FOG1 mRNA species are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>) and conform to a weak Kozak sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Both species have multiple alternate in-frame AUG codons of varying degrees of Kozak strength downstream of the predominant start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). The presence of multiple downstream AUGs may provide alternate sites of translation initiation. Full-length FOG1 migrates at an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa, despite a predicted molecular mass of 105 kDa. In the absence of a linear relationship between amino acid sequence and apparent molecular mass, it is difficult to predict which downstream AUG might account for FOG1S translation. We first attempted to map the second start site through the use of Edman degradation N-terminal sequencing of FOG1S, affinity-purified following expression of a FOG1 construct containing the native 5&#x02032;-UTR and start codon with a C-terminal V5 tag. However, because no useable sequence was recovered, it is likely that the N-terminal methionine is chemically blocked. Therefore, we generated N-terminal truncations corresponding to potential alternate start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>) and expressed each exogenously in 293T cells. Blotting of whole cell lysates with the A-20 antibody revealed that the product most closely corresponding to FOG1S was expressed from the second ATG (ATG2) and lacked only 17 amino acids from the N terminus. It is clear from the size of the protein produced from the fourth ATG (ATG4) that FOG1S must be generated from one of the previous two start codons (ATG2 or ATG3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). In support of this, only the first three ATGs are conserved in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). In addition, expression of a construct in which the canonical initiation codon was mutated to ACG, and therefore translation was presumably initiated at the next ATG (M2), produced a protein indistinguishable in size from FOG1S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Expression of FOG1 from a construct in which the second start codon was mutated produced FOG1L and a molecule migrating somewhat faster FOG1S, presumably starting at the next downstream ATG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>). Finally, we examined expression of FOG1 from constructs in which the second start codon, the third codon, or both were mutated to ACG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic>). Again, the construct containing mutation of the second ATG produced FOG1L and a band running slightly faster than FOG1S. Unfortunately, mutation of the third ATG alone was not interpretable because mutation of this amino acid results in a shift in the apparent molecular mass. Mutation of both the second and third ATG together results in production of a faint product running visibly faster than FOG1S. This protein product is consistent in size with initiation from the fourth ATG. These data from the double mutant provide strong evidence that FOG1S is derived from the second or third ATG, and the molecular mass shift of FOG1S in the absence of the second ATG is consistent with novel initiation from this position.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>FOG1S is translated from the second in-frame ATG.</bold><italic>A</italic>, table showing the first four in-frame ATGs from the mouse FOG1 ORF, along with Exon location, predicted molecular mass of the product, Kozak sequence and strength, and mouse and human conservation. <italic>B</italic>, vectors expressing the wild type FOG1 ORF (WT) or truncations of FOG1 starting from the second (ATG2), third (ATG3), or fourth (ATG4) internal ATG were transfected into 293T cells and Western blotted with &#x003b1;-FOG1 (A-20) antibody. <italic>C</italic>, vectors expressing wild type FOG1 (WT) or FOG1 mutated at the first ATG to ACG (ATG1M) were transfected into 293T cells and Western blotted with FOG1 (A-20) antibody. <italic>D</italic>, vectors expressing wild type FOG1 ORF (WT) or FOG1 mutated at the second ATG (ATG2M) were transfected into 293T cells and Western blotted with &#x003b1;-FOG1 (A-20) antibody. <italic>E</italic>, vectors expressing wild type FOG1 ORF (WT) or FOG1 mutated at the second ATG (ATG2M), third ATG (ATG3M), or both the second and third ATG (ATG2/3M) were transfected into 293T cells and Western blotted with &#x003b1;-FOG1 (A-20) antibody.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0440990920003"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Isoform Generation Is Regulated by Multiple Factors</title><p>Examination of published mRNA sequences of mouse (NM_009569) and human (NM_153813) FOG1 reveals the presence of a highly conserved 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). The 5&#x02032;-UTRs are relatively long (347 bp for the mouse and 323 bp for the human), have a high GC content (84.7% for the mouse and 93.7% for the human), and are predicted, using the mFOLD program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), to form complex secondary structures in cells (data not shown).

Expression of these constructs in 293T and subsequent Western blotting with antibody recognizing FOG1 (A-20) revealed that absence of the native 5&#x02032;-UTR results in slight alteration of the ratio of FOG1S and FOG1L, such that increased amounts of FOG1L are generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). We also found that replacement of the normal 3&#x02032;-UTR with a generic version did not appear to alter the ratio of FOG1L/FOG1S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>), and as expected, the construct containing generic versions of both the 5&#x02032;-UTR and 3&#x02032;-UTR behaved in a similar fashion to the construct with only the 5&#x02032;-UTR replaced. These results indicate that the 5&#x02032;-UTR contributes to the generation of FOG1S and is likely important for modulating its expression in cells. Because the canonical start codon does not conform to a strong Kozak consensus, we reasoned that this feature might be relevant to expression of FOG1S. To examine this possibility, we generated constructs in which we replaced the endogenous Kozak sequence (GGAGACATGTCC) with either a stronger (GGAGACATGgCC) or a weaker version (tGAtACATGTCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) in the context of the native cDNA structure. Expression of constructs containing WT or mutant cDNA (Skoz and WKoz) in 293T cells revealed that alteration of the Kozak sequence had the predicted effect, such that the stronger Kozak resulted in reduced amount of FOG1S, whereas the weakened Kozak led to relatively more FOG1S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). These data support a model consistent with the prevailing mechanistic understanding of translation and the generation of alternate translational isoforms in which FOG1S is produced from the second ATG via the ribosome scanning mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>FOG1 Isoforms Interact with Distinct Complexes</title><p>Full-length FOG1 interacts with members of the NuRD complex by coimmunoprecipitation in the MEL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> Consistent with this, we find that FOG1L, but not FOG1S, associates with MTA2, a core component of the NuRD complex, as revealed by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). FOG1L and FOG1S exhibit overlapping, but distinct, size distributions. These data imply that the two isoforms of FOG1 are found in different multiprotein complexes. Interestingly, CTBP1 and 2 proteins, which are known to interact with FOG1(12&#x02013;14), do not overlap with MTA2, perhaps implying temporally or spatially exclusive interaction of FOG1 with either one or the other of these two complexes. Additionally, FOG1L and FOG1S, as well as GATA1, are present in size fractions containing CTBPs.

First, FLAG-tagged versions of the FOG1 isoforms, as well as GATA1, were coexpressed in 293T cells. Upon immunoprecipitation with anti-FOG1 antibody, we recovered similar amounts of FOG1L and FOG1S protein, as revealed by FLAG antibody. These tagged versions of the isoforms only differ in sequence by 18 amino acids. For these technical reasons, we were not able to achieve adequate separation of tagged FOG1 isoforms. To demonstrate loss of the N-terminal NuRD-binding domain in the tagged FOG1S, we then blotted with the FOG1 antibody specific for the N terminus (M-20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). Consistent with localization of the NuRD-binding domain to the N-terminal domain of FOG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), we found that FOG1S failed to coimmunoprecipitate metastasis-associated 1 family, member 2, MTA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>) or another component of the NuRD Complex, p66 (data not shown). To visualize endogenous MTA2, we needed to overload lanes to achieve adequate MTA2 signal, leading to background in this instance. In contrast to the loss of MTA2 binding, we observed that similar amounts of GATA1 were coimmunoprecipitated by FOG1L and FOG1S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). These results demonstrate that FOG1S does not interact with the NuRD complex, whereas it maintains the capacity to interact with GATA1.</p></sec><sec><title>FOG1 Interacts with LSD1 through the CTBP Complex</title><p>We previously generated a MEL cell clone stably expressing <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> BirA biotin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Upon coexpression of cDNA bearing the target sequence, the resulting protein will be subjected to <italic>in vivo</italic> biotinylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We performed mass spectrometry on samples immunoprecipitated from MEL clones expressing tagged FOG1L and identified peptides from NuRD complex proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>) but found no evidence of CTBP family members or their interacting proteins (except HDAC1, which is common to both complexes). We used a tagged version of FOG1, N67, which lacks the first 67 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), to interrogate FOG1 interaction partners in the absence of NuRD binding. Truncated FOG1 no longer recovers peptides from the NuRD complex and instead displays robust capture of peptides from CTBP1 and CTBP2. In addition, peptides from HDAC1 and LSD1 were recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). Interaction of FOG1 with CTBP family members has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, CTBP proteins interact with molecules comprising a number of distinct complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The molecular nature of the CTBP complex associated with FOG1 has not heretofore been elucidated. To confirm these mass spectrometry results, we performed immunoprecipitation on MEL cells expressing the tagged FOG1L (FOG1L) or the parental cell line (MEL) using &#x003b1;-FLAG antibodies. We found that FOG1 and LSD1 are coimmunoprecipitated from the tagged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). Interestingly, we did not recover peptides derived from CoREST, which has previously been shown to be required for LSD1 demethylase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). To determine whether CoREST is able to associate with FOG1, we coexpressed HA-tagged FOG1, V5-tagged LSD1, and FLAG-tagged CoREST in 293T cells (which express low levels of endogenous CTBP1 and CTBP2) and performed immunoprecipitation with &#x003b1;-FOG1 antibody or normal goat Ig. Again, we found that FOG1L efficiently pulls down LSD1, indicating a robust interaction with this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). FOG1 is able to coimmunoprecipitate CoREST as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>), demonstrating that FOG1 can interact with all of the necessary components for K4 histone demethylation. When we repeated the above experiment using FOG1L and FOG1S, we found that both isoforms efficiently coimmunoprecipitate LSD1 and CTBP1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>). These findings contrast with our mass spectrometric results, in which FOG1L did not recover peptides for CTBP complex components. However, because the interaction of FOG1 with CTBP family members has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), we can only conclude that issues specific to the tandem purification coupled with mass spectrometric analysis are responsible. Mass spectrometric analysis allows for identification of proteins represented by the most abundant peptides. Our unpublished data have demonstrated a remarkably robust interaction between FOG1 and the NuRD complex, refractory to stringent wash conditions and long incubation times. The interaction with CTBP is not as robust. In support of this conclusion, when less stringent single step affinity purification protocols were used, members of the CTBP complex were recovered by FOG1L. Second, there may be some mutual exclusivity of the two interactions (see gel filtration data). Both of these factors would be expected to favor the recovery and identification of the more tightly bound complex in the context of immunoprecipitation with full-length FOG1.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>FOG1 interacts with LSD1-containing CTBP complex.</bold><italic>A</italic>, table showing number of peptides recovered by tandem affinity purification using FLAG-Bio-tagged WT or N-truncated (N67) FOG1. <italic>B</italic>, coimmunoprecipitation (<italic>IP</italic>) of endogenous LSD1 from MEL cells expressing FLAG-Bio-Tagged FOG1 immunoprecipitated using &#x003b1;-FLAG-agarose. <italic>C</italic>, coimmunoprecipitation of LSD1 and CoREST by FOG1 using antibody directed to FOG1 or normal goat Ig, after cotransfection of 293Ts with constructs expressing HA-tagged FOG1, V5-tagged LSD1, and FLAG-tagged CoREST. <italic>D</italic>, constructs containing either FOG1L or FOG1S with an N-terminal FLAG-Bio tagged FOG1 were cotransfected with constructs expressing V5-tagged LSD1, FLAG-tagged CTBP1, and FLAG-tagged CTBP2.

Unexpectedly, immunoprecipitation with &#x003b1;-FOG1 antibody revealed that FOG1L bound TACC3 robustly enough to allow for coimmunoprecipitation, whereas FOG1S did not (data not shown).

Using antibody based mapping, we determined that FOG1S lacks the extreme N terminus. FOG1S can be generated along with FOG1L upon expression of full-length cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) in a heterologous cell line. These data imply that formation of FOG1S is not due to alternative RNA processing, a conclusion consistent with 5&#x02032;-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments. Furthermore, cycloheximide experiments in MEL cells provide evidence that FOG1S is not a cleavage product of FOG1L, because the ratio of the isoforms does not change after translation is blocked. Together, these data indicate that FOG1S is created by alternate translation of the canonical transcript from a downstream, internal initiator codon, most likely through use of the next downstream ATG.</p><p>Translationally mediated generation of FOG1S appears to differ from the manner in which a similar variant of full-length FOG2 is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Production of FOG1S is regulated by the 5&#x02032;-UTR and the Kozak sequence, probably through modulation of ribosome scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, it is unclear what cellular cues, if any, may be involved in generating different ratios of the two translation products or whether maintaining a consistent ratio is biologically important.</p><p>As anticipated, FOG1S is unable to bind components of the NuRD complex. The N-terminal domain of FOG proteins bears a highly conserved NuRD-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The NuRD complex is most often associated with repression, although instances in which it potentiates activation have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). However, FOG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and FOG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), mutated to abrogate NuRD binding, show decreased GATA-mediated repression in transient reporter assays. Additionally NuRD is present, along with FOG1 and GATA1, at repressed genes in erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), indicating that NuRD functions largely in repression of GATA1-dependent genes. Recent data indicate that mice expressing only an N-terminally truncated form of FOG1 display perturbed erythroid development, specifically demonstrating defects in repression of select GATA1-target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). These data show that the ability of FOG to repress genes is not wholly explained by NuRD binding and that the FOG1-NuRD interaction is dispensable for FOG1-dependent activation of erythroid target genes. These, and our own, data lead to speculation that FOG1L may be required for regulation of specific genes in a NuRD-dependent fashion, whereas FOG1S may be involved in the regulation of a subset of genes through a NuRD-independent mechanism. This model would suggest that other FOG1 interaction partners play a role in this regulation or that FOG1 is able to mediate regulation itself in the absence of NuRD recruitment.</p><p>Previously, our lab demonstrated that mice in which the canonical CTBP-binding motif of FOG1 was mutated exhibited normal erythroid development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This result was unanticipated. Our recent data, however, indicate that this mutant version of FOG1 possesses residual CTBP binding activity, most likely through a noncanonical CTBP-binding motif.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>5</sup></xref> Thus, reassessment of the involvement of CTBP in FOG1-dependent activities is warranted. Here, we have shown that, although FOG1L is able to interact with CTBP, it may bind the CTBP and NuRD complexes in a mutually exclusive fashion. Furthermore, utilizing a tagged N-terminal truncation of FOG1, we found that only in the absence of NuRD binding were peptides of the CTBP complex recovered, an observation that provides preliminary evidence of exclusive binding to these distinct repressive complexes. Additionally, LSD1 peptides are recovered with CTBP proteins by purification of an N-terminally truncated FOG1 (N67). We confirmed this interaction by immunoprecipitation with FOG1L, which elucidates the molecular identity of the CTBP complex that associates with FOG1 in erythroid cells. CTBP family members have been shown to interact with a number of molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) that may comprise distinct functional complexes. LSD1 is already known to play an important role in the biology of erythroid development as an interaction partner of Gf11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). LSD1 can act as a repressor or an activator of transcription in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). To understand what functional consequences the interaction between FOG1 and LSD1 may have on erythroid gene expression, it will be important to characterize the molecular components that are brought into association with GATA1 through the interaction of FOG1 and CTBP at specific gene loci.</p><p>Translational regulation of protein expression affects other hematopoietic transcription factors, including T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (SCL/TAL) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), &#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In these cases, translationally generated isoforms exhibit biochemical and functional properties distinct from those of the canonical protein. Such appears to the case for FOG1 also, because FOG1L and FOG1S display different capacities to bind the NuRD complex and are regulated differentially with respect to their cellular localization. Translational regulation also allows for an additional level of control that is sensitive to the translational status of the cell. This status can serve as a finely tuned sensor for multiple cellular cues, such as cell cycle stage, nutrient deprivation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Erythroid differentiation is characterized by a number of cellular changes that impact stress pathways that alter translation, including oxidative stress associated with hemoglobin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), and energetic stresses as mitochondria are removed through autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) during terminal differentiation. These extrinsic and intrinsic cues may result in differential production of the two isoforms. These data lead to conjecture that favoring translation of FOG1L or FOG1S might allow for regulation of erythroid gene expression that is carefully linked to the cell state.</p><p>The cellular localization of FOG1L and FOG1S also appears to be regulated, such that, in erythroid cells, FOG1L predominates in the nucleus, whereas the FOG1L and FOG1S are present equally in the cytoplasm. We show that TACC3, previously shown to be able to sequester FOG1 in the cytoplasm, is not responsible for this differential localization. We hypothesize that other molecules are involved in retaining FOG1S preferentially in the cytoplasm in erythroid cells. Further work is needed to test this speculation. Utilization of nuclear import and export pathways to regulate transcriptional regulators is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) and has been shown for at least one erythroid-specific factor, Kruppel-like factor 1 (erythroid) (KLF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Although we have been unable to determine the mechanism through which FOG1S is selectively retained in the cytoplasm, it may be that cellular stimuli are also involved in regulation of this process. In addition, it is also possible that maintaining equivalent amounts of FOG1L and FOG1S in the cytoplasm is biologically important, although no cytoplasmic role for either FOG1 isoform has been demonstrated.</p><p>Hence, we propose a model in which FOG1 isoforms are produced in a specific ratio, regulated by cues acting upon cellular translation machinery. Further control of the nuclear ratio of FOG1L and FOG1S may allow for adaptive adjustment of the relative amounts of biologically distinct GATA1-interacting proteins and hence the fine-tuning of gene expression during erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grants HL32259 and HL32262 (to S.
