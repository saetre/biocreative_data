Here we demonstrate that the protein is membrane-associated in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and present the crystal structure of the soluble part of the protein lacking its membrane anchor. This reveals that BdbD is similar in structure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> DsbA, with a thioredoxin-like domain with an inserted helical domain. A major difference, however, is the presence in BdbD of a metal site, fully occupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, at an inter-domain position some 14 &#x0212b; away from the C<italic>XX</italic>C active site. The midpoint reduction potential of soluble BdbD was determined as &#x02212;75 mV <italic>versus</italic> normal hydrogen electrode, and the active site N-terminal cysteine thiol was shown to have a low p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic>, consistent with BdbD being an oxidizing TDOR. Equilibrium unfolding studies revealed that the oxidizing power of the protein is based on the instability introduced by the disulfide bond in the oxidized form. The crystal structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted BdbD showed that the protein remained folded, with only minor conformational changes. However, the reduced form of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted BdbD was significantly less stable than reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing protein, and the midpoint reduction potential was shifted by approximately &#x02212;20 mV, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> functions to boost the oxidizing power of the protein. Finally, we demonstrate that electron exchange does not occur between BdbD and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ResA, a low potential extra-cytoplasmic TDOR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Disulfide bonds, formed upon oxidation of two cysteine residue side chain thiols, are key for the stability and/or function of many secreted and membrane-bound peptides and proteins in bacteria, and the failure to insert these correctly has wide ranging effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). To regulate the redox state of cysteine residues on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, intricate disulfide bond regulatory systems have evolved. These involve enzymes of the thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase (TDOR)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> family, which contain cysteine residues often arranged in a Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys thioredoxin motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These enzymes function in pathways that lead to the formation of disulfide bonds, rearrangement of incorrectly positioned disulfide bonds, or the removal of unwanted disulfide bonds, and the redox properties of the enzymes appear to correlate closely with function.</p><p>The paradigm system for disulfide bond formation is the DsbA-DsbB system of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>, which has been characterized in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). DsbA is a soluble periplasmic TDOR, which has a thioredoxin-like fold with an additional helical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The protein oxidizes the di-thiol motifs of a range of substrates, generating in each a disulfide bond. Reduced DsbA is rapidly re-oxidized by DsbB, a membrane-bound TDOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) that channels the resulting electrons into the membrane quinol pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Dsb-like homologues appear to be extremely widespread in Gram-negative bacteria.</p><p>Gram-positive bacteria, unlike Gram-negatives, do not have an outer membrane and so have no spatially defined periplasmic compartment. This places different functional and structural demands on extra-cytoplasmic proteins, and one consequence of this is that extra-cytoplasmic TDORs are generally membrane-anchored in Gram-positive bacteria. Systems for the introduction of disulfide bonds appear to be variable in these organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). As an example, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> does not contain close homologues of DsbA/B but contains another thioredoxin-like TDOR, DsbE, which has been shown to have redox properties similar to those of DsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Some Gram-positive bacteria, including <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, contain a DsbA homologue but no homologue of DsbB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The recent structural and biochemical characterization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> DsbA revealed major similarities with the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> protein but was also consistent with a distinct mechanism of re-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Some Gram-positive bacteria, however, contain clear homologues of both DsbA and DsbB. In the model organism <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, BdbD and BdbC/BdbB have been identified as homologues of DsbA and DsbB, respectively, and demonstrated to be involved in processes such as natural competence development, which requires the insertion of disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). BdbD and BdbC are also involved in a number of other pathways that do not require the insertion of a disulfide bond; <italic>B. subtilis</italic> contains several extra-cytoplasmic TDORs, for example ResA and StoA (required for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> maturation and endospore biogenesis, respectively), which function to specifically reduce disulfide bonds introduced by BdbD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). To understand disulfide bond management systems in Gram-positive bacteria, detailed information on each of the different systems found is required.</p><p>Here we present the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> BdbD in both reduced and oxidized states. The structure is broadly similar to that of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> DsbA, but it also reveals the presence of a novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site remote from the C<italic>XX</italic>C active site. Using two-dimensional NMR methods and fluorescence kinetic studies of thiolate alkylation, we report the reduction potential and p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> properties of the soluble protein, which are entirely consistent with an oxidizing function for the protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. Conformational stability studies and NMR studies showed that the occupancy of the metal site by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is not required for folding/stability but leads to a significant increase of the midpoint reduction potential. The possibility that the principal function of the metal site is to boost the oxidizing power of the protein is discussed.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Bacterial Strains and Plasmids</title><p><italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains 1A1 (<italic>trpC2</italic>) and LUL10 (<italic>trpC2 bdbD</italic>&#x003a9;<italic>Tn10</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) were used for preparation of extracts for immunoblot analysis. <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> TOP10 (F<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>mcrA</italic> &#x00394;[<italic>mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC</italic>] <italic>F80lacZ</italic>&#x00394;<italic>M15</italic> &#x00394;<italic>lacX74 recA1 araD139</italic> &#x00394;[<italic>ara-leu</italic>]<italic>7697 galU galK rpsL endA1 nupG</italic>) (Invitrogen) and B834(DE3) (F<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>ompT hsdS<sub>B</sub></italic>(<italic>r<sub>B</sub></italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>m<sub>B</sub></italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) <italic>gal dcm met</italic> (DE3)) (Novagen) containing pLLE34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) or pACN2 was used for production of sBdbD. pACN2 was constructed by PCR amplifying part of the <italic>bdbD</italic> gene using <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 1A1 genomic DNA as template and two primers (forward, 5&#x02032;-A <underline>CAT</underline><underline>ATG</underline> AAT AAC AAA ACG GAA CAA GGC 3&#x02032;; reverse, 5&#x02032; <underline>CTC</underline><underline>GAG</underline> CTT CCC TTT CAG CTC TTT TTC 3&#x02032;; engineered NdeI and XhoI restriction sites are underlined).

The fold of BdbD is clearly related to the DsbA family of TDORs, for which a number of proteins have been structurally characterized. Like all DsbA-like proteins, BdbD is composed of two domains, a classical thioredoxin-like domain and an &#x003b1;-helical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A, green</italic> and <italic>teal</italic>, respectively). The thioredoxin-like domain consists of residues 59&#x02013;103 (forming the &#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2; component of the fold) and 182&#x02013;222 (forming the &#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1; component of the fold). The helical domain consists of residues 104&#x02013;181 that form five &#x003b1;-helices, the fifth of which is as an extension of the first helix of the thioredoxin &#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1; fold, therefore providing a structurally defined connection between the two domains. Preceding the &#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2; component of the thioredoxin fold at the N terminus is an additional &#x003b2;-strand, which forms a &#x003b2;-sheet with the other &#x003b2;-strands of the thioredoxin fold.

For example, BdbD possesses a loop between helices &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;4 of the all-helical domain that is considerably longer than the equivalent loop observed in EcDsbA and also lacks the hydrophobic groove observed on the surface of EcDsbA, which was recently shown to be important for interaction of DsbA with DsbB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). BdbD can be superposed with SaDsbA and EcDsbA with root mean square deviation values of 2.5 and 3.1 &#x0212b;, respectively. Despite the overall similarities, two features clearly distinguish BdbD from all previously characterized DsbA proteins. First, and most strikingly, BdbD contains a unique metal site located between the helical domain and the central &#x003b2;-sheet of the thioredoxin-like domain. Second, the &#x003b2;-sheet at the center of the thioredoxin-like domain has a different topology to that of previously characterized DsbA proteins. In BdbD, four of the five &#x003b2;-strands that make up the central &#x003b2;-sheet are structurally equivalent to those of the DsbA family of proteins (<italic>i.e.</italic> strands &#x003b2;2, &#x003b2;3, &#x003b2;4, and &#x003b2;5), but the location of the fifth strand in sBdbD is topologically distinct from its location in DsbA, despite the fact that the strand is located at the same position in the primary sequence of both proteins (<italic>i.e.</italic> the strand is &#x003b2;1 in both DsbA and BdbD). In BdbD, strand &#x003b2;1 runs anti-parallel to strand &#x003b2;3 (the strand preceding the helical domain), whereas in DsbA, strand &#x003b2;1 runs anti-parallel to strand &#x003b2;5 (the strand that precedes the final helix). Thus, in BdbD, strand &#x003b2;1 is the closest &#x003b2;-strand to the all-helical domain, although in previously characterized DsbA proteins strand &#x003b2;1 is the most distant from the helical domain. The topological differences between DsbA and BdbD have two important structural consequences. First, the repositioning of strand &#x003b2;1 means that the packing between the all-helical and thioredoxin domains is much denser in BdbD than in other DsbA proteins. This means that domain motions of the type previously observed for EcDsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) are unlikely to occur in BdbD because strand &#x003b2;1 occupies the void that permits hinge movements between the domains in DsbA. Second, the close approach of strand &#x003b2;1 and the helical domain forms an important structural backbone to the metal-binding site that is observed exclusively in BdbD (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Structural Features of the BdbD Active Site</title><p>The active site thioredoxin-like C<italic>XX</italic>C motif of BdbD is located at the N terminus of a long helix (&#x003b1;1) and has the sequence Cys<sup>69</sup>&#x02013;Pro<sup>70</sup>&#x02013;Ser<sup>71</sup>&#x02013;Cys<sup>72</sup>.

In contrast, the oxidized structure showed continuous electron density between the sulfur atoms of Cys<sup>69</sup> and Cys<sup>72</sup> demonstrating the formation of a disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.005785/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>B</italic></ext-link>). Although crystallized as a fully oxidized sample, refinement of a disulfide bond in the oxidized structure did show some residual electron density indicating a small fraction of sBdbD was in the reduced state, probably due to a degree of photo-reduction in the x-ray beam. We thus refined the &#x0201c;oxidized&#x0201d; structure as a mixture of oxidized (70%) and reduced states (30%), with the active site dominated by the oxidized form (a more completely oxidized disulfide structure was obtained for a sample treated with EDTA, see below and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.005785/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>C</italic></ext-link>). The structural data show that there are very few redox-linked conformational changes between the oxidized and reduced forms of the protein, such that superposition of oxidized and reduced BdbD gave a root mean square deviation of 0.268 &#x0212b; (calculated for all atoms of residues 37&#x02013;221).</p></sec><sec><title>Thiolate Form of Cys<sup>69</sup> Is Significantly Stabilized Relative to the Thiol Form</title><p>The reduction potentials of thioredoxin-like TDORs are intimately linked with the p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values of their active site cysteines: in general, the more extensive the stabilization of the thiolate form of the active site cysteines, the lower their corresponding p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> value and the higher the active site reduction potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Furthermore, within the thioredoxin-like family of TDORs, it is the N-terminal active site cysteine that exhibits the greatest variation and is thus likely to be the key determinant of reduction potential. In the structure of reduced sBdbD, the Cys<sup>69</sup> sulfur atom is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone amide groups of both Ser<sup>71</sup> (3.4 &#x0212b;) and Cys<sup>72</sup> (3.2 &#x0212b;) as well as to the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr<sup>192</sup>. The extensive hydrogen bonding network around the Cys<sup>69</sup> sulfur is clearly an important factor in maintaining a low cysteine p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> for Cys<sup>69</sup> and is therefore likely to be a key structural determinant of the reduction potential of the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural Implications for the Interaction of BdbD with Substrates</title><p>The loop region directly opposite the active site (composed of Thr<sup>192</sup> and <italic>cis</italic>-Pro<sup>193</sup>) is very likely to be involved in the interaction of BdbD with its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). This <italic>cis</italic>-proline residue is conserved among all known thioredoxin-like proteins and is likely to be important in presenting the carboxyl oxygen of the preceding residue for hydrogen bond interactions with substrate cysteine residues as observed in various TDOR-substrate complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Substitution of the DsbA equivalent of BdbD Pro<sup>193</sup> has been shown previously to lead to an accumulation of covalent DsbA complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Furthermore, the crystal structure of EcDsbA in a covalent complex with DsbB has shown that this loop is important in mediating contacts between DsbA and DsbB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). We propose that similar interactions are likely to be important for the interaction of BdbD with its substrates. However, we note that although BdbC is clearly a homologue of DsbB, the manner by which BdbD is re-oxidized by BdbC cannot be the same as for DsbA/DsbB, because BdbC lacks the external loop domain with which DsbA interacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Furthermore, as noted above, the peptide-binding groove identified in EcDsbA (which appears to interact with a well defined portion of DsbB) does not exist in the structure of BdbD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Indeed, the electrostatic surface view of BdbD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>) shows that little of the surface shape or the electrostatic properties are conserved between BdbD and DsbA-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Glu<sup>63</sup></title><p>Our structures show that Glu<sup>63</sup> is buried in a position very close to the Cys<sup>72</sup> sulfur atom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). Buried polar or charged residues, which destabilize folding, are usually functionally important, and in support of this, a negative charge at the equivalent position of Glu<sup>63</sup> is highly conserved among BdbD and DsbA homologues although, interestingly, it is not present in SaDsbA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). The role of Glu<sup>63</sup> is not yet clear, but one possibility is that Glu<sup>63</sup> acts as a general acid/base during the mechanism of disulfide exchange. Asp<sup>26</sup> in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> thioredoxin, which is located spatially in a similar position to Glu<sup>63</sup> of BdbD, was proposed to act in just such a way during interaction with its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). We note that buried glutamate residues also occur in ResA (Glu<sup>80</sup>) and StoA (Glu<sup>71</sup>) which, like BdbD, are extra-cytoplasmic membrane-bound TDORs from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). The buried glutamates of StoA and ResA are not in equivalent positions to Glu<sup>63</sup> in terms of primary sequence, but the location of the negative charge close to the C-terminal active site cysteine is similar in all of these TDORs. Furthermore, these glutamate residues of ResA and StoA have both been confirmed as mechanistically important through the investigation of Glu-to-Gln mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>BdbD Contains a Ca<sup>2+</sup> Ion in a Capped Octahedral Geometry</title><p>The metal ion site located between the thioredoxin and helical domains is 14 &#x0212b; from the nearest active site cysteine sulfur and is coordinated by three protein residues as follows: Gln<sup>49</sup>, Glu<sup>115</sup>, and Asp<sup>180</sup>. In addition to these three residues, the central ion also forms coordinate bonds with three low <italic>b</italic>-factor solvent molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). The metal therefore has a total of seven ligands (the carboxylate group of Asp<sup>180</sup> is bidentate) arranged with a capped octahedral geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). We identified the metal as Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the basis of several lines of evidence. First, ICP-AE spectroscopy of purified sBdbD demonstrated the presence of 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> (and no other metal ions) per protein. Second, only Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> refined well against the x-ray data. Smaller candidate ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> refined to unrealistically low <italic>b</italic>-factors and gave positive peaks in difference maps (|<italic>F<sub>o</sub></italic>| &#x02212; |F<italic><sub>c</sub></italic>|), suggesting they are not electron dense enough to fit the observed data. Larger ions such as Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Fe<sup>2+</sup> also refined poorly, with strong negative density in difference maps suggestive of a smaller metal or a partial occupancy. The latter possibility can be ruled out because the anomalous scattering of the metal site (at a wavelength of 0.9798 &#x0212b;) was very small; a low occupancy of Zn<sup>2+</sup> (or another transition metal) would be expected to give much stronger anomalous scattering. Third, the metal-to-water bond lengths derived from the high resolution structure of sBdbD (2.37, 2.40, and 2.56 &#x0212b;) are consistent with those of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (typically 2.40 &#x0212b;) but not of K<sup>+</sup> (typically 2.82 &#x0212b;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site of BdbD.</bold><italic>A</italic>, detailed view (contoured at 1.2 &#x003c3;) of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site of sBdbD, showing monodentate ligands Gln<sup>49</sup> and Glu<sup>115</sup>, bidentate Asp<sup>180</sup>, and three crystallographically ordered water molecules. <italic>B</italic>, an ideal capped octahedral site for comparison with that observed in BdbD.

Furthermore, many of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites have pentagonal bipyramidal geometry, with the capped octahedral geometry observed here being much less common.</p><p>This is the first example of a TDOR that contains a metal ion binding site remote from the C<italic>XX</italic>C active site, raising the question of what the functional significance of the metal site is. Multiple sequence alignments of BdbD/DsbA proteins show that the three residues involved in coordinating the metal site are strictly conserved among all <italic>Bacillus</italic> species, but not in Gram-negative bacteria nor in other Gram-positive organisms such as <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). This suggests that the site is likely to be relevant to the function of BdbD. A second question raised by the structure is whether or not Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the native metal ion in <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> The protein was heterologously produced in the cytoplasm of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells, and it is possible that Ca<sup>2+</sup> was the only ion available in sufficient quantities to fill the site in the absence of an alternative. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in bacterial cells, as in eukaryotic cells, are tightly regulated and are estimated to be between 100 and 300 n<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not normally found at sites usually occupied by other metal ions. Furthermore, we can rule out that Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added during or after purification as it was not used at any stage during the purification or as a component in the crystallization buffer. Therefore, the data indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the natural metal ion in BdbD.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is extremely important for a range of processes in eukaryotic cells. Its role in bacterial cells is much less clear, but there are a number of examples of bacterial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins, which are proposed to be involved in a range of processes, including the maintenance of cell structure and motility, and in cell differentiation processes such as sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Many of these are related to eukaryotic EF-hand proteins that contain a conserved helix-loop-helix structural motif in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> is coordinated by the side chains of three residues from the loop, a backbone atom from another loop residue, a water molecule, and the side chain of an acidic residue in the second helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). The structures of several bacterial EF-hand-like proteins have been determined, revealing that although they share the conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motif D<italic>X</italic>(D/N)<italic>X</italic>DG within the central loop of the EF-hand domain, they exhibit significant diversity in the structural elements surrounding the motif. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also found in other types of bacterial proteins, including those belonging to the RTX family of bacterial cytolysins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) that are normally secreted, which includes toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) and lipases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), as well as a lectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>) and a collagenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), which both contain unusual binuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites. In all of these structures, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is bound in a loop that provides the majority of the ligands, and therefore all are distinct from the site described here in sBdbD, in which the three residue side chains acting as ligands are derived from three different parts of the primary sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). A greater degree of similarity is observed for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites of peroxidases and, in particular, the di-heme cytochrome <italic>c</italic> peroxidase, in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> is coordinated by three residues and four water molecules and lies at the interface between the two domains of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> Site Is Not Required for Folding of BdbD</title><p>To investigate the importance of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> site for the structure of sBdbD, the crystal structure of a metal chelator-treated sample was solved in both oxidized and reduced states (data collection and refinement statistics are given in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.005785/DC1">supplemental Table S1</ext-link>). The sample used for crystallization contained &#x0003c;10% Ca<sup>2+</sup> according to metal analysis, and the chelator, EDTA, was maintained at 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> in all crystallization conditions and cryo-protectants used during preparation of the crystals. Despite this, some residual electron density was present within the metal site of both the oxidized and reduced EDTA-treated sBdbD structures, although this was substantially less than in the as-isolated sBdbD structures. Overall structures of reduced and oxidized chelator-treated sBdbD were very similar to those of the as-isolated protein (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.005785/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>). There were several minor changes to the local structure of residues at the site, including Glu<sup>115</sup>, which adopted multiple distinct side chain conformations consistent with heterogeneity at the site. Furthermore, there was essentially no anomalous scattering at the position of the metal. Best fits to the data were obtained using either a low occupancy Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion or a full occupancy Na<sup>+</sup> ion. Given that EDTA-treated sBdbD contained some Ca<sup>2+</sup>, at least some of the observed intensity must arise from Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupation, but it is possible that Na<sup>+</sup> replaces Ca<sup>2+</sup> in some BdbD molecules. We note that other metals (such as K<sup>+</sup>) can be ruled out on the basis of the metal-to-water coordination distances that are consistent with occupation by Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although it has not yet been possible to completely remove all traces of metal(s) from the observed site, it is nonetheless clear that occupation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> is drastically reduced in the EDTA-treated structures. This indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not required to maintain the native three-dimensional fold of the protein.</p><p>Two-dimensional NMR methods were also used to investigate conformational changes upon removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum of reduced <sup>15</sup>N-labeled sBdbD was recorded before and after treatment with EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). A significant proportion of resonances was observed to have shifted upon depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, indicating that the presence of the ion does have structural consequences in solution. Similar results were obtained for the oxidized form of the protein (data not shown). In light of the crystal structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted sBdbD, we conclude that these changes must be subtle (for example, similar to those caused by an oxidation state change, which do not cause major structural rearrangement but result in shifts in many resonance positions (see below)). Titration of EDTA-treated sBdbD with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions resulted in a <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum identical to that recorded for the native protein (data not shown), whereas titration with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions resulted in an HSQC spectrum distinct from those of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted sBdbD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). These data indicate that the structural effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are specific to this metal ion.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Structural effects of metal binding to BdbD monitored by NMR.</bold><sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra of reduced sBdbD (200 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) in 50 m<sc>m</sc> potassium phosphate, pH 7.0.

BdbD lacks the near-active site tryptophan, and so fluorescence methods could not be used to monitor redox state. Therefore, an alternative method was sought. Two-dimensional NMR methods have been used previously to determine the reduction potential of human thioredoxin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). NMR has the potential to provide much more detailed information about changes occurring in the protein during a redox transition. For example, the effect of redox buffers can readily be monitored through the <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum of a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled protein, and the formation of adducts (<italic>e.g.</italic> mixed disulfides between the protein and glutathione) can be detected. <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra of fully oxidized and reduced sBdbD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) revealed differences in a number of resonances that, although not assigned to specific residues, enabled the redox composition of sBdbD samples to be followed as a function of the potential generated by the GSSG/GSH couple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). Under the conditions of concentration required for the NMR experiments, the highest potential that could be reliably generated by the GSSG/GSH couple was limited to approximately &#x02212;80 mV. Normally, this would be more than sufficient to cover the entire transition for a thioredoxin-like protein. In this case, the protein was not fully oxidized at &#x02212;80 mV, and so a complete redox titration data set was not obtained. Nevertheless, the data could be fitted to the Nernst equation, giving a midpoint reduction potential (<italic>E<sub>m</sub></italic>) of &#x02212;75 &#x000b1; 5 mV <italic>versus</italic> NHE at pH 7 and 25 &#x000b0;C with <italic>n</italic>, the number of electrons involved in the reduction, at 1.85 &#x000b1; 0.26.

To do this, the reduction potential of the unfolded protein is required to calculate <italic>K</italic><sub>3</sub>. It has been shown previously that reduction potentials of a range of unfolded thioredoxin-like proteins, including <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) and glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3), DsbA, and DsbC, exhibit remarkably little variation, with values of approximately &#x02212;215 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). Furthermore, the reduction potential of the C<italic>XX</italic>C motifs of a range of peptides that contain the active site motifs of TDOR proteins also exhibits little variation, with values of approximately &#x02212;205 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the reduction potential of unfolded sBdbD is approximately &#x0223c; &#x02212;210 mV. Using this, a reduction potential of approximately &#x02212;110 mV (<italic>versus</italic> NHE at pH 7) was calculated for folded sBdbD. This is somewhat lower than that determined by redox titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) but is entirely consistent with an oxidative role of BdbD.</p><p>The removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from sBdbD resulted in some conformational changes (see above); therefore, it was of interest to determine the relative stabilities of reduced and oxidized sBdbD in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Equilibrium unfolding experiments were carried out as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Reversible unfolding was observed in each case, and the data could be fitted to a two-state model. For both reduced and oxidized states, the data demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not essential for stability; folded sBdbD is stable in both oxidation states, consistent with the structural data above. However, reduced sBdbD had a folding stability of &#x02212;20.9 &#x000b1; 2.0 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, &#x0223c;10 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> lower than in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and so the metal ion significantly stabilizes the reduced protein. The oxidized protein, on the other hand, in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> exhibited a folding stability similar to and even somewhat greater than that of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-replete sBdbD (&#x02212;14.4 &#x000b1; 1.0 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> compared with &#x02212;11.8 &#x000b1; 1.6 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the as-isolated protein). Therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not contribute to the stability of the oxidized state and may even destabilize it relative to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free form. It is also of note that the <italic>m</italic> values for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted sBdbD are significantly different for the reduced and oxidized states, implying that the extent of unfolding is different, consistent with a difference in structure between the oxidized and reduced states in their native and/or denatured forms.</p><p>The data indicate clearly that the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to a drop in the value of &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>ox/red</sub> and therefore a decrease in the difference between reduction potentials in folded and unfolded states. From the cycle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>, the reduction potential of sBdbD in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was calculated to be &#x0223c;60 mV lower than when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present, suggesting that a major role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is to increase the oxidizing power of BdbD.</p></sec><sec><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> Site of BdbD Serves to Increase the Active Site Reduction Potential</title><p>To determine directly the effect of the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the redox properties of sBdbD, the mid-point reduction potential of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free protein was determined by NMR methods, as described above for the as-isolated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). At the highest potential that could be generated by the GSSG/GSH couple (&#x02212;80 mV), the extent of reduction was much more significant than in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing protein, and fitting of the data to the Nernst equation, giving a midpoint reduction potential (<italic>E<sub>m</sub></italic>) of &#x02212;95 &#x000b1; 5 mV <italic>versus</italic> NHE at pH 7 and 25 &#x000b0;C, with <italic>n</italic>, the number of electrons involved in the reduction, at 1.98 &#x000b1; 0.2.

This difference, although less than that predicted from unfolding studies, is qualitatively in good agreement.</p></sec><sec><title>pK<sub>a</sub> Values of BdbD Active Site Cysteines</title><p>To define the range over which the p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values of the sBdbD active site cysteines can be measured, the pH stability of folded sBdbD was investigated using the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan. A plot of emission wavelength maximum <italic>versus</italic> pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>) showed that pH-induced unfolding of sBdbD led to a sizeable shift in emission wavelength from around 353 nm at pH 7 to much longer wavelengths at extremes of pH. The apparent stability range of BdbD lies between pH 4.5 and pH 10 and is similar to both ResA and StoA from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Within the stable range itself, there was little evidence for titration of other residues affecting the fluorescence of tryptophan residues. The data indicate that p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values lower than 4.5 cannot be measured. This is particularly important for sBdbD because, as a DsbA-like protein, it is likely to have a highly nucleophilic N-terminal cysteine in the C<italic>XX</italic>C motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>pH stability and p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> determination for BdbD.</bold><italic>A</italic>, plots of tryptophan fluorescence emission maxima and emission intensity at 346 nm as a function of pH for solutions of sBdbD (0.15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> in PCTC buffer), as a function of pH. <italic>B</italic>, time-dependent increases in fluorescence at 510 nm upon reaction with wild-type sBdbD (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) with badan (12 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) in a mixed buffer system at pH values from 4.76 to 9.78, as indicated, at 25 &#x000b0;C.

During the badan modification experiment, a single fluorescence peak with a maximum emission at 510 nm was observed for badan-treated sBdbD, corresponding to covalent badan-adduct(s) of protein cysteine residue(s). A plot of the pseudo-first order rate constant <italic>versus</italic> pH revealed a significant rate constant at low pH and an apparent protonation/deprotonation event at pH 8.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>C</italic>). The rate constant at low pH is roughly constant (&#x0223c;0.045 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), whereas that measured after the transition is estimated to be &#x0223c;0.102 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on the basis of the fitted Henderson-Hasselbalch curve. sBdbD contains only two cysteines (Cys<sup>69</sup> and Cys<sup>72</sup>) and, although only a single titration event is detected, the high rate of badan modification at low pH strongly suggests that a cysteine residue must be reacting with badan at acidic pH values. We therefore conclude that the apparent p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> event is likely to be due to titration of Cys<sup>72</sup>, whereas the high rate at low pH is because of the thiolate form of Cys<sup>69</sup>, which is likely to have a p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> value below the minimum pH at which sBdbD is stable. This is consistent with p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values reported for other DsbA-like proteins where the N-terminal cysteine usually has a very low p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>The pH stability studies reported here highlight that the determination of accurate cysteine p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values requires knowledge of the pH-induced unfolding, because the p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values of cysteines in the unfolded protein are likely to be significantly higher than in the folded state. This raises the question of how the effects of protein unfolding at low pH have been taken into account in previous determinations of cysteine p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values in EcDsbA and other DsbA-like proteins. We note that for SaDsbA, a p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> of 3.37 was determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), but the pH stability of the protein was not reported, although Charbonnier <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>) concluded that the p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> value of wild-type EcDsbA could not be accurately determined because of protein unfolding at low pH. Nelson and Creighton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) directly addressed this issue by monitoring thiolate formation in EcDsbA using the absorbance change at 240 nm to report on thiol/thiolate status, while simultaneously measuring the 288 nm signal as indicative of folding/unfolding transitions. From these data, a p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> of &#x0223c;3.5 for the N-terminal cysteine was determined, but it was also shown that the protein unfolded below pH 3. Thus, deprotonation and unfolding events overlap, raising the question of whether the p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values reported are really because of protonation/deprotonation of the active site cysteine in the native state or, in fact, measure protonation/deprotonation because of the relaxation of structural factors that depress the cysteine p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> value in the folded state. Thus, although it is clear that the N-terminal cysteine p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values are considerably lower in DsbA-like proteins (including BdbD) than in reducing thioredoxin-like proteins (which have p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> values of &#x0003e;6.5), or for free cysteine in solution (p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> value &#x0223c;8.5), it is not clear that the p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> value for any of these proteins has been accurately determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Probing Redox Interactions of BdbD</title><p>To investigate the ability of sBdbD to oxidize a substrate, a 15-residue peptide containing the active site sequence C<italic>XX</italic>CH of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> apo-cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>550</sub> (CccA) was used. A significant body of evidence indicates that BdbD oxidizes apo-cytochrome <italic>c</italic> substrates upon their export to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane before they are subsequently re-reduced by the reducing TDOR ResA immediately prior to covalent heme attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). sBdbD was oxidized overnight by the addition of 10 m<sc>m</sc> GSSG, and a 2:1 excess of reduced peptide was added. The resulting <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum showed no evidence for the presence of a stable interaction between sBdbD and the peptide, consistent with the transient nature of the interaction of DsbA-like proteins with substrates, but it did reveal that sBdbD was present entirely in the reduced form (data not shown). An identical experiment with an equivalent peptide containing an S<italic>XX</italic>SH active site resulted in the observation of sBdbD only in the oxidized state. These experiments clearly demonstrate that oxidized sBdbD is able to transfer its disulfide bond to the apo-cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>550</sub> active site mimic peptide.</p><p>The data presented here (and previously) show that BdbD is an oxidizing extra-cytoplasmic TDOR. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> contains a number of other extra-cytoplasmic TDORs, two of which, ResA and StoA, have been shown to be reducing TDORs involved in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> maturation and endospore biogenesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The existence of both oxidizing and reducing TDORs on the outside of the membrane raises questions about how unproductive redox cycling of these proteins and their substrates is avoided. We therefore sought to determine whether or not BdbD can directly oxidize reduced ResA <italic>in vitro</italic>. The fluorescence emission intensity of sResA at 353 nm is highly sensitive to the redox state of the protein, becoming significantly quenched upon oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). As noted above, the fluorescence intensity of sBdbD, on the other hand, is insensitive to the redox state of the protein. Therefore, fluorescence spectroscopy was used to investigate whether sBdbD and sResA can undergo a redox reaction with one another. Oxidized sBdbD was mixed with an equimolar concentration of reduced sResA and fluorescence spectra measured over a period of 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). Initially, a small loss of intensity occurred, but overall significant changes in intensity were not observed. A similar slow loss of intensity was observed upon addition of a redox-inactive S<italic>XX</italic>SH cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>550</sub> active site mimic peptide, indicating that small intensity changes are observed even when electron transfer cannot take place (data not shown). Intensity changes are shown more clearly in the plot of fluorescence intensity at 345 nm as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, <italic>inset</italic>). As a control, sBdbD was also mixed in 1:1 ratio with oxidized sResA, verifying that oxidation of sResA results in a large decrease in intensity. The data indicate that, despite a significant thermodynamic driving force, the proteins do not undergo a redox reaction, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Redox interaction between sBdbD and sResA.</bold> Fluorescence spectra of reduced sResA (0.5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) at increasing time points following the addition of oxidized sBdbD (0.5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.

Although most of these involve proteins closely related to the DsbA/DsbB system of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>, there are significant variations. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, for example, utilizes a protein, DsbE, more closely related to thioredoxin than DsbA to generate extra-cytoplasmic disulfide bonds, and <italic>S. aureus</italic> does not contain a DsbB homologue and therefore must re-oxidize its DsbA protein by another pathway. Members of the genus <italic>Bacillus</italic>, with few exceptions, contain BdbD/BdbC, which are homologues of DsbA/DsbB. Here our studies of BdbD from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> have revealed further evidence of variation, in that the protein possesses an intrinsic metal site not present in other DsbA-like proteins. Upon isolation, the site is fully occupied by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, which commonly plays a structural role in proteins. In this case, the function of the site appears to be more subtle as removal of the metal does not result in unfolding, or indeed any major structural changes. It does have an effect on conformational stability, however, and, intriguingly, this is specific to the reduced state of the protein, such that presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the site significantly affects the redox properties of the protein, despite being some 14 &#x0212b; away from the enzyme active site. Electrostatics may be a significant contributor to the observed effect. In simple terms, binding of a positively charged calcium ion would be expected to stabilize the reduced form of the active site, in which Cys<sup>69</sup> is negatively charged at physiological pH. On the other hand, no stabilization would be expected to result from Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the neutral oxidized (disulfide-bonded) state. This provides a qualitative explanation for the selective stabilization by Ca<sup>2+</sup> of the reduced state of BdbD, which would be predicted to result in an increase in reduction potential, as observed.</p><p>Some TDORs, such as human glutaredoxin 2, are iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). However, in such cases, the cluster cofactor is coordinated by at least one of the active site cysteines, and therefore TDOR activity and cluster coordination are mutually exclusive properties. To the best of our knowledge, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> BdbD is the first example of a TDOR protein that contains a metal cofactor remote from the C<italic>XX</italic>C active site, and it represents an important example in which a non-redox active metal affects the redox properties of a protein. This is somewhat reminiscent of peroxidase enzymes in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> has an important effect on the properties of the active site heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). For BdbD, the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is to increase the reduction potential, and the magnitude of the effect is of the same order as that observed for <italic>XX</italic> dipeptide substitutions at a TDOR C<italic>XX</italic>C active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). This leads us to propose that the role of the metal site is to provide a boost to the oxidizing power of BdbD. A further possibility that remains to be explored is that modulation of the active site reduction potential is important for the re-oxidation of the BdbD active site by its integral membrane partner BdbC.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_35_23719__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.005785_jbc.M109.005785-1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by Grant 076017/Z/04/Z from the Wellcome Trust and by Grant 621-2007-6094 from the Swedish Research Council.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The atomic coordinates and structure factors (codes <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3EU3">3EU3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3EU4">3EU4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3GH9">3GH9</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3GHA">3GHA</ext-link>) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/">http://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>).</p></fn><fn id="FN2" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p><sup><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></sup> The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.005785/DC1">supplemental Experimental Procedures, additional references, Figs.
