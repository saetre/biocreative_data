Impairment of cutaneous wound healing is a debilitating complication commonly encountered during diabetes mellitus. Foot ulcers represent the most prevalent diabetic wounds and frequently lead to limb amputations. The incidence of diabetic foot lesions has been reported to be similar in type 1 vs type 2 diabetic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Ramsey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In human diabetic ulcers, multiple deviations from normal healing have been identified (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Brem1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Diabetic ulcers are characterized by a chronic inflammatory state primarily manifested by imbalances in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Pierce1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Transient self-resolving inflammation is essential for successful wound healing. Wound inflammation is driven by a variety of mediators that are tightly controlled in space and time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Gillitzer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Martin1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Wound-site macrophages represent a key player that drive wound inflammation. Diabetes is known to compromise macrophage function including phagocytosis activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Maruyama1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Abrass1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Diabetic macrophages produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Weisberg1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Goren1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.The causative factors underlying the chronic inflammatory state of diabetic wounds remain to be characterized.</p><p>During the early inflammatory phase, a large number of polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN nearly 50&#x00025; of all cells at the wound site) are recruited to the wound site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Singer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Following completion of their tasks, PMN must be eliminated in order to initiate the next stage of wound healing. Non-resolving persistent inflammation may derail the healing cascade resulting in chronic wounds. In the course of adult cutaneous wound healing, the granulation tissue decreases in cellularity and evolve into a scar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Desmouliere1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Rapid increase in cell infiltration during tissue reconstruction is balanced by apoptosis. Apoptosis allows for the elimination of cells that are no longer required at the injury site or cells that are too damaged to facilitate the healing process. While mechanisms of apoptosis have been intensely studied, the specific mechanisms of disposal or clearance of apoptotic cells from the wound site remain poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Meszaros1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells has distinctive morphologic features and unique downstream consequences. deCathelineau and Henson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-deCathelineau1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and Gardai et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Gardai1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> coined the term efferocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Vandivier1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Efferocytosis refers to phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, an essential feature of immune responses and critical for the resolution of inflammation. This final removal step in the cell-death program plays a critical role in protecting tissues from exposure to the toxic contents of dying cells and also serves to prevent further tissue damage by stimulating production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Erwig1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Fadok1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Inappropriate clearance of cell corpses may lead to autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Rosen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Adequate removal of apoptotic PMNs by macrophages from the wound site is a pre-requisite for the restoration of normal tissue function resolving inflammation. In the clinical treatment of chronic wounds, debridement is commonly practiced and is aimed at the removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue to improve the healing potential of the remaining healthy tissue. We posit that at the wound-site successful debridement at the cellular level is a pre-requisite to the resolution of inflammation and successful healing. The objective of this study was to test this novel hypothesis and to delineate mechanisms that are involved in the impairment of resolution of inflammation in diabetic wounds. This reports presents first evidence collected from functionally active macrophages harvested from diabetic wounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Mice homozygous (BKS.Cg-m &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; Leprdb/J or db/db) for spontaneous mutation of the leptin receptor (Lepr<sup>db</sup>) become identifiably obese around 3 to 4 weeks of age. Elevation of blood sugar was evident within 4 to 8 weeks after birth. Excisional (6 mm) wounds created on the back of these mice showed severe impairment in closure when compared to their corresponding control (heterozygous db/&#x0002b;) mice (data not shown). Using histological approaches, we observed that the wounds of diabetic mice contained higher number of apoptotic cells compared to the wound tissue of control db/&#x0002b; mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g001">Figs. 1A&#x02013;B</xref>). TUNEL staining and Western blot using active caspase-3 antibody demonstrated consistent outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g001">Fig. 1C&#x02013;E</xref>). To test the clinical relevance of the above-said findings punch biopsies (3 mm) were collected from matched (patient characteristics, wound location and clinical condition) wounds of consented diabetic and non-diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009539-t001">Table 1</xref>). Scoring of active caspase 3 positive cells demonstrated a significantly higher load of apoptotic cells in the wound tissue of individuals with diabetes (1F&#x02013;G). In order to identify the types of cells in the diabetic wounds that were undergoing apoptosis, dual immunofluorescence studies were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Wound tissue sections (d3 and d7) from diabetic animals were immunostained with active caspase-3 antibody to visualize apoptotic cells. The sections were then co-immunostained using either anti-neutrophil or anti-CD31 (endothelial cell marker) antibody <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g002">Fig. 2A&#x00026;B</xref>). The results clearly demonstrate that at day 3 majority of caspase-3 positive cells were neutrophils. Some endothelial cells were positive for caspase-3 on day 7 post-wounding. These data suggest PMNs, and endothelial cells at least in part, represent the apoptotic cells detected in the wounds.</p><fig id="pone-0009539-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009539.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Increased number of apoptotic cells in wounds of diabetic mice and humans.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Representative mosaic images from day 3 wounds of diabetic (db/db) or non-diabetic (db/&#x0002b;) mice stained with active caspase 3 (brown).

Despite attenuated oxidative stress following NAC supplementation, no change in apoptotic cell count in wounds was observed in the diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009539.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>). These observations argue against the involvement of oxidative stress in determining the apoptotic cell load in the wound tissue of diabetic mice.</p><p>To evaluate apoptotic cell clearance activity, homogenous wound macrophage suspensions were derived from diabetic and non-diabetic (control) mice. Wound macrophages were isolated employing a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-sponge implantation approach. This isolation procedure resulted in macrophage cultures with &#x0003e;95&#x00025; (95.9&#x000b1;1.7&#x00025;) homogeneity. Wound-site macrophages were co-cultured with cell-tracker (red)-tagged cells that were either apoptotic or viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Thymocytes were made apoptotic by activating them with 5 &#x000b5;M dexamethasone for 12 h.

The co-culture resulted in clasping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) and phagocytosis of the fluorescent-labeled apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g003">Figs. 3C</xref>). Macrophages were phagocytotically-silent when co-cultured with viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The difference in observation between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g003">Figs. 3D&#x00026;E</xref> were objectively tested using scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>). High powered DIC or fluorescence images were utilized to discriminate between adherent and engulfed apoptotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g003">Fig. 3F&#x00026;G</xref>). Significantly impaired apoptotic cell clearance or efferocytosis activity of wound macrophages isolated from diabetic mice was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009539-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We sought to test whether the impairment in apoptotic cell clearance activity of wound macrophages was limited to the db/db model or macrophages from other diabetic mice models show comparable results. To address this issue, we used other genetic models of type 1 diabetes. The NOD/LtJ mice are susceptible to spontaneous development of autoimmune (type 1) insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009539-Breyer1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

No effect on wound epithelialization yet a slower rate of closure suggests that contraction and/or granulation tissue formation was likely affected under these conditions.

This burden, in turn, prolongs the inflammatory phase and complicates the healing process and compromises resolution of inflammation. Correction of impaired efferocytosis in diabetic wounds and strategies to intercept the adverse effects of impaired efferocytosis emerge as novel targets for the management of chronic inflammation commonly noted in diabetic wounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Vertebrate animals</title><p>All animal studies have been approved by Ohio State University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Human subjects</title><p>All human studies were approved by the Ohio State University's Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Secondary-Intention Excisional Cutaneous Wound Model</title><p>Male (8&#x02013;12 week aged) mice were used for this study.
