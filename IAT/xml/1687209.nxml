Previously we reported a mouse Necdin knock-out model with similar defects to PWS patients. Despite the putative roles attributed to Necdin, mainly from <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, its <italic>in vivo </italic>function remains unclear. In this study, we investigate sensory-motor behaviour in Necdin deficient mice. We reveal cellular defects and analyse their cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report sensory differences in Necdin deficient mice compared to wild type animals. These differences led us to investigate sensory neuron development in Necdin deficient mouse embryos. First, we describe the expression pattern of Necdin in developing DRGs and report a reduction of one-third in specified sensory neurons in dorsal roots ganglia and show that this neuronal loss is achieved by E13.5, when DRGs sensory neurons are specified. In parallel, we observed an increase of 41% in neuronal apoptosis during the wave of naturally occurring cell death at E12.5. Since it is assumed that Necdin is a P75NTR interactor, we looked at the P75NTR-expressing cell population in Necdin knock-out embryos. Unexpectedly, Necdin loss of function has no effect on p75NTR expressing neurons suggesting no direct genetic interaction between Necdin and P75NTR in this context.</p><p>Although we exclude a role of Necdin in axonal outgrowth from spinal sensory neurons in early developmental stages; such a role could occur later in neuronal differentiation. Finally we also exclude an anti-proliferative role of Necdin in developing sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, our data show clearly that, in early development of the nervous system, Necdin is an anti-apoptotic or survival factor.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Molecules that orchestrate the cell cycle have to interact with extrinsic signals to trigger neural cell specification and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Discovered 15 years ago, NECDIN (Neurally differentiated Embryonal Carcinoma-Derived proteIN, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]), possesses all the characteristics of such a molecule as described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Necdin belongs to the type II MAGE (Melanoma Antigen Gene Expression) gene family, all of whose members share a MAGE Homology Domain (MHD) of an as yet unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Different roles, mainly based on <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, have been assigned to Necdin. The mouse Necdin protein was first defined as a "growth-suppressor" that could facilitate the cell cycle exit and the maintenance of the neuronal postmitotic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A role in neuronal terminal differentiation, more specifically in neurite outgrowth and fasciculation was also supported by a number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This role is thought to implicate the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and/or a signalling pathway involving centrosomal function and cytoskeletal rearrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Supporting these findings, a large variety of Necdin partners have been revealed using yeast two-hybrids or Ras Rescue Systems. Necdin cytoplasmic interactors (FEZ1, BBS4, NEFA and Nuc which are both Ca2+ binding proteins), or nuclear interactors such as cell-cycle proteins (E2F1, E2F2, p53) and neurotrophic receptors (p75NTR, TrkA) have been characterized.</p><p>Interestingly, it is not only Necdin but also other members of the family such as NRAGE and MAGEH1 which interact with the death domain of the low affinity receptor to neurotrophin p75NTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>As most of these data were obtained from <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, their physiological relevance remained to be demonstrated. Thus, by focusing on the nervous system, we asked whether Necdin plays a unique role via a single signalling pathway or different roles, as suggested by the <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, depending on the cell type and on the physiological context. Effectively, the Necdin expression profile in mouse is consistent with a role in neuronal differentiation including cell cycle arrest, neuronal maturation and later in maintaining a post-mitotic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The human <italic>NECDIN </italic>gene is deleted in the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], a complex multigenic neurogenetic disease. PWS is mainly characterized by a transient infantile hypotonia, global development delay, hyperphagia leading to severe obesity and many other clinical features (hypogonadism, cognitive impairments, skin picking, daytime sleepiness, temperature instability, abnormal ventilatory responses...) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Four different Necdin-null mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] have been generated in order to reveal the physiological and pathophysiological role of Necdin. At first glance, these mice show no obvious abnormal phenotype. Nevertheless, some phenotypic characteristics reveal striking parallels with the phenotypic manifestations in PWS patients: such as a high level of scraping, a particular cognitive profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and, more importantly, depending on the genetic background, postnatal respiratory distress leading to lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Up to now, the phenotype description of the Necdin knock-out (Ndn KO) model is still partial and further analysis could reveal other alterations similar to PW symptoms.</p><p>Finally, subtle morphological abnormalities were also reported suggesting that Necdin deficiency results in aberrant neuronal migration and affects axonal extension, arborization and fasciculation during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Here, in order to clarify the functional roles of Necdin in the cellular physiology of the nervous system, we investigate the sensory system. First, we explore the sensory-motor behaviour and reveal sensory deficits that might result from Necdin deficiency. Then, to address the function of Necdin at the cellular level we examine the integrity of Dorsal Root Ganglias (DRGs) in Necdin mutant embryos (Ndn KO) we have previously generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We analyse carefully the spatio-temporal expression pattern of Necdin in the developing sensory neurons. We observe a significative loss of TrkA and TrkC sensory neurons in Ndn KO compared to wild type; this loss is achieved at E13.5 dpc and remains at P0. We reveal an increase of caspase3-dependant apoptosis, before the peak of naturally occurring cell death. This cell death does not involve the P75NTR receptor.</p><p>We also investigate the axonal outgrowth in several structures innervated by the spinal sensory neurons in Necdin mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Phenotypic features suggest defects of sensory pathways</title><p>Phenotypical analysis is performed on 7 wild type and 9 mutant adult mice (3&#x02013;4 months) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Ndn KO mice had normal body weight and body temperature (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), well-groomed coats, and normal body posture. Gross neurological examination of animals reveals no distinct signs of modified sensory or vestibular reflexes in mutants as assessed in simple tests of vision, audition, olfaction, touch sensitivity or righting reflex. Necdin mutants also show a normal reactivity to handling and a normal exploratory activity when exposed to a novel cage immediately following the transfer arousal test.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Neurological evaluation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>Wild type</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>Ndn-KO</italic></bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Body weight (g)</italic></bold></td><td></td><td align="center">25.20 (0.55)</td><td align="center">25.80 (1.75)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Body temperature (&#x000b0;C)</italic></bold></td><td></td><td align="center">36.40 (1.03)</td><td align="center">36.60 (0.60)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>String test (s)</italic></bold></td><td></td><td align="center">8.98 (20.62)</td><td align="center">7.37 (2.66)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Grip strength (s)</italic></bold></td><td></td><td align="center">7.90 (0.98)</td><td align="center">7.67 (1.85)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Rotarod-4 to 40 rpm in 5 min (s)</italic></bold></td><td></td><td align="center">117.50 (76.38)</td><td align="center">90.50 (69.88)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Beam walking (s)</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><italic>Number of slips</italic></td><td align="center">1.0 (0.25)</td><td align="center">2 (2.40)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>Latency (s)</italic></td><td align="center">11.59 (4.10)</td><td align="center">14.66 (2.39) *</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values indicated represent the median and, between brackets, the interquartile range. * p &#x0003c; 0.05, Mann-Whitney</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We explored further the sensory-motor abilities and general behaviour of Necdin adult deficient mice using specific behavioural tests.

The compound muscle action potentials including the direct muscle response (M-wave) at the level of the gastrocnemius or plantar muscles, and the monosynaptic reflex response (H-wave) on the plantar muscle were also recorded. Amplitude and latency of the M-wave were not significantly different between mutant and wild type mice. On the other hand, the H-wave amplitude and the H/M amplitude ratio, recorded on the plantar muscle, were significantly higher in the mutant group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The H-reflex amplitude and the H/M amplitude ratio have been used traditionally to evaluate spinal excitability. These data suggest an overall facilitation of the stretch reflex circuit (H-reflex) that could result from hyperexcitability of motoneurons and/or sensory neurons.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>EMG measurements</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>Wild type</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>Ndn KO</italic></bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold><italic>Sensory Nerve Conduction Velocity (m/s)</italic></bold></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center">38.5 (8.48)</td><td align="center">40.00 (11.43)</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold><italic>Plantar muscle CMAP</italic></bold></td><td align="center">M-wave</td><td align="center">Latency (s)</td><td align="center">1.65 (0.13)</td><td align="center">1.58 (0.19)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center">Amplitude (mV)</td><td align="center">4.60 (4.98)</td><td align="center">4.50 (1.90)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">H-wave</td><td align="center">Latency (s)</td><td align="center">4.60 (0.68)</td><td align="center">4.30 (0.20)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center">Amplitude (mV)</td><td align="center">0.40 (0.18)</td><td align="center">0.70 (0.20) *</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values indicated represent the median and, between brackets, the interquartile range. * p &#x0003c; 0.05, Mann-Whitney</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Finally, the hot plate test was used to evaluate pain sensitivity and revealed significantly reduced withdrawal latency in mutant mice compared to wild type animals (p &#x0003c; 0.05; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>), thus suggesting reduced pain threshold in Necdin deficient mice.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Pain sensitivity</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left"><bold><italic>Wild type</italic></bold></td><td align="left"><bold><italic>Ndn-KO</italic></bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Hot plate latency (s)</italic></bold></td><td align="left">9.13 (2.08)</td><td align="left">7.05 (1.23) *</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Tail flick latency (s)</italic></bold></td><td align="left">3.77 (0.98)</td><td align="left">3.03 (0.28)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values indicated represent the median and, between brackets, the interquartile range. * p &#x0003c; 0.05, Mann-Whitney</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Taken together these data reveal significant defects in the sensory system.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Necdin in developing DRGs</title><p>In order to detect histological abnormalities in lumbar DRGs that could be correlated to the sensory dysfunction in Ndn KO mice, we first analysed the morphology and the size of lumbar DRGs. At P0, comparing the volume of the first lumbar (L1) DRG between Ndn KO and wild type mice (WT), we observed a 37% reduction of the mutant L1 DRG volume (WT: 32 10<sup>5 </sup>&#x003bc;m<sup>3 </sup>(30 10<sup>5</sup>, 32.7 10<sup>5</sup>), n = 3; Ndn KO: 19.7 10<sup>5 </sup>&#x003bc;m<sup>3 </sup>(17.2 10<sup>5</sup>, 21.4 10<sup>5</sup>), n = 3). Since previously, we have shown that Necdin is expressed through embryogenesis in postmitotic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we hypothesized that a defect during the ontogeny of sensory neurons in Necdin deficient mice might result in a loss or pronounced atrophy of sensory neurons resulting in a reduction of L1 DRGs volume in Necdin deficient mice. In developing DRGs, expression of <italic>Necdin </italic>transcript is first detected at E11.5 and progressively increases to E13.5, in accordance with an increasing number of neurons present in ganglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). At E13.5, using the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), to label proliferative cells, we revealed the absence of Necdin expression in BrdU-positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>); however we showed a colabelling of Necdin and Neurofilament (NF) by immunohistochemistry (IH) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Therefore, in developing DRGs, Necdin is clearly expressed in post-mitotic neurons and not in the progenitor cells as it has been shown in other brain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Necdin protein is detected in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), as confirmed by confocal analysis (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Necdin in DRGs through development</bold>.

We quantified cells undergoing DNA fragmentation, using a TUNEL assay (terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (tdt)-mediated dUTP nick end labelling), in the lumbar region and at different developmental stages (E11.5, E12.5 and E13.5) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

First, we performed a whole-mount immunostaining using anti-&#x003b2; tubulin III (Tuj1) antibody, an axonal marker, to visualize the morphology and to measure the length of axons in mutants compared to wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

At E11.5, in Necdin mutant embryos, the brachial plexus, formed by the last three cervical and first two thoracic nerves, in the forelimb was appropriately patterned and all nerves emanating from it appear normal compared to wild type (data not shown). At E12.5 and E13.5, peripheral spinal nerves were analysed quantitatively by measuring the length of nerves (given in &#x003bc;m) innervating the trunk region.

In DRGs, neural progenitors coexist with differentiated sensory neurons throughout all of neurogenesis and the ontogeny of sensory neurons is well characterized in terms of origins, proliferation, determination, cell death and neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><sec><title>Necdin prevents apoptosis in early developing sensory neurons</title><p>Thus Necdin deficiency impairs lumbar sensory neuron development between E11.5 and E13.5, resulting in a loss of sensory neurons persisting at P0 and at adulthood (FM personal data). During this time frame, we observed in our control mice a wave of naturally occurring cell death as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We revealed a significant 41% increase of cell death in lumbar Necdin mutant DRGs compared to wild type. This increase concerns post-mitotic neurons only and occurs at E12.5, just before the peak of naturally cell death, which is observed in normal mice at E13.5. This increase of cell death was confirmed by Caspase-3 staining and Hoechst incorporation (data not shown). Thus, abrogation of Necdin triggers an increase of early apoptosis via the Caspase-3 pathway.</p><p>Notably, this increase of apoptosis and subsequently the loss of sensory neurons observed in Necdin mutant are specific to the lumbar region. No defect is detected at the thoraco-brachial level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>). However, at E13.5, a similar loss of sensory neurons was obtained in the primary sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional File 2</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, at the cellular level, Necdin prevents apoptosis but the mechanism is unclear.

Thus, at E12.5, the role of Necdin is probably independent of neurotrophic factors provided by the target. However Necdin signaling pathway might depend on local action of neurotrophins or other growth factors.</p><p>The timing of neurotrophin/Trk signalling requirements and the cell types affected by the neurotrophin deficiencies have been well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is assumed that a single neurotrophic factor might promote the survival of a specific population of sensory neurons, although phenotypic comparisons among mice with different mutations have revealed a considerable overlap in terms of neurotrophin requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The abrogation of Necdin results in a relatively selective loss of neurons in DRGs: TrkA and TrkC cell populations are reduced but not TrkB population. A simple interpretation of that might be that Necdin transduces a survival signal of NGF via TrkA (as previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) or/and of NT3 via TrkC. Considering that neurogenesis in developing DRGs is a dynamic process and the expression patterns of the different Trk proteins are also highly dynamic between E10.5 and E13.5, another interpretation is that the TrkA and TrkC populations present at E13.5 expressed a common receptor at an earlier stage of their development and required a common neurotrophic factor that could trigger Necdin function as a survival factor.</p><p>Another way to explain the mechanism, by which Necdin could act as an anti-apoptotic/survival factor, is to consider the p75NTR pathway. Previously, it has been shown that p75NTR interacts with Necdin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and a common signalling pathway involving Necdin and p75NTR has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, throughout development, Necdin and p75NTR expression partially overlaps in the post-mitotic territories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, we did not observe any reduction in the number of neurons expressing p75NTR in Necdin embryonic DRGs compared to wild type. These data suggest that there is no direct genetic interaction between p75NTR and Necdin to prevent the regulated cell death in post-mitotic developing sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell proliferation is not increased in DRGs of Necdin deficient mice</title><p>Necdin has been demonstrated to function as a "growth suppressor" <italic>in vitro</italic>, since its ectopic expression induces an arrest of cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Considering such a role, we could hypothesize that the increase of cell death observed in DRGs from mutant mice might be subsequent to a previous increase of proliferation. Indeed these events are tightly linked and a compensation mechanism cannot be excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. An "anti-proliferative" role of Necdin should induce, in Necdin deficient DRGs, a reduction in the pool of post-mitotic generated neurons and an increase of the number of precursors and/or an increase in cell death. Three types of data do not support such a role in developing DRGs: 1) at E11.5, we did not observe any reduction of the number of Trks expressing cells, including the entire pool of post-mitotic neurons at this stage; 2) we performed BrdU labelling experiments at E13.5 to assess the amount of proliferation in DRGs and no difference was observed as checked by analysis on one representative lumbar DRG; 3) the increase of apoptosis observed at E12.5 is restricted to post-mitotic neurons and neither apoptosis nor necrosis of precursors were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>The abrogation of Necdin does not disturb the axonal growth in early stages of neuronal differentiation</title><p>Altogether, the analysis of axonal growth made in Necdin mutant compared to wild type mice, suggests that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, Necdin is not involved in early axonal outgrowth. Later in development at E17.5, we observed a reduced innervation from the TrkC afferent fibers in the intermediate spinal cord, visualised by a Parvalbumin labelling. Thus this specific defect of the TrkC neurons might suggest an involvement of Necdin in axonal growth. However, we have shown that the lack of Necdin leads to a loss of TrkC expressing cells that in turn could explain the absence or reduction of afferent projections. In the same way, we observed that, qualitatively, the innervation of the CGRP afferent fibers (TrkA-positive) in the hindpads of wild type animals is similar in Necdin adult mutant whereas the number of CGRP-positive nerves appears globally reduced. Again the loss of Trk A sensory neurons could explain this difference.</p><p>Previous <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] suggest a function of Necdin in neurite outgrowth depending on NGF. In our mutant, we investigated whether, independently of the increase of apoptosis observed, the surviving sensory neurons could normally extend neurites in DRG explants cultures. We revealed a reduction in neurite outgrowth of E13.5 embryonic DRG mutant explants, dependant on NGF. This discrepancy between our <italic>in vitro </italic>results and our <italic>in vivo </italic>observations (no defects in axonal growth at E13.5) might be explained by a role of Necdin in late neuronal differentiation only. This Necdin function is separable from its anti-apoptotic role previously revealed. With this in mind, we report a loss of 27% of TrkA expressing cells at E13.5 and a 40% loss of TrkA expressing cells at P0, a substantial reduction between E13.5 and P0. Indeed, a role of Necdin in neurite outgrowth depending on NGF might explain this discrepancy: a deficiency in axonal outgrowth would then lead to an alteration of neuronal differentiation and an additional loss of TrkA cell death, in later embryogenesis stages. Furthermore, such a role would explain the observations reported by other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The Necdin anti-apoptotic function is not restricted to sensory neurons</title><p>In DRGs we observed an approximately 30% partial loss of all neurons.

More generally, we observed an increase of cell death in a whole Necdin embryo at an early stage of development (E10.5), as revealed by an anti-Caspase-3 labelling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B&#x02013;C</xref>). This increase of apoptosis is not restricted to the nervous system but is extended to other tissues like somites or the extremities of members.

These observations lead us to investigate the developing sensory neurons in DRGs. In accordance, we found cellular defects and revealed a loss of nociceptive (TrkA) and proprioceptive (TrkC) sensory neurons. However considering the cellular defects, we cannot immediately explain the sensory defects observed: from a loss of sensory TrkA cells, we would expect an increased pain threshold in Necdin deficient mice but we observe the opposite effect, (a higher sensitivity in the hot-plate test).</p><p>Furthermore from a loss of TrkC-cells, we would expect an alteration of the stretch reflex circuit with a diminution of the H-wave amplitude whereas, again, we observe the opposite effect with an increase of the H-wave amplitude only. A similar effect was observed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis disease in which a loss of motoneurons facilitates the stretch reflex circuit (increase of H-wave amplitude) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In both cases, these data suggest either a hyper-excitability of sensory neurons or a lack of neuronal inhibition.</p><p>Thus to better understand the physiopathology of Necdin mutant mice, it will be necessary to take into account 1) all the cellular effect of Necdin in different neuronal populations and/or 2) the physiological compensation used by the organism to compensate for cellular impairment.

All embryos were genotyped by PCR with the primer set Nec4 (5'-TGC TAA GTG CCT ACA CTG AG-3') and Nec8 (5'-GCA TCT TAT TCA TGA GAG AC-3'); generating a 2.6 kb for the wild type allele and 1,2 kb fragment corresponding to the mutant allele.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Embryos were collected, fixed and sectioned (cryostat, 10 or 12 &#x003bc;m). Antibodies used were: NC243 anti-mouse Necdin (rabbit polyclonal, 1/500, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]), anti-Neurofilament (mouse monoclonal, 1:200, Chemicon); anti-TuJ1 (mouse monoclonal to neuron specific class III &#x003b2;-tubulin, 1:200, Berkeley Antibody); anti-Caspase-3-activated (rabbit polyclonal, 1/500, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Runx3 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, a generous gift of Dr Yoran Gruner) anti-Parvalbumin (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1/200, Swant Swisszerland) and anti-CGRP (Chemicon). Primary antibodies were used in a blocking solution containing 5% Goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton-X-100. Biotinylated secondary antibodies and the ABC complex from the Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were used for detection. Alternatively, fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (1/200; Jackson). Sections were examined on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a CARV module. For whole-mount immunohistochemistry, individual embryos were processed in a whole-mount staining procedure using the monoclonal antibody TuJ1 or anti-Caspase-3-activated, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>In situ hybridization (ISH) was carried out on 10 or 12-&#x003bc; m cryosections and was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The following in situ probes were used: <italic>Trka, Trkb and Trkc </italic>(a gift from Patapoutian)<italic>, Islet </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], <italic>Ndn </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], <italic>p75NTR </italic>(a gift from Dechant). Double in situ hybridization/immunohistochemistry was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Whole-mount ISH was carried out as previously described.</p></sec><sec><title>BrdU labelling</title><p>In summary, pregnant mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg, Sigma) and sacrificed two hours later to allow BrdU incorporation into proliferating cells. Cryostat sections were post-fixed for 10 min in PFA 4%, washed in PBS, and denatured in HCL (2N) and triton-X-100 for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The section was then neutralized for 10 min in sodium borate buffer (0,1 M, PH8.5) at room temperature. Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti BrdU monoclonal antibody diluted 1/2000 in PBS containing BSA 1%, NGS 5% and triton-X-100. Slides were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and detection was performed using anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson, 1:100).</p></sec><sec><title>TUNEL assay</title><p>To identify cells undergoing apoptosis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) technique was used. We performed TUNEL using the ApopTag Direct Kit (Oncor) and followed recommendations. To identify the proportion of neurons undergoing cell death in the early dorsal root ganglia of wild type and Necdin embryos, 10 or 12 &#x003bc;m frozen sections were doubly labeled for Neurofilament (NF), a neuron-specific marker, and TUNEL. Sections were first immunolabeled with mouse anti-NF monoclonal antibody (see above). This was followed by the TUNEL technique. The sections were examined and photographed using an Axioskop microscope. Cells undergoing apoptosis were recognized by an intensely fluorescent nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorojade staining</title><p>To detect any type of neuronal cell death, Fluorojade (FJ) labeling was performed on 10 &#x003bc;m thick frozen section as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Measure of the length of nerves</title><p>Whole mount embryos were labeled with Tuj1 antibody as described above. Axonal outgrowth was measured at E12.5 (WT, n = 4; Ndn KO, n = 5) and E13.5 (WT, n = 7; Ndn KO, n = 9). Six peripheral axon bundles, corresponding to the lateral cutaneous branch were analyzed for each embryo and noted in micrometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Explants culture</title><p>DRG explants were removed from E13.5 embryos and grown on coverslips coated with polylysin/laminin in Neurobasal medium containing 20% FBS and NGF (100 ng/ml). Ganglia were cultured for 20&#x02013;24 hr then immunostained for Neurofilament prior to axon measurement. For each ganglion, the axonal surface was measured by subtracting nucleus area from the whole DRG area (nucleus + axon). For each animal, 10&#x02013;12 ganglia were analyzed. A ratio was then constructed between the wild type and the mutant DRG.</p></sec><sec><title>DRGs volume and cell count</title><p>Area of each DRG slide was calculated by using 12 &#x003bc;m serial section of L1 DRG at P0 from each genotype using the free UTHSCSA ImageTool program (developed at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas and available from the Internet by anonymous FTP from <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://maxrad6.uthscsa.edu"/>). The DRG volume was then extrapolated and the values were noted in micrometer<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Quantitative analysis to count the number of dying cells (TUNEL) or Trks and p75NTR positive cells was performed in at least 10 lumbar DRG sections per animal, and a mean number of positive cells per square millimeter was determined. All observations reported are based on analysis of multiple tissue sections from three to five Necdin mutant (paternal allele KO) and wild type mice from the same littermates.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using appropriate nonparametric statistical tools (unpaired Mann-Whitney test). In the results, values are indicated as following: (Q2 (Q1, Q3), n). Q2 is the median and, between brackets, Q1 is first quartile and Q3 the second quartile. The level of significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Testing procedures</title><sec><title>Gross neurological examination</title><p>The general health and basic sensory motor functions were evaluated using a modified SHIRPA protocol (EMPRESS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eumorphia.org"/>). This analysis is adapted from that developed by Irwin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and from the SHIRPA protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. It provides an overview of physical appearance, body weight, body temperature, neurological reflexes and sensory abilities. Sensory functions were evaluated by measuring or scoring visual ability, audition, olfaction, tactile perception and vestibular function. Visual ability was assessed as orientation responses to an object (a white cotton swab) being moved in each peripheral visual field at a distance of 5 cm. Auditory function was evaluated by scoring Preyer and startle reflexes (pinna flicking backwards, startle) to 90 dB click noise of 20 kHz frequency. Olfaction was evaluated by scoring olfactory exploration of an object (a cotton swab) presented in front of the animal's muzzle. Tactile perception was evaluated by scoring the mouse reaction to pinna and corneal touch using a cotton wire. Vestibular function was evaluated by measuring righting and contact righting reflexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Rotarod test</title><p>This test measures the ability of an animal to maintain balance on a rotating rod (Bioseb, Chaville, France). This task requires a variety of proprioceptive, vestibular and fine-tuned motor abilities. Mice were first given three habituation trials for 60 sec each (one trial at 0 rpm and 2 trials at 4 rpm). Animals were then submitted to 4 testing trials separated by 5&#x02013;10 min interval and during which the rotation speed accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm in 5 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Beam walking</title><p>The beam walking test is used to evaluate fine motor coordination and proprioceptive function, requiring accurate paw placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The apparatus used is a 2 cm diameter and 110 cm long wooden beam, elevated 50 cm above the ground. The beam is subdivided into 11 segments allowing rapid estimation of the distance crossed by the mouse. The first segment at one extremity of the beam is used as a starting point during testing trials. A goal box (12 &#x000d7; 12 &#x000d7; 14 cm) is fixed at the other extremity of the beam.</p><p>Animals are first habituated to the goal box for 1 min. They are then submitted to 3 training trials during which they are placed at different points of the beam the head directed to the goal box and allowed to walk the corresponding distance to enter the goal box. After training, animals are submitted to 3 testing trials during which they are placed at the extremity of the beam opposite to the goal box and allowed to walk the beam distance and enter the goal box. The latency to enter the goal box and the number of slips (when one or both hindpaws slips laterally from the beam) are measured.</p></sec><sec><title>String test (traction reflex test)</title><p>The apparatus is a wire stretched horizontally 40 cm above a table. Testing consists of 3 consecutive trials separated by 5&#x02013;10 min interval. On each trial the forepaws of the animal are placed on the thread. The latency the animal took to catch the wire with its hindpaws was recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Grip test</title><p>This test measures the maximal muscle strength using an isometric dynamometer connected to a grid (Bioseb). Once the animal is holding the grid with its all paws it is slowly moved backwards until it releases it. The dynamometer records the maximal strength developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Tail flick test</title><p>This apparatus consists of a shutter-controlled lamp as a heat source (Bioseb). Three consecutive trials with an interval of about 1&#x02013;2 min are performed at different sites of the tail. For each trial, the tail of the animal is placed under the heat source. The time taken by the animal to flick its tail is recorded (cut off 20 s).</p></sec><sec><title>Hotplate test</title><p>The mice are placed into a glass cylinder on a hot plate adjusted to 52&#x000b0;C (Bioseb) and the latency of the first reaction (licking, moving the paws,) or jump is recorded. Two consecutive trials with an interval of about 15 min are performed. The first trial ends either immediately after the mouse displays the first reaction or after 30 s if it does not show any sign of pain. The second trial ends either immediately after the mouse displays a jump or after 3 min if it does not show any jump.</p></sec><sec><title>Electromyography</title><p>EMG recordings were performed under Ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia using a Key Point electromyograph apparatus (Medtronic, France). The body temperature is maintained at 37&#x000b0;C with a homeothermic blanket (Harvard, Paris, France).</p><p>- For measuring SNCV, recording electrodes are inserted at the base of the tail and stimulating electrodes placed 20 mm from the recording needles towards the extremity of the tail. A ground needle electrode is inserted between the stimulating and recording needles. Caudal nerve is stimulated with a series of 20 pulses during 0.2 ms each at a supra-maximal intensity. The mean response of these 20 stimulations is included for statistical analysis.</p><p>- CMAP was measured in gastrocnemius or plantar muscle after stimulation of the sciatic nerve. For this purpose, stimulating electrodes are placed at the level of the sciatic nerve and recording electrodes are placed in the gastrocnemius or plantar muscle. A ground needle is inserted in either the contralateral paw. Sciatic nerve is stimulated with a single 0.2 ms pulse at a supra-maximal intensity. The amplitude (mV) and the distal latency (ms) of the responses are measured.</p></sec><sec><title>The open field test</title><p><italic>T</italic>he openfield test allows evaluation of anxiety and exploratory drive. Mice are tested in automated open fields (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). The open field arena is divided into central and peripheral regions. The open fields are placed in a room homogeneously illuminated at 150 Lux. Each mouse is placed in the periphery of the open field and allowed to explore freely the apparatus for 30 min, with the experimenter out of the animal's sight. The distance travelled, the number of rearing, and time spent in the central and peripheral regions are recorded over the test session. The latency and number of crosses into as well as the percent time spent in center area are used as indices of emotionality/anxiety</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>statistical analyses were performed using appropriate nonparametric statistical tools: mainly unpaired Mann-Whitney test. Qualitative parameters (e.g. clinical observations) were analyzed using &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>test. The level of significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DA carried out all the <italic>in vivo </italic>cellular studies, made the figures and participated in the draft of the manuscript.
