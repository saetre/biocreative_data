EcAlkB substrates include methylated bases, such as 1-methyladenine (m<sup>1</sup>A) and 3-methylcytosine (m<sup>3</sup>C), as well as certain bulkier lesions, for example the exocyclic adduct 1,<italic>N<sup>6</sup></italic>-ethenoadenine (&#x003b5;A). EcAlkB is the only bacterial AlkB protein characterized to date, and we here present an extensive bioinformatics and functional analysis of bacterial AlkB proteins. Based on sequence phylogeny, we show that these proteins can be subdivided into four groups: denoted 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B; each characterized by the presence of specific conserved amino acid residues in the putative nucleotide-recognizing domain. A scattered distribution of AlkB proteins from the four different groups across the bacterial kingdom indicates a substantial degree of horizontal transfer of AlkB genes. DNA repair activity was associated with all tested recombinant AlkB proteins. Notably, both a group 2B protein from <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> and a group 2A protein from <italic>Rhizobium etli</italic> repaired etheno adducts, but had negligible activity on methylated bases. Our data indicate that the majority, if not all, of the bacterial AlkB proteins are DNA repair enzymes, and that some of these proteins do not primarily target methylated bases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Alkylating agents can introduce several different types of deleterious lesions into the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. Such agents are abundant in the environment, e.g. in the form of methyl halides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Alkylating agents are also generated intracellularly as a result of normal cellular metabolism, and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine, which is the methyl donor in numerous enzyme-catalyzed methylation reactions, also induces a low level of aberrant methylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Endogenous methylating agents may also arise through cellular nitrosation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). To protect their genomes against the harmful effects of alkylating agents, living organisms possess several enzymes dedicated to remove alkylation damage from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Alkylation repair enzymes were first discovered in the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), where three different repair mechanisms have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The expression of repair proteins is up-regulated as an adaptive response to alkylation damage, governed by the alkylation sensitive transcription factor Ada. Each of the mechanisms is responsible for repairing a specific subset of the lesions introduced by alkylation. One such mechanism involves the <italic>E. coli</italic> AlkB protein (EcAlkB), which directly reverses alkylations at the N1-position of purines and the N3-position of pyrimidines, for example, 1-methyladenine (m<sup>1</sup>A) and 3-methylcytosine (m<sup>3</sup>C); the first EcAlkB substrates identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). EcAlkB belongs to the superfamily of iron(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent dioxygenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). As for other members of this superfamily, EcAlkB requires ferrous iron as cofactor and 2-oxoglutarate as cosubstrate, which is decarboxylated, leading to formation of succinate and CO<sub>2</sub>. EcAlkB uses molecular oxygen to oxidize a deleterious methyl group, and the resulting hydroxymethyl moiety is spontaneously released as formaldehyde, leading to the regeneration of the non-damaged base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The set of EcAlkB substrates has later been shown, in addition to m<sup>1</sup>A and m<sup>3</sup>C, to include the structurally analogous, but less abundant lesions 1-methylguanine and 3-methylthymine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). EcAlkB can also repair bulkier adducts such as ethyl and propyl groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), as well as exocyclic etheno and ethano adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>).</p><p>Multicellular organisms generally possess several different AlkB homologues (ALKBH), and initial bioinformatics studies identified eight such proteins in mammals, denoted ALKBH1-8 (initially named ABH1-8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In addition, it was recently found that the more distantly related obesity-associated protein FTO also is a functional ALKBH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). ALKBH2, ALKBH3 and FTO have been shown to possess a repair activity similar to that of EcAlkB, while two somewhat conflicting reports have implicated ALKBH1 both in epigenetic gene regulation and in repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The function of the remaining five proteins remains unknown, but there are indications that they may participate in processes other than DNA/RNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Interestingly, both EcAlkB and ALKBH3 also display activity on methyl lesions in RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and it has been shown that AlkB- or ALKBH3-mediated repair of tRNA and mRNA is accompanied by functional recovery of these molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Also, the genomes of some plant-infecting single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses encode AlkB homologues capable of removing methylation damage from RNA, strongly indicating that some members of the AlkB family are true RNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we have performed an extensive sequence analysis of bacterial AlkB proteins, and found that they can be subdivided into four distinct groups: 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B. A rather scattered distribution of AlkB proteins from the four resulting groups across the bacterial kingdom suggested a high degree of horizontal transfer of bacterial AlkB-encoding genes. We have functionally characterized nine bacterial AlkB proteins, representing all four groups. These proteins were investigated for their ability to repair alkylated nucleic acids in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and recombinant enzymes were also tested for <italic>in vitro</italic> repair activity. Finally, we discuss the likely functions of the AlkB proteins from the four defined groups in light of the results obtained by bioinformatics and experimental analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sequence analysis and construction of phylogenetic trees</title><p>The selected set of bacterial AlkB proteins was identified in the GenBank non-redundant (NR) protein sequence database (NCBI, NIH) using the PSI-BLAST program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).

Since then, the number of sequenced bacterial genomes has increased considerably, reflected by the &#x0223c;360 protein sequences retrieved through a new PSI-BLAST search. The phylogenetic tree based on an updated sequence alignment of bacterial AlkB proteins indicated that group 2 could be more appropriately subdivided into groups 2A and 2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Group 2A represents an outgroup, while group 2B appears to be related to group 1B.</p><p>The recently published three-dimensional structures of EcAlkB in complex with various substrates have identified key residues involved in substrate recognition, and showed that the 216 aa protein consists of the following three domains: an N-terminal extension (aa 1&#x02013;45) followed by a &#x02018;nucleotide-recognition lid&#x02019; (NRL; aa 46&#x02013;89), and a C-terminal dioxygenase domain, &#x02018;the catalytic core&#x02019; (aa 90&#x02013;216) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The dioxygenase domain is found in all members of the AlkB family of proteins and several conserved residues/motifs within this domain define the AlkB family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The NRL domain of EcAlkB is involved in binding the nucleic acid substrate, and appears to be unique to the AlkB proteins repairing DNA or RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The bacterial AlkBs are quite uniform in size (typically from 190 to 220 aa), and generally consist of a conserved dioxygenase domain and a less conserved N-terminal region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp774/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). We reasoned that this N-terminal part may contain key determinants of substrate specificity. To reveal possible similarities in this region, iterative PSI-BLAST searches were performed with the N-terminal part of different AlkB proteins as the initial query. It was found that group 1B members were retrieved in searches where this region from group 2B protein was the initial query, and vice versa. Accordingly, groups 1B and 2B proteins shared several conserved amino acids in the NRL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). When similar searches were performed with proteins from groups 1A and 2A, only proteins from the same group were retrieved. Although the iterative BLAST searches did not reveal sequence similarity between the N-terminal parts of the 1A and 1B proteins, they still appeared to share some conserved key residues in their NRL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), including residues of EcAlkB (Trp69 and Tyr76) that have been implicated in substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Notably, the regions of group 1B proteins displaying homology to group 1A or 2B proteins were non-overlapping and adjacent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The observation that the NRL domain of group 1B proteins displayed sequence homology to both 1A and 2B proteins suggested to us that proteins from these three groups may recognize similar substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence comparison of bacterial and eukaryotic AlkB proteins</title><p>ALKBH2 and ALKBH3, which are functional vertebrate homologues of EcAlkB, display the highest sequence similarity to bacterial AlkB proteins from group 1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Indeed, ALKBH2, ALKBH3 and group 1B bacterial AlkBs share numerous conserved residues in the region corresponding to the NRL domain of EcAlkB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Most of these residues are also shared between group 1B proteins and members of either group 1A or 2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; compare panels A and B), further supporting our hypothesis that proteins from these three groups may act on similar nucleic acid substrates. Notably, the NRL residues that in a recently published crystal structure of human ALKBH2 were shown to be in close contact with a m<sup>1</sup>A-containing dsDNA substrate, i.e. Arg110, Tyr122, Phe124 and Ser125 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), are all among these conserved, shared residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Moreover, Phe102 in ALKBH2, which was shown to be important for flipping out the damaged base from the dsDNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), is conserved as an aromatic residue in ALKBH2 and group 1B proteins, but not in ALKBH3 proteins, which are inactive on dsDNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), suggesting that group 1B proteins may also be active on dsDNA.</p><p>Among bacterial AlkB proteins, those from group 2A appeared as a small outgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), whose N-terminal part displayed little sequence similarity to proteins belonging to the other three groups. However, putative NRL domain of group 2A proteins displayed substantial homology to a corresponding region in ALKBH8 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), which are found in most multicellular eukaryotes and probably have a function other than DNA repair (see Discussion section).</p></sec><sec><title>Distribution of AlkB proteins across bacterial species</title><p>Many, but not all bacteria possess an AlkB protein, and an iterative PSI-BLAST search of 547 completely sequenced and annotated bacterial genomes using EcAlkB as query returned 215 bacterial AlkB proteins (as of February 2008), of which 186 remained after removal of the redundancy corresponding to different strains of the same bacterial species. Of these, 144 proteins were found in bacteria possessing a single AlkB protein, whereas the rest were found in species having two (18 species; 36 proteins) or three (2 species; 6 proteins) AlkB proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

In general, there is a good consistency within the dataset obtained for any given protein, and the data convincingly demonstrated that the groups 1A, 1B and 2B proteins all possess DNA repair activity. Also, one of the two tested group 2A proteins, RE-2A, displayed robust repair activity. Intriguingly, RE-2A and XC-2B, which are present in bacteria which also possess an AlkB from groups 1A or 1B, efficiently repaired etheno lesions in DNA, but displayed very low activity towards methyl adducts. <table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Summary of experiments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein</th><th colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1"><italic>In vivo</italic> experiments<hr/></th><th colspan="5" align="center" rowspan="1"><italic>In vitro</italic> experiments<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ssDNA (MMS)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ssDNA (CAA)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survival (MMS)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ssRNA (MMS)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<sup>3</sup>H]Me-ssDNA</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">dsDNA - m<sup>1</sup>A</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">dsDNA - m<sup>3</sup>C</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">dsDNA - &#x003b5;A</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ssDNA - &#x003b5;A</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SA-1A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC-1A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">XC-1B</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">RE-2A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MT-2B</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SA-2B</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC-2B</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">XC-2B</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF2"><p>++, activity comparable to, or slightly lower than, that of EcAlkB; +, substantially lower activity than EcAlkB; &#x02212;, no detectable activity.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><sec><title>Group 1A</title><p>The group 1A proteins are distributed among a wide range of bacteria, including all the AlkB-containing subdivisions of proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This group includes the founding member EcAlkB, and we have here studied two other members, SA-1A and SC-1A, which both come from the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, and are 79% identical on the protein sequence level. In accordance with this, the two proteins displayed very similar properties and they displayed robust repair activity in most of the assays. These data strengthen the notion that group 1A consists of proteins with a function similar to that of the founding member EcAlkB.</p></sec><sec><title>Group 1B</title><p>The group 1B proteins are primarily found in the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-subdivisions of proteobacteria, as well as in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). These proteins are similar to the ALKBH2/ALKBH3 proteins, which are vertebrate proteins with a similar repair activity as EcAlkB. Accordingly, the only group 1B protein studied here, XC-1B, displayed repair activity in all assays. Our bioinformatics and experimental analysis, therefore, indicates that group 1B proteins are repair proteins with a function similar to that of EcAlkB.</p></sec><sec><title>Group 2B</title><p>Group 2B AlkB proteins are generally found in actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, they are also found in some, but not all, subspecies of the root-associated plant pathogens <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> (&#x003b3;-proteobacteria) and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (&#x003b2;-proteobacteria), which may have acquired their AlkBs by horizontal transfer from actinobacteria, most of which are soil bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Protein sequence analysis revealed that the proteins in groups 1B and 2B shared several conserved residues in the NRL region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), implying also the group 2B proteins in DNA repair. Indeed, the investigated group 2B proteins, MT-2B, SA-2B, SC-2B and XC-2B, displayed repair activity in most of the assays. However, the substrate specificity of these proteins was quite diverse, ranging from a protein (MT-2B) with high activity towards methyl lesions and low activity on etheno adducts, to the opposite (XC-2B).</p></sec><sec><title>Group 2A</title><p>The group 2A proteins are primarily found in the &#x003b1;-subdivision of proteobacteria, such as <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, <italic>Rickettsia</italic> and <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Several of these bacteria are plant pathogens that invade their hosts, and exhibit substantial DNA exchange with the host cell. In addition, <italic>Roseobacter denitrificans</italic>, which also has a group 2A AlkB protein, is a marine bacterium which populates the surfaces of green seaweeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Interestingly, group 2A AlkBs from several bacteria (<italic>R. denitrificans, R. etli, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Sinorhizobium medicae</italic>) reside on plasmids rather than on the chromosome, suggesting that they may have been acquired from the host genome.</p><p>The group 2A AlkBs share strong homology with the ALKBH8 proteins from plants and animals, which, by bioinformatics analysis, have been implicated in tRNA modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This may suggest that group 2A proteins are involved in tRNA modification rather than in repair, in agreement with our inability to measure any repair activity for AT-2A, but in apparent disagreement with the observed activity of RE-2A on etheno adducts. However, compared to AT-2A, RE-2A is considerably more distantly related to the eukaryotic ALKBH8 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), and this protein may, conceivably, have evolved from a tRNA modification enzyme into a repair protein. Unfortunately, due to its insolubility when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we were not able to investigate the enzymatic activity of AT-2A.</p></sec><sec><title>Distribution of bacterial AlkB proteins</title><p>Our phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that the phylogeny of bacterial AlkB protein sequences is very different from that of the bacterial 16S RNA sequences, indicating that a substantial degree of horizontal transfer of bacterial AlkB genes has occurred. In particular, several bacterial genera exist in which closely related species possess very different AlkB proteins.</p><p>The somewhat patchy distribution of AlkB proteins across bacterial species is similar to what is observed in the case of plant-infecting RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). It has been suggested that viruses exposed to a particularly high exogenous load of methylation damage may selectively have acquired AlkBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Similarly, bacteria exposed to relatively high doses of methylating agents may profit from possessing the AlkB function, whereas bacteria experiencing less methylation damage may have disposed of this function, or never acquired it, resulting in an uneven distribution of AlkBs among bacterial species.</p><p>The lack of an AlkB function in many bacteria may also be explained by the fact that certain bacteria have translesion DNA polymerases that can efficiently bypass AlkB-substrates, such as m<sup>1</sup>A and m<sup>3</sup>C, or that these lesions are repaired through other cellular functions. Indeed, it was recently found that the DNA alkylbase glycosylase AlkA from the archaeon <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic>, which was active on typical AlkA substrates such as 3-methyladenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), also acted on the AlkB substrates m<sup>1</sup>A and m<sup>3</sup>C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Generally, archaea do not possess AlkB proteins and it may be that all bacteria lacking AlkB compensate for this by possessing a DNA alkylbase glycosylase active on m<sup>1</sup>A and m<sup>3</sup>C. Another possible explanation for the apparent lack of AlkB-encoding sequences in some bacteria is that functional AlkB homologues may exist that are not readily identifiable by current bioinformatics approaches.</p><p>The O<sub>2</sub>-dependent AlkB mechanism will not be applicable in obligate anaerobic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Thus, AlkB genes appear to be absent from typical anaerobes, e.g. <italic>Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Desulfitobacterium, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Propionobacterium</italic> and <italic>Thermotoga ssp</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Function of bacterial AlkB proteins</title><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the N-terminal part of the Ada protein (AdaA) is an alkylation sensitive transcription factor which mediates the up-regulation of AlkB and other alkylation repair proteins in an adaptive response to alkylation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Moreover, Ada and AlkB are in <italic>E. coli</italic> part of the same operon, being encoded by a common transcript. To investigate the possible involvement of AdaA in regulating the expression of the various bacterial AlkB proteins, we first found, by BLAST searches, that the genomes of <italic>M. tuberculosis, R. etli, S. avermitilis S. coelicolor</italic>, and <italic>X. campestris</italic> all encoded an AdaA homologue (data not shown). However, <italic>adaA</italic> did not form an operon with <italic>alkB</italic> in these bacteria, but rather (in all cases except <italic>R. etli</italic>) with the genes encoding the alkylbase glycosylase AlkA and DNA alkyltransferase Ogt. Moreover, the <italic>alkB</italic> genes were generally not localized adjacent to genes implicated in alkylation repair (data not shown). Thus, the possible role of AdaA in regulating the expression of these AlkB proteins may best be addressed by studying the inducibility of the relevant genes in response to various alkylating agents.</p><p>The results of the present study indicate that most bacterial AlkBs have low activity on RNA, and that AlkB-mediated RNA repair is rare, if not absent, in bacteria. This is also supported by the observation that the activity of EcAlkB on RNA substrates is &#x0223c;10-fold lower than on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Bacterial mRNAs are turned over very rapidly and may not acquire substantial methylation damage during their life-time, thus obviating the need for repair. We rather favor the idea that AlkB-mediated RNA repair may be important in the case of RNAs with a considerably longer lifespan, such as the genomes of RNA viruses or long-lived mRNA species in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Due to the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of etheno adducts, their formation and repair has been subject of extensive studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Several different repair mechanisms have been shown to target etheno adducts, but these also act on additional substrates, thus making it hard to address the significance of the observed activity. Indeed, EcAlkB and the mammalian homologue ALKBH2, have similar or stronger activity on m<sup>1</sup>A than on etheno adducts, and the alkylbase DNA glycosylases AlkA (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and AAG (mammals) prefer 3-methyladenine over etheno lesions. Thus, two of the proteins studied here, RE-2A and XC-2B, represents the first alkylation repair enzymes which are active on etheno adducts, but with low or no activity on methylated bases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our experiments firmly demonstrate that most, if not all, bacterial AlkB proteins are DNA repair enzymes. Moreover, they indicate that some AlkB proteins preferentially target etheno adducts, and that the proteins within each group do not represent an identical repair function. Conceivably, AlkB proteins have the ability to evolve different specificities, governed by the type and amount of damaging agents encountered by the individual bacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp774/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>FRIBIOMOL and FUGE programs of the Research Council of Norway and the Intramural Research Program of the National Library of Medicine at the <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source>.
