Although its etiology remains to be elucidated, pathological evidence indicates that, in addition to the characteristic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, significant brain inflammatory changes, featured with exaggerated gliosis and increased proinflammatory cytokines, are an important component of the pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Inflammation is a double-edged sword. For instance in AD, an appropriate degree of inflammatory reaction may be beneficial for clearance of aggregated proteins and/or degenerated cells. However, if the inflammation is overly reactive, the secondary inflammatory neuronal damage may become a driving force for the disease, as appears to be the case in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to understand what factors may exaggerate the brain inflammation in AD so that corresponding therapeutic approaches can be developed to ameliorate such changes.</p><p>The extent of inflammatory reactions may be regulated by a variety of factors, such as proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, complement systems, and others. In AD, fibrillar &#x003b2;-amyloid (A&#x003b2;) has been shown to directly activate microglial cells and result in increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, it can activate the complement system to generate C3a and C5a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Moreover, fibrillar A&#x003b2; accumulation is associated with increased levels of many chemokines and chemokine receptors, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCR2 ligand), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (CCR3 ligand), interferon-inducible protein-10 (CXCR3 ligand), IL-8 (ligand for CXCXR1 and CXCR2) and CCR1/3/5. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Amongst the inflammatory regulators associated with AD, there is one large category that exerts their cellular effects through heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These include all the chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study, we showed that deficiency of membrane GPCR kinase-5 (GRK5) occurs during early AD, and the GRK5 deficiency contributes to augmented microglial activation <italic>in vitro </italic>via impaired sensitization of relevant GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. GRK5 is one of seven GRK family members, whose primary function is to desensitize activated GPCRs by phosphorylating the activated receptor to promote uncoupling of receptor-dependent G-protein activation and by initiating receptor internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, the lack of membrane (functional) GRK5 resulted in prolonged signaling and enhanced microglial activation, which well explained the phenomena that we observed in the cultured microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Moreover, we speculated that the same phenomena might also take place <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, our later study in GRK5 deficient mice (GRK5KO), an animal model resembling the functional GRK5 deficiency in AD, failed to show any sign of microgliosis, except for moderate increase in axonal defects and synaptic degenerative changes in these animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The negative <italic>in vivo </italic>data appeared to be inconsistent with our earlier <italic>in vitro </italic>data. Nonetheless, a hallmark of GRK action is to function only after GPCRs are activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In other words, whether or not an impact of GRK5 deficiency on a particular stimulus can be revealed depends on whether or not such a stimulus is present. We have reported that, although the GRK5 deficiency indeed caused a mild increase of A&#x003b2; level, no fibrillar A&#x003b2; deposits or any significant signs of microglial activation were observed in the GRK5KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, we speculated that one reason for the absence of microgliosis in these animals might be due to lack of inflammatory initiators, such as fibrillar A&#x003b2;, or any of the downstream chemokines or anaphylatoxins.</p><p>In this study, we crossbred the GRK5KO mice with TgAPPsw (Tg2576) mice. TgAPPsw mice overexpress human &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein (&#x003b2;APP) carrying Swedish double mutations, and have been shown to display fibrillar A&#x003b2; deposition and moderate levels of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the resultant TgAPPsw mice deficient in GRK5 should provide an ideal model to determine if our previous speculations are correct, and GRK5 deficiency plays a significant role in enhancing brain inflammation in AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>GRK5KO mice were generated by targeted deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the GRK5 gene, encoding critical sub-elements I through III of the protein kinase catalytic domain, as detailed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Heterozygous GRK5KO mice (C57/BL6 background) were bred with TgAPPsw (Tg2576) mice (also with a C57/BL6 background) to produce wild type (WT, APPsw<sup>-/-</sup>/GRK5<sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>n </italic>= 6), GRK5KO (APPsw<sup>-/-</sup>/GRK5<sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>n </italic>= 6), TgAPPsw (APPsw<sup>+/-</sup>/GRK5<sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>n </italic>= 6), and the double (APPsw<sup>+/-</sup>/GRK5<sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>n </italic>= 6) mice for this study. Due to known gender difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] [Li, 2008, BRB-submitted], only female mice (18-month old) were used in this study. A tail DNA preparation was used for genotyping as described below. All procedures for using these animals were approved by the KCVAMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping</title><p>Mouse-tail DNA was prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the tail genomic DNA with five different primers together: two human APP-specific primers, 5'CGGAGGAGGATGACTCGGAT3' and 5'CAGCTGCTGTCTCTCGTTGG3', which amplify a 500 bp DNA fragment, were used to identify the presence of the human APP transgene; three additional primers specific for WT murine GRK5 (425 bp) and the GRK5KO loci (200 bp) (5'CAAGTGTGAGGTAGGGTACAGAAT3', 5'CTATCCATTCACCTCCATGCTCCC3', and 5'AACTCTGGTACAGACAGGATCTCT3') were used to identify the presence of WT or the targeted murine GRK5 gene. The PCR used a 20 &#x003bc;l reaction volume containing 1.25 units of Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 200 &#x003bc;M dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 250 nM of each of the APP preimers and 1 &#x003bc;M of each of the three GRK5 primers. The amplification protocol entailed 35 cycles of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 15 s, annealing at 62&#x000b0;C for 15 s and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 15 s, and then followed by a 10-min final extension at 72&#x000b0;C. The PCR products (10 &#x003bc;l) were then analyzed and visualized on 1.5% agarose gels.

To minimize experimental variations, multi-brain embedding and sectioning techniques were adapted according to previously published procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Briefly, twenty-four left hemispheres (including six from each genotype) were embedded into six blocks, with each block containing one hemisphere from each of the WT, GRK5KO, APP and the double mice, respectively. The multi-brain embedding allows the subsequent sectioning and staining procedures for all samples in a single block to be performed in a unified condition, which reduces variations that often occur when each brain is manipulated separately. Frozen sections were taken at a thickness of 20 &#x003bc;m in the coronal plane through the hemispheres. All sections were collected sequentially into eight groups with 160 &#x003bc;m intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescent (IF) staining</title><p>IF staining was performed on the multi-brain sections as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The only difference was the target antibody used: mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to human A&#x003b2; (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX; 1:600), rat mAb to CD45 (MCA1388, Clone: IBL-3/16, Serotec, Raleigh, NC; 1:25), rat mAb to mouse CD11b (Mac-1, Clone: M1/70.15, Serotec, Raleigh, NC; 1:25), mouse mAb to CD11b/c (Clone MRC OX-42, Serotec, Raleigh, NC; 1:25), rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) to human IL-1&#x003b2; (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:25), mAb to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) conjugated to Cy3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO;1:200), or rabbit pAb to IL-6 (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL; 1:100). DAPI (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) was used to detect nuclei.</p></sec><sec><title>Image Analysis</title><p>For quantitative image analysis, serial coronal sections taken from 1.70 to 3.16 mm posterior to the bregma were examined for CD45<sup>+ </sup>microglia and GFAP<sup>+ </sup>astrocytes. Six animals from each group were evaluated. For each animal, antigens were detected in 5 parallel multi-brain sections having a defined distance of 160 &#x003bc;m and showing both the hippocampus and cortex. In each section, the hippocampus and the cortex were evaluated for the number of stained cells, and integral staining density (sum of all individual optical densities of each pixel in the area being measured). Images were acquired as digitized tiff files to retain maximal resolution using a Leica DMI 6000 B microscope microscope at 100 &#x000d7; final magnification with an attached digital camera system (Leica DFC 340 FX, Heerbrugg, Germany). The digital images were then routed into a Windows PC for quantitative analyses using Image-Pro Plus software, with the examiner blinded to sample identifiers. To maintain consistency across animals, a rectangular box (0.42 &#x000d7; 0.26 mm) was centered over the area of interest. Except for fewer sections used, all other quantifying procedures were the same as stereological quantification. The final results were shown as number of immunopositive cells or immunoreactivity per mm<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>At euthanasia, the cold PBS-perfused right hemispheres were further dissected into anterior cortex, posterior cortex, striatum, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum.

Only heterozygotes were used in this study, which included four genotype groups: WT control (APPsw<sup>-/-</sup>/GRK5<sup>+/+</sup>), GRK5KO heterozygote control (APPsw<sup>-/-</sup>/GRK5<sup>+/-</sup>), TgAPPsw (APPsw<sup>+/-</sup>/GRK5<sup>+/+</sup>) and the double (APPsw<sup>+/-</sup>/GRK5<sup>+/-</sup>) mice. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, inactivation of one copy of the GRK5 gene resulted in at least 50% down-regulation of the GRK5 expression at the protein level in the heterozygote GRK5KO and the double mice.</p><p>Evaluation of potential changes in brain inflammation was performed in 18-month old female mice, due to the known gender impact in these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] [Li, 2008, BRB-submitted]. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against microglial and astrocyte markers was employed to reveal changes in microgliosis and astrogliosis. Our initial examination with antibody against CD45, a surface marker of microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], revealed an increase of microgliosis in both hippocampal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>) and cortical (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;H</xref>) areas of the double mice as compared to the TgAPPsw mice. Subsequent characterization of the microgliosis showed that, consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], CD45<sup>+ </sup>microglial cells were largely located surrounding or near A&#x003b2; deposits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref>). Staining with a rat mAb to CD11b (Mac-1), another well-established microglial and macrophage marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], revealed similar changes of microglia in these animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;F</xref>). In addition, a mouse mAb OX-42 to CD11b/c also decorated the activated microglial cells in a way similar to anti-CD45 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). However, at least in our experiments, OX-42 appeared to non-specifically stain the A&#x003b2; plaques, in addition to its positive staining for microglial cells. It has been previously established that activated microglial cells, at least at the early phase, produce IL-1&#x003b2;, an important proinflammatory cytokine that participates in a self-sustained vicious cycle to amplify the inflammatory neuronal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Our examination revealed that, although less profound than CD45 immunoreactivity (IR), IL-1&#x003b2;-IR was indeed found near or surrounding the A&#x003b2; plaques (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>) and was colocalized with CD45<sup>+ </sup>microglial cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>). Therefore, the microgliosis in the double mice displayed similar traits to that observed in other AD transgenic models, except for the exaggerated extent.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Increased CD45<sup>+ </sup>microglial cells in hippocampus and cortex of the TgAPPsw mice with reduced GRK5</bold>.

Our quantitative image analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) showed that, as compared to the WT mice, both the TgAPPsw and the double mice displayed significantly more CD45<sup>+ </sup>microglial cells in both of the examined brain regions (p &#x0003c; 0.001 for all); when compared to the TgAPPsw mice, the double mice had approximately double the number of CD45<sup>+ </sup>microglial cells, in both hippocampus and cortex (P &#x0003c; 0.001). In addition, the heterozygote GRK5KO mice did not show any significant changes in the number of CD45<sup>+ </sup>microglial cells, as compared to the WT, which is consistent with our previous report for the negative finding of brain inflammation in the GRK5KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. When two-way ANOVA was used to analyze interactions between the two gene modifications (over-expression of human APPsw and inactivation of one copy of the murine GRK5 gene), a significance of p &#x0003c; 0.001 was revealed. Meanwhile, the changes caused by both gene modifications in the double mice were significantly higher than the sum of the changes caused by APPsw over-expression in TgAPPsw and by GRK5 gene inactivation in GRK5KO mice (p = 0.003 for hippocampus and p &#x0003c; 0.001 for cortex). These results indicate that the two gene modifications synergistically interact with each other, and both contribute the microgliosis observed in the double mice.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Quantification of CD45<sup>+ </sup>microglial cells in hippocampus and cortex of the TgAPPsw mice with reduced GRK5</bold>.

We found more hypertrophic astrocytes brightly stained with anti-GFAP in both hippocampus and cortex from the double mice as compared to the TgAPPsw mice, and both the double mice and the TgAPPsw mice showed more hypertrophic astrocytes than the WT or heterozygous GRK5KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;H</xref>). Further characterization of the astrogliosis in the double mice revealed that although some of the hypertrophic astrocytes located near A&#x003b2; plaques (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C</xref>), compared to the relation of microglia to A&#x003b2; plaques, hypertrophic astrocytes were more widespread in the entire brain region.

Quantitative image analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) indicated that both the TgAPPsw and the double mice showed significantly more GFAP<sup>+ </sup>astrocytes in the hippocampus and cortex (p &#x0003c; 0.001 for all) as compared to either the WT or the heterozygous GRK5KO mice; furthermore, the double mice displayed greater numbers of astrocytes than that in the TgAPPsw mice (p &#x0003c; 0.01 for hippocampus and p &#x0003c; 0.001 for cortex).

Because of this, counting the number of GFAP<sup>+ </sup>astrocytes may not accurately reflect the extent of the astrogliosis. Therefore, a quantitative image analysis of GFAP-IR intensity was also performed in parallel to the GFAP<sup>+ </sup>cell counting. The results were similar to those from simple cell number counting, except that the significance was more striking (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). The double gene modification effects were significantly higher than the sum of the each single gene alone for both hippocampus (p = 0.006) and cortex (p = 0.009). The interactions between the two gene modifications were also highly significant for both brain regions (p = 0.002 for hippocampus, and p = 0.005 for cortex). Therefore, these results suggest that Swedish mutated APP gene over-expression and GRK5 deficiency synergistically interact with each other to promote the astrogliosis observed in the double mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>By analyzing the extent of gliosis in the brains of TgAPPsw mice with normal or reduced GRK5 expression, we demonstrated that the TgAPPsw mice with reduced GRK5 displayed significantly exaggerated microgliosis and astrogliosis. Consistent with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], GRK5 deficiency alone does not lead to any significant inflammatory changes in either the heterozygote or homozygote GRK5KO mice. However, when an inflammation is present, as evoked by overexpression of the Swedish mutated APP gene, the GRK5 deficiency synergistically interacts with the active inflammatory processes and leads to amplified inflammatory responses. Such phenomena are consistent with the manner of GRK action, as GRKs are not thought to induce signals directly, but rather, they primarily modify the activity of activated GPCRs by uncoupling the receptor from G-protein, and initialing receptor internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the GRK5KO mice, the reason why we did not observe a significant inflammation is likely because there was no an active inflammatory signaling for the GRK5 to act on. In the double mice, however, when Swedish mutated APP was overexpressed, the accumulation of fibrillar A&#x003b2; initiated a complex of active inflammatory processes, which provided an opportunity to reveal impact of GRK5 deficiency. As demonstrated in this study, inactivation of one copy of the native GRK5 gene led to approximately doubled extent of microgliosis and significantly exaggerated astrogliosis. Therefore, these <italic>in vivo </italic>results strongly support the model that GRK5 deficiency indeed plays a significant role in amplifying the brain inflammatory responses in AD, as we previously speculated.</p><p>Since the primary role of GRKs is to desensitize GPCRs and dampen the activated GPCRs signaling, deficiency of GRK5 may lead to hyperactivity of those GPCRs that are specifically regulated by GRK5. As previously demonstrated, the fibrillar A&#x003b2; can initiate a complicated inflammatory process, which may include increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and activated complement components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is known that receptors for all chemokines and the anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a are GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In fact, even fibrillar A&#x003b2; itself has been shown to activate GPCRs, such as macrophage scavenger receptor, or formyl chemotactic receptor 2 (FPR2 or FPRL-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, theoretically, all these GPCRs could be potential substrates for GRK5. On the other hand, however, the substrate spectrums for different GRK members may overlap, and the lost function due to deficiency of one GRK member may be largely compensated by other GRK members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Only when the lost function cannot be fully compensated, a phenotype relevant to the specific GPCR signaling can then be revealed. For example, GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6 KO mice have been shown to display selectively impaired desensitization of adrenergic, muscarinic and dopaminergic receptors, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, information regarding the specific regulation of GRK5 on most, if not all, of the GPCRs involved in the fibrillar A&#x003b2; initiated inflammatory processes, particularly the <italic>in vivo </italic>data, is unavailable. Therefore, further investigations are warranted to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms by which the GRK5 deficiency exaggerates the brain inflammation in the TgAPPsw mice.</p><p>The main purpose of this study was to determine whether or not GRK5 deficiency <italic>in vivo </italic>contributes to exaggerate brain inflammation, and the results confirmed the positive role of GRK5 deficiency in the TgAPPsw mice. In the meantime, the fact that the double mice displayed significantly stronger inflammatory changes than those in the TgAPPsw mice makes the double mice a distinct model from the original TgAPPsw mice. It has been suggested that inflammatory responses in currently available APP transgenic mouse models, including the TgAPPsw mice, are not as strong as those in human AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, at least in resembling the strength of the inflammatory responses in AD, the TgAPPsw mice with reduced GRK5 may be a better model than the single TgAPPsw mice, and should serve as an additional AD animal model for relevant studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has demonstrated that GRK5 deficiency <italic>in vivo </italic>significantly exaggerates the microgliosis and astrogliosis in the presence of an inflammatory initiator, the excess fibrillar A&#x003b2; and the subsequent active brain inflammatory reactions in the TgAPPsw mice. In the absence of an active inflammatory response, however, the effects of the GRK5 deficiency on inflammation <italic>in vivo </italic>remain silent. These findings, along with our previous findings for the role of GRK5 deficiency in promoting axonal defects and synaptic degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] [Li, 2008, BRB-submitted], strongly support that the hypothesis that GRK5 deficiency plays a significant role in AD pathogenesis. In addition, the TgAPPsw mouse combined with deficient GRK5 is a better model than the single TgAPPsw mouse, due to a stronger resemblance to the strength of the inflammatory responses in AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AD: Alzheimer's disease; A&#x003b2;: &#x003b2;-amyloid; GPCRs: G-protein coupled receptors; GRK5: GPCR kinase-5; GRK5KO: GRK5 knockout; &#x003b2;APP: &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; IF: Immunofluorescent; mAb: monoclonal antibody; pAb: polyclonal antibody; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; IL-1&#x003b2;: interleukin-1beta; IL-6: interleukin-6; IR, immunoreactivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LL carried out the pathological studies, performed the statistical analysis, and participated in the maintenance of the transgenic mice and initial drafting of the manuscript, JL participated in the establishment and maintenance of the transgenic mouse colonies, WZS designed the study, supervised and coordinated the experimental conduction, and helped to draft the manuscript.
