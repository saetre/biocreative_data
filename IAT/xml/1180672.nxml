DNA-binding domain A in the large subunit of human RPA (hRPA70A) binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is responsible for the species-specific RPA&#x02013;T antigen (T-ag) interaction required for Simian virus 40 replication. Although <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RPA70A (scRPA70A) shares high sequence homology with hRPA70A, the two are not functionally equivalent. To elucidate the similarities and differences between these two homologous proteins, we determined the solution structure of scRPA70A, which closely resembled the structure of hRPA70A. The structure of ssDNA-bound scRPA70A, as simulated by residual dipolar coupling-based homology modeling, suggested that the positioning of the ssDNA is the same for scRPA70A and hRPA70A, although the conformational changes that occur in the two proteins upon ssDNA binding are not identical. NMR titrations of hRPA70A with T-ag showed that the T-ag binding surface is separate from the ssDNA-binding region and is more neutral than the corresponding part of scRPA70A. These differences might account for the species-specific nature of the hRPA70A&#x02013;T-ag interaction. Our results provide insight into how these two homologous RPA proteins can exhibit functional differences, but still both retain their ability to bind ssDNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Replication protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding (SSB) protein that is likely to be the eukaryotic equivalent of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> SSB protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). RPA is involved in many aspects of eukaryotic DNA metabolism, such as DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair and genetic recombination [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)].</p><p>In humans, as in other eukaryotes, RPA consists of three distinct, evolutionarily well-conserved subunits, RPA70 (70 kDa), RPA32 (32 kDa) and RPA14 (14 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). RPA70 interacts with ssDNA as well as with other proteins, such as XPA and Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The SSB activity of human RPA70 (hRPA70) resides mainly in the central region of the protein (amino acid residues 175&#x02013;420, called hRPA70AB), which also interacts with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The N-terminal domain (residues &#x0223c;1&#x02013;170) participates in specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions, and the C-terminal domain (residues &#x0223c;450&#x02013;616) interacts with hRPA32 and hRPA14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). hRPA32, which is regulated by cell-cycle-dependent N-terminal phosphorylation, can also bind to ssDNA and interacts with several protein partners, such as XPA and Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RPA (scRPA) has also been studied not only with biochemical methods, but also with a genetic approach. The scRPA70 subunit also bears the major SSB activity in its central part (scRPA70AB; residues 180&#x02013;416), and the composition of its domains is matched precisely with that of hRPA70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). scRPA has similar ssDNA-binding properties to human RPA. It can interact with ssDNA non-sequence specifically, keeping preference to polypyrimidine, such as hRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Genetic studies in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> have shown that the genes encoding all three RPA subunits are essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Mutational analyses with scRPA revealed that some mutants are defective in intrachromosomal recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), the recombinational repair of induced double-stranded breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), whereas others exhibit either mutator phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) or a stimulation of recombination among direct repeats, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and methyl methanesulfonate sensitivities, growth thermosensitivity and replication defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). From the results of these genetic studies, several hypotheses regarding the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of scRPA have been put forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). However, the absence of 3D structures for each of the proteins that make up the scRPA complex has made these hypotheses difficult to prove.</p><p>Although the two RPA homologs from human and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> are highly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), one should be careful not to apply what is known about the structure of hRPA to scRPA, because the two proteins are not functionally equivalent. First, antibodies to hRPA do not cross-react with scRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). This indicates that the surface antigens of the homologs vary significantly. Second, none of the genes that encode the three subunits of hRPA can complement the corresponding null mutations in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Third, hRPA can support Simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, while scRPA cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>In an <italic>in vitro</italic> SV40 replication system, RPA is required for SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag)-dependent, origin-dependent unwinding of the SV40 origin of replication. During initiation, RPA interacts with the SV40 T-ag and the DNA polymerase &#x003b4;&#x02013;primase complex (Pol/Prim) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), resulting in the formation of an initiation complex at the replication origin. Physical interactions between RPA, T-ag and Pol/Prim are necessary for the initiation of SV40 DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and for the function of RPA in the elongation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Moreover, hRPA is required for the initiation of DNA replication (which is detected by the synthesis of small RNA primers by Pol/Prim), and it cannot be replaced by scRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), suggesting a specific role for hRPA in SV40 DNA replication. T-ag was shown to bind to RPA through the major ssDNA-binding domain in hRPA70 and possibly through the C-terminus of RPA32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The mapped RPA-binding site in SV40 T-ag is embedded within the origin DNA-binding domain (OBD) of T antigen, whose solution structure is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Finally, it has been reported that scRPA has a reduced binding affinity for SV40 T-ag compared with hRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Given this collection of findings, we deemed that any new structural information for scRPA70A (residues 181&#x02013;294; DNA-binding domain A in RPA70 from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>) can be used, not only for explaining the molecular bases of the scRPA70A genetic studies, but also for providing clues to elucidate how these closely related proteins function so differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we determined the solution structure of the free form of scRPA70A by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and deduced a model of its ssDNA-bound forms employing residual dipolar coupling (RDC)-based homology modeling. Comparison with the hRPA70A structure indicated that the ssDNA-binding regions are conserved through evolution, even though the conformational changes that occur upon ssDNA binding are not identical. Chemical shift perturbation experiments with the SV40 T-ag OBD indicated that the SV40 T-ag OBD interaction surface on RPA70 is separated from the RPA70 ssDNA-binding site. These results provide insight into the mechanisms by which these two homologous domains differ in their ability to interact with T-ag, while displaying similarities in their modes of ssDNA binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sample preparations</title><p>The gene encoding scRPA70A(<italic>RPA70</italic><sub>181&#x02013;294</sub>) was cloned into the pET14b vector as an N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion (Novagen), and the construct was used to transform <italic>E.coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3)pLysS.

A final set of 22 lowest energy structures was selected from 100 calculations. There were no violations larger than 0.2 &#x0212b; and 5&#x000b0; for the NOEs and dihedral angles, respectively. The superimposed backbone traces of 22 structures were well aligned, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, where residues in the loops (residues 213&#x02013;217 and residues 265&#x02013;274) and residues at the N-terminus (residues 181&#x02013;196) and C-terminus (residues 290&#x02013;294) were somewhat scattered, probably because they are flexible in nature (see Supplementary Figure 1). The root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for backbone heavy atoms in residues in regular secondary elements was 0.90 &#x0212b; and for all heavy atoms was 1.02 &#x0212b;. The solution structure of scRPA70A was deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 1YNX).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows a ribbon diagram of the lowest energy structure of scRPA70A, revealing that the domain has a typical oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold, which consists of five stranded &#x003b2;-barrel and one &#x003b1;-helix. As expected from the high sequence similarity, the architecture of scRPA70A closely resembled the crystal structure of hRPA70A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). The C&#x003b1; atoms in the secondary structural part of the scRPA70A structure were superimposed with their equivalents in the hRPA70A. The r.m.s.d. for the C&#x003b1; atoms between two proteins was 1.58 &#x0212b;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows a superposition of scRPA70A and hRPA70A. While the regular structural regions were well aligned each other, the L12 and L45 loops showed bigger differences. The L12 loop of scRPA70A was bent into the core of the molecule, while the corresponding region of hRPA70A had a rather straight orientation. In contrast, the L45 loop of scRPA70A showed a more opened conformation compared with that of hRPA70A. However, the spacing of the two loops in scRPA70A did not differ significantly from that of the human protein, because the two loops of scRPA70A were shifted forward.</p><p>Although the flexible loops of scRPA70A and hRPA70A showed some differences, the structural and sequence comparisons of the two proteins suggested similar modes of ssDNA binding. In hRPA70A crystal structure, intimate contacts with ssDNA were made by R210, R216, R234, F238, Q263, F269 and E277. These amino acids are conserved or conservatively substituted in scRPA70A (described in detail below). A previous report that hRPA70NAB (the N-terminal region and RPA70AB) has nearly identical DNA-binding properties (the occluded binding site size and binding affinity) to scRPA70NAB, where the largest distinction observed between the two fragments was a 2-fold difference in affinity for (dT)<sub>30</sub>, also suggest that structural differences in the flexible loops of the homologous proteins do not significantly influence the ssDNA-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction with ssDNA</title><p>In order to address the conformational rearrangement of scRPA70A upon ssDNA binding, we performed RDC-based homology modeling for the scRPA70A&#x02013;ssDNA complex instead of doing the traditional NOE-based structure calculations. We considered that it would be difficult to assign resonances of ssDNA and to obtain intermolecular NOEs in a ssDNA&#x02013;protein complex. Chou <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) first demonstrated that the dipolar refinement protocol can be used to define large conformational rearrangements that may take place when sample conditions are altered. The protocol was applied to the protein calmodulin, which experiences a conformational change upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. We hypothesized that ssDNA binding to scRPA70A induces observable conformational changes in the protein. So we applied the same strategy used for calmodulin to the scRPA70A&#x02013;ssDNA complex. The calculated free scRPA70A structures were used as the starting model, and the measured dipolar coupling restraints of the scRPA70A&#x02013;ssDNA complex were used in two sequential low-temperature, simulated annealing procedures. In order to exclude the pitfalls of potential effects of conformational averaging on the magnitude of the observed RDCs, in the calculation, we did not include the RDC values of the residues in the tip of L12 and L45 loops, which are known to be flexible. Also, we performed an <sup>15</sup>N relaxation study for the validation of the model (see Supplementary Figure 1).</p><p>The magnitudes of the normalized dipolar couplings in the complex at a pf1 concentration of 10 mg/ml ranged from &#x02212;16.0 to 19.0 Hz. Using the histogram approach, the alignment tensor magnitude, <italic>D</italic><sub>a</sub>, was estimated at 9.5 with a rhombicity, <italic>R</italic>, of 0.37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). After the second simulated annealing, we selected the lowest energy structure and analyzed the backbone &#x003d5;, &#x003c8; angles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows the angle differences between the lowest energy structure of free scRPA70A and of the ssDNA-bound form. The residues in the L12 and L45 loops showed large differences in both the &#x003d5; and &#x003c8; angles. The data were consistent with the chemical shift perturbation of scRPA70A observed in the presence of TT-10 ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results imply that ssDNA binding to scRPA70A effects changes to amino acid residues in the L12 and L45 loops. Superimposition of backbone traces (excluding the turns and loops) of the RDC-based model with the lowest energy structure of free scRPA70A yielded an r.m.s.d. of 1.56 &#x0212b;.</p><p>From studies of the crystal structure of hRPA70AB, the internal flexibility of the various domains has been addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In the case of hRPA70B (residues &#x0223c;305&#x02013;422), the L12 and L45 loops showed large shifts upon ssDNA binding. In contrast, for hRPA70A, conformational changes upon ssDNA binding were observed only in L12; the L45 loop did not move significantly, possibly because of a crystal packing effect. However, a dynamics study of hRPA70A using NMR relaxations showed that both the L12 and L45 loops are flexible in the absence of ssDNA and that their motions are influenced by ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). From the structure calculations of the free form of scRPA70A and <sup>15</sup>N relaxation study, we found that the L12 and L45 loops of scRPA70A also have internal flexibilities (see Supplementary Figure 1). Similar to the phenomenon observed for hRPA70A, the main conformational changes in scRPA70A upon ssDNA binding occurred in the two loops, L12 and L45. While the L12 loop showed only moderate reorientation, larger changes were observed in the L45 region. Amino acid residues in the &#x003b2;4&#x02032; region (A260, K261, L262 and Q263) showed large displacements upon ssDNA binding, which moved the L45 loop closer to the L12 loop, compared with the free scRPA70A structure. The loop movement observed for scRPA70A was similar to that which occurs in hRPA70A. Therefore, these results show that the RDC-based homology modeling method is suitable for the detection of conformational changes in the protein partner upon ssDNA binding.</p><p>Because we used only RDC constraints for the backbone bonds, it was hard to address the precise orientation of the side chains in the protein. However, it was possible to compare the spatial positions of the backbone atoms. In doing so, we found that the positions of residues critical for ssDNA interactions in hRPA70A were well matched in scRPA70A, e.g. two phenylalanines (F238 and F269) that make stacking interactions with DNA bases in hRPA70A lay in similar positions in scRPA70A. Also, the positions of R210 (K210 in scRPA70A) and E277 were similar in the two proteins. However, in scRPA70A, Q263 was positioned more closely to the spaces in the structure where ssDNA resided than is K263 in hRPA70A. In addition, for scRPA70A, R234 sat further from the ssDNA than does the same residue of hRPA70A. Finally, in accordance with the conformational change in the L12 loop upon ssDNA binding, the relative position of R216 in scRPA70A differed from that of R216 in hRPA70A. Consequently, these changes resulted in a slightly narrower ssDNA-binding arc in scRPA70A relative to hRPA70A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>The other changes that occurred upon ssDNA binding to scRPA70A were in the helix region (residues 239&#x02013;248). The &#x003b1; helices in each of the two structures had slightly different orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This observation could imply that ssDNA binding to scRPA70A induces conformational changes, not only in residues in the binding arc, but also in other residues that do not make direct contact with ssDNA.</p><p>The residues of hRPA70A that are affected by TT-10 binding have been mapped previously in chemical shift perturbation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>); they are located on the &#x003b2;2, &#x003b2;3, &#x003b2;4&#x02032; and &#x003b2;5&#x02032; strands and in the L45 loop, and these results are consistent with the crystal structure of hRPA70A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). When we performed chemical shift perturbation with scRPA70A and TT-10, we observed both similarities and differences as compared with the data for hRPA70A. The perturbation of similar residues in both scRPA70A and hRPA70A upon ssDNA binding implies that the positioning of ssDNA bound to scRPA70A is similar to the positioning of ssDNA bound to hRPA70A, i.e. the binding sites are similar for the two proteins. In addition to the equivalent positions of amino acid residues perturbed by ssDNA binding that were mapped in both scRPA70A and hRPA70A, residues in the helix between &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4 were also substantially perturbed in scRPA70A, but not in hRPA70A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). From our data herein and those of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), we hypothesize that the residues in the helix region of scRPA70A do not contact ssDNA directly. Therefore, the perturbations we observed in the helix region of scRPA70A may result from indirect conformational changes that occur upon ssDNA binding. This hypothesis is consistent with the unexpected conformational changes in this part of the protein with ssDNA binding that were revealed in the RDC-based model structure. Taken together, our results suggest that the orientations of the residues involved in ssDNA binding are conserved in both hRPA70A and scRPA70A; however, the conformational changes that occur in the two proteins upon ssDNA binding are not identical.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction with the SV40 T-ag OBD</title><p>Our structural data showed that the ssDNA-binding arcs of human and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RPA70A are conserved. Moreover, the charge distributions in the binding arc were also similar. Both surfaces of the ssDNA-binding regions were basic, and these properties could permit the phosphates backbones of the DNA strands to interact with both domains in similar manners. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that, except for the ssDNA-binding arc, the surfaces of the two proteins differ. The surface that consists of the &#x003b1;-helix and the C-terminal region (from &#x003b2;5&#x02032;) in scRPA70A was highly acidic, while the equivalent part of hRPA70A is less acidic and relatively neutral. Also, the amino acid sequences in these regions are less homologous compared with other parts of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). On the basis of this information, we hypothesized that (i) the SV40 T-ag binding surface of RPA70A does not overlap with the ssDNA-binding region and (ii) the different charge distributions displayed by the surfaces of the two proteins, which include the &#x003b1; helices and the C-terminal region, contribute to the ability of the proteins to discriminate among interaction partners.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we performed chemical shift perturbation experiments on hRPA70A and scRPA70A in the presence of the SV40 T-ag OBD. We titrated unlabeled SV40 T-ag OBD into solutions of each of the <sup>15</sup>N-labeled RPA70A protein separately, starting with a molar ratio of 1:0 (labeled/unlabeled) and progressing to a ratio of 1:10, and collected spectra at each addition. The studied complexes were at saturation at the titration endpoint. The estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for hRPA70A was &#x0223c;200 &#x003bc;M and scRPA70A had a substantially lower binding affinity for the OBD than does hRPA70A (data not shown). In hRPA70A, residues G219, E240, N252, G260, T261, F269, V272, K273, T279 and E283 exhibited significant chemical shift perturbations, while only residues G219, F222, N271, D281, T284 and D290 showed notable chemical shift changes in scRPA70A. The residues that showed substantial changes only in hRPA70A (E240, G260, T261 and T279) were located near each other and were more neutral than the same parts of scRPA70A (D240, A260, K261 and N279). We then mapped the SV40 T-ag OBD binding surface in each protein and found that it was separated from the ssDNA-binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Even though a few residues in the L12 and L45 loops (G219 and F269 of hRPA70A) also showed substantial chemical shift changes, these alternations did not appear to result from direct protein&#x02013;protein contacts. One reason for this conclusion is that it is hard to access to G219 directly from the outside of the protein. Because of the natural flexibilities of the loop regions described above, the observed chemical shift changes of the residues in these loops might result from indirect conformational changes in the protein due to T-ag binding.</p><p>From our results, we suggest that the higher T-ag binding affinity of hRPA70A, relative to scRPA70A, results from the different surface characters detected in the two proteins. Furthermore, we speculate that these properties account for the species-specificity observed in SV40 replication.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSIONS</title><p>scRPA70A is one of the proteins most homologous to hRPA70A, and, thus, it has been assumed that the structure of scRPA70A will be very similar to that of hRPA70A. However, biochemical experiments have highlighted functional differences between the two proteins. These findings prompted us to determine the solution structure of scRPA70A, which could provide clues as to the origins of the functional dissimilarities. As expected, the overall structure of scRPA70A was quite similar to that of hRPA70A; the intricate details, however, revealed some important differences.</p><p>Because the hRPA70A structure was determined by X-ray crystallography, we must consider the possibility that the subtle structural distinctions between the two homologous proteins might result from the methodological differences. However, when we used chemical shift perturbations and RDC-based homology modeling to assess the conformational changes in the structures of both RPA70A proteins, differences between the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and human proteins were observed. scRPA70A showed indirect conformational changes that did not occur in hRPA70A and exhibited a narrower ssDNA-binding arc than did hRPA70A. These findings imply that scRPA70A experiences more changes upon ssDNA binding than does hRPA70A. Considering that a cofolding event that involves the loop structures and single-stranded nucleic acids occurs in at least one of the binding partners concurrent with complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>), it is intriguing to note that the binding affinity of scRPA70NAB for ssDNA is slightly higher than that of hRPA70NAB (&#x0223c;2-fold), which might be related to the additional conformational changes observed for scRPA70A upon binding to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>OB folds, common feature of ssDNA-binding modules, have been studied in many proteins. For non-base-specific ssDNA interactions, OB folds retain flexibilities in its binding sites. hRPA70A, Pf3, T4gp32 and scRPA70A all show this common characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). The hydrogen bonding interaction between protein and ssDNA is also used in non-base-specific binding as well as in base-specific interaction. However, the flexible binding sites on the protein make it possible to adjust base-specific contacts along the different DNA sequences. The sequence-specific ssDNA-binding proteins, such as POT1, have much more extensive contact with ssDNA by using hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>).</p><p>As far as OB fold as a protein interaction module is concerned, we found that surfaces formed by amino acid residues from the &#x003b1;-helix to the C-terminus of hRPA70A interacted with T-ag OBD. This binding surface is separated from the ssDNA-binding surface and from the Rad51 and XPA binding regions of hRPA70A, which overlap with the ssDNA-binding surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). These findings imply that the T-ag OBD will not compete with ssDNA binding to RPA70A, while Rad51 and XPA will (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). A previous biochemical study demonstrated that RPA bound to ssDNA showed a reduced affinity for T-ag binding, which suggests that ssDNA binding can modulate hRPA70A's ability to form protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). From this previous result and those described here, we suggest that the observed modulation of the hRPA70A&#x02013;T-ag OBD interaction by ssDNA does not result from direct obstruction of the T-ag binding surface on hRPA70A.</p><p>In a similar vein, substantial chemical shift changes in amino acid residues in the L12 and L45 loops upon T-ag binding to hRPA70A raise the possibility that hRPA70A&#x02013;T-ag OBD interaction modulate the ssDNA&#x02013;RPA70A interaction by inducing indirect conformational changes in the DNA-binding region. The reciprocal regulation of ssDNA- and protein partner-binding implies that these two key biochemical functions of RPA70A should not be considered independently. An earlier study showed that the D228Y mutation in scRPA70A conferred a slow-growth phenotype and UV sensitivity on <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, and the mutant version of scRPA displayed reduced ssDNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). Because the mutated residue is not in the ssDNA-binding site, it is unlikely that the mutation inhibits ssDNA binding directly. One explanation is that the mutation affects the protein structure in such a way that it influences the ability of scRPA to interact with ssDNA.</p><p>Regarding the species-specific interaction between the T-ag OBD and hRPA70A, the main interacting forces between these two proteins are not electrostatic, as the T-ag binding surface of hRPA70A is relatively neutral. The equivalent region of scRPA70A has more charged residues, and we speculate that the differences between these two surfaces determine whether or not they can bind T-ag. A recent study has addressed the mechanisms at work behind the interaction between the C-terminal domain of the hRPA32 subunit (hRPA32C) and the T-ag OBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). In this interaction, the binding surface of hRPA32C has an acidic character, and the T-ag OBD provides a complementary basic surface. scRPA32C lacks the acidic residues necessary for binding to the T-ag OBD. From this recent study and our current results, we hypothesize that a weak, two-point interaction occurs between hRPA and T-ag at surfaces on hRPA that are not found in homologous proteins from other species.</p><p>From the comparison between the structures of hRPA70A and scRPA70A in this study, we suggest that evolutionary pressures may have specifically exploited, for specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions, a region of the RPA70 protein distal to the ssDNA-binding region. Taken together, the results of our study of scRPA70A presented here and previously published biochemical data provide insight into how similar protein structures can display distinct protein&#x02013;protein interactions while retaining similar ssDNA-binding affinities.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_13_4172__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_13_4172__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Prof P.
