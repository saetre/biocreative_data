Previously we have shown that chromosomal protein HMGB1 interacts with topo II&#x003b1;, and stimulates its catalytic activity. Here we show the effect of HMGB1 on the activity of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter in different cell lines. We demonstrate that HMGB1, but not a mutant of HMGB1 incapable of DNA bending, up-regulates the activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter in human cells that lack functional retinoblastoma protein pRb. Transient over-expression of pRb in pRb-negative Saos-2 cells inhibits the ability of HMGB1 to activate the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter. The involvement of HMGB1 and its close relative, HMGB2, in modulation of activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene is further supported by knock-down of HMGB1/2, as evidenced by significantly decreased levels of <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> mRNA and protein. Our experiments suggest a mechanism of up-regulation of cellular expression of topo II&#x003b1; by HMGB1/2 in pRb-negative cells by modulation of binding of transcription factor NF-Y to the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter, and the results are discussed in the framework of previously observed pRb-inactivation, and increased levels of HMGB1/2 and topo II&#x003b1; in tumors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is an essential and ubiquitous enzyme for proliferation of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It can alter the topological state of DNA and untangle DNA knots and catenanes (interlocked rings) via ATP-dependent passing of an intact double helix through a transient double-stranded break generated in a separate DNA segment, followed by religation and enzyme turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In mammalian cells, topo II exists in two isoforms, &#x003b1; (170 kDa) and &#x003b2; (180 kDa), both having similar primary structure and almost identical catalytic properties, but differing in their production during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Topo II is the target of a number of drugs currently used in the treatment of human malignancies, such as etoposide, teniposide, doxorubicine and mitoxantrone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These drugs (also termed topo II poisons) can stabilize the covalent enzyme-associated complexes and shift the DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of the enzyme reaction toward the cleavage state, converting biological intermediates of topo II activity into lethal ones ultimately leading to triggering of programmed cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>HMGB-type proteins are relatively abundant and evolutionarily highly conserved non-histone chromatin-associated proteins in mammals. There are three HMGB variants in human and mice, HMGB1, HMGB2 and HMGB3. While HMGB1-3 proteins are expressed in early mice embryos, HMGB2 and HMGB3 are down-regulated during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The abundant HMGB1 protein (&#x0223c;1 molecule per 10&#x02013;15 nucleosomes) is highly conserved among mammals, and it continues to be ubiquitously expressed in adults. HMGB1 and HMGB2 function in a number of fundamental cellular processes such as transcription, replication, DNA repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). HMGB1 is associated with chromosomes in mitosis and due to its extreme mobility in the cell the protein is continuously exchanged between nucleus and cytoplasm [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and refs therein]. HMGB1, but not HMGB2, also exhibits an important extracellular function in mediation of inflammation mechanisms, tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). HMGB1, like HMGB2-3, has a tripartite domain organization, consisting of two DNA-binding domains, the HMG-boxes A and B, and acidic C-terminal tails of variable length. While the two HMG-boxes interact with DNA (exhibiting a high affinity for distorted DNA conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12">9&#x02013;12</xref>), the C-tail usually decreases the affinity of the protein for DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Binding of HMGB1 to DNA causes local distortions by bending/looping and changes in DNA topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). HMGB1 also interacts weakly with a number of proteins, including transcriptional factors, site-specific recombination and DNA repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The importance of HMGB1 for life is supported by the phenotype of the HMGB1 knockout mice, which die 24 h after birth due to hypoglycemia and exhibit a defect in the transcriptional function of the glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Lack of HMGB1 in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts correlates with higher rates of DNA damage after UV irradiation, and the cytogenetic analyses revealed high levels of aneuploidy and spontaneous chromosome aberrations, decreased activity of telomerase and shortening of telomere lengths, suggesting that HMGB1 plays an important role in promoting genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Previously we have reported that HMGB1 could interact with topo II&#x003b1; and stimulate its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In the present study we studied an impact of over-expression of HMGB1 and its close relative, HMGB2, on the activity of human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter. Using luciferase gene reporter assay we have demonstrated that HMGB1, but not a mutant of HMGB1 incapable of DNA bending, up-regulated the activity of human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter in human cells that lack functional retinoblastoma protein pRb. Transient over-expression of pRb in <italic>Rb</italic>-minus cells inhibited the transactivation potential of HMGB1 over the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter. In agreement with the above data, up-regulation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter by HMGB1/2 was very low in cells with functional pRb. The involvement of HMGB1 and HMGB2 in modulation of cellular activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene was also supported by silencing of HMGB1/2 expression by plasmid-encoded specific shRNA resulting in diminished expression of topo II&#x003b1;. Our experiments allowed us to propose a mechanism of HMGB1-mediated transactivation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter by modulation of transcriptional factor NF-Y binding to the promoter. The obtained results are discussed in the framework of previously observed increased levels of HMGB1 and topo II&#x003b1; in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Each of the supercoiled DNA plasmids was isolated by alkaline lysis method, followed by purification by two rounds of cesium chloride gradients or by the Qiagen plasmid kits.

To identify sequences of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter involved in HMGB1-mediated up-regulation of the promoter, Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with the HMGB1 expression plasmid and the luciferase reporter constructs containing varying lengths of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter. Deletions of the sequences from bp &#x02212;557 to &#x02212;142 (encompassing ICE5, ICE4, ICE3 and ATF) had very little, if any, effect on the ability of HMGB1 to up-regulate the activity of the promoter [albeit stepwise deletion of the 5&#x02032;-promoter sequences from bp &#x02212;557 to &#x02212;142 of the full promoter resulted in up to &#x0223c;20-fold decrease in luciferase activity in the absence of over-expressed HMGB1, in agreement with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>)]. However, truncation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter from bp &#x02212;142 to &#x02212;90 including the ICE2 (pTII&#x003b1;-90 containing only ICE1) markedly decreased the ability of HMGB1 to up-regulate the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, pTII&#x003b1;-142 or pTII&#x003b1;-90). A slight activation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter lacking all known regulatory sequences (pTII&#x003b1;-32) by HMGB1 was to be explained by the reported effect of the protein on the basal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The above data suggested the importance of the ICE2 for the HMGB1-mediated transactivation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter. The latter conclusion seemed to be confirmed by mutation of the ICE2 (ATTGG mutated to GTGGA) within the &#x02212;142 promoter construct resulting in inability of HMGB1 to transactivate the &#x02212;142 bp <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter (pTII&#x003b1;-142_ICE2mt, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, right). However, while the ICE2 was crucial for the HMGB1-mediated transactivation of the &#x02212;142 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), it was much less important in the context of the full-length <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter as revealed by the luciferase gene reporter assay using the &#x02212;617 promoter construct with mutated ICE2 (pTII&#x003b1;-617_ICE2mt, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, left). These results questioned the central role of the ICE2 in the HMGB1-mediated up-regulation of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter, and pointed out the possible importance of multiple ICEs for the HMGB1-mediated up-regulation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter (see Discussion section).</p><p>It is generally assumed that HMGB1 could facilitate binding of a number of transcription factors (such as steroid hormone receptors, homeitic HOX proteins, recombination activating gene protein RAG1, octamer transcription factors Oct-1/Oct-2, human TATA-binding protein TBP, TFIID and proteins of p53 family) to their cognate sites by binding to the TFs and delivering them to the corresponding DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). NF-Y (nuclear factor-Y) is a transcription factor comprising NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits. NF-Y specifically recognizes a CCAAT box motif which is found in the promoter and enhancer regions of many genes, including the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The NF-YA subunit associates only with the NF-YB:NF-YC heterodimer creating a functional NF-Y (trimer) CCAAT box DNA-binding complex. NF-Y binds to the human ICE1-4, but not to ICE5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The effect of NF-Y on cellular levels of the human topo II&#x003b1; (and subsequently on the regulation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter) is elusive due to conflicting reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Thus, a simple explanation for the enhancement of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter activity by HMGB1 could be that HMGB1 could promote binding of crucial activators, such as NF-Y, to their DNA-binding sites. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) was therefore used to determine whether HMGB1 could enhance binding of NF-Y to short DNA duplexes containing ICE1, ICE2 or ICE3 sequences derived from the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter. Addition of HMGB1 to nuclear lysate from Saos-2 cells could enhance (&#x0223c;2&#x02013;3-fold) binding of NF-Y to the ICE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), and also to the ICE1 and ICE3 (data not shown), demonstrating the ability of HMGB1 to promote NF-Y binding to various ICEs.</p><p>The ability of HMGB1 to promote <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of NF-Y to DNA duplexes containing inverted CCAAT elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) could indicate that the protein could modulate NF-Y binding to the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. To find out whether HMGB1/2 could affect binding of NF-Y to the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used.

Purified immunoprecipitated DNA was subjected to semi-quantitative PCR with primers specific for a region &#x02212;215 to &#x02212;21 of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter, amplifying a 195 bp product encompassing three NF-Y-binding sites (ICEs1-3). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, the ChIP analysis revealed that inhibition of HMGB1/2 expression resulted in up to &#x0223c;3-fold reduction in NF-Y binding to the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter relative to the control cells.

To understand the importance of individual intercalating amino acids of HMGB1 for the ability of the protein to bend DNA, single HMG-boxes, domains A and B, and their mutants were first investigated.

Mutation of Phe38 (domain A) or Phe103 (domain B) to alanine completely abolished the ability of the both single domains to form DNA minicircles. On the other hand, mutation of the second intercalating residue of domain B, Ile122, had only a little effect on the ability of the domain to bend DNA. Interesting results were obtained upon mutagenesis of the intercalating residues in the context of the full-length HMGB1. Whereas mutation of Phe38 (domain A) exhibited only a little effect on the ability of the HMGB1 protein to bend DNA, mutation of Phe103 (domain B) nearly abrogated the ability of the protein to bend DNA. A complete inhibition of the ability of HMGB1 to bend DNA was to be achieved only when both intercalating phenylalanine residues, Phe38 and Phe103, had been mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, a double mutant F38/F103, upper panel). These results indicated that the domain B could largely substitute for the DNA-bending potential of the domain A within the full-length HMGB1, suggesting the major role of the domain B in mediating DNA bending by HMGB1 [see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>)].

The A/B pocket (residues 379&#x02013;792), comprised of structural domains A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F, upper panel), is a hot-spot for mutation in human cancers, and is the binding site of several viral oncoproteins that inactivate pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).

Although HMGB1 could bind to both the wild-type and mutant pRb (amino-acid 706 C &#x02192; Y within the A/B pocket domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F), a higher fraction of HMGB1 (&#x0223c;2&#x02013;3-fold) was associated with the wild-type pRb than with the mutant pRb (equal amounts of GST-pRb immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads were confirmed by immunodetection using anti-pRb antibody; lanes 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E).

Results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A (lanes 2&#x02013;5) demonstrated that binding of NF-Y to a short DNA duplex containing the ICE2 was visibly compromised by preincubation of nuclear lysate from Saos-2 cells with pRb (similar results were obtained from EMSA experiments using the ICE1, not shown). In addition, the HMGB1-mediated enhancement of NF-Y binding to the ICE2 was also reduced by preincubation of HMGB1 with pRb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A; compare lanes 6, 7 and 8). We have verified that the observed reduction of NF-Y binding by pRb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) was not unspecific, as titration with un unrelated protein (GST) in comparable amounts to pRb had no effect (not shown).

In order to verify silencing of HMGB1 and/or HMGB2 expression, proteins from nuclear lysates were resolved by electrophoresis, transferred onto the membrane and detected with specific antibodies recognizing HMGB1 or HMGB2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, the expression of HMGB1 was inhibited in H1299 cells by &#x0003e;90% by shRNAs specific for <italic>HMGB1</italic> mRNA (lane 3; H1299) or for <italic>HMGB1</italic> and <italic>HMGB2</italic> mRNAs (lane 4; H1299). The latter approach resulted in simultaneous knock-down of HMGB1 and HMGB2 expression. Similar results were obtained in Saos-2 cells although silencing of HMGB1 expression was only &#x0223c;60&#x02013;70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, lane 3; Saos-2). Control silencing experiments revealed that the levels of HMGB1 and HMGB2 were unaffected in both H1299 and Saos-2 cells transfected with plasmid producing unrelated shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 2 as compared to lanes 1 for untransfected cells). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Knock-down of HMGB1 and HMGB2 results in inhibition of topo II&#x003b1; expression.

On the other hand, the topo II&#x003b1; protein levels in pRb-negative Saos-2 cells with silenced HMGB1/HMGB2 expression were decreased up to &#x0223c;3-fold relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, lane 4; Saos-2). This finding was also supported by QRT-PCR analysis revealing &#x0223c;3-fold decrease in <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> mRNA levels in Saos-2 cells with silenced HMGB1/2 expression (data not shown). The fact that only very little (&#x0003c;20%) decrease in topo II&#x003b1; protein levels was observed when solely HMGB1 expression was silenced in Saos-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, lane 3; Saos-2) may be related to possible functional redundancy of these two closely related HMGB-type proteins (see Discussion section).</p><p>In conclusion, we have found that chromosomal proteins HMGB1 and HMGB2 could modulate cellular expression of topo II&#x003b1; in cells lacking functional retinoblastoma gene susceptibility protein pRb by promoting binding of NF-Y to the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter. Our findings are discussed in the view of reported over-expression of HMGB1/2 proteins in tumors [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and refs therein], as well as the fact that the <italic>Rb</italic> gene is deleted/mutated in &#x0003e;50% human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Recently we have reported that chromosomal protein HMGB1 could stimulate catalytic activities of human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; by enhancing DNA binding and cleavage by the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Here we report that HMGB1 and its close relative, HMGB2, could also up-regulate the activity of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter and cellular expression of the enzyme. Our results suggest that HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins may serve as positive regulators of the cellular activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene (this article) as well as that of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins have been implicated in regulation of chromatin structure and DNA metabolic processes such as transcription, replication, recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The lack of HMGB1 in knockout mice results in death within a few hours after birth due to inefficient activation of glucocorticoid receptor responsive genes, but HMGB2 knockout mice are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). HMGB2 protein could not substitute in mice for the loss of HMGB1 <underline>(</underline>15,47), suggesting that HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins may have distinct roles, albeit most of the reported DNA-binding studies indicated that the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-binding properties of HMGB1 and HMGB2 were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Murine and human cells were viable without functional HMGB1, indicating that HMGB2 could partially compensate for the loss of HMGB1 in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The possible functional redundancy of HMGB1 and HMGB2 (at least in some biological processes) may also explain our finding that the double knock-down of HMGB1 and HMGB2 in pRb-negative cells was necessary in order to observe a significant decrease in cellular levels of topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. However, as we have not succeeded in silencing of HMGB2 expression only and/or without concomitant silencing of HMGB1 expression (using various shRNA constructs directed against different parts of <italic>hHMGB2</italic> mRNA, unpublished results) we could not determine the exact contribution of the individual HMGB-type proteins to the cellular expression of topo II&#x003b1;.</p><p>HMGB1 is an abundant and most mobile nuclear protein (&#x0223c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> molecules per nucleus), but despite its abundance the protein may be limiting within cells as evident from transient over-expression of HMGB1 resulting in transactivation of numerous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Previous transfection experiments revealed that HMGB1, but <italic>not</italic> HMGB1 lacking the acidic C-tail (HMGB1-&#x00394;C), could stimulate the Gal4VP16-mediated reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>), or the p53-dependent transactivation of the p53-responsive promoter in H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Transactivation of the human <italic>topoII&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter by HMGB1 did not require the acidic C-tail of HMGB1 suggesting that the C-tail did not function as an activator of transcription of the <italic>topoII&#x003b1;</italic> promoter (this article). Higher DNA binding and/or bending/looping by HMGB1-&#x00394;C relative to the full-length HMGB1 [see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>)] may explain why the truncated HMGB1 protein activated the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter more efficiently than the full-length HMGB1. Thus, shielding of positively charged A+B di-domain of HMGB1 by the acidic C-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) may account for lower ability of the full-length protein to up-regulate the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter.</p><p>We have demonstrated that intercalating residues of human HMGB1 (Phe 38 and Phe 103)&#x02014;that were essential for the ability of HMGB1 to bend DNA [see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>)]&#x02014;were required for the ability of HMGB1 to enhance binding of NF-Y to ICEs and for the up-regulation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter (this article). Interestingly, the intercalating residues of HMGB1 proved to be dispensable for protein&#x02013;protein interactions such as binding of HMGB1 to topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (11 and unpublished results) or progesterone receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), as well as for a specific binding of progesterone receptor to its cognate sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). The mechanism by which HMGB1/2 proteins stimulate activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter most likely involves enhancement of transcription factors binding, possibly by pre-bending of the DNA promoter sequences. Numerous transcription factors have been reported to interact with HMGB1 and/or HMGB2, including TBP, Oct and Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Binding of NF-Y to short DNA duplexes containing ICEs1-4-binding sites (this article), as well as Oct-1/2 (74) and Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) to their DNA cognate sites was enhanced by HMGB1. NF-Y, Sp1 and ICBP90 have previously been shown to be required for efficient transcription from human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>topo II&#x003b2;</italic> promoters [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) and refs therein). The ability of HMGB1/2 to enhance NF-Y binding to the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> was to be explained by HMGB1-(NF-Y) interactions, and possibly also by HMGB1-mediated DNA pre-bending of the DNA-binding sites for NF-Y. The fact that no ternary HMGB1-(NF-Y)-DNA complex was detected did not necessarily mean the lack of existence of such a complex. It is possible that HMGB1 could &#x02018;deliver&#x02019; NF-Y to its DNA-binding site by forming a ternary complex which is transient and unstable. This idea is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating the ability of HMGB1 to enhance binding a plethora of sequence-specific proteins to their cognate DNA sites without formation of ternary complexes, despite the detection of the corresponding protein&#x02013;HMGB1 interactions in &#x02018;pull-down&#x02019; assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The existence of interactions of pRb with NF-Y (and also with HMGB1) may constitute a basis for understanding of pRb-mediated inhibition of the activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter. The observed decrease in binding of NF-Y to ICEs by pRb, as well as inhibition of the ability of HMGB1 to promote binding of NF-Y binding to ICEs (this report), suggested that pRb could down-regulate the activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter by preventing NF-Y binding to inverted CCAAT elements. The exact nature of the interactions involving NF-Y, HMGB1, pRb (phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated?) as well as other binding partners on the the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter is unknown. In addition, interaction of HMGB1 to NF-Y, as well as stimulation of NF-Y binding to several ICEs <italic>in vitro</italic>, may also explain our finding that sequential deletion of ICEs5-3 from the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter had very little effect on the ability of HMGB1 to up-regulate the promoter. Thus, our results could indicate possible functional redundancy of ICEs for the activation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter by HMGB1.</p><p>Results of this article demonstrated that HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins could significantly up-regulate the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter only in cells lacking functional retinoblastoma protein pRb. The exact reason for the inability of HMGB1/2 to significantly up-regulate the activity of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter in pRb-positive cells is unknown. However, the detectable (albeit slight) transactivation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter in pRb-positive cells could be related to weakening of the inhibitory effect of pRb on the promoter. This could be due to HMGB1 binding to pRb which could partially counteract the inhibitory effect of pRb on NF-Y binding to ICEs of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter (see also the above paragraph). On the other hand, the fact that HMGB1 could significantly (&#x0003e;10-fold) enhance activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter in Saos-2 cells transiently expressing mutant pRb (within the A/B pocket) was most likely related to the inability of the mutant to inhibit the activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter, rather than to the pRb(mut)-HMGB1 interactions [see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>)]. The possibility that the failure of the pRb mutant to inhibit the activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter was related to the inability of the mutant to interfere with NF-Y binding to ICEs remains to be investigated.</p><p>Previous reports indicated that p53 could also inhibit activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter despite the lack of clear consensus p53-binding sites within the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This inhibition was explained as consequence of an interference of p53 with NF-Y binding to regulatory sequences of the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins have previously been reported to promote binding of p53 (or its close relative, p73) to their specific DNA-binding sites by bending and specific p53&#x02013;HMGB1/2 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Whether the latter interactions could counteract or even enhance the reported p53-mediated inhibition of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) is unclear. Interestingly, the catalytic activity of topo II&#x003b1; was stimulated by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), albeit by a mechanism different from that reported by HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Contrary to the action of pRb or p53, the HMGB-type proteins could both transactivate the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> promoter and stimulate the catalytic activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). A possible mechanism summarizing interplay of pRb, p53 and HMGB1/2 on the activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene and topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Modulation of activity of human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; by pRb and HMGB1/2 (a hypothesis). HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins up-regulate the expression of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene in pRb-negative cells by enhancement of binding of transcription factor NF-Y to its specific DNA-binding sites (ICEs) within the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter. Binding of NF-Y to the ICEs is facilitated by pre-bending the DNA sequences by HMGB1/2. pRb can inhibit the activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene, as well as the ability of HMGB1 to up-regulate the gene, possibly by reducing binding of NF-Y to ICEs (this article). HMGB1/2 promote cellular expression of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (this article), and the proteins have also the potential of enhancing catalytic activity of the enzyme, as previously demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> (11 and unpublished results). p53 inhibits activity of the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene by compromising NF-Y binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Unlike the inhibitory effect of pRb on the catalytic activity of topo II&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), the enzyme is stimulated by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp067f7"/></fig></p><p>The two isoforms of topoisomerase II, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, are encoded by distinct genes on chromosomes 17q21-22 and 3p24, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). While the activity of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> gene promoter is low in resting cells and enhanced during proliferation (such as in tumors), the activity of the human <italic>topo II&#x003b2;</italic> gene promoter is constant throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Both isoforms differ in their production during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>), but they exhibit very similar catalytic activities, including the sensitivity to anticancer drugs specifically targeting topo II. The latter may be interesting in the view of our finding that the activities of both the <italic>topo II&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>topo II&#x003b2;</italic> gene promoters were up-regulated by HMGB1/2. Whether the HMGB1/2-mediated activation of the <italic>topo II&#x003b2;</italic> gene promoter is also affected by pRb, awaits further investigation.</p><p>Although HMGB1 is expressed throughout the cell cycle with no significant variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), the protein is clearly over-expressed in most human tumors, including breast carcinoma, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, colon carcinomas and acute myeloblastic leukaemia [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>) and references herein]. HMGB1 over-expression has also been observed upon administration of hormones (estrogen and/or progesterone), resulting in increased potency of anticancer drugs cisplatin and its analogue carboplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). Recently HMGB2 was also found to be over-expressed in cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://expression.gnf.org/cgi-bin/index.cgi#Q">http://expression.gnf.org/cgi-bin/index.cgi#Q</ext-link>; Gene Expression Atlas, 38065_at).</p><p>Most of the human tumors have excess DNA copies of the <italic>TOP2A</italic> (encoding topoisomerase II&#x003b1;) gene [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>) and refs therein], and the <italic>TOP2A</italic> gene amplification may explain the significantly enhanced cellular levels of topo II&#x003b1; in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). Topo II&#x003b1; over-expression has been reported to be associated with poor cancer-specific survival and presence of metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Up-regulation of topo II&#x003b1; could significantly affect responsiveness of tumors to drugs specifically targeting the enzyme (topo II poisons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). The fact that the HMGB1/2-mediated up-regulation of cellular levels of topo II&#x003b1; was most prominent in <italic>Rb</italic>-minus cells (this article) raises the question of a possible relevance of simultaneous HMGB1/2 overexpression and <italic>Rb</italic> deletions in tumors in respect to clinical prognosis of patients treated with topo II poisons. While over-expression of HMGB1/2 proteins could enhance cellular levels (and/or activity) of topo II&#x003b1;, reduced transcriptional activity of <italic>HMGB1/2</italic> genes could diminish the cellular levels (and/or activity) of the enzyme. Several polymorphisms and/or mutations were recently identified in the <italic>HMGB1</italic> gene with a potential regulatory impact on <italic>HMGB1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). In this respect, the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), a malignant disease with highly variable clinical course, could be of interest due to deletions of the 13q14 locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). About 30&#x02013;50% of patients with 13q14 deletions bear <italic>Rb</italic> deletions (some of them even biallelic, unpublished results). Interestingly, the <italic>HMGB1</italic> gene is localized in the 13q12 locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). Furthermore, research is necessary to fully understand the involvement of HMGB-type proteins and their possible interplay with tumor suppressor proteins, pRb and p53, in modulation of cellular activity of topo II&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This research was supported by grants to M.&#x00160;. by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (204/08/1530), the Grant Agency of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (IAA400040702), and by the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (grants no AV0Z50040507 and AV0Z50040702). &#x00160;.P. was supported by grant IGA MZ &#x0010c;R NR/9293-3.
