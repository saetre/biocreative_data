Unequivocal proof of such an association, however, requires independent replication of initial positive findings. Recently, three (&#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, +61450 C&#x0003e;A, and +83897 T&#x0003e;A) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within glutamate decarboxylase 2 <italic>(GAD2)</italic> were found to be associated with class III obesity (body mass index &#x0003e; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The association was observed among 188 families (612 individuals) segregating the condition, and a case-control study of 575 cases and 646 lean controls. Functional data supporting a pathophysiological role for one of the SNPs (&#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G) were also presented. The gene <italic>GAD2</italic> encodes the 65-kDa subunit of glutamic acid decarboxylase&#x02014;GAD65. In the present study, we attempted to replicate this association in larger groups of individuals, and to extend the functional studies of the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP. Among 2,359 individuals comprising 693 German nuclear families with severe, early-onset obesity, we found no evidence for a relationship between the three <italic>GAD2</italic> SNPs and obesity, whether SNPs were studied individually or as haplotypes. In two independent case-control studies (a total of 680 class III obesity cases and 1,186 lean controls), there was no significant relationship between the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP and obesity (OR = 0.99, 95&#x00025; CI 0.83&#x02013;1.18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.89) in the pooled sample. These negative findings were recapitulated in a meta-analysis, incorporating all published data for the association between the &#x02212;243G allele and class III obesity, which yielded an OR of 1.11 (95&#x00025; CI 0.90&#x02013;1.36, <italic>p</italic> = 0.28) in a total sample of 1,252 class III obese cases and 1,800 lean controls. Moreover, analysis of common haplotypes encompassing the <italic>GAD2</italic> locus revealed no association with severe obesity in families with the condition. We also obtained functional data for the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP that does not support a pathophysiological role for this variant in obesity. Potential confounding variables in association studies involving common variants and complex diseases (low power to detect modest genetic effects, overinterpretation of marginal data, population stratification, and biological plausibility) are also discussed in the context of <italic>GAD2</italic> and severe obesity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A large genetic study involving multiple populations is not able to replicate previous findings linking variation in the <italic>GAD2</italic> gene to susceptibility to obesity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>By dramatically increasing mortality &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d; and morbidity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d; from cardiovascular disease, obesity has emerged as a major public health issue for the 21st century.

In the initial study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d; involving individuals ascertained by a proband with class III obesity (BMI &#x0003e; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and at least one sibling with BMI &#x0003e; 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, strong evidence for linkage (maximum logarithm of odds score 4.85) was obtained at the marker D10S197. The linkage peak encompassed a region of approximately 15 centimorgans. Confirmation of this linkage, albeit at lower levels of significance, was obtained in German Caucasians &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d; and a combined sample of Caucasian Americans and African Americans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. The marker D10S197 is located within intron 7 of the glutamate decarboxylase 2 <italic>(GAD2)</italic> gene, which encodes the 65-kDa subunit of glutamic acid decarboxylase&#x02014;GAD65.</p><p>Recently, Boutin et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; obtained evidence to implicate <italic>GAD2</italic> as a candidate gene for human obesity. In a case-control study for class III obesity, the authors identified both a haplotype (consisting of the most frequent alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms +61450 C&#x0003e;A and +83897 T&#x0003e;A), and a SNP (&#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G) within <italic>GAD2</italic> that differed in frequency between cases and controls. In family-based tests of association involving 612 individuals from 188 nuclear families, the +61450 C&#x0003e;A and +83897 T&#x0003e;A SNPs were associated with class III obesity. The &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; wild-type (WT) haplotype (+61450 C and +83897 T) identified in the case-control study was found to be in excess in unaffected offspring.</p><p>As the <italic>GAD2</italic> variant allele &#x02212;243 G was in the 5&#x02032; region of the gene (the other two SNPs were located in intronic regions), displayed the strongest association with class III obesity in the case-control study, and was in linkage disequilibrium with the +61450 C&#x0003e;A and +83897 T&#x0003e;A SNPs, functional studies were performed to test its effects on transcription and nuclear protein binding. In a luciferase reporter gene containing the <italic>GAD2</italic> promoter, the &#x02212;243 G allele increased the transcriptional activity 6-fold relative to an equivalent reporter gene containing the WT (&#x02212;243 A) allele in &#x003b2;TC3 murine insulinoma cells. Also, relative to the WT (A) allele, oligonucleotide probes containing the variant (G) allele had a higher affinity for an unidentified nuclear protein from &#x003b2;TC3 cells. Overall, their results suggested that the <italic>GAD2</italic> &#x02212;243 G allele might not only constitute a genetic marker for class III human obesity, but may also exert a significant physiological effect.</p><p>In recent years, many unreplicated associations have been reported between common genetic polymorphisms and measures of adiposity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, one of the significant challenges in genetic association studies is the presence of statistical trends towards susceptibility (with the suspected allele being neither sufficient nor necessary for disease expression), rather than clear cause-and-effect relationships. This factor reduces the power of individual studies; consequently, it has become critical to develop larger multi-center studies to confirm positive associations in other populations, and to perform meta-analyses to more accurately estimate the magnitude of the genetic effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, excess transmission of the G allele of the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP to affected offspring was not observed (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06).</p><p>To further assess these initial findings in a much larger cohort, we performed family-based tests of association in 2,359 German Caucasian individuals from 693 nuclear families. Nuclear families were composed of obese children (mean BMI percentile = 98.6 &#x000b1; 2.3, range 90th&#x02013;100th percentile), their obese siblings, and both of their parents. The clinical characteristics of the nuclear families segregating obesity are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030315-t001">Table 1</xref>. This group of individuals included the 89 families that had previously displayed suggestive linkage for obesity (maximum likelihood binomial logarithm of odds score of 2.24) at D10S197 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Using the pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;, we found no evidence for excess transmission of any <italic>GAD2</italic> alleles to obese children in the 89 families displaying prior linkage of obesity to Chromosome 10p (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030315-t002">Table 2</xref>). This finding alone suggested that the original linkage signal in this region might be due to different SNPs than the ones under study. We next included samples that were not previously tested for linkage, bringing the total group to 693 nuclear families. As in the linked families, we found no association between any of the <italic>GAD2</italic> SNPs and obesity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030315-t002">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, studies of haplotype transmission in the entire group using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) did not provide any evidence for a &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; haplotype consisting of the +61450 C and +83897 T alleles, or any other two- or three-allele <italic>GAD2</italic> haplotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030315-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Case-Control Studies</title><p>Previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;, the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, +61450 C&#x0003e;A, and +83897 T&#x0003e;A SNPs were associated with class III obesity in one case-control group (349 obese cases and 376 nonobese controls), whereas the association between the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP and obesity was significant in the pooled sample of 575 obese cases and 646 controls (odds ratio &#x0005b;OR&#x0005d; of 1.3, 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d; 1.053&#x02013;1.585, <italic>p</italic> = 0.014).

To incorporate the data from the third SNP, +61450 C&#x0003e;A (rs992990), into this framework, we genotyped the same CEPH (Centre D'&#x000e9;tude du Polymorphisme Humain) samples (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) that were used in the creation of the map. When the genotype results from the +61450 C&#x0003e;A SNP were integrated with those from HapMap, the overall structure of the haplotype block did not change. To capture at least 95&#x00025; of the haplotype diversity within this haplotype block, we then determined that genotyping of three more SNPs was required: rs3781117 (intron 4), rs3781118 (intron 4), and rs1330581 (intron 7) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>The German families and case-control participants from the US and Canada were genotyped for the SNPs rs3781117, rs3781118, and rs1330581.

However, the transcriptional activity of our WT &#x02212;1710/&#x02212;4 reporter gene was appreciably higher than that of pGL3Basic in &#x003b2;TC3 cells, suggesting that the <italic>GAD2</italic> promoter does exhibit some basal transcriptional activity in this cell line.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay</title><p>In the previous study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;, oligonucleotide probes containing either of the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G alleles were tested for their affinity for nuclear extract prepared from &#x003b2;TC3 murine insulinoma cells.

To replicate their findings, we first performed family-based tests of association for all three SNPs in 693 nuclear families segregating severe obesity (2,359 participants, nearly four times as many participants as in the original report). This group of individuals included 89 families found to have linkage of severe obesity to Chromosome 10p12 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. No evidence for excess transmission of any <italic>GAD2</italic> alleles or haplotypes from parents to affected offspring was obtained. Next, we conducted an adequately powered case-control study to test the association between class III obesity and the <italic>GAD2</italic> &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G variant in Caucasians. Consistent with the family-based association results, we did not observe any association between the &#x02212;243 G variant and class III obesity in 680 cases and 1,186 lean controls. These findings were also obtained in a meta-analysis for the association between the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP and class III obesity. Lastly, we obtained results from the reporter gene and DNA binding experiments for the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G variant that were inconsistent with the original report. Overall, we found that (i) a haplotype consisting of the WT alleles at SNPs +61450 C&#x0003e;A and +83897 T&#x0003e;A does not appear to protect against severe, early-onset obesity, (ii) the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP is not associated with class III obesity in adults, (iii) other haplotypes in the region of <italic>GAD2</italic> are not associated with severe obesity, and (iv) the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP does not elicit detectable effects on transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in &#x003b2;TC3 murine insulinoma cells.</p><p>Irreproducibility of positive findings has been a common criticism leveled at association studies investigating the common genetic basis of complex diseases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;. The reasons cited are numerous, and include a lack of statistical power to detect small to moderate effects, lack of control over the Type I error rate, overinterpretation of marginal data, population stratification, and poor biological plausibility &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b28">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Regarding the conflicting results obtained by Boutin et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; and the current study, it is likely that the lack of replication could be ascribed to any of these causes, which are discussed below. The inconsistencies between association studies may also reflect the complex interactions between multiple population-specific genetic and environmental factors.</p><p>The lack of statistical power to detect alleles of minor effect is likely to have contributed to the differences between the study by Boutin et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; and the current investigation. Based on the findings of the initial report, we conducted an adequately powered, ethnically matched, case-control study. Although our results overlapped with the size of the initial effect, they did not show a significant association between the &#x02212;243 G allele and class III obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030315-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We estimate that we had 60&#x00025; power to detect a significant difference (&#x003b1; of 0.05) in allele frequency between our pooled groups of cases and controls, assuming that the &#x02212;243 G allele (frequency of 0.18) was the disease allele, a genotype relative risk of 1.25, and a prevalence of class III obesity in the general population of 5&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The family-based association tests had a similar amount of power (&#x0223c;60&#x00025;), given the same assumptions. Under these conditions, the original study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; may have been underpowered. Moreover, it must be pointed out that the marginally significant association (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04) they observed between the &#x02212;243 G allele and class III obesity was observed in only one of their two groups of participants, and did not reach nominal significance in their family-based analysis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06). Although the lack of statistical significance does not exclude the possibility of an association (as we cannot rule out smaller effects), the data do not support a relationship between this SNP and class III obesity.</p><p>The interpretation of results from genetic association studies is frequently complicated by other statistical issues, such as a failure to control for multiple hypothesis testing, overinterpretation of marginal data as positive trends, and the well-documented tendency for initial positive findings to overestimate the strength of the association &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. This &#x0201c;jackpot&#x0201d; phenomenon &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d; can be readily observed in our meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030315-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Population stratification may also account for some of the inconsistencies observed between association studies, though its importance may have been overestimated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Population stratification is usually controlled for by careful matching of cases and controls by ethnicity, using family-based tests of association (such as the TDT) or studying multiple case-control populations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Considering the marked differences in allele frequency that we observed between ethnic groups for the <italic>GAD2</italic> SNPs (the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G and +61450 C&#x0003e;A SNPs in particular), as well as the known differences in the prevalence of class III obesity between Caucasian Americans and African Americans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d;, it is plausible that a small difference in ancestry between cases and controls could lead to spurious claims of association. Naturally, future studies of the <italic>GAD2</italic> gene should carefully take this into consideration.</p><p>There is no obvious explanation for the differences in results obtained for the EMSA and reporter gene assays. Regarding the EMSA, a major problem with these experiments is that most random DNA sequences will be bound by a nuclear extract from any cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">S5</xref> and Figure 4 in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;). It is likely that the introduction of single base-pair differences into this DNA sequence will interfere with the binding pattern observed. Moreover, while an allele-specific difference in the binding of &#x003b2;TC3 cell nuclear extract definitely occurs for the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G polymorphism, this observation is of limited physiological significance, because: (i) it appears to be restricted to this cell type (and there is no apparent difference in allele-specific binding for nuclear extract derived from a neuronal cell line); and (ii) the binding of this nuclear protein does not appear to affect transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in &#x003b2;TC3 cells. Finally, even if the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP did affect transcription of the reporter gene in this context, there is no prior biological evidence to suggest that perturbation of <italic>GAD2</italic> expression in &#x003b2; cells could exert detectable effects on long-term energy homeostasis.</p><p>This latest point raises the issue of biological plausibility. <italic>GAD2</italic> encodes the 65-kDa isoform of the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase, which catalyzes the production of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, from glutamic acid. The biological evidence implicating <italic>GAD2</italic> as a candidate gene (and by extension, hypothalamic GABA levels as causative) in severe obesity is as follows: <italic>GAD2</italic> mRNA is co-expressed with neuropeptide Y in neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus that act in the nearby paraventricular nucleus and other hypothalamic areas to stimulate food intake &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Concomitantly, these arcuate neuropeptide Y neurons inhibit the parallel and opposing effects of neighboring pro-opiomelanocortin/cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript neurons via GABA-ergic collateral inputs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In rats, administration of muscimol, a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, into either the third ventricle or the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus stimulates feeding in a dose-dependent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, inhibition of GABA synthesis in the ventromedial hypothalamus, by injection of antisense GAD-65 and GAD-67 oligonucleotides, has been shown to suppress food intake &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>However, enthusiasm for <italic>GAD2</italic> as a candidate gene for severe obesity is dampened somewhat by the observation that <italic>GAD2</italic>-deficient mice appear normal with respect to behavior, locomotion, reproduction, and glucose homeostasis, but suffer from epileptic seizures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Also, levels of <italic>GAD2</italic> mRNA in the arcuate nucleus of the rat do not change in response to 48 hr of food deprivation, as do levels of prepro&#x02013;neuropeptide Y mRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the notion that hypothalamic GABA levels are proportional to food intake may be an oversimplification; although microinjection of GABA into the paraventricular nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus stimulates feeding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d;, injection of GABA, muscimol &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;, or an adenovirus expressing <italic>GAD2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d;, into the lateral hypothalamus of rats has been observed to have the opposite effect.</p><p>While these experimental results do not exclude <italic>GAD2</italic> as a candidate gene for human obesity, it remains possible that the linkage signal could be due to variation in a neighboring gene. Certainly <italic>GAD2</italic> is the leading candidate in this region, due to some of the biological evidence presented above and the location of D10S197 within one of its introns. However, in light of the large number of genes involved in energy homeostasis (recently reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b41">41</xref>&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d;), the multiple tissue-specific roles of each gene, and the readily available information regarding the homology and expression pattern of uncharacterized genes, it now seems possible to make a tenuous case for almost any single gene in the regulation of body weight. For example, a preliminary glance at the Chromosome 10p12 region yielded several interesting genes: <italic>TPRT</italic> (trans-prenyltransferase), the enzyme that elongates the prenyl side-chain of coenzyme Q, one of the key elements of the respiratory chain within mitochondria; <italic>GPR158</italic>, which encodes a metabotropic glutamate, GABA<sub>B</sub>&#x02013;like G-protein-coupled receptor; and <italic>PTF1A,</italic> which encodes pancreas-specific transcription factor 1a. Although only a little is known about each of these genes, it is possible to speculate on the potential role of each in obesity. <italic>GAD2</italic> is no exception. At present, however, there is insufficient genetic or biological evidence to implicate genetic variation in <italic>GAD2</italic> in the predisposition to severe obesity in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Participants</title><p>The ascertainment strategy for these participants has been described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030315-b43">43</xref>&#x0005d;.
