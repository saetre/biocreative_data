DDB is dispensable for <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleotide excision repair (NER) reaction, but stimulates this reaction especially for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD). Here we show that DDB directly interacts with XPA, one of core NER factors, mainly through DDB2 subunit and the amino-acid residues between 185 and 226 in XPA are important for the interaction. Interestingly, the point mutation causing the substitution from Arg-207 to Gly, which was previously identified in a XP-A revertant cell-line XP129, diminished the interaction with DDB <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In a defined system containing R207G mutant XPA and other core NER factors, DDB failed to stimulate the excision of CPD, although the mutant XPA was competent for the basal NER reaction. Moreover, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments revealed that the mutant XPA is recruited to damaged DNA sites with much less efficiency compared with wild-type XPA and fails to support the enhancement of CPD repair by ectopic expression of DDB2 in SV40-transformed human cells. These results suggest that the physical interaction between DDB and XPA plays an important role in the DDB-mediated NER reaction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the major mechanism for removing helix-distorting DNA lesions induced by sunlight and chemical mutagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). Defects in the NER pathway give rise to xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by photosensitivity, pigment changes and a predisposition to skin cancer and in some cases neurological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In human cells, the early process of NER from damage recognition to dual incision is accomplished by six core NER factors, XP complementation group A (XPA), RPA, XPC-RAD23B, TFIIH, XPF-ERCC1 and XPG <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB) is a heterodimeric complex comprising DDB1 and DDB2 subunits and binds to a wide spectrum of DNA lesions including a UV-induced (6&#x02013;4) photoproduct (6-4PP) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). However, DDB is dispensable for <italic>in vitro</italic> NER reaction in the reconstituted systems with purified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The <italic>DDB2</italic> gene is responsible for XP complementation group E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and the cells derived from XP-E patients show a lack of DDB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>) and a partial deficiency in NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). DNA lesions induced in transcriptionally inactive DNA regions or the non-transcribed strand of expressed genes are repaired by a global genome repair (GGR) sub-pathway of NER, whereas those in the transcribed strand of expressed genes are repaired by a transcription-coupled repair (TCR) sub-pathway. DDB2-deficient cells exhibit normal TCR activity but significantly or slightly reduced GGR activity for CPD or 6-4PP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The accessory roles of DDB in GGR have been suggested from different aspects.</p><p>We found using an <italic>in vitro</italic> excision repair assay that DDB greatly stimulates the excision of CPD by cell-free extracts (CFEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) or purified NER factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), although the excision of 6-4PP was rather inhibited under the same conditions and weakly stimulated by a less amount of DDB. Interestingly, the DDB-mediated stimulation of CPD excision was further enhanced by the addition of XPA and/or RPA to CFEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Moreover, in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, DDB was found to strikingly elevate the binding of XPA to DNA substrates containing a single CPD and to make a ternary complex with XPA and the DNA substrate. These results suggest that there is some link between DDB and XPA on damaged DNA sites, although there was an argument about the stimulatory role of DDB in NER reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Local UV irradiation experiments have revealed a significant role of DDB in recruiting core NER factors to damaged DNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. DDB rapidly accumulates at damaged DNA sites in the absence of core NER factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), suggesting that DDB can bind to UV lesions before other core NER factors. Moreover, the ectopic overexpression of DDB2 in SV40-transformed human cell lines, which exhibit a low endogenous DDB2 level due to p53 inactivation by SV40 large T antigen, enhances the recruitment of XPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). A more detailed study using XP-A cells stably expressing CPD- or 6-4PP-specific photolyase showed that DDB activates the recruitment of XPC to CPD rather than 6-4PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>A recent finding that DDB is a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex together with Cullin4A and Roc1 has given a new insight into the accessory role of DDB in NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The E3 ligase complex was demonstrated to polyubiquitinate XPC and DDB2, leading to the alteration of DNA binding properties of XPC-RAD23B and DDB, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The polyubiquitination appears to be required for cell-free NER reaction when DDB is bound to 6-4PP. Furthermore, it has been shown that XPC is modified by SUMO-1 and ubiquitin following UV irradiation and these modifications require DDB2 and XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>DDB has been also suggested to function in recognizing the lesions in the context of chromatin and/or remodeling chromatin to facilitate repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). DDB2 subunit shares homology with chromatin reorganization proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and DDB heterodimer has been shown to interact with histone acetyltransferases, CBP/p300 and GCN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Moreover, the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing DDB was reported to ubiquitinate histone H2A, H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). DDB seems to be involved in several reactions at different levels during NER, but those still remain to be fully understood.</p><p>In this study, we have focused on the stimulatory role of DDB in an early step of NER and on a molecular link between DDB and core NER factors. We have found that DDB2 physically interacts with XPA <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>, and identified a DDB2-interactive domain in XPA. Functional analyses of a binding-defective XPA mutant indicate that the interaction between DDB2 and XPA is required for the stimulatory role of DDB in NER reaction especially for CPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The pGEX18/XPA construct for expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-XPA fusion protein and its deletion derivatives have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

We next examined the excision of CPD in a reconstituted system containing either wild-type or R207G mutant (His)<sub>6</sub>-XPA and other five NER factors. The substrate containing a CPD was incubated with the purified proteins in the presence or absence of recombinant DDB.

For this experiment, we used a SV40-transformed XP-F cell line lacking 5&#x02032; endonuclease of dual incision, in which the accumulation of XPA at locally damaged DNA sites can be observed more clearly and persistently than in NER-proficient cells (43, our unpublished data). XP2YOSV or its derivative cell line stably expressing Flag-tagged DDB2 (XP2YOSV/F-DDB2) was transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing myc-XPA (wild-type or R207G mutant) and exposed to UV light through a 5 &#x000b5;m isopore membrane filter.

On the other hand, myc-XPA(R207G) exhibited poor accumulation even in the presence of F-DDB2. To verify the co-localization of XPA and DDB at damaged DNA sites, myc-XPA and 3xFlag-DDB2 were transiently co-expressed in XP2YOSV cells and detected by each epitope-tag-specific antibody following micropore UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).

However, only a few studies on the interaction between DDB and core NER factors have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), in contrast to numerous reports of DDB-interactive proteins involved in other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). The first core NER factor shown to interact with DDB is RPA, based on immunoprecipitation using partially purified DDB fraction or nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). RPA is a eukaryotic single-stranded DNA-binding protein essential for chromosomal DNA replication as well as NER and shows a preferential binding to damaged DNA compared with native DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The interaction between DDB and RPA appears to enhance damaged DNA-binding activity of both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) also observed a ternary complex of DDB, RPA and damaged DNA in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In addition, RPA is known to interact with XPA physically and functionally and this interaction again enhances both binding activities to damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Together with our previous observation of a higher complex containing DDB, RPA, XPA and damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), DDB might also play a role in recruiting RPA along with XPA to damaged DNA sites.</p><p>Recently, Sugasawa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) have reported that DDB physically interacts with XPC based on immunoprecipitation using cell lysates as well as purified proteins. The interaction between DDB and XPC is implicated in the ubiquitination of XPC by the E3 ligase complex with Cullin4A, Roc1 and DDB, and the XPC polyubiquitination alters its DNA-binding properties. In the literature, XPC is also known to interact with XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Furthermore, other group has recently shown that XPC is modified by SUMO-1 and ubiquitin in untransformed cells exposed to UV light and these modifications require not only DDB2 but also XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Taken all together, it is plausible that DDB bound to damaged DNA sites may function in the recruitment of XPC-RAD23B, XPA and RPA and further in the modification of XPC at damaged DNA sites.</p><p>A recently developed micropore UV irradiation method has contributed to our understanding of sequential assembly of NER factors at damaged DNA sites in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). We originally found that DDB rapidly accumulates at locally UV-damaged subnuclear regions in the absence of XPC or XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Other groups reported similar observations and further showed that the recruitment of XPC to UV-damaged sites, especially CPD, requires functional DDB2 (as a DDB complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). In this study, we showed that the ectopic expression of DDB2 in SV40-transformed XP-F cells enhances the recruitment of XPA to UV-damaged sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Using the same local UV irradiation, Volker <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) demonstrated that XPC is required for the recruitment of XPA to damaged-DNA sites in primary diploid human fibroblasts containing a normal level of DDB2. DDB may enhance the recruitment of XPA to DNA lesions <italic>in vivo</italic> by two possible mechanisms, directly through its interaction with XPA and indirectly through efficient XPC loading onto DNA lesions.</p><p>XPA is known to interact with all of other five core NER factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), and their interaction domains as well as DNA-binding domain in XPA have been mapped. The DDB2-interactive domain (residues 185&#x02013;225) determined in this study partially overlaps with a DNA-binding domain (residues 98&#x02013;219) reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) and is located between an RPA1-binding domain (residues 98&#x02013;187) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) and a C-terminal TFIIH-binding domain (residues 226&#x02013;273) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). We further demonstrated that R207G mutation in the DDB2-interactive domain results in the reduced binding to DDB2 or DDB heterodimer. Importantly, this amino-acid substitution caused the attenuated XPA recruitment to locally UV-damaged subnuclear regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn964/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2S</ext-link>) and impaired enhancement of CPD repair by DDB <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), clearly indicating that the interaction between DDB and XPA plays an important role in the DDB-mediated NER reaction for CPD.</p><p>The R207G mutation was found in the XP129 revertant cell line, which had been isolated from a SV40-transfomed XP12ROSV cell line following the repetitious treatment of methyl methane sulfonate and reported to have a unique DNA repair phenotype of removing 6-4PP normally but not CPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). On the other hand, Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) examined the effects of this mutation on NER activity and UV sensitivity using various XP12ROSV transfectants stably expressing wild-type or R207G mutant XPA. Based on the observation that the rate of CPD repair in the transfectant expressing R207G mutant XPA was almost normal, the authors concluded that the R207G mutation might not be responsible for the selective GGR defect for CPD repair in XP129 cells. The apparent discrepancy between the two studies seems explainable by the findings that SV40 transformation reduces GGR activity for CPD significantly (but not completely) due to dysfunction of p53 by the large T antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) and this repair deficiency can be reversed by ectopic expression of DDB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> strongly support this possible explanation.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has found that DDB2 physically interacts with XPA and this interaction is required for the stimulatory effect of DDB on CPD excision <italic>in vitro</italic>, the efficient recruitment of XPA to damaged sites <italic>in vivo</italic> and the enhancement of CPD repair by ectopic expression of DDB2 in SV40-transformed human cells. These findings reveal a new link between DDB and the core NER factors, and indicate that XPA interacts with not only five core NER factors but also an accessory factor DDB. The critical role of XPA as a scaffold might explain why XP-A patients or XPA-deficient cells exhibit the most severe phenotypes among seven complementation groups of NER-defective XP.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn964/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by grants 12143202 (T.M.) and 16710031 (M.W.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, and <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> grant <grant-num>R01 NS052781</grant-num> (J.E.C.).
