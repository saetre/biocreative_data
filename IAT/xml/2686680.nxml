Chibby (Cby) is an evolutionarily conserved molecule that physically interacts with the key downstream coactivator &#x003b2;-catenin and represses its transcriptional activation potential.

The Cby oligomer predominantly exists as a homodimer. Furthermore, we found that dimerization-deficient Cby mutants still retain the ability to bind to &#x003b2;-catenin and to repress &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent gene activation. More importantly, Cby homodimerization is required for its efficient interaction with the nuclear import receptor importin-&#x003b1; and subsequent nuclear translocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our comprehensive mutational analysis of the Cby coiled-coil domain reveals that the four heptad leucine residues play an essential role in mediating Cby homodimerization.

More recently, dysregulation of Wnt signaling has been linked to a range of human diseases, especially cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For instance, canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is aberrantly activated in greater than 70% of colorectal cancers, promoting cancer cell proliferation, survival and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Accordingly, the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway has gained recognition as an enticing molecular target for cancer therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this signaling cascade, &#x003b2;-catenin plays a pivotal role as a transcriptional coactivator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the absence of a Wnt ligand, cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin becomes phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in a complex containing the tumor suppressors Axin and Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Wnt binding to the seven transmembrane Frizzled (Fz) receptors and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) co-receptors, LRP5 and LRP6, triggers recruitment of Axin to the plasma membrane, resulting in inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As a consequence, &#x003b2;-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and then translocates into the nucleus where it forms a complex with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef) family of transcription factors, leading to activation of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>We previously reported a &#x003b2;-catenin antagonist Chibby (Cby) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The human Cby protein is composed of 126 amino acids, and is highly conserved throughout evolution. Cby physically interacts with the C-terminal activation domain of &#x003b2;-catenin. Our recent crystal structural studies for a full-length &#x003b2;-catenin suggest that Cby binds to the Helix C located at the C-terminal end of the central Armadillo repeat region of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Cby functions as a repressor of &#x003b2;-catenin by competing with Tcf/Lef factors for &#x003b2;-catenin binding. Reduction of Cby protein levels in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>embryos by RNA interference (RNAi) results in hyperactivation of this pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], underscoring the biological importance of Cby's function. Using <italic>in vitro </italic>cell culture models, we demonstrated that Cby facilitates adipocyte and cardiomyocyte differentiation of pluripotent stem cells through inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. More recently, we isolated 14-3-3 adaptor proteins as novel Cby-binding partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Upon phosphorylation of Cby serine 20 by Akt kinase, Cby and 14-3-3 form a stable trimolecular complex with &#x003b2;-catenin, and cooperate to promote cytoplasmic localization of &#x003b2;-catenin, leading to down-regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. Therefore, we proposed a new model in which inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling by Cby involves at least two distinct molecular mechanisms, i.e. competing with Tcf/Lef transcription factors for binding to &#x003b2;-catenin in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and facilitating nuclear export of &#x003b2;-catenin via interaction with 14-3-3, following phosphorylation of Cby serine 20 by Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Through comparison of Cby protein sequences across species, we noted that Cby contains a conserved putative coiled-coil motif in its C-terminal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In a later study, Hidaka <italic>et al. </italic>performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length human Cby as bait, and pulled out Cby itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Their subsequent deletion analysis indicated that the C-terminal region of human Cby protein encompassing the coiled-coil domain (amino acids 60&#x02013;112) is prerequisite for its self-association. However, the nature of Cby homooligomers and specific amino acid residues responsible for Cby self-assembly has remained to be elucidated.</p><p>In the present study, we report that Cby forms a stable homodimer via its C-terminal leucine zipper coiled-coil domain. Using a variety of Cby point mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis, we found that four leucine residues in the C-terminal heptad-repeat region are responsible for Cby homodimerization. We also show that Cby mutants defective in homodimer formation are capable of both binding to &#x003b2;-catenin and antagonizing its signaling activity. More importantly, we provide evidence that Cby homodimerization is necessary for its efficient binding to the nuclear import receptor importin-&#x003b1; and subsequent nuclear import.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cby forms a stable oligomer</title><p>Cby has been shown to interact with itself using the conventional yeast two-hybrid system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In order to confirm and further extend this observation, we examined whether Cby forms a complex with itself in mammalian cultured cells by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Cell lysates from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells co-transfected with Myc- and Flag-tagged Cby expression constructs were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Flag antibody. A specific interaction was reproducibly observed between the Cby proteins (lane 3).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cby forms a stable complex with itself</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-Cby and Flag-Cby. <bold>(B) </bold>Cby self-interaction was detected by split synthetic Renilla luciferase (hRluc) protein-fragment-assisted complementation. Cby or negative control GFP was fused in-frame to the N-terminal portion (RN) and C-terminal portion (RC) of hRluc. These expression plasmids (400 ng each) were transfected into HEK293T cells as indicated, and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activities were measured 24 hr post-transfection. A firefly luciferase plasmid (5 ng) was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency.

Transfections were carried out in triplicate and the means &#x000b1; SD are shown.<bold>(D) </bold>Cby complex is highly stable. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with wash buffer containing 0.135, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 M NaCl, or 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 M urea as shown. The experiments with urea were performed in the presence of 0.135 M NaCl.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-41-1"/></fig><p>Next, split synthetic Renilla luciferase (hRluc) assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] were employed as an independent means to verify the Cby-Cby interaction. To this end, Cby or negative control GFP was fused in-frame to the N-terminal portion of hRluc (Cby-RN or GFP-RN) or to the C-terminal portion of hRluc (Cby-RC or GFP-RC). Physical interactions between fusion proteins would bring the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of hRluc together and restore its activity. The constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells in various combinations and hRluc activities were measured. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, co-transfection of empty vectors (RN and RC) or Cby- and GFP-hRluc fusion plasmids (Cby-RN and GFP-RC or GFP-RN and Cby-RC) produced only a basal level of hRluc activity. In contrast, robust hRluc activity was observed when Cby-RN and Cby-RC were coexpressed. We also utilized a cell-permeable substrate for Renilla luciferase (ViviRen) to detect protein-protein interactions in live cells in real time. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> demonstrates that transient co-transfection of Cby-RN and Cby-RC expression vectors into HEK293T cells resulted in a high luminescence value, whereas either vector in combination with an empty plasmid (RC or RN) generated only low background luminescence. Interactions between Cby and the well-established basic leucine zipper (bZIP) coiled-coil transcription factors, Jun and Fos, were also tested using the ViviRen live cell substrate. No marked luminescence was detected when Cby-RN and Fos-RC or Jun-RN and Cby-RC were coexpressed in HEK293T cells, compared to that of Jun-Fos and Cby-Cby interactions, suggesting that the Cby-Cby interaction is specific.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined the stability of the Cby oligomer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Flag-Cby and HA-Cby expression plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293T cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then exposed to increasing concentrations of NaCl or urea as indicated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Flag antibody. Essentially, a similar amount of Flag-Cby was detected in the presence of up to 2 M NaCl or 2 M urea. These results indicate that the Cby oligomer is highly stable and that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may contribute to the stability of the Cby complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Cby is present as a homodimer</title><p>To gain insights into the oligomeric nature of Cby, we performed gel filtration chromatography. His-tagged Cby was purified from stable HEK293T cells using nickel beads and applied to a Superdex 75 column. Following fractionation, each fraction was examined by immunoblotting using anti-Cby antibody. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, Cby eluted as a broad single peak centered at fraction 34, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 45 kDa. Since the molecular weight of a His-Cby monomer is 22 kDa, we estimated that Cby is most likely to be present as a homodimer.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cby exists as a homodimer</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Gel filtration analysis of Cby. His-Cby purified from stable HEK293T cells was run on a pre-calibrated Superdex 75 FPLC column in buffer containing 1 M NaCl. An aliquot of each fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Cby antibody. The arrows indicate the elution positions of protein standards: aldolase, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 45 kDa and cytochrome C, 12 kDa. Similar results were obtained using buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl (data not shown). <bold>(B, C) </bold>Cross-linking experiments. His-tagged Cby was purified from transiently transfected HEK293T cells using Ni-NTA beads, and subjected to cross-linking with glutaraldehyde for 5 or 20 min <bold>(B)</bold>, or dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) for 30 min <bold>(C)</bold>. The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Cby antibody.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-41-2"/></fig><p>As an independent means, we conducted glutaraldehyde cross-linking analysis. For this purpose, His-tagged Cby was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, and purified using nickel beads. The purified Cby protein was then incubated in the presence or absence of glutaraldehyde for 5 or 20 min, and the cross-linked proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Cby antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). As expected, in the absence of glutaraldehyde, His-Cby had an apparent monomer molecular weight of 22 kDa. On the other hand, after incubating with glutaraldehyde, His-Cby migrated slower at a higher molecular weight of approximately 44 kDa. Similar results were also observed using dimethyl suberimidate (DMS), another cross-linking reagent that contains a longer spacer arm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). All together, these results suggest that Cby predominantly exists as a homodimer.</p></sec><sec><title>Cby harbors a putative leucine zipper coiled-coil motif in its C-terminal region</title><p>In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], through inspection of the Cby protein sequence, we noted the presence of a putative coiled-coil motif in its C-terminal region. Coiled coils are a supercoiled bundle of &#x003b1;-helices known to mediate protein oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Further analysis of the human Cby amino acid sequence using the COILS program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] predicted a high probability of an &#x003b1;-helical coiled-coil structure extending from amino acids 68 to 102 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Visual examination of this segment revealed four leucine residues that appear at every seventh position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), characteristic of a leucine zipper coiled-coil motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The sequence alignment of the Cby coiled-coil domain across species shows that these four leucines are perfectly conserved in vertebrate Cby homologues. On the contrary, only the first two leucine residues (L77 and L84) are conserved in fruit fly <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>Cby. Nonetheless, the corresponding region of <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>Cby was also predicted to form a coiled-coil structure by the COILS program (data not shown), signifying the functional importance of this domain. As depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, the coiled-coil domain of human Cby comprises four consecutive heptad repeats with amino acid positions labeled as a-g. Helical wheel projection of this region illustrates that the d positions are lined with leucine residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), as typically observed in bZIP transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The a and d positions are occupied generally by hydrophobic residues that interact with each other to form a hydrophobic core, while residues in the other positions are often surface-exposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Some of these exposed amino acid residues in the heptad repeats of Cby might directly contact &#x003b2;-catenin as the &#x003b2;-catenin-binding domain of Cby resides in its C-terminal half [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Collectively, these observations raise the possibility that the four heptad leucines may play an essential role in mediating Cby homodimerization.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The C-terminal region of Cby harbors a putative coiled-coil motif</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>The human Cby protein sequence (126 amino acid residues) was analyzed by the COILS program at a window size of 21 residues.

These mutations would not be expected to disrupt the &#x003b1;-helical structure of Cby, but the shorter alanine side chain would not be able to mediate a leucine zipper-mediated stable coiled-coil configuration. Upon overexpression of N-terminally Flag-tagged proteins in HEK293T cells, all Cby mutants were detected at appreciable levels by Western blotting using anti-Flag antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Next, the Cby mutants were evaluated for their ability to form a complex with wild-type Cby (CbyWT) by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Individual Flag-tagged Cby mutant was coexpressed with HA-tagged CbyWT in HEK293T cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Flag antibody. Cby single-point mutants were all able to interact with CbyWT although reduced interactions were noted for CbyL84A. Remarkably, Cby mutants carrying alanine substitutions for two or more out of the four leucine residues completely abolished their interaction with CbyWT. To validate these data, we carried out split hRluc assays for self-associations between Cby point mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Coexpression of CbyWT-hRluc fusion proteins in HEK293T cells yielded high Rluc activity. Consistent with the coimmunoprecipitation experiments, reduced, yet significant Rluc activities were observed for Cby single-point mutants, whereas all Cby double mutants or the quadruple mutant (Cby4A) displayed only marginal Rluc activities.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The heptad leucine residues within the coiled-coil domain are crucial for Cby homodimerization</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Expression levels of Cby point mutants.

Notably, the dimerization-deficient mutant CbyL77A/L91A-Flag exhibited increased cytoplasmic staining, while both CbyL77A-Flag and CbyL91A-Flag mutants capable of self-interaction displayed predominant nuclear localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). To confirm these results, we next evaluated the intracellular localization of N-terminally Flag-tagged Cby protein (Flag-Cby). Consistent with our previous observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], when expressed in COS7 cells, Flag-CbyWT primarily localized to the cytoplasm or both the nucleus and cytoplasm, especially in cells with high levels of Cby expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). This cellular localization pattern of Flag-CbyWT is essentially the same as that of untagged protein (data not shown). In contrast, Flag-CbyL77A/L91A defective in dimer formation showed a subtle yet significant shift towards cytoplasmic localization.

Upon Wnt stimulation, &#x003b2;-catenin, the key downstream component of this pathway, enters the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional coactivator to up-regulate target gene expression. Cby is an evolutionarily conserved protein that directly binds to the C-terminal activation domain of &#x003b2;-catenin and antagonizes its signaling activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Cby has been shown to interact with itself through its C-terminal region using yeast two-hybrid assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, the molecular basis for the Cby-Cby interaction has remained largely uncharacterized to date.</p><p>Here we provide evidence that Cby forms a homodimer via the leucine zipper coiled-coil motif in its C-terminal region. The Cby complex is highly stable even in the presence of 2 M NaCl or 2 M urea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). We found that the four leucine residues in the d position of the helical wheel diagram (amino acids 77, 84, 91 and 98 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) are crucial for mediating Cby self-association. Alanine mutagenesis of two or more leucines completely abolishes the Cby-Cby interaction (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Furthermore, our data indicate that the Cby-Cby interaction is not obligatory both for binding to &#x003b2;-catenin and for suppressing its signaling activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Instead, homodimerization of Cby is a prerequisite process for its efficient binding to importin-&#x003b1; and nuclear import (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>&#x003b1;-Helical coiled-coil motifs are versatile domains that mediate numerous protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The C-terminal coiled-coil motif of Cby is evolutionarily conserved from fly to human, implying the biological importance of this domain. Consistent with the presence of the &#x003b1;-helical coiled-coil structure, circular dichroism (CD) studies showed that Cby protein has a high &#x003b1;-helical content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our cross-linking and gel filtration experiments suggest that Cby predominantly forms a dimer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, it is also possible that Cby exists in a larger oligomeric state under certain conditions as shown for other coiled-coil proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In order to gain further insights into the molecular basis and functional significance of the Cby-Cby interaction, it would be of great interest to determine the three-dimensional structure of the Cby complex. However, so far, Cby protein is insoluble and forms inclusion bodies when expressed using bacterial as well as baculoviral expression systems (data not shown), thereby impeding further structural and biochemical analyses. We found that the aggregation of Cby protein is mainly caused by the C-terminal coiled-coil domain since the N-terminal half of the protein is highly soluble in <italic>E. coli </italic>(data not shown).</p><p>Our recent data suggest that Cby harbors functional NLS and NES motifs, and constantly cycles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Thus, it appears that Cby intracellular localization at steady state is determined by a dynamic balance between its nuclear import and export. In this respect, Cby homodimerization represents a crucial step for its efficient binding to importin-&#x003b1; and subsequent nuclear import. It is noteworthy that dimer formation has been shown to be the key regulatory event controlling the nuclear entry of STAT, SREBP2 and viral IE1 transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Nuclear import of STATs is mediated by importin-&#x003b1; family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], but that of SREBP2 depends on importin-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, binding of importin-&#x003b1;5 to STAT dimers strictly requires two intact NLS elements, one in each STAT monomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We therefore envision that the assembly of Cby into dimers creates a fully functional NLS perhaps by juxtaposing the NLS of each monomer, allowing its efficient binding to importin-&#x003b1; and subsequent nuclear import. Alternatively, Cby oligomerization may induce a conformational change that unmasks the NLS.</p><p>Our results clearly show that Cby mutants deficient in self-interaction are capable of efficiently binding to &#x003b2;-catenin, leading to repression of its signaling activity to a similar extent as wild-type Cby (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), despite the fact that these Cby mutants are predominantly cytoplasmic (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). However, this is in agreement with our model in which Cby inhibits &#x003b2;-catenin signaling through two distinct molecular mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]: 1) in the nucleus, Cby competes with Tcf/Lef transcription factors for binding to &#x003b2;-catenin; 2) Cby sequesters &#x003b2;-catenin in the cytoplasm in collaboration with 14-3-3 proteins. Thus, we speculate that monomeric Cby suppresses &#x003b2;-catenin signaling by trapping &#x003b2;-catenin within the cytoplasmic compartment. Alternatively, a small portion of nuclear Cby might be sufficient to repress &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation since dimerization-deficient Cby mutants are able to enter the nucleus, albeit at a reduced rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the Cby-Cby interaction is of importance in certain biological contexts other than &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. For example, Cby has been shown to interact with thyroid cancer-1 (TC-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and polycystin-2 (PC-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. TC-1 was initially identified as a gene whose expression was elevated in thyroid cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. More recently, TC-1 was shown to interact with Cby and stimulate &#x003b2;-catenin signaling presumably by displacing Cby from &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, its precise functions are not yet completely understood. PC-2 is another known binding partner of Cby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The PDK-2 gene, encoding PC-2, is mutated in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. A previous report showed that Cby associates with PC-2 and regulates its subcellular distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Hence, Cby appears to exert multiple biological functions. Whether Cby self-association is involved in controlling the activity of TC-1 and PC-2 awaits further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that Cby forms a stable dimer through its C-terminal coiled-coil motif, which consists of a heptad repeat of four conserved leucine residues. Our extensive mutational analysis clearly shows that these leucines are critical for Cby dimerization. In addition, our results indicate that the Cby self-interaction is dispensable for inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling but is required for Cby nuclear import.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Expression vectors for Flag-CbyWT, MBP-CbyWT, &#x003b2;-catenin-Myc and His-&#x003b2; catR10-C have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].
