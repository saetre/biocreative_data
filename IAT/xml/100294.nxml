Its major task is to recognize mismatches as well as insertion&#x0002f;deletion loops which have escaped the polymerase proofreading activity in newly synthesized DNA, and to accomplish the repair of these mistakes. Bacterial mismatch repair, which has been reconstituted with purified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c1">1</xref>), is essentially carried out by the two homodimeric proteins MutS and MutL and the endonuclease MutH. MutS has been shown to recognize and bind the mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c2">2</xref>), followed by ATP-dependent recruitment of MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c3">3</xref>). This complex subsequently activates the exonuclease MutH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c5">5</xref>), which initiates repair of the faulty DNA area.</p><p>The homodimeric MutS protein, which exhibits an asymmetrical conformation on mismatched DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c7">7</xref>), has evolved as heterodimers in eukaryotes and two of these (hMutS&#x003b1;, consisting of hMSH2 and hMSH6, and hMutS&#x003b2;, consisting of hMSH2 and hMSH3) have been implicated in human mismatch repair. Human MutL&#x003b1; (hMLH1 paired with hPMS2) as well as hMutL&#x003b2; (hMLH1 paired with hPMS1) correspond to bacterial MutL. While hMutL&#x003b1; alone is able to confer complete mismatch repair proficiency on hMLH1-deficient extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c8">8</xref>), data for a possible contribution of hMutL&#x003b2;, which is 10 times less abundant than hMutL&#x003b1; in HeLa nuclear extracts, to mismatch repair are conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c11">11</xref>).</p><p>MutS and its homologs contain a conserved ATP-binding cassette ATPase site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c7">7</xref>). ATP has been observed to abolish MutS protein binding to mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c16">16</xref>). Further investigations indicated that MutS proteins show a translocating or sliding mode on DNA after mismatch recognition and ATP uptake, either as an ATP-driven engine (translocation model; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c13">13</xref>) or by diffusion along DNA with the bound ATP transmitting a repair signal in a manner similar to G proteins (sliding clamp model; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c17">17</xref>). Recently, a third model (DNA bending model; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c18">18</xref>) was proposed, based on the findings that ATP uptake by bacterial MutS and binding to a mismatch may not be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c20">20</xref>) and that translocation along a DNA helix is not required in mismatch repair, since MutH activation can occur in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c18">18</xref>). This model suggests that MutS remains bound to the mismatch site even after uptake of ATP, and that ATP imparts verification of the mismatch by decreasing the affinity of MutS for homoduplex DNA more than the affinity of MutS for heteroduplex DNA. In this model MutS can only activate MutH through MutL when a mismatch and ATP are bound at the same time.</p><p>MutL proteins also contain an ATPase site in each subunit. Some results indicate preferential binding of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MutL to single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c22">22</xref>) and an ATP-regulated clamp mechanism for single-stranded DNA has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c22">22</xref>). Furthermore, MutL was shown to load DNA helicase II onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c23">23</xref>) and to activate it in a mismatch-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c24">24</xref>), which promoted the development of a model of MutL inducing DNA unwinding and passing of one strand to an exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c24">24</xref>). Moreover, MutL and its eukaryotic homologs have been suggested to be molecular matchmakers that signal mismatch recognition to downstream proteins responsible for excision and repair. After mismatch recognition MutS has to interact with MutL or the respective eukaryotic counterparts, and evidence for this interaction in the form of ternary complexes including MutS and MutL proteins and DNA has been provided for the bacterial, yeast and human proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c32">32</xref>).</p><p>Conflicting results have been provided for the role of ATP in the interaction of human MutL and MutS homologs. One report showed that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for complex formation of hMSH2 and hMLH1 in HeLa extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c28">28</xref>), while another found that hMutS&#x003b1; forms complexes with hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; on mismatched DNA that are abolished by addition of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c29">29</xref>). Recently, an ATP- and DNA-length-dependent assembly of human MutS&#x003b1; and MutL&#x003b1; was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c32">32</xref>). It was the aim of this work: (i) to establish an experimental system to examine binding of hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; to DNA; (ii) to investigate the conditions under which the interaction between hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL heterodimers occurs; (iii) to clarify the role of hMutL&#x003b2; in complex formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Poly&#x0005b;d(I-C)&#x0005d; was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany).

Bold letters indicate the position of the G-T mismatch and italic letters the area that remained single stranded in specific experiments. Duplexes were created by annealing these oligomers with their antisense oligomers as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c29">29</xref>). All oligonucleotides were coupled to Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Incubations were performed with 50 pmol DNA substrate per mg Dynabeads, thus remaining below the binding capacity of the beads (200 pmol single-stranded oligomers&#x0002f;mg). The coupling efficiency was evaluated by comparing the DNA content before and after incubation using 15&#x00025; polyacrylamide gels and silver staining. While 32mer single- and double-stranded oligomers exhibited complete binding to the beads, the binding of 81mer double-stranded DNA achieved &#x0223c;90&#x00025; binding. No difference in binding efficiency was detectable between coupling of homoduplex versus heteroduplex substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding assay</title><p>Before use, DNA-coupled Dynabeads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 5&#x00025; glycerol, 1 mM EDTA) and equal volumes were pipetted into 1.5 ml cups. After collecting the beads with a magnet the supernatant was carefully removed. Binding reactions were carried out with 50 or 100 &#x000b5;g nuclear extract as indicated in the individual experiments. For supplementation experiments, 185&#x000a0;ng purified hMutS&#x003b1; or 300 ng purified hMutL&#x003b1; were added. Nuclear extract was added to the premixed binding buffer resulting in a final composition of 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH&#x000a0;7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5&#x00025; glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT and 1 &#x000b5;g poly&#x0005b;d(I-C)&#x0005d; in a total volume of 300 &#x000b5;l. In experiments using the same extracts or proteins, the binding mixture was prepared for all samples in one vial and then aliquoted into separate cups to avoid any variation in the incubation mixture. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then for 10 min on ice. Poly&#x0005b;d(I-C)&#x0005d; and the preincubation steps were omitted in experiments using only purified proteins. All subsequent steps were performed on ice. Each reaction mixture was added to aliquots of 670 &#x000b5;g Dynabeads coupled with substrate DNA and incubated for 25 min. In experiments including ATP, this was added now to a final concentration of 250 &#x000b5;M, and all samples were further incubated for 10 min if not specified otherwise. Afterwards, beads were collected with a magnet and the supernatant was removed. The cup was centrifuged, the beads collected and the remaining supernatant again taken off. For elution, the beads were resuspended in 20 &#x000b5;l of elution buffer (20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5&#x00025; glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT) with the NaCl concentration indicated for the individual experiments and incubated for 5 min. In experiments examining the salt resistance of the hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA complex in the presence of ATP, 250 &#x000b5;M ATP was included in the washing buffers. As shown in experiments without DNA on the beads, non-specific binding of mismatch repair proteins was negligible. Furthermore, experiments with several samples treated identically in parallel also showed identical signals on one blot, providing evidence that this procedure does not produce significant variations during sample processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>The proteins eluted in the above assay were separated on 10&#x00025; polyacrylamide gels, followed by western blotting on nitrocellulose membranes and antibody detection using standard procedures. Because PMS1 runs to only a slightly higher molecular weight than PMS2, both proteins were detected consecutively (first PMS1, then, after stripping of the membrane, PMS2).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>DNA binding properties of hMutS&#x003b1;, hMutS&#x003b2; and hMutL&#x003b1;</title><p>To confirm that human mismatch repair proteins bind DNA substrates coupled to magnetic beads, we incubated either nuclear extracts of the mismatch repair-proficient cell line TK6 or purified hMutL&#x003b1; with beads coupled with 32mer single-stranded or homoduplex DNA. Furthermore, the effect on binding of different adenine nucleotides (ADP, ATP, ATP-&#x003b3;-S and AMP-PNP, each at 250 &#x000b5;M) was assessed. Complete elution of bound proteins was carried out with 700 mM NaCl. Beads boiled in SDS sample buffer after this elution did not show any signal (data not shown). Furthermore, the assay showed only DNA-bound mismatch repair proteins, since beads without DNA produced negligible signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f1">1</xref>).</p><p>As expected, hMutS&#x003b1; (hMSH2&#x02013;hMSH6) displayed higher affinity for double-stranded DNA, which was reduced by ATP. While AMP-PNP did not affect hMutS&#x003b1; binding, ATP-&#x003b3;-S also had a depressing effect, which is in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c36">36</xref>). Although the effect of ATP-&#x003b3;-S was much weaker than that of ATP, it was reproducible and became more intense after longer incubation times (data not shown). No hMutS&#x003b2; (hMSH2&#x02013;hMSH3) bound to the homoduplex substrate, while some affinity for single-stranded DNA was observed, which may reflect the preference of hMutS&#x003b2; for extrahelical loops. Interestingly, binding of hMSH3 to double-stranded DNA became detectable in the presence of ADP &#x0005b;although the expected concomitant rise in the signal of hMSH2 could not be detected due to the significantly higher abundance of hMSH2&#x02013;hMSH6 (hMutS&#x003b1;) in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c37">37</xref>)&#x0005d;. This may reflect an ADP-transmitted change in the hMutS&#x003b2;&#x02013;homoduplex interaction which did not occur with hMutS&#x003b1; under the assay conditions used. While hardly any hMLH1 from cell extracts bound to the substrates, hMutL&#x003b1; bound efficiently when used as a purified protein, which is probably attributable to the absence of competition by other DNA-binding proteins. hMutL&#x003b1; exhibited a three times higher affinity for single- than double-stranded DNA, as judged by densitometric evaluation of the western blot. The binding affinity of hMutL&#x003b1; was not affected by addition of adenine nucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>hMutS&#x003b1; bound to a mismatch exhibits higher salt resistance than hMutS&#x003b1; bound to homoduplex DNA</title><p>To investigate whether hMutS&#x003b1; binds differently to homo- and heteroduplexes in this assay, magnetic bead-coupled 32mer oligoduplex substrates, containing either a G-T mismatch or the correct base pairing, were tested for their ability to bind hMutS&#x003b1; by incubation with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, which are proficient in mismatch repair. Slightly more hMutS&#x003b1; was retrieved from hetero- than from homoduplexes by elution with 1.5 M NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f2">2</xref>A, hMSH2 shown; hMSH6 reacted identically, data not shown). No more mismatch repair proteins could be retrieved by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer after the 1.5 M elution, indicating that this salt concentration was sufficient to disrupt binding of the investigated proteins to both DNA substrates. The finding that both substrates bound hMutS&#x003b1; efficiently is consistent with earlier reports showing that hMutS&#x003b1; not only binds mismatches, but also has homoduplex affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c36">36</xref>). Consecutive elution with increasing salt concentrations from 100 to 1300 mM NaCl after incubation with extracts from the repair-proficient cell lines HeLa and TK6 and repair-deficient TK6 clone MT1 revealed different elution profiles of hMutS&#x003b1; from mismatched and correctly paired substrates. Binding of hMutS&#x003b1; to homoduplex DNA was disrupted at 200&#x02013;700 mM NaCl, while hMutS&#x003b1; required 700&#x02013;1300 mM NaCl to be eluted from heteroduplexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f1">1</xref>B, hMSH2 shown; hMSH6 reacted identically, data not shown). hMutS&#x003b1; from MT1 cells, whose <italic>hMSH6</italic> genes carry two missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c38">38</xref>), reacted qualitatively similarly to wild-type protein, but showed reduced binding, which may be attributable either to decreased abundance of hMutS&#x003b1; in MT1 extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f1">1</xref>C) or to an impaired DNA binding ability of the mutant heterodimer. Similar elution profiles were obtained for 81mer duplexes (data not shown). While hMSH2 and hMSH6 reacted in parallel in these experiments, hMSH3 was again undetectable on homo- and heteroduplexes (data not shown). Although mismatch-bound hMutS&#x003b1; exhibited high salt resistance, the initial binding to mismatches was not efficient above 200 mM NaCl (data not shown), confirming previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c39">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ATP reduces the salt resistance of hMutS&#x003b1; binding but hMutS&#x003b1; retains affinity for heteroduplexes</title><p>To investigate the effect of ATP on homo- and heteroduplex binding of hMutS&#x003b1; in our assay, we added 250 &#x000b5;M ATP to the binding reaction. ATP immediately (elution 1 min after addition of ATP) disrupted the highly salt-resistant binding of HeLa hMutS&#x003b1; to mismatched 32mer DNA beads, and hMutS&#x003b1; detached at 100&#x02013;350 mM NaCl from homo- and heteroduplexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f3">3</xref>A, hMSH2 and eluate fractions below 500 mM shown; hMSH6 reacted identically, data not shown). To determine the ATP concentration sufficient for this effect, we performed consecutive elutions with 700 and 1000 mM NaCl. This allowed specific detection of mismatch-bound hMutS&#x003b1; in the 1000 mM eluate fraction in the absence of ATP (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f2">2</xref>B); this signal is expected to disappear when ATP takes effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f3">3</xref>A). Using this approach, the ATP concentration that disrupts the specific hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;mismatch complex was found to be 1&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f3">3</xref>B, hMSH2 shown; hMSH6 reacted identically, data not shown), which is in good agreement with the IC<sub>50</sub> of 3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M reported previously for human hMutS&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c36">36</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, after 10 min incubation with 250 &#x000b5;M ATP, consecutive elution with 100 and 500 mM NaCl revealed that more protein eluted from 32mer heteroduplexes than from homoduplexes, which occurred predominantly in the 500 mM fraction. This result was similar when ATP was added before incubation with the beads and therefore was not an artefact of higher initial binding of hMutS&#x003b1; to heteroduplex DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f3">3</xref>C). Bacterial and yeast MutL proteins have been shown to improve the binding of MutS proteins to mismatches in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c31">31</xref>). However, in the present study the reaction of hMutS&#x003b1; in HCT-116 extracts (hMutL-deficient) was similar to that of hMutS&#x003b1; in HCT-116&#x0002b;ch3 extracts (hMutL-proficient), indicating that hMutL dimers did not affect DNA binding of hMutS&#x003b1; under these experimental conditions. These experiments suggest that the affinity of hMutS&#x003b1; to homoduplexes may be more impaired by ATP and that hMutS&#x003b1; is able to retain binding to heteroduplexes in the presence of ATP at salt concentrations of 50 and 100 mM NaCl.</p></sec><sec><title>ATP promotes binding of hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; on 81mer DNA substrates</title><p>While addition of ATP did not induce hMLH1 binding to 32mer DNA substrates, hMLH1 from HeLa extracts showed enhanced binding to 81mer substrates after addition of 250 &#x000b5;M ATP and eluted in the 700 mM NaCl fraction. No hMutL proteins were detectable in the 1000 mM fraction or could be detached by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer after this elution (data not shown) and no binding occurred on beads without DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f4">4</xref>), confirming that binding of hMLH1 was DNA dependent and that elution with 700 mM NaCl was quantitative. The increase in bound hMLH1 occurred on both homo- and heteroduplexes. Nuclear extracts of the mismatch repair-proficient cell lines TK6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>F) and HCT-116&#x0002b;ch3 (data not shown) reacted similarly and in all cases both hMutL&#x003b1; (hMLH1 with hPMS2) and hMutL&#x003b2; (hMLH1 with hPMS1) were bound. Although hMutL&#x003b1; was shown to have a higher affinity for single-stranded DNA, the completely duplexed 81mer substrate reacted identically to one containing a duplexed area of 42 bp and a single-stranded area of 39 bp, suggesting that hMutL&#x003b1; binding to single-stranded DNA is not an important factor in initial complex formation. This held true whether the single-stranded area was located at the 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-end of the duplexed area (data not shown). In this experiment consecutive elutions with 700 and 1000 mM NaCl were performed, with the former fraction eluting hMutL proteins, homoduplex-bound hMutS&#x003b1; in the absence of ATP and hMutS&#x003b1; bound to DNA in the presence of ATP. The 1000 mM fraction was utilized to detect (ATP-induced disruption of) the mismatch-specific complex of hMutS&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; is dependent on hMutS&#x003b1;</title><p>LoVo and Hec59 cells are deficient in hMutS proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>A) and hMLH1 in nuclear extracts of both cell lines failed to react to ATP in our binding experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>B). ATP sensitivity was restored in both experiments when the extracts were supplemented with nuclear extract from hMLH1-deficient HCT-116 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>B). Furthermore, purified hMutS&#x003b1; alone was able to restore the reaction in LoVo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>C) and Hec59 nuclear extracts (data not shown), proving that binding of hMutL heterodimers was dependent on hMutS&#x003b1;. Because the reaction of hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; with ATP was restored, hMutS&#x003b1; was competent for recruitment of both hMutL heterodimers. Nevertheless, hMutL&#x003b2; was not essential for the interaction, because purified hMutL&#x003b1; alone also formed a complex with hMutS&#x003b1; when added to a nuclear extract of HCT-116 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>D). Purified hMutL&#x003b1; alone also reacted with ATP when supplemented with purified hMutS&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>E), further showing that these two heterodimers are sufficient for interaction. However, direct comparison showed that significantly more hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; bound in the supplementation experiments with cell extracts, although the same amounts of purified protein were used for both (data not shown). This effect likely reflects that additional proteins engaged in DNA manipulation and repair significantly enhance DNA binding and support complex formation of hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL proteins. This concept is supported by recent findings that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) can enhance mismatch binding of MutS&#x003b1; in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c40">40</xref>) and that MMR proteins seem to assemble in larger complexes with other DNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c41">41</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, mutated hMutS&#x003b1; in MT1 extracts was as efficient in recruitment of hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; as the wild-type heterodimer of the parental, mismatch repair-proficient cell line TK6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>F). Furthermore, addition of purified wild-type hMutS&#x003b1; to the MT1 extract did not increase binding of hMutL proteins, though the specific complex of mismatch-bound hMutS&#x003b1; in the 1000 mM NaCl fraction was restored. The mutations of <italic>hMSH6</italic> in MT1 cells (V1260I and D1213V) are both located in the ATPase region and are likely to impair hMSH6 ATPase function. Two reasons may account for the ability of mutated MT1&#x02013;hMutS&#x003b1; to recruit hMutL heterodimers as efficiently as wild-type protein: (i) the hMSH6 ATPase function may not be sufficiently suppressed by the mutation to abolish interaction; (ii) the interaction between hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL heterodimers may be predominantly conferred by the hMSH2 ATPase.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential hMutS&#x003b1;-dependent recruitment of hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2;</title><p>To test whether formation of complexes of hMutS&#x003b1; with hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; occurs equivalently, the ATP concentration necessary for recruitment of hMutL heterodimers was assessed. Recruitment occurred at 1&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M ATP, but hPMS1 and hPMS2 did not react in parallel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f6">6</xref>A). While 1 &#x000b5;M ATP efficiently promoted complex formation between hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1;, hMutL&#x003b2; still showed a significant increase when the ATP concentration was raised from 1 to 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M. Direct comparison of homo- and heteroduplex DNA with 1 and 250 &#x000b5;M ATP showed that heteroduplex DNA was more efficient in recruitment of hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; at both concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f6">6</xref>B). The finding that hMutS&#x003b1; is able to recruit predominantly hMutL&#x003b1; at 1 &#x000b5;M ATP on homo- and heteroduplexes and the observation that in the absence of ATP hPMS2 generally exhibits higher basal binding than hPMS1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf154f5">5</xref>C&#x02013;F) suggest that hMutS&#x003b1; may have an intrinsic preference for hMutL&#x003b1;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The binding of hMutS&#x003b1; to mismatches and its interaction with hMutL heterodimers on DNA was investigated by a method that enabled the use of short incubation times and cell extracts, which allowed the mimicking of biological binding conditions more closely. Binding of all proteins in this assay was confirmed to be DNA dependent, and consecutive washing steps of increasing stringency allowed the existence of mismatch-specific binding of hMutS&#x003b1; to be proved. Furthermore, the mismatch binding ability of hMutS&#x003b1; was shown to be altered at the same ATP concentration as reported previously, confirming the reliability of the method. The higher salt resistance exhibited by hMutS&#x003b1; when bound to heteroduplexes likely mirrors the tighter and more stable interaction of MutS proteins with mismatched DNA that has previously been visualized in the crystal structure of bacterial MutS and heteroduplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c7">7</xref>). The data from this study also show that hMutL&#x003b1; binds single-stranded DNA, providing evidence that the function of human MutL&#x003b1; is similar to bacterial MutL, which also preferentially binds this substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c22">22</xref>). Binding of hMutL&#x003b1; to single-stranded DNA was not, however, enhanced by the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, possibly reflecting a lower susceptibility to these nucleotides under the assay conditions used.</p><p>ATP has been shown to reduce the affinity of MutS and its eukaryotic homologs for mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c16">16</xref>), which was interpreted as a complete loss of mismatch binding ability. Recent studies with bacterial MutS, however, indicated that ATP binding and mismatch binding by MutS may not be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c20">20</xref>). The present study confirms that the affinity (in terms of salt resistance) of hMutS&#x003b1; for homo- and heteroduplexes is markedly reduced in the presence of ATP, but also indicates that binding to homoduplexes may be more affected than binding to heteroduplexes. With regard to the current models of mismatch repair, this observation is in accordance with the DNA bending model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c18">18</xref>). In this case, the reduced salt resistance of the hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;mismatch complex in the presence of 250 &#x000b5;M ATP may represent the state of verification that hMutS&#x003b1; would enter after binding ATP.</p><p>Furthermore, hMutS&#x003b1; was found to interact with hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; on DNA in the presence of ATP. This interaction occurred only on 81mer and not on 32mer DNA substrates, reflecting a DNA length dependence of complex formation that has recently also been observed for bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c31">31</xref>) and human complexes using SPRS and gel shift assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c32">32</xref>). The finding that hMutL&#x003b1; has an intrinsic affinity for DNA supports the notion that both heterodimers may stay in contact with DNA in the complex. Because hMutS&#x003b1; covers &#x0223c;25 bp of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c36">36</xref>), the 32mer substrate may not be long enough for interaction.</p><p>According to recent reports, the involvement of hMutL&#x003b2; in mismatch repair remains controversial. hMutL&#x003b2; was suggested to participate in human mismatch repair due to a <italic>hPMS1</italic> mutation found in a patient with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with mutations in mismatch repair genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c9">9</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>PMS1</italic>-deficient mouse fibroblasts exhibit microsatellite instability, a phenotypic marker of deficient mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c10">10</xref>). However, hMutL&#x003b2; is unable to confer mismatch repair proficiency on hMLH1-deficient extracts, which is possible with hMutL&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c11">11</xref>). The present study shows that hMutL&#x003b2;, although being 10 times less abundant than hMutL&#x003b1; in HeLa nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c11">11</xref>), is efficiently recruited by hMutS&#x003b1;. The results also show that hMutL&#x003b1; is the favored partner for interaction with hMutS&#x003b1; at low ATP concentrations. Taken together, the results show that hMutL&#x003b2; participates efficiently in mismatch repair protein complexes. It may exert a supportive function in the repair process after initial formation of the hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; complex. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the precise contribution of MutL&#x003b2; to the mismatch repair process.</p><p>Under the conditions used in the present study, hMutS&#x003b1; interacted with hMutL heterodimers on homoduplexes and heteroduplexes, although complex formation was enhanced on heteroduplexes, which is consistent with earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c28">28</xref>). In contrast, a recent report found complex formation to be mismatch dependent using SPRS and that different hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL&#x003b1; complexes arose on homo- and heteroduplex DNA in gel shift assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c32">32</xref>), showing that the experimental procedure influences the mode of interaction. The ability to interact on homoduplex DNA may be explained by the sliding clamp model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c17">17</xref>) as well as the translocation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c13">13</xref>), since both predict an interaction of hMutS&#x003b1; with other components of the mismatch repair machinery after ATP-induced movement from the mismatch to homoduplex DNA.</p><p>A recent report showed the dynamic nature of human MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutL&#x003b1; complexes on DNA, and the complexes were found to dissociate from the substrate DNA on poly&#x0005b;d(I-C)&#x0005d; challenge in gel shift assays when the DNA was not blocked at both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c32">32</xref>). Although poly&#x0005b;d(I-C)&#x0005d; was present in our experiments (except for those with purified proteins) and the DNA substrates were generally blocked at only one end, hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL complexes remained detectable. A possible explanation is that an equilibrium may be established between formation of hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL complexes on DNA and translocation of these complexes off the oligoduplex during incubation and that only the fraction bound at the moment of elution is subsequently detected. Alternatively, under the assay conditions used, translocation off the oligoduplex may be blocked by other means than a second end block. The complex may, for example, be tethered to the substrate by additional proteins. This would also account for the weaker signals seen in experiments with purified proteins compared with cell extracts.</p><p>hMutS&#x003b1; contains two asymmetrical ATPase sites and it is possible that one ATPase predominantly confers interaction with hMutL proteins after mismatch recognition. The finding that the hMSH6 ATPase mutant in MT1 cells efficiently recruited hMutL heterodimers suggests that hMSH2 predominantly initiates the interaction (which has also been proposed based on considerations of the X-ray structure of bacterial MutS on a mismatch; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c6">6</xref>), while the ATP function of hMSH6 (the subunit that directly contacts the mismatch) may promote subsequent processes, like mismatch verification in the DNA bending model. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate the different contributions of the two ATPases to these processes.</p><p>In conclusion, DNA-coupled magnetic beads provide a suitable tool for investigating protein&#x02013;DNA interactions and formation of mismatch repair protein complexes. The affinity of hMutS&#x003b1; for homoduplexes is shown to be more reduced by ATP than the affinity for heteroduplexes, supporting the recently suggested DNA bending model of mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf154c18">18</xref>). Furthermore, hMutS&#x003b1; is shown to interact with hMutL&#x003b1; as well as hMutL&#x003b2; on DNA. This interaction requires ATP and occurs only on long DNA substrates, confirming the DNA length dependence of complex formation reported earlier. Although hMutL&#x003b2; is efficiently recruited by hMutS&#x003b1;, hMutL&#x003b1; seems to be the preferred partner in the initial interaction and it seems reasonable that hMutL&#x003b2; exerts an auxiliary function in the mismatch repair process.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf154f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> DNA binding properties of hMutS&#x003b1;, hMutS&#x003b2; and hMutL&#x003b1;. 32mer single-stranded or homoduplex DNA was coupled to magnetic beads and incubated with either 100 &#x000b5;g TK6 cell nuclear extract (upper) or 600 ng purified hMutL&#x003b1; (lower).
