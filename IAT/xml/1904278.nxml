Using structural and phylogenetic criteria, we identified two putative genuine La proteins (At32 and At79) and showed that both are expressed throughout plant development but at different levels and under different regulatory conditions. At32, but not At79, restores <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> La nuclear functions in non-coding RNAs biogenesis and is able to bind to plant 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH RNAs. We conclude that these La nuclear functions are conserved in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and supported by At32, which we renamed as AtLa1. Consistently, AtLa1 is predominantly localized to the plant nucleoplasm and was also detected in the nucleolar cavity. The inactivation of AtLa1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leads to an embryonic-lethal phenotype with deficient embryos arrested at early globular stage of development. In addition, mutant embryonic cells display a nucleolar hypertrophy suggesting that AtLa1 is required for normal ribosome biogenesis. The identification of two distantly related proteins with all structural characteristics of genuine La proteins suggests that these factors evolved to a certain level of specialization in plants. This unprecedented situation provides a unique opportunity to dissect the very different aspects of this crucial cellular activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The La protein is a highly abundant phosphoprotein first described in human as an autoantigen in patients suffering from the rheumatic diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). It is an RNA-binding protein involved in many aspects of RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>) and is present in a wide range of eukaryotes including budding and fission yeasts, vertebrates, insects, worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and trypanosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The La protein is one of the first proteins to bind to primary polymerase III (pol III) transcripts due to the specific recognition of the 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH motif present in these precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> La protein (named Lhp1p) also binds polymerase II (pol II) transcribed small RNAs that terminate in 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH such as precursors to the U3 snoRNA (<underline>s</underline>mall <underline>n</underline>ucle<underline>o</underline>lar <underline>RNA</underline>) or U snRNAs (<underline>s</underline>mall <underline>n</underline>uclear <underline>RNA</underline>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). From yeast to human, genetic and biochemical studies have shown that La protects these small RNAs from 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). For example, the binding of La to pre-tRNA precursors prevents exonucleolytic nibbling of their 3&#x02032;-trailer and promotes its endonucleolytic removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>) and Lhp1p stabilizes U snRNAs and U3 precursors from exonucleolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In addition, the La protein fulfils an RNA chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) involved in the assembly of several RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and in the structural stabilization of pre-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Finally, the La protein most probably takes part in the quality-control mechanism of newly synthesized non-coding RNAs such as pre-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>To accomplish its various functions in the biosynthesis of small stable RNAs, most of the La protein logically accumulates in the nucleoplasm as assessed by steady-state subcellular localization experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>). Nevertheless, the La protein subcellular distribution is highly dynamic as this protein was shown to shuttle through the nucleolus in association with several precursor RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">,24&#x02013;26</xref>) and strongly accumulates in the nucleolus during late G1 and early S phases for yet unknown reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). But not all La protein is present in the nuclear compartment. It has been demonstrated that 2&#x02013;4% of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> La homologue accumulates in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and that the human La (hLa) protein shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Moreover, a major pool of La protein is redistributed to the cytoplasm under various stress conditions such as apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) or viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). These observations are in agreement with several reports suggesting that, beside their primary role in pol III and non-coding pol II stable RNAs biosynthesis, La homologues could be implicated in mRNA translation enhancement [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>)]. For example, by binding to their 5&#x02032;-UTR, the cytoplasmic La protein stimulates the internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) as well as certain cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Also, La is involved in the cap-dependent translation of 5&#x02032;-terminal oligopyrimidine stretch (TOP) containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>La proteins are modular polypeptides whose molecular weight ranges from &#x0223c;50&#x02009;kDa in vertebrates to 32&#x02009;kDa in yeasts. Their NH2-terminal domain (NTD) is extremely well conserved and always contains a 60&#x02013;80-amino-acid-domain called the La-motif, also found in a number of otherwise unrelated (La-like) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), closely followed by a canonical <underline>R</underline>NA <underline>r</underline>ecognition <underline>m</underline>otif (RRM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Diverse structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39 B40">37&#x02013;40</xref>) and functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) emphasized the importance for a <italic>bona fide</italic> La protein to display this particular NTD organization at least for efficient and specific binding of 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH-containing substrates. The COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of La proteins is more variable. The hLa CTD contains an atypical RRM (RRM2) ending with a long helix comprising a nuclear retention element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), followed by a <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>b</underline>asic <underline>m</underline>otif (SBM), several phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), a <underline>n</underline>ucle<underline>o</underline>lar <underline>l</underline>ocalization <underline>s</underline>ignal (NoLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and a <underline>n</underline>uclear <underline>l</underline>ocalization <underline>s</underline>ignal (NLS). The RRM2 motif is found in La proteins from all vertebrates, but is absent from the very short CTD of the yeast proteins and was not detected for La homologues from some metazoans such as fly or worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>In higher plants, a functional homologue of the La protein is yet to be identified. We report here that higher plants are exceptional compared to other eukaryotes by having two distantly related proteins that display every structural feature of genuine La proteins. We show that at least one of these proteins we named AtLa1 (for <italic><underline>A</underline>rabidopsis <underline>t</underline>haliana</italic><underline>La</underline> protein <underline>1</underline>) is a true functional homologue as it is able to fulfil the nuclear La functions related to RNA pol III transcripts maturation and stability. We also demonstrate that T-DNA insertion in the <italic>AtLa1</italic> gene leads to embryonic lethality showing that AtLa1 function is required for plant viability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular phylogenetic analyses</title><p>The amino acid sequences of the different La motifs were aligned using ClustalW multiple-alignment program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Evolutionary distances were calculated using the probability matrix from blocks (PMB) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) of the Protdist program (PHYLIP package version 3.6, available at the following web site: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html">http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html</ext-link>). The coefficient of variation of the gamma distribution (to incorporate rate heterogeneity) was obtained by pre-analysing the data with the Tree-Puzzle program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), and the significance of the various phylogenetic lineages was assessed by bootstrap analyses (1000 trials) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The phylogenetic tree and the consensus tree were inferred using the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) and Consense programs (both from the PHYLIP package), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning</title><p>cDNAs corresponding to At32 and At79 isoforms were PCR amplified from a cDNA library derived from Col0 suspension cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). PCR products were inserted in pBluescript vector and two clones for each cDNA were fully sequenced. Plasmids were named p116 (At32 in pBSK) and p114 (At79 in pBSK), respectively. The centromeric yeast shuttle vector pFL38 (<italic>ARSCEN</italic>-<italic>URA3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) was used as a platform to assemble the different genes under the control of the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) with or without the Protein A tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). First, a 1169-bp SacI-BamHI and a 264-bp BamHI-HindIII restriction fragments, both from the pGALPATG1L vector (obtained from K. Hellmut and E. Hurt, University of Heidelberg), containing the GAL1-10 promoter region fused with the Protein A tag, and the GAL4 transcription terminator region, respectively, were cloned into pFL38 to produce the pFL38GALProtA vector (p131). The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> open reading frames (ORFs) were PCR amplified from plasmids p116 and p114, respectively, while the <italic>LHP1</italic> gene was amplified from the pATL vector [generous gift from Sandra Wolin (HHMI, New Haven)]. All PCR amplifications were performed using a 5&#x02032;-primer with a terminal BamHI site (to produce the tagged version) or with a terminal SphI site (to produce the untagged version) in combination with a 3&#x02032;-primer ending with an XhoI site. The tagged and untagged final constructs were produced by cloning the different PCR products in pFL38GALProtA after digestions with BamHI-XhoI (tagged version) or with an SphI-XhoI (untagged version). By this way, we obtained the pGAL [numbers p140 (<italic>LHP1</italic>), p139 (At32) and p138 (At79)] and pGALPa [numbers p133 (<italic>LHP1</italic>), p132 (At32) and p135 (At79)] collections. To construct the high-copy vectors, the <italic>ARSCEN</italic> regions of plasmids p131, p133 and p132 were excised by ClaI digestion and replaced with the 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;L region of pFL44L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) to produce the p2&#x003bc;GALPa plasmids [p144 (Protein A alone), p150 (<italic>LHP1</italic>), p145 (At32) and p146 (At79)].</p><p>Restriction sites (NheI-SmaI at the 5&#x02032;-end and BamHI-XbaI at the 3&#x02032;-end) were added by PCR amplification to the eGFP ORF. The PCR amplification product was inserted into pBluescript vector at sites HincII and XbaI to obtain pBSK-eGFP (p315) and verified by sequencing. The At32-coding region was subsequently inserted into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pBSK-eGFP resulting in NH2 GFP fusion (vector p316), and into the XhoI and NheI sites to give COOH fusion (vector p317). After sequencing, each fusion as well as the eGFP ORF were transferred at the KpnI and XbaI restriction sites of the plant transformation vector pBIN-HYG-TX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S) giving plasmids p320 (GFP), p321 and p322 (GFP-At32 and At32-GFP).</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast strains and media</title><p>Growth and handling of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were by standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).

Our search revealed the presence of eight <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and nine rice putative proteins containing a La motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We used a phylogenetic approach to test the relationship of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice La motifs with those present in several eukaryote La and La-like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Our results show that two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (At4g32720 and At1g79880) and two rice (bad19607 and cae03115) proteins form a well-supported cluster (bootstrap of 1000) and that the association of this cluster with the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> La proteins is fairly well supported (bootstrap of 728, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The NTD of La proteins contains a typical RRM (SMART accession number SM00715) (referred to as RRM1) that closely follows the La motif. In addition to At4g32720, At1g79880, bad19607 and cae03115, three <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and four rice proteins also present a RRM closely following the La motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), but these proteins group in a cluster intermediate between genuine La and La-like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

This motif is very difficult to detect based on primary sequence analysis alone. We hence searched for the presence of such atypical RRMs in the plant putative La homologues using the hidden-Markov-model (HMM)-based protein structure prediction program SAM-T02 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/HMM-apps/T02-query.html">http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/HMM-apps/T02-query.html</ext-link>). This program was successful in predicting the correct topology for the human atypical RRM2 (see Supplementary Figure 1 online). We found that amongst the plant proteins displaying both the La motif and the canonical RRM, At4g32720 and At1g79880 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and bad19607 and cae03115 from rice are the only ones likely to possess an atypical RRM2 domain in their CTDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and Supplementary Figure 1 online). We also found that with the exception of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologues, each of the genuine La proteins we tested is likely to display such motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, Supplementary Data Figure 1 online). Therefore, the presence of an atypical RRM in the La protein CTDs is apparently not a characteristic restricted to vertebrate proteins, but is likely to be a conserved feature of genuine La proteins with the exception of the yeast homologues, which possess a much shorter CTD. Altogether these data suggest that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> At4g32720 and At1g79880 and rice bad19607 and cae03115 are the most likely <italic>bona fide</italic> La homologues of the two species.</p><p>The two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins, At4g32720 and At1g79880, have an overall amino acid identity of only 44%, with the highest identity found in the La motif (54%) and in the first RRM (59%) (see Supplementary Data Figure 1A online), suggesting that they are not produced from recently duplicated genes. In fact our phylogenetic studies show that At4g32720 is more closely related to the two rice proteins than it is to At1g79880. The presence of two distantly related proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with characteristics of <italic>bona fide</italic> La proteins is exceptional as the eukaryote La function has always been associated to a single La protein [with the exception of two closely related (&#x0003e;90% amino acids identity) <italic>Xenopus</italic> La proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>)].</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of At4g32720 and At1g79880 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p>Searches of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> information resources (TAIR at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org">http://www.arabidopsis.org</ext-link>) and NCBI databases revealed that full-length cDNAs corresponding to both loci have been sequenced. For the At4g32720 locus, all characterized ESTs and full-length cDNAs code for a single protein reported as At4g32720.1. For the At1g79880 locus, three different isoforms are suggested by EST data but only two of those (called At1g79880.1 and At1g79880.2) are supported by full-length cDNAs. The At1g79880.2 protein differs from At1g79880.1 by the deletion of the first 44 amino acids, including more than half of the La motif. Since At1g79880.2 lacks a complete La motif and since the third isoform (At1g79880.3) is only supported by a single EST sequence (corresponding to a small portion of the protein CTD), we decided to conduct further structural and functional studies on the At1g79880.1 protein. From now on, the At4g32720.1 and At1g79880.1 proteins will be referred to as At32 and At79, respectively.</p><p>To monitor the developmental expression profiles of At32 and At79, we searched the expression atlas of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development microarray data (AtGenExpress) using the Genevestigator web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/at/">https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/at/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). We observed that mRNAs corresponding to both genes are present at all developmental stages in every plant tissue tested (see Supplementary Figure 2A online). At32 mRNA levels are highest in tissues composed of actively dividing cells (such as root tips, radicles, seedling, callus or cell suspensions), while At79 mRNAs is in general more abundant in tissues composed of mainly differentiated (non-dividing) cells. In average, At32 mRNAs are four times (4&#x000d7;) more abundant than that of At79 but this ratio is highly variable and is highest (10&#x000d7;) in &#x02018;young&#x02019; tissues and lowest (2&#x000d7;) in 35-day-old senescent and cauline leaves (see Supplementary Figure 2B online). Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for At32 and At79 confirmed that both proteins are present in all developmental stages tested (see Supplementary Figure 2C online).</p><p>To further characterize the roles of At32 and At79, we first conducted functional studies in yeast and tested the ability of these plant proteins to complement phenotypes linked to the full depletion of Lhp1p, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> La homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>At32 restores growth of the <italic>lsm8-1;lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; colethal strain</title><p>While Lhp1p is not required for growth in wild-type cells, it becomes essential in specific genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">,18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">,21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">,53</xref>). The Sm-like protein 8 (Lsm8p) is an essential member of the Lsm2p&#x02013;Lsm8p ring-shaped complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). In the nucleus, Lsm8p associates with U6 snRNA and is important for its stability, for the formation of U6-containing snRNPs and for pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">,64</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">,66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">,67</xref>). The <italic>lsm8-1</italic> allele is not lethal in normal growth conditions but becomes essential when combined with a deletion of the <italic>LHP1</italic> gene. In the <italic>lsm8-1</italic> background, Lhp1p is essential to stabilize newly synthesized U6 RNAs and to facilitate the U6 snRNP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The viability of the BP1 (<italic>lsm8-1;lhp1</italic>-&#x00394;, <italic>ade2</italic>) colethal strain is maintained by an extra-chromosomal copy of the <italic>LHP1</italic> gene carried on an <italic>ARSCEN, ADE2, TRP1</italic> plasmid (pATL). As a red pigment accumulates in <italic>ade2</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>), cells that retain pATL will form white colonies, while cells that grow without the plasmid will form solid red colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). The ability of plant proteins to restore growth in the <italic>lsm8-1;lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; background can be monitored by the capacity of BP1 to form colonies with red sectors when transformed with a plasmid expressing the coding sequence of interest. DNA fragments corresponding to the <italic>LHP1</italic>, At32 and At79 ORFs were cloned in fusion at their NH2 terminus with the Protein A tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) and placed under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter on a low-copy <italic>URA3</italic> vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) to create the pGALPa plasmids collection. BP1 was transformed with the different pGALPa plasmids and grown under galactose-inducing conditions. To compare protein production levels in the different transformants, proteins were prepared from an aliquot of each culture and western blot analysis performed using a rabbit anti-Nhp2p (a snoRNP H/ACA protein) antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) that, as for most IgGs, also binds to the Protein A tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). As expected, the anti-Nhp2p antibody recognizes in all extracts a single protein migrating above 20&#x02009;kDa, corresponding to Nhp2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Additional bands corresponding to the expression of the Protein A alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 2) and to the different fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 3&#x02013;5) were detected in extracts from the BP1 strain transformed with the different pGALPa plasmids. Using the Nhp2p signal as a loading control, we can observe that all fusion proteins accumulate to similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Complementation of the <italic>lsm8-1;lhp1-</italic>&#x00394; colethal phenotype by heterologous expression of the At32 and At79 proteins.

The Lhp1p has a predicted molecular weight of 32&#x02009;kDa but displays an electrophoretic mobility of 38&#x02009;kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>), accordingly the ProtA-Lhp1p migrates above 50&#x02009;kDa (lane 3).

As expected, the ProtA-Lhp1p positive control restores red/white sectoring in the BP1 strain giving 22.2% of colonies with red sectors while background, as observed for the untransformed and Protein A-expressing colethal strain, is between &#x0003c;0.2% and 0.6%. Among the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins, only At32 gives red/white sectoring above background (2.9%). Using fluoroorotic-acid-containing medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>), we confirmed that the red colonies growth is strictly dependent on the presence of the pGALPa vectors expressing ProtA-Lhp1p or ProtA-At32. The inability of the At79-tagged protein to restore growth in the BP1 strain might be due to the presence of the tag or to the fact that a higher level of this protein is required. To test these possibilities, we placed the untagged plant and <italic>LHP1</italic> ORFs under the control of the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter on the <italic>ARSCEN-URA3</italic> plasmid (pGAL vectors) and the galactose controlled protA-tagged ORFs on a high-copy <italic>2</italic>&#x003bc;<italic>L-URA3</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) (p2&#x003bc;GALPa vectors). Each set of plasmids was transformed into the BP1 strain and tested by western for equivalent protein expression levels using anti-Nhp2p antibodies for p2&#x003bc;GALPa vectors and At32- and At79-specific antibodies for the pGAL vectors (not shown). As with the pGALPa plasmids collection, we tested the ability of the new BP1 transformants to produce red sectors. The untagged proteins gave results similar to the previous ones showing that the presence of the NH2 tag has no clear impact on the expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). As expected, the use of high-copy vectors leads to higher levels of red sectors for ProtA-Lhp1p and ProtA-At32 giving 45 and 8% red/white sectoting colonies respectively, whereas the At79 sectoring percentages remain at the background level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>Altogether these data show that the At32 putative La homologue is able to complement the colethal <italic>lsm8-1;lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; phenotype and suggest that At79 is not able to do so.</p></sec><sec><title>At32 is able to restore 3&#x02032;-end processing of non-coding RNA precursors in an <italic>lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; background</title><p>Inactivation of the <italic>LHP1</italic> gene in an otherwise wild-type background leads to several molecular phenotypes including a differential accumulation of U3A snoRNA (referred to as U3 from now on) and tRNA precursor species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). To test the ability of the plant proteins to complement molecular phenotypes observed upon Lhp1p depletion, we expressed At32 and At79 from the p2&#x003bc;GALPa set of vectors in the CY2 (<italic>lhp1::LEU2</italic>) yeast strain which bears a fully inactivated allele of the <italic>LHP1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).

Total RNAs were extracted from the different transformants and the accumulation of U3 and tRNAs precursors assessed. Three independent experiments were performed and gave similar results.</p><p>Lhp1p has been shown to protect two U3-3&#x02032; extended forms from exonucleolytic trimming by binding to poly(U) stretches present in the 3&#x02032;-end region of pre-U3 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). These extended forms, named U3-3&#x02032;I (U3 + 12) and U3-3&#x02032;II (U3 + 18) are readily detected by northern blot in wild-type conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A lane 2 and drawing). Following <italic>LHP1</italic> inactivation, the two extended forms are replaced by a heterogeneous population of molecules whose sizes range from +12 to +8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Consequently, the impact of <italic>LHP1</italic> inactivation on pre-U3 3&#x02032;-maturation can be assessed by monitoring the level of the U3-3&#x02032;II extended form. Our analysis shows a strong impact on the accumulation of the U3-3&#x02032;II form upon inactivation of <italic>LHP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A lane 1) but by contrast to previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), there is no complete depletion of the band. This might result from strain discrepancies since we are using a different genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) than the one used by Kufel <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In extracts from the CY2 strain transformed with the p2&#x003bc;GALPa-LHP1 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A lane 4), we observe a strong over-accumulation of U3-3&#x02032;II (and likely of U3-3&#x02032;I as well) as compared to the CY3 wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A compare lanes 2 and 4 and see also Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A online for quantification of the signals). Since the expression of the Protein A tag alone under the same strong promoter and from the same high-copy vector, has no influence on U3-3&#x02032;II accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A lane 3), we conclude that the over-expression of Lhp1p is likely to be responsible of this effect (see footnotes on Supplementary Figure 3 online). In the presence of the ProtA-At32 protein, the U3-3&#x02032;II precursor accumulates &#x0223c;45% of the wild-type levels, which is around three times the residual levels observed in the untransformed CY2 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A lane 5 and Supplementary Figure 3A online).

As expected, expression of the ProtA-Lhp1p in the <italic>lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; background qualitatively restores a wild-type processing pattern for all tested tRNA families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B lane 4 and Supplementary Data Figure 3B online). Nevertheless, we can observe a striking over-accumulation of the 3&#x02032;-extended intermediate of tRNA<sup>ProUGG</sup> (and of other tested tRNAs, see Supplementary Figure 3B online), a more limited one for tRNA<sup>SerCGA</sup>, and a slight increase in all unspliced 5&#x02032;-, 3&#x02032;-extended transcripts. As for U3, we speculate that all these molecular phenotypes are the consequence of Lhp1p over-expression (see footnotes of Supplementary Figure 3 online).</p><p>In the presence of the ProtA-At32 fusion, we clearly observe the restoration of a normal pattern of precursors and intermediates for all tested tRNA families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B lane 5 and Supplementary Figure 3B). We also observe, as in the ProtA-Lhp1p-expressing strain but to a more limited extent, the over-accumulation of the 5&#x02032;-, 3&#x02032;-extended intron-containing transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B compare lanes 2 and 5). Pre-tRNA patterns from the ProtA-At79 expressing CY2 strain are similar to that of the untransformed and Protein A expressing CY2 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B lane 6 and Supplementary Figure 3B) even after longer exposures (not shown).</p><p>Altogether these data show that At32 displays the ability to restore correct precursor patterns of U3 and every tRNA tested. We conclude that At32 is able to restore a wild-type 3&#x02032;-end maturation process for these precursors and hence to support at least partially Lhp1p function in these processes. On the other hand, expression of At79 in the CY2 background does not allow U3 or tRNA precursors to accumulate. We conclude that expression of At79 is not able to support these Lhp1p functions under such heterologous conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>At32 binds to plant RNA polymerase III transcripts <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>La homologues can associate with highly diverse coding or non-coding RNAs from viral or cellular origins [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>)]. This multi-functionality is in part explained by the capacity of La proteins to specifically bind with high-affinity RNAs presenting a terminal 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). All primary RNA pol III transcripts end with such a motif but mature forms do not, as it is subsequently removed by a 3&#x02032;-end processing step. To determine whether At32 is able to bind to 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH ending RNAs in plant, we asked whether RNA pol III precursors could be co-immunoprecipitated with green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged versions of the protein. However, since most plant pol III precursors have a very short 3&#x02032;-extension and are difficult to distinguish (by hybridization or PCR amplification) from mature forms, we had to select rare situations where this distinction would be possible. One such situation is provided by the presence of an intron in a subgroup of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> pre-tRNA methionine (pre-tRNA<sup>Met</sup>) (tRNA database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/">http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/</ext-link>) and another by the presence in plant of a dicistronic gene organization, where a tRNA is co-transcribed with a snoRNA in a single precursor molecule (pre-tsnoR43.1) by the RNA pol III complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>).</p><p>Stable transgenic cell suspension lines expressing At32 fused at its NH2 or COOH terminus to the GFP, as well as a cell line expressing the GFP alone as negative control were produced. We prepared native extracts of each of these cell suspension lines and performed immunoprecipitations with anti-GFP antibodies. Two independent experiments that yielded similar results were conducted for each fusion and no significant difference was observed between the NH2 and COOH translational fusions. Western blot analysis performed on identical fractions of each eluate showed that both GFP and At32-GFP are efficiently immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). We checked for the presence of pre-tRNA<sup>Met</sup> and pre-tsnoR43.1 in each eluate fraction by RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). As negative control, to test the specificity of our immunoprecipitation experiments, we also performed RT-PCR amplifications targeting 5.8S ribosomal RNA since La proteins are not known to associate to this highly abundant transcript. PCR reactions performed on total genomic DNA demonstrate that primers are efficient and give specific signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B lane 2) and since we were not able to amplify from non-reverse transcribed RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B lanes 3, 5, 7 and 9), we conclude that the signals obtained with reverse-transcribed samples arise from cDNAs and not from contaminating genomic DNA. Also, in each case, we were able to amplify a specific product using input cDNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B lanes 4 and 8) showing that each of the three tested RNAs were present in corresponding crude lysates. PCR reactions using cDNAs produced from the At32-GFP immunoprecipitated fraction generated the expected product for pre-tRNA<sup>Met</sup> and pre-tsnoR43.1, but not for 5.8S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 10), while PCR reactions using cDNAs produced from the GFP-alone fraction did not produce any PCR product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B lane 6). We conclude that pol III transcribed precursors to tRNA<sup>Met</sup> and tRNA-snoR43.1 specifically co-immunoprecipitate with At32-GFP. Despite the fact that the GFP protein is efficiently immunoprecipitated and is more abundant than At32 in the eluate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), no such RNA is co-immunoprecipitated with GFP alone strongly supporting the conclusion that At32 is able to specifically associate at least to these RNA pol III transcripts <italic>in vivo</italic> and probably to 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH ending RNAs in general. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with an anti-GFP antibody on crude lysates of GFP or At32-GFP expressing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell lines.

Based on its capacity to fulfil in yeast the small nuclear RNA biogenesis function of Lhp1p and to bind <italic>in planta</italic> to RNA pol III transcripts, we conclude that the protein produced at the At4g32720 locus (we named AtLa1 for <italic><underline>A</underline>rabidopsis <underline>t</underline>haliana</italic><underline>La</underline> protein <underline>1</underline>) is a genuine <italic>A. thaliana</italic> La protein.</p><p>The fact that AtLa1 can restore correct U3 and tRNA precursor patterns in <italic>lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; background and growth of the <italic>lsm8-1;lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; strain is a strong indication that it can bind to all RNAs that terminate with an oligouridylate motif (not only to pol III transcripts) and participate in their biogenesis. In yeast, U3 snoRNA is produced by the RNA pol II complex and binding of Lhp1p to precursor molecules is a key step of its maturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). AtLa1 is able to restore correct U3 precursors pattern in an <italic>lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; background showing that it can bind these pol II encoded RNAs and participate in their processing in yeast. This suggests that AtLa1 has the potentiality to bind to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> pol II-encoded 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH RNAs such as snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>) or snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>) and to participate in their processing, stability and/or RNP formation.</p><p>AtLa1 is also able to restore normal pre-tRNA patterns in an <italic>lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; background and even to stabilize intermediates above wild-type levels. This high level of complementation by a plant protein of the yeast La function in 3&#x02032;-end pre-tRNAs processing is consistent with previous reports showing that this maturation is evolutionary well conserved in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>). This together with the fact that AtLa1 is able to bind <italic>in vivo</italic> to plant tRNA precursors allow us to propose that the mechanism of 3&#x02032;-processing and protection of pre-tRNAs involves the La function and is conserved in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Finally, the capacity of AtLa1 to restore growth in the <italic>lsm8-1;lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; strain is a strong indication that it can participate in U6 snRNA biogenesis. In yeast, both the ring-shaped complex Lsm2p-Lsm8p and the Lhp1p proteins are involved in the biogenesis of several non-coding RNAs such as U3 snoRNA, tRNAs and U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>).

A 2&#x02013;3-fold over-expression of Lhp1p in this background restores U6 snRNA levels to 75% of wild-type and expression of U6 snRNA in extra copies allows viability of the <italic>lsm8-1;lhp1</italic>-&#x00394; strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).

In fact, hLa was shown to shuttle in and out of the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and its distribution changes throughout the cell cycle with its major pool relocated to the nucleolus during late G1 and early S phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The significance of hLa nucleolar accumulation is not fully understood but it could be involved in early steps of ribosomal RNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>), in the stabilization of some RNA pol III transcripts (such as U6 or pre-tRNAs as part of their nucleolar maturation and/or modification processes) and in binding U3 precursor and forming the corresponding RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). As expected for a genuine La protein, we report that AtLa1 mainly localizes to the nucleoplasm in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells. We did not observe a significant level of labelling of the nucleolus using the GFP-tagged AtLa1 proteins under steady-state conditions (except in the nucleolar cavity, see below). In agreement, AtLa1 was not identified in the proteomic analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nucleolus content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>) suggesting that AtLa1 is not a stable component of this nuclear subcompartment. However, it is possible that a small pool of AtLa1 shuttles through nucleolus and/or that the protein accumulates in this compartment at precise steps of the cell cycle. We also observed that, in a small fraction of cells, a significant pool of AtLa1 localizes to the nucleolar cavity. The nucleolar cavity is a highly dynamic entity, devoid of transcription, whose presence and structure is dependent upon cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>). Since we did not utilize a synchronous cell population to perform subcellular localization experiments, not every observed protoplast will contain a nucleolar cavity, and since the structure and probably content of this entity varies at least according to the cell cycle, it is possible that AtLa1 does not accumulate in this sub-nucleolar compartment at all times. This explains at least partially why only a sub-fraction of observed cells (whether <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts or tobacco cells) displays fluorescent labelling of the nucleolar cavity. Several snoRNAs such as U3, spliceosomal snRNAs or the 7-2/MRP RNA component of the RNase MRP complex were reported to localize at least transiently to the nucleolar cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76 B77 B78">76&#x02013;78</xref>). However, it is neither known if mature or precursor RNAs were detected in these studies, nor if other RNA pol III transcripts such as tRNAs could be present in this structure. The significance and the role of the nucleolar cavity is unknown but it was proposed to be a storage space and/or to host maturation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>). We speculate that AtLa1 could fulfil chaperone and/or stabilization functions for RNAs present in this cavity.</p></sec><sec><title>AtLa1 function is required early in embryogenesis</title><p>The La homologues from budding and fission yeasts are not required for viability in otherwise wild-type conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). However, the situation in yeasts, where La proteins have a much shorter C-terminal domain compared to other eukaryotes, is likely to be exceptional. Indeed La homologues from mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>), fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>) and trypanosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>) are required for viability and we show here that this is also the case for AtLa1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>The AtLa1 function is apparently not essential during gametogenesis but is required early in embryonic development. <italic>atla1</italic>-deficient embryos cannot reach the globular to heart stage transition and terminate development and desiccate at the early globular stage. This is similar to the situation in mouse where La is required early in development for the production of healthy blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>), but contrasts with the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> situation where La becomes essential only at the late midgut stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>).</p><p>An intriguing characteristic of <italic>atla1</italic> mutant embryos is the presence of unusually large nucleoli. Although a similar nucleolar hypertrophy was previously reported for other <italic>Arabidopsis emb</italic> mutants (<italic>domino1, titan</italic> and <italic>plz</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89 B90 B91">89&#x02013;91</xref>), it is not a general feature of developmentally arrested embryos. The nucleolus is the site of ribosome biogenesis, and, in wild-type conditions, its size and morphology directly correlates with ribosome production activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>). In genetically altered background, increase in nucleolus size can be a direct consequence of pre-ribosomal RNA processing or ribosome assembly alteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>), or can indirectly result in the alteration of other cellular processes interconnected with nucleolar functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>) as this is probably the case in <italic>titan</italic> and <italic>plz</italic> mutants which display, in addition to nucleolar hypertrophy, cell cycle and cytokinesis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">,91</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">,98</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">,99</xref>). In this case, however, we know that the La protein is likely to be important for ribosome biogenesis. Indeed, the human La protein was reported to interact in the nucleolus with nucleolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>), a protein involved in ribosomal RNA production, processing, assembly and export of pre-ribosomal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>). Also, the yeast Lhp1p protein was shown to participate in the stabilization and folding of 5S rRNA and, when over-expressed, is able to restore 60S ribosomal subunit production in strains expressing <italic>cis</italic>-mutated 5S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the nucleolar hypertrophy we observed in <italic>atla1</italic> mutant embryos likely results from a direct rather than indirect effect on ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar functions. However, since AtLa1 is probably a multifunctional protein, the perturbation of nucleolar functions is not necessarily responsible for the lethality phenotype we observed in the mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Two distinct genuine La proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>?</title><p>The presence of two proteins with structural characteristics compatible with the La function is a feature that is likely to be conserved for all higher plants since this situation is present in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (a dicotyledon) and rice (a monocotyledon). The two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins present considerable sequence divergence with a mean amino acid identity of only 44%. This leads us to speculate that this sequence divergence was associated with a certain level of specialization and that the functions of the proteins are at least not fully redundant.</p><p>We showed that At79, the second putative <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> La homologue, possesses every structural feature of <italic>bona fide</italic> La proteins. It displays a characteristic La NTD organization and we clearly detected an atypical RRM2 motif in its CTD, which we believe is an additional structural hallmark of genuine La proteins (see Supplementary Figure 1 online). Nevertheless, At79 was not able to complement Lhp1p function in non-coding RNA biosynthesis in yeast, whereas AtLa1 did. This came as a surprise, especially concerning the well-conserved pre-tRNA maturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>). Several reasons could account why At79 is not functional in yeast among which, improper folding and/or subcellular localization of the protein. But we also failed to co-immunoprecipitate 3&#x02032;-UUU-OH RNAs with GFP-tagged versions of At79 expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell suspensions. Although we cannot strictly rule out the possibility that the presence of the GFP tag has an inhibitory effect on At79's ability to bind to RNA pol III transcripts, we believe it is unlikely since La proteins from different organisms (hLa, <italic>S. pombe</italic> La, Lhp1p, AtLa1) were previously proven functional as GFP fusions [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>) and our present results]. We therefore conclude from our immunoprecipitation and yeast complementation results that At79 is probably not able to bind to RNA pol III transcripts and is not involved in their biogenesis.</p><p>This situation where a protein structurally similar to a genuine La factor is apparently not competent to fulfil the most &#x02018;basic&#x02019; La function, that is to bind to RNA pol III precursor RNAs, is unprecedented and indeed puzzling. However, it is now clear that there is more to the La function than just binding RNA pol III precursors [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>)] and we propose that At79 is not fully redundant with AtLa1 and that this protein specialized to fulfil other aspects of the La function. In support of this hypothesis, the mRNA patterns of expression of both genes are not superimposed across plant development and their levels are not regulated in the same way in different stress situations such as cold and heat shocks (AtGenExpress, data not shown). Moreover, we observed that AtLa1 is essential for viability, whereas At79 is dispensable for normal plant growth and development (not shown), suggesting that At79 is not able to fulfil entirely the AtLa1 function and that there is at least partial specialization of the two La homologues in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This specialization is unprecedented in eukaryotes and studying the La function in plants should provide unique opportunities to dissect the very different aspects of this crucial cellular activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>We are grateful to Sandra Wolin (HHMI, New Haven) for generous gift of yeast strains and plasmid pATL and to K.
