Many studies have reported increased expression of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) in inflammation and enhanced ASIC3 channel activity with pro-inflammatory mediators. However, the role of ASIC3 in inflammation remains inconclusive because of conflicting results generated from studies of <italic>ASIC3 </italic>knockout (<italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) or dominant-negative mutant mice, which have shown normal, decreased or increased hyperalgesia during inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we tested whether ASIC3 plays an important role in inflammation of subcutaneous tissue of paw and muscle in <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or carrageenan by investigating behavioral and pathological responses, as well as the expression profile of ion channels. Compared with the <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>controls, <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice showed normal thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia with acute (4-h) intraplantar CFA- or carrageenan-induced inflammation, but the hyperalgesic effects in the sub-acute phase (1&#x02013;2 days) were milder in all paradigms except for thermal hyperalgesia with CFA-induced inflammation. Interestingly, carrageenan-induced primary hyperalgesia was accompanied by an <italic>ASIC3</italic>-dependent <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>up-regulation and increase of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium currents. CFA-inflamed muscle did not evoke hyperalgesia in <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>or <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice, whereas carrageenan-induced inflammation in muscle abolished mechanical hyperalgesia in <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, as previously described.

During inflammation, damaged tissues release pro-inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, serotonin, histamine, nerve growth factor, prostaglandin, neuropeptides and cytokines to activate immune cells and neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These factors serve a protective purpose by stimulating the immune system, which causes vasodilatation to allow the exudation of plasma and leukocytes into the surrounding tissues, whereby the harmful stimuli are removed and the injured tissue undergoes repairing. The extravasation of leukocytes and plasma fluid into the tissue accounts for the swelling of the tissue, whereas the increased blood flow is responsible for the heat and redness.</p><p>Inflammation also causes tissue acidosis, whereby high concentrations of protons are the direct cause of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) is the most sensitive nociceptive ion channel responding to tissue acidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. During inflammation, lactic acid, arachidonic acid and nitric oxide sensitize ASIC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Up-regulation of ASIC3 is seen in inflamed human intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of rodents with inflamed hind paws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Two experimental models of inflammation have been widely used in research of pain. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) is composed of an antigen solution of heat-inactivated bacterium, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, emulsified in mineral oil, which can potentiate the cell-mediated immune response and the production of immunoglobulins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A single injection of CFA into the plantar surface of the paw induces intense and persistent inflammation at local injection sites and occasionally at distant locations because of its systemic spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, carrageenan is thought to produce non-immune-mediated inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A subcutaneous injection of carrageenan induces inflammatory responses initially mediated by mast cells and neutrophils, and then followed by a phagocytic response, which depends on the mobilization of macrophages. The behavior of <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice has been studied largely with the carrageenan inflammation model but with discrepant results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, these previous studies imply that ASIC3 might be involved in the development of secondary but not primary hyperalgesia produced by inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Sensory neurons innervating muscle and those innervating skin are considered to have different properties, and ASIC3 is more likely expressed in the former than in the latter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To reveal the functional role of ASIC3 in inflammation, we systematically studied thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia induced by CFA and carrageenan in the paw and muscle of <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice. Tissue underwent pathological examination and real-time PCR to reveal the gene regulation of ion channels dependent on ASIC3 following inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Behavior tests</title><p><italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice did not differ in baseline responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli or responses in left and right paws.

Although both <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice showed increased sensitivity to heat, the latter showed longer withdrawal latency from 4 h to 2 days than the former in the carrageenan inflammatory model. The difference was small but significant after 4 h, with a mean latency of 3.20 sec and 2.09 sec for <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice, respectively (P &#x0003c; 0.05). On days 1 and 2, paw withdrawal latency for <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice remained short (mean latency 2.49 sec for day 1 and 2.66 sec for day 2), but the magnitude of hyperalgesia was significantly lower for <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice (mean latency 4.44 sec for day 1 and 5.96 sec for day 2 than that of <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice (P &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Intraplantar inflammation-mediated hyperalgesia</bold>.

Histologically, the muscle sections of saline groups revealed intact and well-organized muscular fibers, connective tissue and vascular channels with mild infiltration of leukocytes found along the needle tracks in some cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). However, marked infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells (most likely macrophages) and edema evidenced by the spaces between muscular fibers was observed with CFA injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The inflammatory cells infiltrated endomysial and perimysial connective tissue and caused focal destruction of the myocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Large round to oval empty spaces representing the deposition of the lipid content from CFA were frequently surrounded by inflammatory infiltrates and the formation of granulomas with epithelioid macrophages was evident (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). CFA contained <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and mineral oil, which might well account for the formation of granulomas from day 2. Well-formed granulomas defined by compact, well-circumscribed structures composed of epitheloid macrophages were characteristic of <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), but most of the granulomas found in <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice were small and ill-defined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>).

Although mouse strains and sexes of these two studies may cause the discrepant results from our current work, the studies used 2% carrageenan, and the tests were carried out only 3&#x02013;4 h after injection. In another study involving dominant-negative <italic>ASIC3 </italic>transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], behavior tests were performed 1&#x02013;6 h after zymosan injections to induce paw inflammation. These mice exhibited increased mechanical hypersensitivity. Although the role of ASIC3 in the acute phase of inflammation is inconclusive, our results indicate the involvement of ASIC3 in the sub-acute phase of inflammation. Our study showed no difference in nociceptive behaviors in the acute phase of inflammation (4 h) between two genotypes, except for a small but significant difference in thermal hyperalgesia in the carrageenan inflammatory model. On follow-up in <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, in both models for mechanical hyperalgesia and in the carrageenan model for thermal hyperalgesia, hyperalgesia was attenuated after intraplantar injection. The inflammation state might have changed from an acute to a sub-acute phase in 24 h, and <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice could have recovered faster from hyperalgesia. Although ASIC3 is believed to play a more important role in secondary hyperalgesia (hypersensitivity occurred in non-injured sites) induced by inflamed muscle or joints than primary hyperalgesia in inflamed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], in this study we provide evidence that ASIC3 does play a role in subcutaneous primary hyperalgesia in later stages. This conclusion is also supported by a recent report showing that subcutaneous injection of the ASIC3-selective blocker APETx2 can alleviate the inflammation-induced hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the role of ASIC3 for sub-acute-phase primary hyperalgesia is not applied to the deep tissues, because a recent study reported that <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice did not show different levels of primary hyperalgesia in inflamed joint induced by 3% of carrageenan than <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>We did not observe a significant difference in effects of inflammation between <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice on pathological examination, which indicates that ASIC3 does not play a role in the development of inflammation, and the difference in hyperalgesia may not be related to the degree of inflammation.</p><p>During inflammation, the enhanced expression of ion channels sensitizes primary afferent neurons and produces hyperexcitability, thereby producing hyperalgesia. Up-regulation of ASIC3 and sodium channels during inflammation have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, real-time PCR results in our study showed no transcriptional change in <italic>ASIC3</italic>, <italic>Nav1.6</italic>, <italic>Nav1.7</italic>, and <italic>Nav1.8 </italic>mRNA level following inflammation. These results are contradictory to those in previous studies. The only up-regulated gene we found was <italic>Nav1.9</italic>, an ion channel reported to be unchanged under intraplantar carrageenan-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>mRNA level has been shown to increase by day 7 with CFA-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; however, its expression was not changed in our CFA model. A possible explanation for the discrepancy between our study and previous studies is the difference in sampling and signal quantification. Previous studies used methods such as RT-PCR, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization or immunostaining, which were semi-quantitative. Furthermore, both <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunostaining examine one plane of cells, whereas with real-time PCR, the total mRNAs from all cellular populations in a single DRG were quantified. Lack of transcriptional change in a single DRG by real-time PCR cannot rule out the possibility of up- or down-regulated genes in subgroups of cells or involvement of the gene in posttranscriptional regulation for the process of sensitization. Another issue to consider is the timing of sampling, since regulation of these genes might be transient and time dependent. Animal species and genetic background may also account for the discrepancies to a certain extent, because mice express relatively less ASIC channels in DRGs than do rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The up-regulation of <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>on day 2 with intraplantar carrageenan-induced inflammation was significant and ASIC3 dependent. The functional importance of <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>in modulation of pain behavior in inflammation has been previously investigated by disrupting the ion channel in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Mechanical and thermal thresholds are comparable between <italic>Nav1.9</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and wild-type mice in the absence of injury. In contrast, inflammation-mediated pain behavior differs prominently in <italic>Nav1.9</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice as compared with wild-type mice. Intraplantar injection of carrageenan induced thermal hyperalgesia in both wild-type and <italic>Nav1.9</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice in the first 3 h post-injection; however, the hyperalgesia was diminished 24 h later in <italic>Nav1.9</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice. This finding matches our observation of <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice with longer paw withdrawal latency starting at 4 h and continuing through day 2, which is indicative of attenuated thermal hyperalgesia.</p><p>The similar phenotypes in the pain behavior for <italic>Nav1.9</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice under inflammation and the ASIC3-dependent up-regulation of <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>suggest that inflammation induces tissue acidosis, which leads to activation of ASIC3 and subsequent ASIC3-dependent up-regulation of <italic>Nav1.9</italic>; the increased <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>level in turn contributes to thermal hyperalgesia. In the absence of ASIC3, <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>cannot be up-regulated, and thermal hyperalgesia becomes attenuated.</p><p>In contrast to up-regulation of <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>transcripts, increase of I<sub>Nav1.8 </sub>on day 2 with intraplantar carrageenan-induced inflammation was significant and ASIC3 dependent on electrophysiology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Although our electrophysiolgical data did not show increased I<sub>Nav1.9 </sub>in overall small to medium neurons to support the up-regulation of <italic>Nav1.9 </italic>transcripts during inflammation, we did find a significant increase of I<sub>Nav1.9 </sub>in neurons that did not express Nav1.8 activity in <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice (65.4 &#x000b1; 16.0 vs. 506.5 &#x000b1; 147.7 pA for the control vs. carrageenan group, respectively, P &#x0003c; 0.05). Further study would aim to determine whether a specific subset of DRG neurons plays an important role in regulating the ASIC3-dependent effect during inflammation. However, the increase in I<sub>Nav1.8 </sub>was robust, with an increase of up to threefold in peak amplitudes, which was associated with maximal mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia on day 2 of carrageenan inflammation. However, a previous study reported slight change of I<sub>Nav1.8 </sub>peak amplitude on day 4 of carrageenan inflammation, when the <italic>Nav1.8 </italic>mRNA was significantly up-regulated and the current density of I<sub>Nav1.8 </sub>was slightly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, the alteration of Nav1.8 activity during inflammation may be time-dependent, as was seen in many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, the increase of I<sub>Nav1.8 </sub>is intriguing because Nav1.8 is known to play a role in mechanical nociception, and inhibition of Nav1.8 would abolish inflammation-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

However, we did not observe thermal hyperalgesia in either genotype with carrageenan-induced inflammation as was reported for C57BL6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Perhaps the time to establish secondary thermal hyperalgesia in CD1 mice is longer than is needed in C57BL6 mice.</p><p>In inflamed muscle, <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice seemed to display milder pathological features, including infiltration of leukocytes, formation of granulomas and vasculitis, than <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice. Previous reports described the same pathological responses in both genotypes, and an assessment of neutrophilic activity by myeloperoxidase in carrageenan-inflamed muscle also suggested that ASIC3 played no role in the development of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although neutrophilic activity represents only one aspect of inflammation, the type of immune cells recruited and their organization and behavior vary by inflammatory conditions. As we examined closely, the inflammation processes involved in CFA- or carrageenan-induced inflammation are not simple. Carrageenan-induced vasculitis was not documented, although in one study histological examination was carried out to characterize the transition of immune cell-type from acute to chronic inflammation of the rat leg muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Also, CFA has not been used as a muscle inflammation model; thus, no report of its effect on granuloma formation in muscle exists.</p><p>The development of granulomas and vasculitis involves complicated interaction among immune cells, cytokines and chemokines. Granulomas are the aggregation of mononuclear inflammatory cells and modified macrophages organized in a compact nodule, with involvement by a complicated interaction between antigen-presenting macrophages and T lymphocytes mediated by various cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, the pathogenesis of vasculitis is still not well understood, but endothelium injury is generally believed to be the fundamental event in its development. Responding to neuropeptides (substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide), endothelial cells mediate several features of chronic inflammation such as vasodilatation, leukocyte migration, cytokine production and cellular adhesion molecule expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. During vascular tone regulation and interaction with immune cells, damage to endothelial cells could occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>The involvement of ASIC3, an ion channel present on neurons, in the pathogenesis of these features is thus intriguing. The interplay between the neuronal and immune system has become an interesting topic recently; body systems do not work alone. Neurons could initiate a cascade of cytokine synthesis and release and recruitment of inflammatory machinery. The process is neurogenic inflammation, whereby small-diameter sensory neurons release neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin-gene related peptide upon activation. Blocking nerves results in decreasing the inflammation consequences of carrageenan-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. ASIC3 could thus participate in the pathogenesis of granuloma formation and vasculitis through activating neurogenic inflammation. Lacking ASIC3 may alter the properties of sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], thus influencing its neurogenic release and the inflammatory consequences. This point should be further investigated. However, the immune system could also affect how the neural system perceives pain through activated mast cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and the cytokines they release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. ASIC3-mediated inflammation could be essential for the hyperalgesia we observed in wild-type mice.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we systematically characterized changes in behavior, pathology, gene expression, and TTX-resistant sodium currents following inflammation induced by CFA and carrageenan in <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>ASIC3</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>mice and showed that the deletion of the <italic>ASIC3 </italic>gene affected features in both inflammation models.

DRG acute culture and settings for whole-cell patch recording were as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The internal solution contained (in mM) 10 NaCl, 110 CsCl, 20 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 2.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 3 Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP, and 5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.0 with CsOH. The external solution contained (in mM) 100 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 30 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 CdCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 glucose, 5 4-aminopyridine, and 5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl. Osmolarity was adjusted to 290 mosmol/kg with glucose. Before whole-cell patch recording, cells were stained for isolectin B4(IB4)-FITC (4 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 2 min, and only small- to medium-size (&#x0003c; 34 &#x003bc;m) DRG neurons were selected for recording [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recordings were performed in external solution containing 200 nM TTX (Tocris, Avonmouth, UK). TTX-resistant sodium currents were evoked by a 30-ms test pulse between -70 and 0 mV in 10-mV steps from a holding potential of -80 mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For clarity, only the -60 and -40 mV current traces were shown. All recording was at room temperature (21&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) and completed within 24 h after plating. A total of 144 DRG neurons were patch recorded; half of them were IB4-positive neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Analysis involved use of SAS9.1 (SAS Inst, Cary, NC). Radiant heat testing was analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by least squares means post-hoc test. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine differences in mechanical sensitivity between groups and time points, differences in paw thickness, granuloma, vasculitis, and quantitative PCR. Mean peak amplitudes of TTX-R currents were compared between groups via one-way ANOVA. The level of significance was set at P &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ASIC3: acid-sensing ion channel 3; DRG: dorsal root ganglion; CFA: complete Freund's adjuvant; Nav: voltage-gated sodium channel; TRPV1: capsaicin receptor; TTX: tetrodotoxin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YTY performed pain behavior testing, pathological examination, and quantitative PCR.
