The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu antagonizes this restriction by an unknown mechanism that likely involves the down-regulation of BST-2 from the cell surface. Here, we show that the optimal removal of BST-2 from the plasma membrane by Vpu requires the cellular protein &#x003b2;-TrCP, a substrate adaptor for a multi-subunit SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and a known Vpu-interacting protein. &#x003b2;-TrCP is also required for the optimal enhancement of virion-release by Vpu. Mutations in the DSGxxS &#x003b2;-TrCP binding-motif of Vpu impair both the down-regulation of BST-2 and the enhancement of virion-release. Such mutations also confer dominant-negative activity, consistent with a model in which Vpu links BST-2 to &#x003b2;-TrCP. Optimal down-regulation of BST-2 from the cell surface by Vpu also requires the endocytic clathrin adaptor AP-2, although the rate of endocytosis is not increased; these data suggest that Vpu induces post-endocytic membrane trafficking events whose net effect is the removal of BST-2 from the cell surface. In addition to its marked effect on cell-surface levels, Vpu modestly decreases the total cellular levels of BST-2. The decreases in cell-surface and intracellular BST-2 are inhibited by bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification; these data suggest that Vpu induces late endosomal targeting and partial degradation of BST-2 in lysosomes. The Vpu-mediated decrease in surface expression is associated with reduced co-localization of BST-2 and the virion protein Gag along the plasma membrane. Together, the data support a model in which Vpu co-opts the &#x003b2;-TrCP/SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to induce endosomal trafficking events that remove BST-2 from its site of action as a virion-tethering factor.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The cellular protein BST-2 prevents newly formed particles of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses from escaping the infected cell.

Cells (HeLa) were transfected with either an empty plasmid or a plasmid expressing Vpu, along with a plasmid expressing GFP as a transfection marker. The cells were also transfected with either an empty plasmid (&#x0201c;mock&#x0201d;), a plasmid expressing &#x003b2;-TrCP, or a plasmid expressing a &#x003b2;-TrCP protein lacking the F-box (&#x00394;Fbox &#x003b2;-TrCP). The next day, the cells were stained for surface BST-2 and analyzed by two-color flow cytometry. Histograms represent the relative cell number vs. BST-2 fluorescence intensity for the GFP-positive cells. The percentage of GFP-positive cells varied between 30 and 33&#x00025; for the six transfections shown. Gray-shaded histograms represent cells not transfected to express Vpu; unshaded histograms represent cells transfected to express Vpu. &#x00394;F-box &#x003b2;-TrCP inhibited the Vpu-mediated down-regulation of cell surface BST-2 in each of four experiments; statistical analysis is described in the text. (B) Cells (HeLa) were transfected with a plasmid expressing &#x003b2;-TrCP (WT &#x003b2;-TrCP), or a plasmid expressing a &#x003b2;-TrCP protein lacking the F-box (&#x00394;Fbox &#x003b2;-TrCP), or not transfected; cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot to detect the HA-tagged &#x003b2;-TrCP proteins. (C) shRNA targeting &#x003b2;-TrCP inhibits Vpu-mediated down-regulation of cell-surface BST-2. Cells (HeLa) were transfected with plasmids expressing shRNAs targeting either <italic>Renilla</italic> GFP (rGFP) as an irrelevant control, &#x003b2;-TrCP-1, &#x003b2;-TrCP-2, or both &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 and -2; in two cases these plasmids also expressed jellyfish GFP (the plasmids targeting &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 and both &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 and -2); for the others a separate plasmid expressing GFP was co-transfected. Two days later, the cells were re-transfected with an empty plasmid or a plasmid expressing Vpu, along with a plasmid expressing Tac antigen (IL-2 receptor &#x003b1;; CD25) as a transfection marker. The next day, the cells were stained for surface BST-2 and Tac, and then analyzed by three-color flow cytometry. Two-color dot plots are the BST-2 vs.Tac intensity of the individual GFP-positive cells. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments. (D) HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids expressing shRNAs used in (C) along with the plasmid expressing &#x003b2;-TrCP-1-HA; cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot to detect the HA-tagged &#x003b2;-TrCP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000450.g001"/></fig><p>To test further the role of &#x003b2;-TrCP in the modulation of BST-2 by Vpu, we used RNA interference to target the endogenous protein.

HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting <italic>Renilla</italic> GFP (as a control), &#x003b2;-TrCP-1, &#x003b2;-TrCP -2, or both &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 and -2; GFP was co-expressed as an indicator of transfection. Subsequently, the cells were re-transfected to express Vpu and a second indicator protein, IL-2 receptor &#x003b1; (Tac antigen; CD25), and then analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of both indicator proteins and BST-2. The shRNA targeting the sequence common to genes 1 and 2 inhibited the Vpu-mediated down-regulation of BST-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000450-g001">Figure 1C</xref>); this effect was modest and primarily evident in cells expressing high levels of Tac. In contrast, the shRNAs specific for &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 or -2 had little or no inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000450-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To quantify these effects, comparable regions of peak cell density for the Tac-positive and BST-2 down-regulated cells in each analysis were picked based on contour plots, and the MFI values of these regions were used to determine the fold down-regulation of BST-2 by Vpu in each condition. This analysis indicated that Vpu induced a 17-fold down-regulation of BST-2 in cells expressing the control shRNA targeting Renilla GFP, whereas it induced a 8.5-fold down-regulation in cells expressing the shRNA targeting the sequence common to &#x003b2;-TrCP genes 1 and 2. Using these data plus those from a second, independent experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000450.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the activity of Vpu in cells expressing shRNA to &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 was 1.39 relative to the activity of Vpu in cells expressing shRNA targeting Renilla GFP, whereas the relative activity in cells expressing shRNA targeting &#x003b2;-TrCP-2 was 0.80, and the relative activity in cells expressing shRNA targeting both &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 and -2 was 0.49. To validate these shRNAs, we tested their effectiveness and specificity using co-expressed, HA-tagged, &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000450-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The vector encoding the shRNA specific for &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 and the vector encoding the shRNA targeting both &#x003b2;-TRCP-1 and -2 were equally active against &#x003b2;-TrCP-1-HA, whereas the vector specific for &#x003b2;-TrCP-2 was inactive. These data suggested that targeting &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 alone is insufficient to inhibit the modulation of BST-2 by Vpu. Overall, the inhibitory effect of the shRNA targeting both &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 and -2, which reduced the activity of Vpu by 51&#x00025; as noted above (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000450.s001">Figure S1</xref>) supported the data obtained from the &#x00394;F-box, dominant negative experiments. Both sets of data are consistent with the hypothesis that &#x003b2;-TrCP is a cellular co-factor for the down-regulation of cell-surface BST-2 by Vpu.</p><p>Since down-regulation from the cell surface has been proposed as the mechanism by which Vpu counteracts the restriction mediated by BST-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, we asked whether over-expression of &#x00394;F-box &#x003b2;-TrCP also inhibited the enhancement of virion-release by Vpu. Vpu-mediated enhancement of virion-release was measured as the fractional secretion of p24 capsid antigen from virus-producing cells. As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, Vpu markedly enhanced the efficiency of capsid-release in HeLa cells expressing endogenous BST-2: 38&#x00025; of the total capsid antigen produced was released into the surrounding medium in the case of cells expressing wild-type virus, whereas only 4&#x00025; of capsid antigen was released in the absence of Vpu (see &#x0201c;mock&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000450-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

The idea that Vpu counteracts restriction of virion-release by removing BST-2 from the cell surface seems intuitively obvious, but modulation of the subcellular distribution of BST-2 by Vpu was not evident in initially published microscopic data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Neil1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies examined the expression of BST-2 in optical sections of permeabilized cells. We reevaluated this paradox by specifically imaging the cell surface, both by staining the cells for BST-2 before permeabilization and by acquiring images just above the cover glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000450-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

In many cases these puncta overlapped and likely represented the co-localization of BST-2 and Gag in endocytic pits and/or at sites of virion assembly. In contrast, in cells expressing wild-type (<italic>vpu</italic>-positive) virus, BST-2-containing puncta were diminished in intensity or completely absent, and less co-localization of BST-2 and Gag was detected. These images are similar to those of cells transiently expressing epitope-tagged BST-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Jouvenet1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, although the co-localization between transiently expressed BST-2 and Gag in the absence of Vpu appears even more striking than that shown here for endogenous BST-2; this difference could be due to supra-physiologic expression following transient transfection and/or to masking of the native epitope by bound virions. Here, analysis of over 10 cells expressing either wild-type or <italic>vpu</italic>-negative virus indicated an average Pearson coefficient of correlation between surface BST-2 and Gag signals of 0.048 for cells expressing the wild-type and 0.11 for cells expressing <italic>vpu</italic>-negative virus (1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation; 0 indicates no correlation; and &#x02212;1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation); p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.002 by Student's t test (data not shown).

Each of these experimental approaches inhibited the down-regulation of cell surface BST-2 and/or the enhancement of virion-release, but in each case the inhibition was incomplete. These results suggest that the recruitment of the &#x003b2;-TrCP/SCF E3 ligase complex enables optimal Vpu-activity but is not frankly obligatory. &#x003b2;-TrCP-independent activity could rely on direct binding between Vpu and BST-2 and endosomal sequestration as discussed below. Interestingly, the expression of an shRNA targeting &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 and -2 inhibited Vpu-activity less efficiently than the expression of the dominant negative mutant, &#x00394;-F-box &#x003b2;-TrCP. We suspect this difference may be a technical one. Alternatively, the activity of the &#x00394;-F-box mutant could in principle be due to competition with a WD- and F-box containing protein other than &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 or -2, but we consider this very unlikely, because over-expression of full-length &#x003b2;-TrCP-1 did not inhibit Vpu-activity.</p><p>The proposed model for the down-regulation of BST-2 by Vpu from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000450-g009">Figure 9</xref>) incorporates three key components: &#x003b2;-TrCP and by inference ubiquitination, the plasma membrane clathrin adaptor AP-2; and endosomal acidification. The proposed itinerary for BST-2 is internalization from the plasma membrane via AP-2, then sorting by Vpu/&#x003b2;-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination followed by pH-dependent endosomal transport. Alternative models are possible. Specifically, the roles of AP-2, &#x003b2;-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination, and endosomal acidification could represent independent mechanisms of action of Vpu. Nevertheless, the model proposed is attractive because it incorporates all the data into a single pathway. The model is also consistent with the physiologic roles of &#x003b2;-TrCP in the removal of cellular receptors from the plasma membrane. These cellular transmembrane proteins, which include the human growth hormone, prolactin, and the type-1 interferon receptors, are down-regulated from the cell surface by &#x003b2;-TrCP-dependent endocytosis and/or lysosomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Kumar1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-vanKerkhoff1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Li1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Kumar2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The data herein indicate that in addition to modulating cell-surface levels, Vpu modestly decreases the total cellular concentration of BST-2. Both the decrease in surface levels and the decrease in intracellular BST-2 were sensitive to the endosomal proton pump (vATPase) inhibitor bafilomycin A1. These data suggest that Vpu induces, at least to some extent, the lysosomal degradation of BST-2. However, we suspect on quantitative grounds that lysosomal degradation is a consequence of the removal of BST-2 from the cell surface rather than the cause of the reduced surface levels. Given the relatively modest extent of degradation, we speculate that a substantial fraction if not the majority of the surface down-regulation effect results from the sequestration of BST-2 within endosomes. Intriguingly, the virally encoded RING-CH ubiquitin ligase K5 of KHSV, which like Vpu down-regulates BST-2, uses a mechanism similar to that just proposed to remove the natural killer cell ligand MICA from the cell surface: targeting surface MICA to an endosomal compartment without inducing marked degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Thomas1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Notably, a more striking decrease in the total cellular expression of BST-2 than is shown herein was previously observed during the expression of Vpu in HeLa cells and macrophages, though apparently not in certain T cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Bartee1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Miyagi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. These quantitative differences may relate to differing levels of expression, but how Vpu would antagonize BST-2 in the absence of either down-regulation from the cell surface and/or a decrease in total cellular expression is unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Miyagi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Of further interest, treatment of cells with proteasome-inhibitors was very recently shown to reverse a Vpu-induced decrease in the total cellular expression of exogenous, epitope-tagged BST-2 in HEK293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Goffinet1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. These data led to the proposal that Vpu induces the proteasomal degradation of BST-2. Notably, these experiments involved prolonged incubation of cells with the proteasome-inhibitors, which likely depletes the cellular pool of free ubiquitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Mimnaugh1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a more inclusive interpretation of such results is that depletion of cellular BST-2 by Vpu is ubiquitin-dependent. This conclusion is mechanistically consistent with the data herein, insofar as ubiquitin-dependent processes include not only proteasomal degradation but also endosomal trafficking and lysosomal degradation. We previously reported that the exposure of HeLa cells to the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for five hours minimally reversed the Vpu-mediated down-regulation of surface BST-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, but here we show that a 14-hour exposure induces a more striking inhibition. These data support the hypothesis that the effect of proteasome-inhibitors on the Vpu-induced down-regulation of BST-2 reflects ubiquitin-depletion. Overall, although the prolonged exposure to proteasome-inhibitors cannot distinguish between proteasomal degradation and other ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms, the roles of AP-2 and &#x003b2;-TrCP together with the inhibition by bafilomycin A1 reported here support a model of ubiquitin-mediated endo-lysosomal trafficking.</p><p>As noted above, the plasma membrane adaptor protein complex AP-2 was required for the efficient down-regulation of BST-2 by Vpu. This result is consistent with the observation that rodent BST-2, though associated with lipid rafts via its C-terminal GPI-anchor, is internalized constitutively via the clathrin adaptor AP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Rollason1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This result also leads to the conclusion that at least part of the down-regulation results from the direct removal of BST-2 from the plasma membrane, a mechanism that may provide the most rapid reduction of cell surface levels. Alternative mechanisms such as total cellular depletion or retention of BST-2 within biosynthetic or exocytic membrane systems rely on the physiologic rate of turnover at the plasma membrane to clear BST-2 from its site of virion-tethering action. Since Vpu is expressed late during the viral life cycle concurrently with the structural proteins of the virion, the direct removal of BST-2 from the plasma membrane via endosomal trafficking could be key to the temporally effective relief of restricted virion-release.</p><p>Exactly how the Vpu-mediated recruitment of &#x003b2;-TrCP would affect the endosomal trafficking of BST-2 remains to be elucidated. The rates of endocytosis of BST-2 in the presence and absence of Vpu were equivalent, an observation that weighs against the involvement of proteins such as epsin and eps15, which participate in endocytosis and which recognize ubiquitin as a sorting signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Hawryluk1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Polo1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, the influence of Vpu on BST-2 is apparently post-endocytic. This conclusion is based both on the absence of an effect of Vpu on endocytosis and on the inhibition of down-regulation obtained by disruption of the endosomal pH gradient by treatment of cells with bafilomycin A1. We favor the hypothesis that Vpu and the &#x003b2;-TrCP/SCF E3 ligase complex influence the itinerary of BST-2 at the level of early, sorting endosomes. Here, we speculate that Vpu diverts BST-2 from a recycling pathway, which would normally return it to the cell surface, toward late endosomes, in which BST-2 would become sequestered and partially degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000450-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Candidate ubiquitin interacting proteins that could mediate such a sorting event include the monomeric clathrin adaptor Hrs, which plays a canonical role in recruiting endocytosed epidermal growth factor receptor for transport to late endosomes at this junction within the endosomal system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Raiborg1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another key question that emerges from our model is whether or not Vpu induces the ubiquitination of BST-2. Notably, we have observed that mutation of both lysines in the cytoplasmic domain of BST-2 does not block the down-regulation of surface expression by Vpu (data not shown). These data suggest that if Vpu and the &#x003b2;-TrCP/E3 ligase complex induce ubiquitination of BST-2, then this must occur on non-lysine residues. Nevertheless, ubiquitination of BST-2 itself is not an essential feature of a model involving &#x003b2;-TrCP; for example, the requirement for &#x003b2;-TrCP in the internalization of growth hormone receptor (GHR) appears to be independent of GHR ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-vanKerkhoff1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The model herein includes the hypothesis that Vpu and BST-2 interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000450-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). While this remains to be demonstrated, endosomal co-localization of Vpu and BST-2 has been observed at the level of light microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Neil1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, robust co-localization required the native sequence of the Vpu transmembrane domain. Furthermore, the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Vpu is required for both the down-regulation of surface BST-2 and the enhancement of virion-release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Schubert2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, it is tempting to speculate that Vpu and BST-2 interact via their transmembrane domains. This hypothesis is supported by our observations that BST-2 from rhesus macaques, which is not efficiently down-regulated from the cell surface by Vpu, is rendered partly Vpu-responsive by the introduction of mutations in the BST-2 TMD that &#x0201c;humanize&#x0201d; the sequence (data not shown). It is also supported by recent data indicating that the inability of Vpu to antagonize the restrictive effect of rhesus BST-2 is a consequence of amino acid changes in the TMD of the rhesus relative to the human protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-McNatt1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, the mutated protein Vpu-S52/56N dominantly interfered with the down-regulation of BST-2 by wild-type Vpu. This result is consistent with a model in which a ternary interaction enables Vpu to link BST-2 to &#x003b2;-TrCP. Presumably, Vpu-S52/56N can bind BST-2 via its transmembrane domain but cannot link it to &#x003b2;-TrCP. Consequently, the over-expression of Vpu-S52/56N may saturate BST-2 and competitively inhibit the activity of the wild-type Vpu protein.</p><p>As shown here and elsewhere, mutation of the DSGxxS sequence impairs virion-release, but it does not abolish this activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Schubert1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, a Vpu truncation mutant including a minimal cytoplasmic domain that does not contain the DSGxxS sequence reportedly retained partial activity in enhancing virion-release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Schubert2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. To reconcile these observations with the model proposed here, we speculate that a minimal Vpu lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain or a Vpu lacking a functional &#x003b2;-TrCP binding motif may retain a modicum of activity in counteracting BST-2, solely on the basis of its ability to interact with BST-2 and trap it within the endosomal system. Nevertheless, the data herein indicate that the recruitment of the &#x003b2;-TrCP/SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex by the full-length, wild-type Vpu protein enables more efficient removal of BST-2 from the cell surface and consequently more efficient enhancement of virion-release.</p><p>A remarkable feature of this emerging model is that it unites the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of Vpu in the context of counteracting the restriction imposed by BST-2. This is a new perspective on the Vpu protein, whose domains have been previously associated with &#x0201c;separable&#x0201d; functions: the TMD with the enhancement of virion-release and the cytoplasmic domain with the degradation of CD4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Schubert2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu is sufficient to induce the degradation of CD4 in the absence of the native Vpu TMD sequence, because it contains the determinants for both the interaction with CD4 and the recruitment of &#x003b2;-TrCP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Margottin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Margottin2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

To date, BST-2 has been shown to restrict the release of members of the retrovirus, filovirus, and arenavirus families. Viral antagonists of BST-2 include, in addition to Vpu, the K5 protein of KSHV (HHV-8), the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-2, and the envelope glycoprotein of Ebola virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Bartee1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Jouvenet1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Sakuma1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000450-Kaletsky1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. As noted above, the K5 and Vpu proteins share mechanistic features, insofar as K5 is a membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase, and Vpu recruits a cellular ubiquitin ligase complex to membranes. How viral envelope glycoproteins antagonize BST-2 is unclear, but the HIV-2 envelope down-regulates BST-2 from the cell surface, and this requires the tyrosine-based AP-2 binding motif in the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 (data not shown). So far, viral antagonists of BST-2 appear to operate via the cellular ubiquitination and/or endosomal trafficking systems.</p><p>In summary, we show that &#x003b2;-TrCP is a Vpu-cofactor for the removal of BST-2 from the plasma membrane and consequently for the counteraction of the antiviral activity of this interferon-induced restriction factor.

Where noted, the CD4-negative HeLa clone Z24 was used; this line is a precursor to P4 cells and was provided by Chris Aiken. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the experiments involving expression of &#x00394;F-box &#x003b2;-TrCP, cells were transfected in wells of six-well plates using 4 &#x000b5;g total DNA: 2 &#x000b5;g of the empty vector control, the &#x003b2;-TrCP-expression vector, or the &#x00394;F-box &#x003b2;-TrCP-expression vector; and 2 &#x000b5;g of the empty vector control, pVphu, or pNL4-3 or the &#x00394;Vpu proviral mutant. For experiments involving the expression of shRNAs, cells were first transfected in wells of twelve-well plates containing 1.6 &#x000b5;g total DNA, of which either all was the shRNA expression vector or 0.3 &#x000b5;g was pCG-GFP and the rest was the shRNA vector, then subsequently transfected with 0.32 &#x000b5;g each of pCDM8-Tac and pVphu. For experiments involving the expression of Vpu proteins containing substitutions in the DSGxxS motif or a termination codon at position 33 (Vpu-32), cells were transfected in wells of twelve-well plates containing 1.6 &#x000b5;g total DNA, of which 160 ng was pVphu; the remaining DNA was pCG-GFP and pcDNA3.1 for the flow cytometry assays, or the &#x00394;Vpu proviral mutant for the virion release assays. For the transfections combining the expression of wild type Vpu with Vpu-52/56N, 160 ng of pVphu and 1000 ng of pVphu-52/56N were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>For analysis of surface levels of BST-2, cells were stained before fixation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) including sodium azide and 2&#x00025; FBS at 4&#x000b0;C using an indirect method to detect BST-2: the HM1.24 murine monoclonal antibody (0.1 &#x000b5;g/ml) was followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to APC. For the analysis of cells transfected sequentially to express shRNAs followed by Vpu and Tac antigen, the cells were stained first for BST-2 as just described, then blocked with normal mouse serum, and finally stained for Tac antigen using the PE-conjugated antibody to CD25. For the analysis of total cellular levels of BST-2 (intracellular staining), cells were fixed and permeabilized with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences), followed by indirect staining as described above. All samples were analyzed by two- or three-color flow cytometry; gates for BST-2 were set using an antibody isotype control (IgG2a) as the primary antibody, gates for GFP and were set using non-GFP expressing cells, and gates for Tac were set using a PE-conjugated isotype control.

Cells were stained for surface BST-2 and HIV-1 Gag p17/p55 by fixation and staining for BST-2, followed by permeabilization as above and staining for p17/p55. For analysis of the relationship between cell surface BST-2 and Gag, images of single focal planes adjacent to the cover glass were deconvolved using a &#x0201c;no neighbors&#x0201d; algorithm (Slidebook). A Pearson correlation coefficient for the overlap between BST-2 and Gag was determined using at least 10 cells expressing either wild-type or Vpu-negative virus using Slidebook software. To analyze the relationship between the intensities of BST-2 and Gag at individual puncta on the plasma membrane, the intensities of over 100 puncta on the surface of seven cells each for wild-type and Vpu-negative virus were measured using Slidebook software. Composite multi-color images of single optical sections were assembled using Adobe Photoshop software.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Western blots</title><p>Cellular samples were suspended in loading buffer containing SDS and dithiothreitol and boiled for 10 min.
