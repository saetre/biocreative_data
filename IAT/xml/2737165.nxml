However, excess stimulation of TLR pathways is supposed to be connected with provocation of autoimmunity. We show that paired immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor B (PIR-B), an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif&#x02013;harboring receptor for major histocompatibility class I molecules, on relatively primitive B cells, B-1 cells, suppresses TLR9 signaling via Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) dephosphorylation, which leads to attenuated activation of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B p65RelA but not p38 or Erk, and blocks the production of natural IgM antibodies, including anti-IgG Fc autoantibodies, particularly rheumatoid factor. The autoantibody production in PIR-B&#x02013;deficient (<italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice was further augmented in combination with the <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mutation, which might be linked to the development of autoimmune glomerulonephritis. These results show the critical link between TLR9-mediated sensing and a simultaneously evoked, PIR-B&#x02013;mediated inhibitory circuit with a Btk intersection in B-1 cells, and suggest a novel way toward preventing pathogenic natural autoantibody production.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The emergence of autoimmunity is often coupled with aging, and is suggested to be linked to activation of the innate immune system in individuals suffering from bacterial and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baccala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Groom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krieg and Vollmer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rothlin et al., 2007</xref>). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed in leukocytes of the innate immune system play indispensable roles in the sensing of viral and bacterial invasion through binding pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which leads to efficient T cell&#x02013;mediated inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004</xref>). The TLR-mediated priming of inflammation and production of neutralizing antibodies against pathogens should be strictly regulated, otherwise there is the possibility of the development of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marsland and Kopf, 2007</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the efficient TLR-mediated activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems with prevention of reactivity to autologous tissues remain elusive.</p><p>Examples of critical cells that express TLRs and could potentially link the innate and adaptive immune systems are relatively primitive B cells, B-1 cells, found mainly in the peritoneal and pleural cavities. In contrast to recirculating follicular B cells (or conventional B or B-2 cells), B-1 cells are characterized by B220<sup>low</sup>IgM<sup>high</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berland and Wortis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tung and Herzenberg, 2007</xref>). Although it has been pointed out by many researchers that innate B-1 cells but not conventional B cells are producers of natural antibodies against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ochsenbein et al., 1999</xref>), accumulating lines of evidence suggest that a major source of autoantibodies is also those B-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgarth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll and Holers, 2005</xref>), but it has been a matter of debate. By stimulation via different TLRs, the B-1 cell population in the peritoneal cavity has been enlarged and B-1 cell&#x02013;mediated autoantibody production augmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami et al., 1995</xref>). This could be partly because B-1 cells express a set of TLRs, including TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gururajan et al., 2007</xref>), and are more prone to differentiate into plasma cells than B-2 cells upon TLR-mediated stimulation, although B-2 cells similarly possess a range of TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Genestier et al., 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami et al. (1995)</xref> have shown, in anti&#x02013;red blood cell autoantibody transgenic mice, that the susceptibility to autoimmune hemolytic anemia was significantly increased when the mice were transferred from germ-free or specific pathogen-free conditions to conventional conditions or injected with a TLR4 ligand, LPS, with a concomitant increase in the peritoneal B-1 cell population, whereas almost all B-2 cells are constitutively deleted in the transgenic mice. These findings again suggest the importance of the regulation of TLR signaling in B-1 cells, which prevents overstimulation of TLRs so as not to evoke overproduction of natural antibodies, including potentially harmful autoantibodies. Therefore, what mechanisms may regulate the overstimulation of the TLR signal, particularly in B-1 cells?</p><p>We speculated that paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayami et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kubagawa et al., 1997</xref>) could participate in the regulation of B-1 cells. Recruitment of SH2 domain&#x02013;containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) to phosphotyrosylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic portion of PIR-B was shown to be critical for PIR-B&#x02013;mediated inhibitory signaling in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maeda et al., 1999</xref>), and this inhibition is achieved, at least in part, via constitutive binding of PIR-B to its ligand, i.e., MHC class I molecules, expressed on the same cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masuda et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in PIR-B&#x02013;deficient (<italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice, the peritoneal B-1 cell population significantly increased, particularly with aging, compared with wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ujike et al., 2002</xref>). However, it has not been determined how the B-1 cell compartment is physiologically regulated by PIR-B or what the physiological or pathological consequence of the expanded B-1 cells is in the contexts of infection and autoimmunity.</p><p>In this paper, we show that PIR-B can inhibit TLR9-mediated signaling via regulation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) phosphorylation in peritoneal B-1 cells. We found that TLR9 activation immediately activates an Src family kinase, Lyn, which then phosphorylates PIR-B cytoplasmic ITIMs. In the absence of PIR-B, B-1 cells become hyperproducers of natural IgM antibodies, including anti-IgG Fc autoantibodies, i.e., rheumatoid factor (RF), via unmethylated CpG-B oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-B) stimulation in vitro and in vivo or upon aging. These phenotypes caused by PIR-B deficiency were further exaggerated in combination with the <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mutation, which caused the <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mutant mice to be short-lived mainly because of autoimmune glomerulonephritis with immune complex depositions. Our findings may provide a novel strategy for preventing autoimmunity by reducing the production of pathogenic autoantibodies by B-1 cells, such as through down-regulation of Btk activation or enhancement of PIR-B&#x02013;mediated B-1 cell regulation.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>PIR-B deficiency with <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mutation characteristically augments autoantibody production associated with autoimmune glomerulonephritis</title><p><italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were grossly normal and survived well to at least 50 wk of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) without any abnormalities in the histology of their joint components (synovium and cartilage; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082392/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>), skin, lungs, and glomeruli (not depicted). However, <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice were found to be markedly short-lived, with only about half of them surviving at 40 wk of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Microscopic examination of their organ samples revealed that the combined mutant mice did not develop histopathological traits in the lung, salivary glands (not depicted), and joints (Fig. S1 A), but that in the kidney they readily developed diffuse glomerulopathy with a mild increase in the size and cellularity (mesangial area) of the glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, periodic acid&#x02013;Schiff [PAS] stain).

These pathological changes were not observed in wild-type B6 or <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice, indicating that autoimmune glomerulonephritis occurs as a combined effect of PIR-B and Fas mutations (Fig. S1 B). Consistent with no arthritis and Sj&#x000f6;gren-like disease in the double-mutant mice, anti&#x02013;SS-B/La antibodies were below the detection limit (Fig. S1 C, left). We also found that, although the levels of IgM- and IgG-RF were high in <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice, these levels were further elevated in <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), indicating that PIR-B deficiency has a marked impact on the augmentation of RF production in vivo. In addition, anti&#x02013;double-stranded (ds) DNA autoantibody production was more augmented in <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice than in <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> animals, although the difference did not reach a statistically significant level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We also measured by ELISA the levels of autoantibodies in sera against single-stranded (ss) DNA and &#x003b2;2&#x02013;glycoprotein I (&#x003b2;2-GPI), but we did not observe a significant elevation of anti-ssDNA production in <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice tested compared with <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, right), nor we did not detect anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;2-GPI (Fig. S1 C, right). Examinations of hematocrit values failed to demonstrate an autoimmune hemolytic anemia in <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> and other mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082392/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). The PIR-B deficiency did not result in any obvious changes in the staining pattern by antinuclear autoantibodies (Fig. S1 D). The peritoneal B-1 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, top) and splenic plasma cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, bottom) populations were also markedly increased in <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice. With these data collectively, we concluded that PIR-B deficiency renders mice susceptible to the development of autoimmune glomerulonephritis in combination with <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic>, which accompanies with a markedly elevated RF production, with a robust production of anti-dsDNA and anti-ssDNA autoantibodies.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> with the <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mutation is sufficient in mice for the development of glomerulonephritis with marked elevation of RF production.</bold> (A) <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice were remarkably short-lived.

The main source of such autoantibodies is considered to be B-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montecino-Rodriguez and Dorshkind, 2006</xref>). Adequate regulation of the production of natural autoantibodies, including RF, is proposed to be crucial for avoiding autoimmune diseases, which are otherwise evoked by too strong or sustained innate responses against microbial or viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Re et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krieg and Vollmer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marsland and Kopf, 2007</xref>). To characterize the precise sources of RF, we next examined the RF levels in sera from B6 and <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in the absence of a potentially large influence by <italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mutation.

For example, receptor tyrosine-based activation motif&#x02013;induced, SOCS1-mediated feedback regulation seems to occur at later stages, such as hours, after TLR9 activation, followed by inflammatory cytokine induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rothlin et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the PIR-B&#x02013;mediated suppression revealed in this study seems to take place as early as 5 min after CpG-B addition to B-1 cells. Therefore, PIR-B does not seem to fit well into the category of feedback regulatory elements for TLR9. Rather, it plays an important regulatory role in immediate-early cellular responses to TLR9 activation. PIR-B is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated at the ITIMs and associates with SHP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kubagawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maeda et al., 1999</xref>), which is critical for maintaining steady-state levels of intracellular phosphotyrosylated proteins. In this study, we found a novel and immediately initiated regulatory circuit for TLR9, namely that PIR-B phosphorylation is immediately augmented by TLR9-initiated Lyn activation, and the concomitant enhancement of SHP-1 recruitment to augmented phospho-ITIMs of PIR-B leads to Btk dephosphorylation, which then attenuates the phosphorylation level of NF-&#x003ba;B p65RelA. The molecular mechanism for the TLR9-initiated Lyn activation, which augments Btk phosphorylation, is currently not known. Interestingly, on the other hand, SHP-1 has recently been demonstrated to be a critical regulator for type I interferon production by macrophages and dendritic cells through inhibition of IRAK1 activation downstream of TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2008</xref>), whereas augmented IRAK1 activation is not observed in CpG-B&#x02013;stimulated <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B-1 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082392/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>), suggesting that B-1 cells preferentially use Btk as a key intersecting molecule for the inhibitory circuit.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that Btk is an important mediator for the TLR9 cascade in addition to MyD88 and TRAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doyle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilliet et al., 2008</xref>). Btk is required for NF-&#x003ba;B activation, participating in the pathway leading to increased phosphorylation of p65RelA activated by TLR8 and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doyle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). As is well known, Btk is a critical kinase for the development and function of B cells, including B-1 cells, by assuring antigen receptor signaling, as has been demonstrated in immunocompromised <italic>Xid</italic> mice and human X-linked agammaglobulinemia, in which Btk is dysfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hashimoto et al., 1996</xref>). Our current finding that Btk is a critical link between the TLR9 cascade and the PIR-B&#x02013;mediated regulatory loop, particularly in B-1 cells expressing abundant PIR-B (Fig. S3 A), provides an insight into the mechanism underlying crosstalk of the innate immune system with ITIM-harboring receptors.</p><p>Given that PIR-B might be a negative regulator for TLR9 in B-1 cells, PIR-B&#x02013;mediated inhibition of TLR9 activation could become potentially harmful for host mammals if their immune system should engage with invading pathogens that otherwise would cause serious infectious diseases. Therefore, it is expected that this regulatory system might be tightly controlled during the course of the capture, sensing, processing, and elimination of virulent microbes. How is PIR-B&#x02013;initiated TLR9 regulation controlled? Although we do not currently have an answer to this question, it is conceivable that cell-surface expression of PIR-B might be down-regulated or the expression of PIR-A with possibly the opposite function, namely the activation of TLR9, might be up-regulated, or both. Another possibility is that spatial communication between PIR-B and TLR9 on, or near, the cell membrane might be uncoupled during serious infections by means of any unknown intracellular mechanism that controls the dynamics of endosomal/lysosomal TLR9 as well as the dynamics of PIR-B. It may be possible that PIR-B on plasma membrane could translocate partially to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment of B-1 cells upon CpG stimulation. Our preliminary confocal laser-scanning microscopic analysis of B-1 cells stimulated with CpG suggests that it could be the case (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082392/DC1">Fig. S6</ext-link>). Such translocation may account for, at least partly, the reason why endosomal/lysosomal TLR9 can communicate intimately with PIR-B in terms of CpG-initiated, TLR9-mediated signaling and may imply a presence of any uncoupling mechanism for the TLR9&#x02013;PIR-B communication. On the other hand, although preceding studies have demonstrated the critical roles of inhibition mediated by PIR-B in the maintenance of immune homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wheadon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ujike et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pereira et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masuda et al., 2007</xref>), the function of the activating counterpart, PIR-A, remains to be determined, but it also can bind to MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>).

Our observations on glomerulonephritis in <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice with markedly and specifically elevated IgM- and IgG-RF productions, but not other autoantibodies examined, suggest that IgM- and IgG-RF autoantibodies, namely anti-IgG Fc antibodies, are factors that worsen the disease, presumably by accelerating the deposition of IgG autoantibodies against basement membranes of glomeruli. Considering these observations, it may increasingly become important to manipulate the PIR-B&#x02013;mediated inhibitory system in the regulation of autoimmune diseases while maintaining the integrity of TLR9-mediated microbial sensing, in such cases as rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newkirk, 2002</xref>). Understanding of the PIR-B system in B-1 cells may lead to the development of novel and effective ways toward controlling autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ujike et al., 2002</xref>) and backcrossed with B6 mice for 12 generations. <italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice were generated by crossing B6.<italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice (C57BL/6J Jms Slc-<italic>lpr/lpr</italic>; The Jackson Laboratory) with B6.<italic>Pirb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and by intercrossing between the littermates.
