This protein contains six putative &#x003b1;-helices and three extracellular loops in which the glycosylation sites (Asn132, Asn149 and Asn240) are comprised in loops 2 and 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Wallach1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In its active state, NADPH oxidase is a multi-component enzyme complex composed of cytochrome <italic>b<sub>558</sub></italic> (gp91<sup>phox </sup>and p22<sup>phox</sup>) and cytosolic factors (p67<sup>phox</sup>, p47<sup>phox</sup>, p40<sup>phox</sup>, Rac and Rap1A) that translocate at the membrane surface from cytosol upon stimulation. From this transfer and through the assembly of the constituents, NADPH oxidase is activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Mizrahi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon infection or stimulation with inflammatory mediators, NADPH oxidase from neutrophils generate O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and then oxygen derivatives, or ROS, which are necessary for the defense of the organism.</p><p>Recent studies on the C-terminal part (amino acids 221 to 570) of gp91<sup>phox</sup> protein show that the cytoplasmic domain retains a high NADPH diaphorase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Nisimoto1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> that can be stimulated in the presence of cytosolic proteins Rac and p67<sup>phox</sup>. This supports the hypothesis that p67<sup>phox</sup> and Rac bind directly to gp91<sup>phox</sup> and activates NADPH oxidase by inducing conformational changes in its flavoprotein domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Paclet1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Using a similar approach, different domains of p22<sup>phox</sup> protein have been delineated and shown to be involved in the maturation of the gp91<sup>phox</sup> protein before the assembly of the gp91<sup>phox</sup>/p22<sup>phox</sup> heterodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Zhu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Among these approaches, an internal domain in the N-terminal part of p22<sup>phox</sup> is involved in the flavocytochrome assembly, whereas the proline-rich region (PRR motif) in the C-terminal portion is responsible for NADPH oxidase activity via the binding to the p47<sup>phox</sup> SH3 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Vignais1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare immunodeficiency disease caused by mutations in genes encoding one of the main constituents of NADPH oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Heyworth1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations in the <italic>CYBB</italic> gene encoding gp91<sup>phox</sup> represent almost 60&#x00025; of CGD cases. These defects largely result in a lack of protein expression (X&#x000b0; CGD) or, in less than 10&#x00025; of CGD cases, in a decrease or a loss of oxidase activity while protein is present (X<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or X<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CGD). Recently, gene therapy has been tested in animal models and in clinical trials to attempt to reconstitute NADPH oxidase activity in X-linked CGD mice or in X-linked CGD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Ott1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Although promising results have been reported, this method still employs a retrovirus that may deliver the corrective gene into the patient's genome in locations which affect essential genes such as those involved in cancer.</p><p>Beside gene therapy, recent progress has been made with methods for the delivery of functional proteins which are based on the direct delivery of active therapeutic proteins into targeted living cells or, in the case of monoclonal antibodies, for the stimulation of specific immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Park1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Different strategies are used for the delivery of functional proteins such as microinjection, electroporation, liposomes or by fusion to a protein transduction domain (PTD). Among these delivery systems, liposomes represent a promising technology for the delivery of macromolecules into cells for the following reasons: (1) they are non-cytotoxic; (2), they can deliver and specifically target a large set of bioactive molecules (such as proteins, DNA or ribozymes); (3), they can protect molecules from degradation; and (4), their composition is easily modifiable. Different studies have used liposomes for the delivery of proteins such as antigens or toxins, drugs and nucleic molecules, but none of them has attempted to deliver membrane proteins.</p><p>The production of recombinant membrane proteins by the classical overexpression systems still presents a technical challenge. Among these challenges are yield, correct folding, solubility and protein integration into the lipid membrane to constitute functional proteoliposomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Rigaud1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, due to their hydrophobic nature, it is difficult to make membrane proteins in a native conformation for functional and structural studies in these <italic>in vivo</italic> systems. An interesting and attractive alternative for producing membrane proteins is the use of cell-free transcription/translation systems. These cell-free protein synthesis systems are essentially derived from rabbit reticulocytes, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> lysates, or wheat germ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Liguori1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the advantages of these <italic>in vitro</italic> expression systems is their capability to synthesize cytotoxic membrane proteins, or regulatory or unstable proteins that cannot be expressed in living organisms. The efficient expression of integral membrane proteins from prokaryotic sources has recently been demonstrated by using optimized <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-free systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Klammt1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The modification of the reaction conditions by adding chaperones, detergents or <italic>E. coli</italic> lipids have improved the synthesis and solubility of the expressed membrane proteins. Furthermore, solubilization of precipitated membrane proteins from cell-free expression systems and the integration into synthetic lipid vesicles result in the production of functional proteoliposomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Klammt2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar approach has been attempted in the production of functional mammalian membrane proteins, G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Ishihara1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Three human GPCRs were synthesized by an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-free expression system as fusion proteins with a thioredoxin tag. After integration into phospholipid vesicles, these GPCRs proteins displayed ligand-binding activities. However, the formation of functional proteoliposomes containing GPCRs with this technology requires first solubilization in the presence of detergents, and then reconstitution into lipid vesicles through long-term dialysis. Even if this work represents an important advance in the synthesis of mammalian membrane proteins by cell-free expression technology, it cannot be applied as a general strategy for producing membrane proteins due to the large size of the thioredoxin tag (11.2kDa), which may impair the protein activity.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the potential of the cell-free expression system to synthesize functional truncated forms of the gp91<sup>phox</sup> subunit and its capacity to directly produce proteoliposomes containing these truncated forms. We demonstrate that all the truncated forms are expressed as soluble proteins in the presence of detergents and display fully enzymatic activity. Moreover, the addition of natural lipid vesicles in the synthesis reaction results in the formation of functional proteoliposomes which can be used as vectors in the direct delivery of the membrane protein into mammalian cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> expression of truncated gp91<sup>phox</sup></title><p>An analysis of the prediction of the putative hydrophobic domains of gp91<sup>phox</sup> protein has been carried out through the use of different programs (Sosui, TMHMM, TMpred and TopPred).

Recent developments suggest that cell-free expression systems represent an alternative to classical <italic>in vivo</italic> expression. In order to decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in the activity of human NADPH oxidase, we generated five truncated forms of gp91<sup>phox</sup>.

Truncated gp91<sup>phox</sup> were designed with a his-tag located either at the N or at the C terminal part of the protein. (B) Analysis of the expression of the ten gp91<sup>phox</sup> truncated proteins by western blot using a monoclonal antibody anti-his.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000856.g002"/></fig><p>We first set up the conditions for expressing each construct in the presence or absence of chaperones or detergents. As an initial validation, the expression of these ten truncated proteins was analyzed by western blotting using an anti-his antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar results were obtained with a gp91<sup>phox</sup> specific antibody (data not shown). Interestingly, the expression pattern of each construct depends on different parameters. Using the standard conditions, all the truncated gp91<sup>phox</sup> proteins are expressed but at variable levels, as detected by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The position of the histidine tag may have a critical effect by decreasing (e.g. gp91<sup>phox</sup> 90-C) or by inhibiting (e.g. gp91<sup>phox</sup> 233-C) the expression of the truncated gp91<sup>phox</sup> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Our results suggested that the N-terminal hexa-histidine tag improves the translation efficiency either by stabilizing the messenger or by providing a better folding state of the expressed proteins.</p><p>We next studied the effect of non-ionic (<italic>n</italic>-dodecyl &#x003b2;-D-maltoside, <italic>n</italic>-octyl &#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside, <italic>n</italic>-thiooctyl &#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside, Nonidet P40) and zwitterionic (Chaps) detergents on the expression of gp91<sup>phox </sup>truncated forms. These detergents were selected as they are mild, relatively non-denaturing and are compatible with <italic>in vitro</italic> expression systems as they have no inhibitory effects on the expression of membrane proteins. They were all tested at their critical micellar concentration (CMC), except for Nonidet P40 (NP40), which was 100 times more concentrated than the usual CMC (0.05 mM). Interestingly, these detergents displayed various effects on protein expression. For example, Chaps and &#x003b2;-OG have a strong negative effect on the expression of the gp91<sup>phox</sup> truncated forms, except for constructs gp91<sup>phox</sup> 221-C with &#x003b2;-OG and gp91<sup>phox</sup> 221-C, gp91<sup>phox</sup> 233-N and 233-C, gp91<sup>phox</sup> 285-N with Chaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These two compounds decreased the expression of gp91<sup>phox</sup> 221-N, but were compatible with the expression of gp91<sup>phox</sup> 221-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, NP40, Thio-OG and DDM enhanced the expression levels for most of the gp91<sup>phox</sup> truncated forms, with a stronger effect on the constructs containing a hexa-histidine at the N-terminal part of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that the addition of non-ionic detergents is compatible with the synthesis of protein in a cell-free expression system, and that this may result in an enhancement of protein synthesis.</p><p>The effect of the histidine tag position on protein synthesis was also studied in the presence or absence of detergents or various compounds. Interestingly, when the histidine tag is attached to the N-terminal part of the protein, all the gp91<sup>phox</sup> truncated forms were synthesized, except in the presence of &#x003b2;-OG and Chaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The other compounds (GroE and GSH/GSSG) had no effect on the expression of the truncated forms, except for constructs gp91<sup>phox</sup> 90-N, 195-N and 233-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These data indicate that the levels of expression of gp91<sup>phox</sup> truncated forms in a cell-free system depend on both the tag position and the detergent. However, there is no clear rule to determine whether a mammalian membrane protein will be expressed or not in a high yield within this optimized cell-free expression system.</p><p>Based on these results, we sought to determine whether the truncated gp91<sup>phox</sup> proteins could be expressed under a soluble form, as this form is usually considered to possess a &#x0201c;native-like&#x0201d; conformation. The solubility tests are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Solubilization depends on a combination of three different factors: (1) the structural properties of the membrane protein, (2) the position of the tag (gp91<sup>phox</sup> 233-N vs. -C or gp91<sup>phox</sup> 221-N vs. -C) and (3) the detergent by itself (DDM for gp91<sup>phox</sup> 221-N/-C or Chaps for gp91<sup>phox</sup> 233-N/-C). Using the standard conditions of the cell-free expression system, the gp91<sup>phox</sup> truncated proteins were expressed as precipitates (data not shown). All the proteins were produced in a soluble form using DDM, except for the gp91<sup>phox</sup> 233 proteins which were solubilized in the presence of Chaps. Whichever compound was added, the solubility of gp91<sup>phox</sup> 90-N protein remained too low to be used for further experiments.</p><fig id="pone-0000856-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000856.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Solubility and activity of gp91<sup>phox</sup> recombinant proteins.</title><p>(A) Optimization of the solubility of the gp91<sup>phox</sup> truncated proteins by western blot using a monoclonal antibody anti-his.

However, the production of mammalian membrane protein in an <italic>E.coli</italic> cell-free expression system results in a non-glycosylated protein. To quantify the electron transfer from NADPH to FAD, we used two different electron acceptors: NitroBlueTetrazolium (NBT), the most commonly used electron acceptor, or IodoNitroTetrazolium (INT), which has been shown to specifically accept electrons from FAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Cross1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

The soluble gp91<sup>phox</sup> proteins were tested for their diaphorase activity, and for each assay 10 pmoles of purified soluble protein were used. None of the truncated proteins tested exhibited activity in the absence of cytosolic regulatory proteins (p47<sup>phox</sup>, p67<sup>phox</sup>, p40<sup>phox</sup> and Rac; data not shown). By incubating the recombinant proteins with neutrophil cytosol and an optimum concentration of arachidonic acid (AA) for 10 minutes at 25&#x000b0;C, we were able to activate the recombinant proteins and to observe NADPH-dependent diaphorase activity.</p><p>The results for gp91<sup>phox</sup> 195-N, gp91<sup>phox</sup> 221-C, gp91<sup>phox</sup> 233-N and gp91<sup>phox</sup> 285-N proteins are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g003">Figure 3B</xref>.

Further structural data will shed light on the mechanisms of diaphorase activation of recombinant gp91<sup>phox</sup> constructs in the absence or presence of lipids.</p><p>Data presented here provide conclusive results on the capacity of the optimized cell-free expression system to produce fully active proteoliposomes in a one-step reaction. Liposomes are now widely used for the delivery of various therapeutic molecules such as antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Park1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, nucleic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Cusi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Kim1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and antifungal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Wasan1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> or anticancer drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Sengupta1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. These molecules can be located either in the aqueous compartment, if soluble, or embedded into the bilayer for hydrophobic compounds. Moreover, various liposomal vesicles containing pharmaceutical agents have been developed to sustain their therapeutic actions <italic>in vivo</italic> by a prolonged half-life circulation, a reduced cytotoxicity and an improved cellular and tissue targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Torchilin1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One of the current challenges in therapy is to develop new strategies in the efficient treatment of disease. Encouraging results have recently been obtained using gene therapy to treat CGD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Ott1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, even if gene therapy appears to be a promising method of treatment of rare diseases, its efficiency needs to be improved, and a number of major problems inherent to this technology remain to be solved, such as immunogenic responses against the vector, low specificity of cells expressing the protein and the random insertion of DNA into the genome of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000856-Boeckle1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, an alternative or a complementary approach to gene therapy needs to be developed.</p><p>In this paper, we report the development of a new method to produce recombinant proteoliposomes containing membrane protein in a one-step reaction, and we demonstrate that these proteoliposomes can be used as carriers for delivering membrane proteins. We evaluate the ability of proteoliposomes to exhibit diaphorase activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g006">6A</xref>) and to efficiently deliver truncated gp91<sup>phox</sup> protein into cells targeting their plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g005">Figures 5C, 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000856-g006">6B and 6C</xref>). Therefore, we demonstrated the &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d; that the active embedded protein can be directly delivered to the plasma membrane of different cell lines, and we demonstrated that our proteoliposomes may represent an original approach for protein therapy. However, production by the cell-free expression system of a fully functional cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558 </sub>containing two hemes remains a challenge. The incorporation of hemin in the cell-free expression medium was first tested to evaluate the feasibility to express heme-bound protein with this expression system. Preliminary results indicate that concentrations of hemin below 1.6 &#x000b5;M do not interfere with the transcription/translation process suggesting that the cell-free expression system could be useful to produce recombinant cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>558</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>All the chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich and the detergents from Calbiochem.
