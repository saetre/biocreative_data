A prolactin excess reduces the tumour latency and increases the tumour incidence and growth rate in multiple rodent models of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced mammary tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In humans, prospective case&#x02013;control studies show that women with high versus low blood prolactin levels have an increased risk of preinvasive and invasive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the majority of human breast cancers have been shown to express the prolactin receptor (PRLR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Despite these observations, attempts to treat advanced breast cancer through the pharmacological inhibition of pituitary prolactin secretion, either as monotherapy or in combination with tamoxifen, have been disappointing. In a recent study of women with metastatic breast cancer, however, a significant increase in the objective tumour response rate was seen when the dopamine agonist cabergoline was added to docetaxel versus treatment with docetaxel alone (31/34 versus 13/36, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), suggesting that endocrine prolactin protects against chemotherapy-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This corroborates preclinical data in breast and ovarian cancers and myeloma in which exogenous prolactin reduced the apoptotic response to commonly used cytotoxic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, breast cancer cell lines engineered to overexpress autocrine prolactin are resistant to taxane-mediated cell death both <italic>in vitro </italic>and in tumour xenografts <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Expression of prolactin has been demonstrated by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation and immunostaining in the epithelial component of over 90% of human breast cancer samples. Moreover, multiple breast cancer cell lines have been shown to synthesise and secrete bioactive prolactin <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Coexpression of the PRLR in breast cancer cells suggests that such prolactin may act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to influence cell growth and survival. Approaches to antagonise autocrine prolactin in breast cancer cell lines have centred on prolactin-neutralising antibodies and PRLR antagonists. Neutralising prolactin antibodies have been shown to inhibit MCF-7 and T47Dco cell growth by 20% to 85% and to increase cell death twofold to threefold; however, no <italic>in vivo </italic>data have been reported on this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the latter study, prolactin neutralisation also resulted in additive augmentation of the apoptotic effects of exogenous ceramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The human PRLR antagonist G129R-hPRL was developed by site-directed mutagenesis, with the substitution of glycine for arginine at position 129 in the third alpha helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This mutation sterically hinders the sequential dimerisation and subsequent activation of the PRLR, but notably reduces the PRLR binding affinity 10-fold. G129R-hPRL has been shown to reduce Bcl2 expression and to induce apoptosis in both oestrogen receptor-positive and oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines by one group, but this was not replicated by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Administration of G129R-hPRL reduced the growth of MCF-7 and T47D xenografts by 40% in immunocompromised mice compared with control mice, and its transgenic expression reduced the incidence of DMBA-induced mammary tumours by 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The single G129R mutation does not remove all agonist activity, however, as demonstrated by high sensitivity assays <italic>in vitro </italic>and in the prostate gland <italic>in vivo</italic>, where G129R-hPRL was overexpressed using the metallothionein promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These transgenic animals exhibited hypertrophied prostate glands with increased levels of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase compared with those from wildtype mice. Further modification of G129R by its N-terminal truncation results in a 'pure' PRLR antagonist, &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 G129R-hPRL (&#x00394;1&#x02013;9), which is devoid of any agonist activity. Coinjection of female Balb-c/J mice with &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 and exogenous prolactin reduced the prolactin-induced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 but only at an antagonist/prolactin ratio of 100:1. This confirms the antagonistic properties of &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 but also highlights the reduced binding affinity for the PRLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. No further data are published on &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 in breast cancer, however it has been shown to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines by antagonising autocrine prolactin-mediated janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT5A/B signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the current study we examined the effects of the 'pure' prolactin receptor antagonist &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 in breast cancer models <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although ineffective at inhibiting breast cancer cell line growth in monolayer culture as a single agent, &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 significantly augmented the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Short-term treatment with doxorubicin increased prolactin mRNA expression in all five cell lines tested. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that prolactin receptor antagonism markedly inhibited the colony forming efficiency of cell lines and primary cancers <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data suggest a role for autocrine prolactin signalling in a subpopulation of clonogenic and treatment-resistant breast cancer cells that may be responsible for relapse after chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Recombinant prolactin and &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 were produced in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>as previously described and were gifts from V.

In brief, cells were seeded in 96-well plates, allowed to adhere for 24 hours and were treated with the desired experimental media, which was refreshed every 2 to 3 days. At harvest, monolayers were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed and stained with 0.4% sulphorhodamine B in 1% acetic acid.

At the exogenous prolactin concentrations employed, a 10-fold excess of &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 was required for almost complete antagonism of prolactin-induced stimulation. This necessity is consistent with data demonstrating a 10-fold reduced binding affinity of site 2 mutated lactogenic hormones for their cognate receptors, compared with their native ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the development of the growth hormone receptor antagonist Peg-Visomant (Somavert&#x02122;), this need was overcome by further engineering the site 1 binding site, with eight additional amino acid substitutions, restoring the receptor binding affinity to that of native growth hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A similar approach to increase the binding affinity of the PRLR antagonists to the PRLR would be required if they are to be developed successfully as therapeutic agents.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>&#x00394;1&#x02013;9-G129R-hPrl inhibits exogenous prolactin effects but does not reduce cell numbers in standard growth conditions. <bold>(a) </bold>Western analysis of T47D cell lysates confirms prolactin (500 ng/ml for 30 min) induced phosphorylation of STAT 5A/B, which is abrogated in a dose-dependent manner by coincubation with &#x00394;1&#x02013;9-G129R-hPrl (&#x00394;1&#x02013;9). <bold>(b) </bold>Prolactin-induced increase in cell number of T47D cells in monolayer culture for 3 days was abrogated by coincubation with &#x00394;1&#x02013;9. <bold>(c) </bold>1,000 ng/ml &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 (broken lines) had no effect on cell number in control medium (solid lines) of MCF-7 cells (upper two curves) or T47D cells (lower two curves) in a monolayer culture in the absence of exogenous prolactin. *<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 by Student <italic>t </italic>test compared with 100 ng/ml prolactin in the absence of &#x00394;1&#x02013;9.

These latter data are consistent with reports of growth inhibition of breast cancer cell lines using prolactin inhibitory antibodies, and it is possible that subtle variations in culture conditions/constituents or genetic drift of the cell lines may account for the discrepancies between our findings and those of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In serum-free medium, the MCF-7 cell number declined over 5 days in culture and, in contrast to the findings above, &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 induced further significant reductions in the MCF-7 cell number of 5% to 10% over controls, at concentrations &#x0003e;10 ng/ml (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Using RT-PCR, a time-dependent increase in prolactin mRNA expression was seen in response to serum starvation, leading to the hypothesis that autocrine prolactin is produced to promote survival of breast cancer cells under conditions of stress, and that its antagonism reduces cell survival (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). To examine the effects of more therapeutically relevant stressors, MCF-7 cells were exposed to 1 &#x003bc;M doxorubicin for 24 hours before RNA extraction. Doxorubicin treatment was associated with an increase in prolactin mRNA expression, which was sustained for at least 5 days after treatment, whereas it could not be detected in cells cultured in control medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Autocrine prolactin production is stimulated by serum starvation and treatment with doxorubicin. <bold>(a) </bold>Monolayer culture of MCF-7 cells in serum-free medium over 5 days (open bars) resulted in cell loss compared with the cell number at 24 hours after plating in 10% charcoal stripped serum (CSS) (grey bar). &#x00394;1&#x02013;9-G129R-hPrl (&#x00394;1&#x02013;9) increased cell loss in a dose-dependent manner (clear bars).

The increases in prolactin mRNA were accompanied by increases in prolactin protein secretion, as demonstrated by western analysis of the conditioned medium from these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). Prolactin was secreted into the medium at concentrations between 2 and 20 ng/ml following doxorubicin treatment, with increased secretion evident with treatment for 24 hours. As approximately 3 million cells were used in 5 ml medium (see Materials and methods) and the amount of prolactin produced by the cells is taken as approximately 5 ng/ml, this secretion equates to ~25 ng/3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/24 hours, which is equivalent to ~8 pg/cell/24 hours. This level is comparable with the results of Ginsburg and Vonderhaar, who detected 7 to 14 pg/cell/24 hours in T47Dco cells as assessed by the Nb2 bioassay using concentrated conditioned media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

This effect was seen over a range of chemotherapy doses in short-term culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b,c</xref>) and also in longer term culture of cells for 10 days, after short initial pulses of doxorubicin for 2 to 12 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>).

This dramatic effect of PRLR antagonism in clonogenic cells but not in a monolayer culture suggests the presence of a subpopulation of clonogenic cells with increased dependence upon autocrine/paracrine prolactin signalling compared with their nonclonogenic counterparts.</p><p>The expression of both the PRLR and autocrine prolactin was thus examined in a monolayer culture of breast cancer cell lines by dual-label fluorescence immunocytochemistry. All T47D cells showed strong staining for both the PRLR (red fluorescence) and for prolactin (green fluorescence), which showed subcellular localisation in a region consistent with Golgi localisation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Such subcellular localisation may explain why prolactin could be detected by immunocytochemistry, due to the increased concentrations at these sites, but not by western analysis of whole cell lysates. Western analysis of subcellular fractions may facilitate detection of prolactin from cell lysates. The staining pattern of MCF-7 cells for the PRLR was more heterogeneous and was confined to particular colonies of cells. These cells also coexpressed prolactin and were often surrounded by cells that expressed neither prolactin nor its receptor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). The three oestrogen receptor-negative cell lines displayed less frequent PRLR-positive cells compared with the oestrogen receptor-positive lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5f</xref>). Further work is required to correlate the relative clonogenicity of cells with expression levels of PRLR and prolactin, and would be augmented by improvements in PRLR antibodies to determine the relative expression levels of the long form of the PRLR and the dominant negative short form of the PRLR.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Immunofluorescence of prolactin and the prolactin receptor in breast cancer cell lines.

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that an antiprolactin approach can significantly reduce the colony-forming ability of breast cancer cells in culture. Next the effects of &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 on the clonogenicity of disaggregated primary DCIS specimens were examined. These DCIS cells did not grow in the soft agar assay described, so a suspension culture technique termed the mammosphere assay was employed. This was chosen on the basis that a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of primary breast cancer cells with the properties of both self-renewal and multipotency can be isolated by means of their capacity to survive anoikis and to grow in suspension culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Mammospheres were generated in suspension culture from six DCIS samples. Such mammospheres have been shown to be of epithelial origin, as they express cytokeratins 14 and 18, but were shown to form faster and with greater efficiency than those from normal breast tissue &#x02013; confirming their origin from the malignant cells rather than adjacent normal breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As bovine pituitary extract was used in the mammosphere growth medium, it was necessary to first investigate the effects of the bovine prolactin content on DCIS mammosphere formation. In the first two mammosphere assays on DCIS samples, therefore, controls were set up in which 500 ng/ml exogenous human prolactin was substituted for the bovine pituitary extract. The results demonstrate that the removal of bovine pituitary extract reduced mammosphere formation significantly but that human prolactin could not substitute for the effects of bovine pituitary extract on mammosphere formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). In view of these and previously published data demonstrating the reduced affinity of bovine prolactin for the human PRLR, we were satisfied that exogenous prolactin from bovine pituitary extract would not interfere significantly with the effects of &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 on autocrine prolactin signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In all six DCIS samples tested, the mammosphere forming efficiency was reduced significantly by the inclusion of &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 into the culture medium &#x02013; with maximal inhibition of mammosphere forming efficiency at concentrations from 10 to 1,000 ng/ml (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). An example of inhibition is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>. The median reduction in the mammosphere forming efficiency at 3 days was 56% (range 32% to 88%). Immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded DCIS mammospheres demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of the PRLR in cells located at their periphery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated a disparity between the effects of &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 in routine growth in monolayers and under conditions of cell stress or clonogenic growth. In response to cell stressors such as doxorubicin, signalling components known to be downstream of the PRLR, notably Src and focal adhesion kinase, are upregulated in cells lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The balance between cell apoptosis and proliferation downstream of PRLR signalling has been described previously to be dependent on the relative abundance of such signalling intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Changes in the abundance of signalling intermediates in this situation could therefore induce autocrine/paracrine prolactin dependence and preferential survival of prolactin-expressing cells. Furthermore, cells exhibiting such dependence may be a subpopulation of clonogenic cells, antagonism of which in a short-term monolayer culture results in no discernable change in cell number. Conditions of cell stress in monolayer and clonogenic assays expose the relative importance of these cell populations, the growth of which can be antagonised by &#x00394;1&#x02013;9.</p><p>The mechanisms by which autocrine prolactin secretion protects breast cancer cell lines from the effects of serum starvation and cytotoxic agents have not yet been elucidated. Other groups have shown that overexpression of prolactin in breast cancer cell lines induces the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, and that treatment with G129R-hPrl has been shown to reduce Bcl-2 levels whilst increasing those of the proapoptotic protein Bax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The inability of a second group to repeat these findings may be due to the effect being evident only in a subpopulation of clonogenic cells and not their more differentiated progeny. Differences in cell culture techniques, reagents and cell lines between laboratories may have exacerbated these discrepancies, and these differences highlight the need for better techniques to identify such treatment-resistant subpopulations of cells.</p><p>The expression and secretion of autocrine/paracrine prolactin mRNA and protein following chemotherapy raises the possibility of improved breast cancer therapy with the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and a PRLR-targeted agent. The increase in mRNA expression to a maximum at 48 hours, followed by a fall in levels thereafter, suggests that combination therapy should be given initially. The duration of PRLR-targeted therapy would probably be at least 1 week as mRNA was detectable up to this point. Investigation of longer term prolactin mRNA expression post treatment was not investigated, however, and the most efficacious treatment regimens will need to be discerned from further <italic>in vitro </italic>studies and xenograft studies <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In contrast to its lack of effect in monolayer culture, PRLR antagonism with &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 profoundly inhibits colony formation of both breast cancer cell lines and primary tumour samples. This suggests the presence of a clonogenic population of breast cancer cells that are preferentially sensitive to prolactin inhibition. In addition, autocrine/paracrine prolactin appears to be a survival factor in this subpopulation of breast cancer cells and is induced by treatment with doxorubicin or paclitaxel, as treatment with the PRLR antagonist &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 potentiates the efficacy of such drugs. If autocrine prolactin is preferentially produced by a cytotoxic-resistant putative breast cancer stem cell, then the rational combination of cytotoxic agents and &#x00394;1&#x02013;9 may improve outcomes in breast cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>&#x00394;1&#x02013;9 = &#x00394;1&#x02013;9-G129R-hPrl; BSA = bovine serum albumin; CFE = colony-forming efficiency; DCIS = ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic>; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS = foetal calf serum; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PRLR = prolactin receptor; RT = reverse transcriptase; STAT = signal transducer and activator of transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SJH designed and performed the experiments, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.
