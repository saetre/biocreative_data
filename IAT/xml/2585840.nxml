Orthologues of Hem1 in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are essential for cytoskeletal reorganization, embryonic cell migration, and morphogenesis. However, the in vivo functions of mammalian Hem1 are not known. Using a chemical mutagenesis strategy in mice to identify novel genes involved in immune cell functions, we positionally cloned a nonsense mutation in the <italic>Hem1</italic> gene. Hem1 deficiency results in defective F-actin polymerization and actin capping in lymphocytes and neutrophils caused by loss of the Rac-controlled actin-regulatory WAVE protein complex. T cell development is disrupted in Hem1-deficient mice at the CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (double negative) to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (double positive) cell stages, whereas T cell activation and adhesion are impaired. Hem1-deficient neutrophils fail to migrate in response to chemotactic agents and are deficient in their ability to phagocytose bacteria. Remarkably, some Rac-dependent functions, such as Th1 differentiation and nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B)&#x02013;dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines proceed normally in Hem1-deficient mice, whereas the production of Th17 cells are enhanced. These results demonstrate that Hem1 is essential for hematopoietic cell development, function, and homeostasis by controlling a distinct pathway leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, whereas NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent transcription proceeds independently of Hem1 and F-actin polymerization.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: CBC, complete blood count; DN, double negative; DP, double positive; ENU, N-ethylnitrosourea; Erk, extracellular regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase; GTP, guanosine-5&#x02032;-triphosphate; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; SP, side population; WBC, white blood cell.</p></fn><fn><p>M.W.

Among the major signaling molecules that regulate the cytoskeleton include members of the Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases (Cdc42, Rho, and Rac). Rho family members are activated downstream of multiple receptor types, including BCR and TCR, growth factor receptors, and cytokine receptors, and are also known to activate integrin receptors and cell adhesion through &#x0201c;inside-out&#x0201d; signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The importance of Rac in hematopoietic cell development and function is underscored by the characterization of gene-targeted mutations in mice, as well as natural mutations in humans, which result in a plethora of alterations including impaired proliferation, IL-2 production, adhesion, and migration in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>); defective dendrite formation and antigen presentation by DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>); defective migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) by neutrophils; and impaired proliferation, survival, adhesion, and homing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Rac and Rho are essential for pre&#x02013;T cell receptor-mediated T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), whereas Rac is also essential for B cell development and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). These studies indicate that Rho family members are essential for several active biological processes in hematopoietic cells.</p><p>Remarkably, although there are 70 or more putative Rho family effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), there is limited information on the identity of their biologically important targets in hematopoietic cells. Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> suggest that key biological targets of Rho family members may involve a family of adaptor proteins, including WASp (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein), and components of the WAVE complex. In mammalian cells, the WAVE complex consists of multiple subunits including WAVE (1, 2, or 3), HSPC300, Abi (1 or 2), Hem2 (also known as Nap1 [Nck-associated protein 1]), and Sra1 (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). The WAVE complex induces actin polymerization in response to Rac guanosine-5&#x02032;-triphosphate (GTP), which is brought into the WAVE complex via associations with Sra1 and Hem2. Although the majority of WAVE complex subunits are ubiquitously expressed, there is a version of the Hem subunit called Hem1 (also known as Nckap1l [NCK-associated protein1-like]), which was cloned based on hybridization to transcripts from hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Biochemical and genetic studies in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) indicate that homologues of Nap1 act downstream of the Rac pathway to regulate the actin polymerization, cell migration, and cell shape that are necessary for proper morphogenesis and development.</p><p>In this study, we sought to identify novel genes involved in lymphocyte development by taking a &#x0201c;phenotype-driven&#x0201d; approach using N-ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis, followed by immune function screening of G3 animals for recessive mutations leading to specific immunodeficiencies. Using positional cloning strategies, we identified a pedigree of mice that contains a point mutation in the <italic>Hem1</italic> gene, resulting in the absence of Hem1 protein. We show that Hem1 is an essential hematopoietic-specific regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, where it controls lymphocyte development, activation, proliferation, and homeostasis, as well as phagocytosis and migration by neutrophils and macrophages. Surprisingly, cytokine production proceeds normally in the absence of Hem1, suggesting that NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines is regulated independently of Hem1 and the actin cytoskeleton.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>Hem1</italic>&#x02013;deficient mice using chemical mutagenesis</title><p>In the course of the ENU program, a flow cytometry screen identified a pedigree (denoted NTB.1 for no T or B cells) in which the mice presented with an increased percentage of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells and a decreased percentage of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B lymphocytes in peripheral blood samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To identify the gene responsible for the NTB.1 phenotype, G1 and G2 NTB.1 carriers were crossed to C3HeB/FeJ mice, and the resulting F1 animals were intercrossed to generate F2 and N2 animals for mapping (see Materials and methods).

A genome scan of affected and unaffected animals indicated that the NTB.1 mutation mapped to chromosome 15 between 59.8 and 60.1 cM.

However, analysis of whole cell lysates from WT and <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes, T cells, and neutrophils indicates that loss of Hem1 results in the near complete absence of the WAVE complex proteins Wave2, Abi1, Abi2, and Sra1 in thymocytes and purified T cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>, left and middle), whereas WAVE members are reduced in <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>, right). The reduction in WAVE complex proteins is not caused by decreased transcription because <italic>Abi1</italic>, <italic>Abi2</italic>, <italic>Sra1</italic>, and <italic>Wave2</italic> mRNA are expressed normally in <italic>Hem1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> T cells relative to WT T cells (Fig. S8).

These results suggest that Hem1 is required for stabilization and/or translation of the WAVE complex proteins in hematopoietic cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), and they are consistent with several recent studies indicating that siRNA knockdown of Hem1 in HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) or Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) results in degradation of WAVE complex proteins, which are essential mediators of F-actin polymerization.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of Hem1 functions in F-actin polymerization and hematopoietic cell biology.</bold> In mammalian cells, the WAVE complex consists of multiple subunits including WAVE (1, 2, or 3), Abi (1 or 2), Hem (Hem2 [also known as Nap 1] or Hem1), and Sra1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). The WAVE complex alone does not induce actin polymerization but is stimulated in response to Rac GTP, which is activated by many receptors, and is brought into the WAVE complex via associations with Sra1 and Hem.

However, the specific signaling molecules and pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton in hematopoietic cells in vivo are unclear. In this study, we used a phenotype-driven ENU mutagenesis strategy in mice to identify a novel loss-of-function mutation in <italic>Hem1</italic>. Our studies reveal that Hem1 is an essential hematopoietic cell-specific regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, where it controls cell migration, adhesion, phagocytosis, and proliferation. Importantly, this study supports the utility of using ENU mutagenesis to generate immunodeficiency models in mice caused by single-point mutations, which more closely mimic the genetic alterations that result in human genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). The relative hematopoietic cell-specific expression of <italic>Hem1</italic>, and the multilineage immunodeficiency phenotype of <italic>Hem1</italic>-deficient mice, suggests that a subset of immunodeficiency diseases in humans may include loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Hem1</italic>.</p><p>Analysis of <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice reveals a severe defect in the development and expansion of &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells, predominantly at the DN-to-DP cell transition. Further examination of gated DN populations by flow cytometry indicates that <italic>Hem1</italic>-deficient thymocytes are inhibited at the CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN3 to CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cell stage, mediated by formation of the pre-TCR complex. Although Rac activation appears normal in <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes, F-actin polymerization and T cell capping are completely lost, and components of the WAVE complex disappear in the absence of Hem1. These results suggest that Hem1 has an essential role in T cell development and F-actin polymerization, perhaps by stabilizing the WAVE complex downstream of Rho family members. Our results extend a previous series of elegant studies suggesting that the Rac GTP exchange factor Vav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), as well as Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), are essential for T cell development at the DN-to-DP cell transition by regulating cell survival. Indeed, we also find an increased incidence of apoptosis in <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes and mature T cells (Fig. S6). The generation of T cell&#x02013;specific <italic>Hem1</italic>-deficient mice will be required to more clearly delineate the involvement of Hem1 in pre-TCR signaling and to separate specific and potentially nonspecific contributions of Hem1 deficiency on T cell development.</p><p>Previous studies have also suggested that the actin-regulatory proteins Vav (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>) for review), Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), HS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), Dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), Abi1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), and WAVE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) have essential roles in T cell activation by regulating actin reorganization, immune synapse formation, and calcium signaling. In addition, Rac2 has been shown to regulate Th1 cell differentiation by inducing the IFN-&#x003b3; promoter through the cooperative activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). We find that loss of Hem1 impairs T cell activation based on decreased CD69 up-regulation and decreased cell division of live-gated cells after &#x003b1;-CD3/&#x003b1;-CD28 stimulation. In addition, we find a defect in F-actin polymerization, actin capping, and cell adhesion in Hem1-deficient thymocytes and T cells. However, in contrast to loss of Vav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), WASp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), and Rac2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), we find that loss of Hem1 does not affect TCR-induced calcium signaling (unpublished data) and IL-2 production, nor is cell proliferation rescued by the addition of IL-2. In addition, we find that IFN&#x003b3;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; production occurs normally in <italic>Hem1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> T cells. The differences between loss of Vav1 and Rac2 versus loss of Hem1 likely reflect a bifurcation of signals from Vav1 and Rac2 upstream of Hem1. Consistent with this notion, we find that loss of Hem1 specifically disrupts processes that are dependent on actin reorganization, such as cell migration, adhesion, and immune synapse formation, whereas NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent transcription of IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, and proinflammatory cytokines proceed normally.</p><p>Loss of Vav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) and Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) have also been shown to be essential for normal B cell development and signaling by regulating cell survival. In addition, high <italic>Hem1</italic> expression has recently been associated with a poor clinical outcome in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and down-regulation of <italic>Hem1</italic> by antisense treatment increased susceptibility of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to fludarabine-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Our results show that Hem1 is essential for both B and T cell development, and they are consistent with Hem1 acting downstream of Vav and Rac during lymphocyte development. These results collectively suggest that Hem1-deficient mice provide an important resource to examine the importance of Hem1 in transformation and metastasis of hematopoietic cancers.</p><p>Innate immune responses are dependent on the ability of phagocytic cells to sense invading microbes through Toll-like receptors and to respond to chemoattractant molecules by migrating to inflammatory sites, where they produce proinflammatory cytokines and phagocytose and kill invading pathogens. Our analyses of blood and BM from <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice reveal severe but distinct alterations in innate immune responses associated with Hem1 deficiency. Purified neutrophils and macrophages from <italic>Hem1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice fail to phagocytose bacteria, and mutant neutrophils fail to migrate across a membrane and polymerize F-actin in response to stimulation. Neutrophil numbers are increased up to 25-fold in peripheral blood from <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which is consistent with decreased migration in vivo. The neutrophilic response in <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also correlates with increased numbers of proinflammatory Th17 cells, increased serum IL-17 and IL-6, and increased production of IL-1&#x003b2;, Mip-2, and KC from in vitro&#x02013;stimulated macrophages. Because IL-17 potently stimulates the expansion and chemotaxis of neutrophils in a G-CSF&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>), the neutrophilic phenotype seen in <italic>Hem1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice may result from increased Th17 effector cells. Likewise, the increased serum amyloid A from liver cells (which is made in response to IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1;) is likely the source of the amyloid deposits seen in <italic>Hem1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> liver, kidney, and heart (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref> and Fig. S6). Although the exact mechanism is unclear, the increase in Th17 effector cells in <italic>Hem1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice may be caused by the following: impaired neutrophil migration into tissues combined with defective phagocytosis of tissue neutrophils by macrophages, which could result in increased production of IL-23 from tissue macrophages (Fig. S3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>); increased Th17 differentiation from naive T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S7) in response to increased IL-6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S6) and ICOS (Fig. S7); and/or increased production of IL-17&#x02013;producing memory T cells in response to lymphopenia and impaired innate immunity.</p><p>Neutrophils from Vav1/2-deficient mice also exhibit defective adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Similarly, neutrophils from Rac2-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>), as well as a human patient with a dominant-negative RAC2 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), exhibit impaired neutrophil migration and phagocytosis. Although <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils exhibit normal Rac activation, components of the Rac-effector WAVE complex are severely reduced after loss of Hem1. These results are consistent with Hem1 acting downstream of Rac to stimulate actin polymerization in neutrophils, perhaps by stabilizing the WAVE complex. However, although macrophages from <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are also defective in their ability to phagocytose bacteria, they produce normal or increased amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to toll-like receptor stimulation. Hence, as we observed in T cells, our results suggest that NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated transcription of proinflammatory cytokines proceeds independently of Hem-1 in phagocytes. The imbalance between a functional proinflammatory cytokine arm and dysfunctional effector arm in both lymphocytes and phagocytes from <italic>Hem1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice may explain the unique pathology after loss of Hem1. Altogether, our results suggest that Hem1 is essential for innate immune cell function and homeostasis by regulating F-actin polymerization.</p><p>Rac1 and Rac2 also regulate many aspects of HSC biology, including adhesion, migration, mobilization, and engraftment. Indeed, we also find that Hem1 deficiency results in decreased colony-forming activity in the BM and increased colony-forming activity in the spleen and peripheral blood, and <italic>Hem1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells compete poorly with WT Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells after BM transplantation. These results are consistent with decreased adhesion of HSC/Ps in the BM niche, resulting in their release (mobilization) into peripheral blood and spleen of <italic>Hem1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), as is seen in Rac-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Additional experimentation will be required to definitively determine whether Hem1 also regulates HSC survival and proliferation.</p><p>Hem family proteins are highly conserved across Phyla. Disruption of specific Hem family orthologues in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>), and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) reveal a common theme of defective development, failed migration of embryonic tissues, and disrupted morphogenesis, all of which correlate with impaired actin reorganization. Similarly, the recent disruption of <italic>Nap1</italic> (<italic>Hem2</italic>) in mice results in early embryonic lethality caused by impaired neuronal differentiation and outgrowth, whereas premature retroviral expression of <italic>Nap1</italic> promotes postmigratory differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Our results indicate that Hem1 is the key Hem family member in hematopoietic cells, where it controls lymphocyte development and activation, as well as phagocyte function. The finding that Hem1 is relatively restricted to hematopoietic cell types, and that it plays a key role in actin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>) and survival of both normal and transformed cells, suggests that Hem1 might prove to be a valuable drug target in inflammatory diseases or cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>ENU mutagenesis, screening, and mutation mapping.</title><p>Mutagenesis with ENU was performed on C57BL/6J male mice according to the protocol used by Justice et al.
