However, the physiological function of PrP<sup>C</sup> remains an enigma. Cell culture experiments have indicated that PrP<sup>C</sup> and in particular its N-terminal octarepeat region together with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways have a fundamental involvement in neuroprotection and oxidative stress reactions. We used wild-type mice, PrP knockout (<italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) animals and transgenic mice that lack the octarepeat region (C4/&#x02212;) and subjected them to controlled ischemia. We identified an increased cleavage and synthesis of PrP<sup>C</sup> in ischemic brain areas of wild-type mice compared with sham controls. The infarct size in <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals was increased threefold when compared with wild-type mice. The infarct size in C4/&#x02212; animals was identical to <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, that is, around three times larger than in wild-type mice. We showed that the PrP in C4/&#x02212; mice does not functionally rescue the <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> phenotype; furthermore it is unable to undergo &#x003b2; cleavage, although an increased amount of C1 fragments was found in ischemic brain areas compared with sham controls.

A templated conformational transition of PrP<sup>C</sup> seems to be the cause of transmissibility and pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">(25)</xref>. PrP<sup>C</sup> has been shown to play a role in cellular antioxidative defense mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">(15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27)</xref> and to protect human neurons in primary culture against Bax-mediated cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">(2)</xref>. Experiments in cerebellar granule cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">(5)</xref> have shown a loss of neuroprotective activity of PrP<sup>C</sup> by a deletion of all five N-terminal octarepeats (PrP&#x00394;51&#x02013;90). We have recently identified a functional link between PrP<sup>C</sup> expression and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, a regulator of Akt phosphorylation and a protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>. Our findings are in agreement with published results that showed reduced Phospho-Akt expression levels in <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse brains following ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">(38)</xref>. We could also demonstrate that hippocampal cells that lack the octarepeat region showed reduced PI3K levels and decreased survival under stress conditions similar to PrP<sup>C</sup> knockout cells.</p><p>In neuroblastoma cells it could be demonstrated that the octapeptide repeats are required for the &#x003b2; cleavage and their absence (PrP&#x00394;oct) correlates with increased sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">(36)</xref>. The cleavage of the molecule seems to play a major role in the biological properties of PrP<sup>C</sup> but succession of these proteolysis procedures as well as relations between the two cleavages is controversial and still remains to be elucidated and in particular, the relevance of the octapeptide region in this functional process has not been established <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Recently, brain injury models in mice have been used to investigate a potential neuroprotective role of PrP<sup>C</sup><italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37)</xref>. There were significant differences between the volume of the lesion in PrP knockout (<italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice when compared with the wild-type counterpart with larger area of injury in the former. Moreover, using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization an increase of PrP mRNA levels and also PrP immunoreactivity were detected in penumbral neurons of the ischemic lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">(21)</xref>. These results further support the hypothesis of the antioxidant function of PrP<sup>C</sup><italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>With this work we specify the neuroprotective property of PrP<sup>C</sup> and the role of the octarepeat region in this function and contribute to understanding the succession and significance of cleavage processes in an <italic>in vivo</italic> ischemic model.

The C4 protein (PrP&#x00394;32&#x02013;93) did not functionally rescue the <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> phenotype, the octapeptide region of PrP<sup>C</sup> therefore seems to play a key role in neuroprotection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>We used homologous <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> recombination to produce <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> littermates with a 129/Sv-C57/Bl6 background. The role of the octarepeat region was investigated in C4/&#x02212; mice lacking amino acids 32 to 93 of PrP<sup>C</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">(30)</xref>. In consideration of the <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background of C4/&#x02212; mice and the PrP<sup>C</sup> expression, we crossed hemizygous C4/&#x02212; and <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to obtain male (21&#x02013;28 g) hemizygous C4/&#x02212; and <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> littermates.

In agreement with previous findings published by Shmerling and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">(30)</xref>, we detected higher PrP expression in C4/&#x02212; animals in comparison with wild-type control mice, that is, approximately three times higher in homozygous and 1.5 times higher in hemizygous C4/&#x02212; mice (data not shown). All C4 mice used in this study were hemizygous C4/&#x02212;. The mice were assigned to four groups: G1 (<italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; n = 9), G2 (<italic>Prnp</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; n = 7), G3 (C4/&#x02212;; n = 8), G4 (<italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; n = 8). They were kept under standard diurnal conditions and allowed access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The animal experiments were in accordance with animal protection standards and were approved by the government of Upper Bavaria (protocol number 209.1-2531-81/01). Every effort was made to reduce the number of animals used and to ensure they were free of pain and discomfort.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>The intraluminal filament model was used for occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">(35)</xref>. After 1 h of ischemia reperfusion was induced by withdrawing the thread, the animals were then sacrificed after 24 h. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (Forene, Abbott, Germany) for induction and maintained on 1.5% in a 70%/30% mixture of N<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub> administered via a face mask. The rectal temperature was maintained at 37 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C with a homeothermic blanket system. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was recorded in all animals using laser Doppler flowmetry (Perimed, J&#x000e4;rf&#x000e4;la, Sweden) in which a fiberoptic probe placed over the MCA territory 2 mm posterior and 6 mm lateral of the bregma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">(12)</xref>. After ventral midline neck incision, the left common and external carotid arteries were ligated. The internal carotid artery (ICA) was temporarily clipped with a microvascular clip (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany), and a silicon-coated 8-0 nylon monofilament (Ethicon, Johnson&#x00026;Johnson, Norderstedt, Belgium) was gently advanced into the ICA. The baseline rCBF values were reduced by &#x0003e;70%. The tip diameter of the thread was selected to match the body weight of the animals. After surgery, the laser Doppler probes were removed, and mice were allowed to wake up and return to their cages. Reperfusion was initiated by withdrawing the thread under short inhalation anesthesia. At the end of the reperfusion period, the mice were sacrificed in deep anesthesia by transcardial perfusion with cold isotonic saline solution containing bovine serum albumin (5 g/L), heparin (10 IU/L) and 2 mL nitroprusside sodium (100 &#x000b5;L, 18 mg in 10 mL saline) solution. Brains were removed, and the skull base was inspected for hemorrhage. In addition, four sham-operated mice underwent the same surgical procedures, but in these mice the filament was only introduced into the common carotid artery; this does not lead to brain infarction. The neurological outcome was defined in all animals according to Garcia et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">(7)</xref>. It is defined by a sequence of six physiological tasks: (i) spontaneous activity, (ii) symmetry in the movement, (iii) forepaw outstretching, (iv) climbing, (v) body proprioception, and (vi) response to vibrissae touch. The overall score is 18 points. In all surgical procedures and following experiments the investigators were blinded as to the experimental groups individual mice belonged to.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of frozen sections</title><p>Frozen sections of 10-&#x000b5;m thickness were collected on pre-labeled glass slides at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C.

For Western blotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), frozen coronal sections were prepared, Nissl-stained and divided using a scalpel and a dissecting microscope into three regions, that is, necrotic infarct area (N), ipsilateral non-necrotic hemisphere (I), and contralateral hemisphere (C) to detect different progressions of the damage in dependence on the injury distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Histology after middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1-h ischemia and 24-h reperfusion time</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Nissl-stained sections at the level of the bregma, the maximal extent of the infarct in <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice.

To calculate the infarct and hemispheric volumes, the method described by Kloss et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref> was used. Briefly, Nissl-stained consecutive sections with 500-&#x000b5;m clearance were digitized using a flatbed scanner (Epson, Meerbusch, Germany). The files were imported into Optimas imaging software, the lesions and hemispheres delineated, and the size converted into the metric system. Next, partial volumes between two adjacent sections were computed using the formula for a conic section: <disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bpa0017-0174-mu1.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula> with area <sub>1,2,3, &#x02026; n&#x02212;1</sub> being the partial area of the lesion of the serial sections. The total hemisphere volumes were calculated equally and finally the ratio of infarct volume vs. the total hemispheric volume was defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR)</title><p>Immediately prior to RNA isolation, slides containing frozen sections were fixed in 75% ethanol for 45 s and Nissl-stained. Subsequently, the slides were dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions for 5 s each and air-dried. RNA isolation from Nissl-stained sections was performed by using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Briefly, materials in particular brain regions (N, I and C) as described above were scraped and lysed with buffer RLT. Materials in a particular region from eight sections each animal were pooled and RNAs isolated according to the protocol recommended by Qiagen. The quantity of RNA was assessed using the NanoDrop&#x000ae; ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA).</p><p>Four hundred nanograms of RNA was used to make single-stranded cDNAs (Superscript II; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Using 2 &#x000b5;L diluted cDNA (1:10), real-time quantitative PCR was carried out with Faststart Plus DNA Master SYBR Green I on LightCycler (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) under the following conditions: 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes for a hot start, followed by denaturing at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 s, annealing at 57&#x000b0;C for 5 s, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 s for 45 cycles.

Afterwards, nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked with 10% normal goat serum followed by incubation of the respective primary antibody. For PrP staining in <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, an antiserum purified from a rabbit immunized against recombinant full-length mouse PrP was used (CDC1), whereas 1A8, an antiserum purified from a rabbit immunized against the C-terminal domain (amino acids 89&#x02013;234) of mouse PrP was used in C4/&#x02212; mice. The polyclonal antibody Actin I-19 against &#x003b2;-actin was obtained from Santa Cruz (Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). The primary antibody was detected by a biotinylated secondary antibody and enhanced by streptavidin alkaline phosphatase complexes. Visualization of immunoreactivity followed by using Fast Red or DAB as the chromogen. Counterstaining followed with hemalaun. For immunofluorescence staining, a streptavidin CY3 conjugate was used instead of streptavidin alkaline phosphatase complexes. The nuclei were counterstained with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride and slides were covered in aqueous solution. Staining of paraffin sections was performed after deparaffinizing the sections in xylene.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>The process was performed as described in our previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">(18)</xref>. According to the size, different regions (N, I and C) on the Nissl-stained coronal frozen sections were solubilized by adding 5 &#x000b5;L of lysis buffer (with 2% SDS and 0.5 M DTT) on N, 10 &#x000b5;L on I and 15 &#x000b5;L on C. Identical regions were solubilized in the same volumes of buffer in sham-operated animals. In five animals without surgery the brains were perfused to obtain calibration measurements. The solubilized tissue was transferred to reaction tubes and digested with PNGase according to the standard protocol of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Digestion was stopped by the addition of modified Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 10 minutes. Five microliters of each sample was subjected to Western blotting. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). After short blocking, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies, 6H4 (Prionics, Schlieren, Switzerland) and Actin I-19 (Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), separately, over night. After incubation with primary antibody, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies, coupled to alkaline phosphatase (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany).</p><p>The complete process was performed with exact timing of the individual steps and at a constant temperature to reach maximum accuracy. For quantification of relative signal intensities, each Western blot contained a dilution series of a standard protein with known concentration. Intensity measurements were done with Total Lab V 2.01 software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). The Western blots of actin were used as a reference.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software system (SPSS for Windows, Version 9.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Severe swelling of the affected hemisphere with a corresponding midline shift was noticed. Clearly delineated lesions in the ischemic hemisphere were found in all animals after 24 h of reperfusion.

We found a decrease in <italic>Prnp</italic> expression in the lesion area while the infarct-free region around the lesion of the ipsilateral hemisphere showed a significant increase. A slight but nonsignificant increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> mRNA levels was found in the contralateral hemisphere. The decrease of PrP<sup>C</sup> mRNA levels in the necrotic area is readily explained by the large number of dying cells in this area. The up-regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> mRNA levels in the area adjacent to the infarct may be triggered by local oxidative damage and other metabolic derangements in this area; this would be in keeping with <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses showing a correlation between PrP expression and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">(3)</xref>.

In this study we detected an increased degradation of PrP<sup>C</sup> FL to its breakdown product C1 in the area surrounding the infarct and in the contralateral hemisphere in <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mouse brains. This finding is in agreement with Mang&#x000e9;&#x02019;s postulation of increased PrP<sup>C</sup> degradation under oxidative conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">(20)</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that PrP<sup>C</sup> overexpression increases the chances for neuronal survival under the conditions of oxidative stress while lack of PrP<sup>C</sup> facilitates cell death. However, the cascade may be more complex; volumetric analyses of mouse brains overexpressing PrP<sup>C</sup> (tga20 line) did not show enhanced neuroprotection compared with wild-type control animals after ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">(31)</xref>. Disproportionate availability of downstream ligands may have an impact on the neuroprotective ability of PrP. A number of proteins, for example, the neuronal cell adhesion molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">(29)</xref>, the stress-inducible protein 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">(19)</xref> or the laminin receptor and laminin receptor precursor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">(8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11)</xref>, have been postulated as potential interaction partners. It is also possible that PrP acts as a regulator of cytosolic signaling pathways. Increased activity of cell signaling factors involved in cell survival and apoptosis such as ERK-1/-2, STAT-1 and caspase-3 were found in <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">(31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38)</xref>.

PI3K signaling increased the survival chances of PrP<sup>C</sup>-expressing cells. PI3K has been shown to be sensitive to redox signaling by superoxide and hydrogen peroxide and to be activated by copper ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>. This effect may be mediated or initiated by PrP. In our experiments this interaction could not be initiated by PrP lacking the octapeptide and flanking amino acids (PrP&#x00394;32&#x02013;93). Other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">(36)</xref> have demonstrated that the octapeptide repeat region of PrP<sup>C</sup> is required for reactive oxygen species-mediated &#x003b2; cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> and cells lacking the octapeptide region are more susceptible to oxidative stress.</p><p>As our previous cell culture experiments pointed towards the neuroprotective effect of the N-terminal octapeptide repeat region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">(5)</xref> we were interested to investigate this effect <italic>in vivo</italic> using the established focal ischemia model.

In accordance with these findings Bounhar et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">(2)</xref> demonstrated that PrP<sup>C</sup> potently inhibits Bax-induced cell death in human primary neurons and while the deletion of four octapeptide repeats of PrP<sup>C</sup> completely eliminates the neuroprotective effect of PrP<sup>C</sup>, PrP lacking the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor signal peptide remains anti-apoptotic.</p><p>On the other hand the N-terminal octapeptide region of PrP<sup>C</sup> has been shown to bind copper in a cooperative manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">(1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34)</xref>. The most obvious train of arguments would invoke the copper-binding ability of PrP<sup>C</sup> and its involvement in cell signaling, oxidative stress and the contribution to cell survival under stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>. PrP<sup>C</sup> does not seem to be involved in copper transport at the synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">(10)</xref>. Thus it would appear that PrP<sup>C</sup> is a sensor for oxidative stress, which may function in conjunction with copper binding to the N-terminal octarepeat.</p><p>Sequence analysis by Chen et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4)</xref> first detected a glycosylated, cell membrane-anchored major product, designated C1 that is generated by a cleavage at position 111/112 (&#x003b1; cleavage), as well as an additional fragment longer than C1, termed C2 which is created by &#x003b2; cleavage. These cleaving processes seem to be copper dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">(32)</xref>. Interestingly, our Western blotting analyses showed that in C4/&#x02212; mice there is an increase of the &#x003b1; cleavage in ischemic brain regions compared with sham-operated C4/&#x02212; control animals. This finding indicates that the C1 fragment is not likely to be linked to the neuroprotective function of PrP<sup>C</sup>. Furthermore, in agreement with Watt and Hooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">(36)</xref> no fragments at about 21.1 kDa corresponding to the C2 cleavage products were detectable in C4/&#x02212; mice. As the &#x003b2; site is located in the octapeptide repeat region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">(22)</xref>, the absence of a &#x003b2; cleavage in the octapeptide repeat region and its breakdown products in C4/&#x02212; mice must be expected. In accordance with our data, McMahon et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">(22)</xref> found a decrease of PrP<sup>C</sup> FL and an increase of amino-terminally fragmented PrP<sup>C</sup> in cells under oxidative stress. Furthermore they reported that the octapeptide repeat region of PrP<sup>C</sup> undergoes a site-specific copper- and pH-dependent cleavage, which has vast implications for further proteolysis.</p><p>Mang&#x000e9; and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">(20)</xref> argued that PrP<sup>C</sup> is first cleaved at the &#x003b2; site in the octapeptide region and near the histidine in position 96, followed by a rapid second cleavage in the &#x003b1; site, which inactivates the biological active form of PrP cleaved at the &#x003b2; site. This is in line with data of our experiments, where bands corresponding to the C2 fragments appeared to decrease in <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>+/+</sup> ischemic mouse brains, whereas an increase of bands corresponding to the C1 fragments was visible compared with <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>+/+</sup> sham controls. In mice expressing PrP&#x00394;32&#x02013;93 remarkably stronger bands representing the C1 fragments were detectable in ischemic brain areas compared with C4/&#x02212; sham controls as well. Although C4/&#x02212; mice express 1.5 times more PrP than wild-type mice and show an increase of C1 fragments under oxidative stress conditions, they fail to rescue the <italic>Prnp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> phenotype. Therefore our findings show that mice expressing PrP&#x00394;32&#x02013;93 were able to provide C1 terminal fragments independent of previous cleavage at the &#x003b2; site in the octapeptide region but the C1 fragments have no protective role.</p><p>Taken together our data support the hypothesis that absence of cleavage at the &#x003b2; site, which is possibly facilitated by copper binding, is associated with loss of PrP<sup>C</sup> function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by EU NeuroPrion (FOOD-CT-2004-506579).
