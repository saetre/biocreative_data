The disease is characterized by an inability of the functional &#x003b2;-cell mass to meet chronically increased metabolic demands for insulin, as occurring under variable states of insulin resistance. The normal &#x003b2;-cell population can adapt to a sustained stimulation by recruiting &#x003b2;-cells into a higher translational and insulin synthetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>) and possibly by an expansion of its total cell number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). The molecular mechanisms involved in this chronic adaptation of the &#x003b2;-cell population are not completely understood. Several reports have highlighted the importance of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) signaling in &#x003b2;-cell physiology. For example, glucose stimulates the insulin gene promoter activity via a cascade involving PI 3-kinase. Indeed, glucose triggers phosphorylation of PDX-1 via the PI 3-kinase pathway, which induces nuclear translocation of PDX-1, and the latter then increases insulin gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Furthermore, glucose promotes &#x003b2;-cell survival through the PI 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PKB) cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Different actors of the PI 3-kinase cascade have been identified as critical control points in insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>), among them 3&#x02032;-phosphoinositide&#x02013;dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). This kinase was initially recognized by its ability to phosphorylate in the presence of lipid products generated by PI 3-kinase, the activation loop of PKB on Thr-308 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). The role of PDK1 in vivo has been addressed in different organisms by genetic deletion of PDK1 homologs. In short, knockout studies revealed a central role of PDK1 in regulation of cell growth and organ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Importantly, PDK1 ablation in &#x003b2;-cells induces diabetes consecutively to a reduction in &#x003b2;-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of microRNAs has opened an entirely new line of thoughts regarding the regulation of signaling by growth factors and hormones and its perturbations in situations associated to disease processes. MicroRNAs are 21- to 25-nucleotide&#x02013;long noncoding RNA molecules first identified as regulators of the level of several proteins in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Currently, hundreds of microRNAs have been cloned in mammalian species, i.e., 285 in rats, 442 in mice, and 533 in humans. They are collectively annotated and indexed in the microRNA registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk">http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>). Remarkably, some microRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, heralding important biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Another feature of several microRNAs is their time- and tissue-specific expression, which points to their role in development and organ function. Since their discovery in 1993 by Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>), a growing list of pleiotropic effects of microRNAs has appeared. Indeed, microRNAs have been shown to regulate development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) and metabolism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). More recently, they have been implicated in mammals in adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>), lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>) and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>) development, and &#x003b2;-cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>).</p><p>Here, we were interested in identifying microRNAs targeting molecules involved in insulin signaling in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. Using computational analysis, we found that miR-375, previously described as decreasing glucose-induced insulin secretion and characterized by pancreas-specific expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>), targets PDK1, a key player in the PI 3-kinase cascade. By gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we found that miR-375 regulates PDK1 protein level, resulting in modulation of glucose-stimulatory action on insulin gene expression and DNA synthesis. We showed that miR-375 interacts directly with the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of PDK1 mRNA. Furthermore, exposure of either INS-1E cells or freshly isolated rat islets to glucose modulates endogenous miR-375 precursor levels, suggesting its involvement in regulation of glucose responsiveness of &#x003b2;-cells. Finally, miR-375 expression is found to be decreased in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats compared with Wistar rats.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfections.</title><p>INS-1E &#x003b2;-cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 11 mmol/l glucose supplemented with 10&#x00025; (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, 2 mmol/l <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 10 mmol/l HEPES, 1 mmol/l sodium pyruvate, and 50 &#x003bc;mol/l &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol in humidified 5&#x00025; (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>, 95&#x00025; (vol/vol) air at 37&#x000b0;C and used between passages 50 and 75.

One of the predicted targets for miR-375 is PDK1. The predicted miR-375 binding site in the 3&#x02032;UTR of PDK1 mRNA (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) appears to be phylogenetically maintained. This would suggest that the function of miR-375 as potential regulator of PDK1 has been conserved in mice, rats, and humans. To investigate whether miR-375 affects PDK1, plasmids driving the expression of miR-375 precursor (pmiR-375) or control (pNeg) were transfected in INS-1E cells. pmiR-375 increased miR-375 precursor levels by &#x0223c;500-fold, as assayed by real-time PCR (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Functional analysis shows that miR-375 precursor overexpression in INS-1E cells results in a reduction of &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of PDK1 protein (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>) without affecting its mRNA level (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>), indicating that miR-375 acts as a translational repressor. To evaluate whether the predicted miR-375 target site in the 3&#x02032;UTR of PDK1 mRNA was directly involved in miR-375&#x02013;induced reduction in PDK1 protein, we cloned the putative 3&#x02032;UTR target site downstream of a luciferase reporter gene and cotransfected this <italic>p</italic>-Luc-3&#x02032;UTR PDK1 construct into INS-1E cells with pmiR-375 or pNeg. Luciferase activity of cells transfected with pmiR-375 and <italic>p</italic>-Luc-3&#x02032;UTR PDK1 was decreased by &#x0223c;25&#x00025; compared with cells cotransfected with control pNeg and <italic>p</italic>-Luc-3&#x02032;UTR PDK1 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>). With negative control constructs <italic>p</italic>-Luc-Empty and <italic>p</italic>-Luc-3&#x02032;UTR MUT PDK1, no reduced luciferase activity was observed when cells were cotransfected with pmiR-375 compared with pNeg. Taken together, our data argue for a direct interaction between miR-375 and PDK1 mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>miR-375 decreases insulin signaling downstream of PDK1.</title><p>The PI 3-kinase/PDK1/PKB signaling pathway is used by insulin in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells to elicit several actions of the hormone. It is generally believed that after insulin stimulation of cells, PDK1 is recruited to the plasma membrane and phosphorylates PKB on Thr-308, which becomes activated and phosphorylates a series of substrates, including GSK3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;. Downregulation of PDK1 in &#x003b2;-cells is expected to cause a decrease in insulin-induced signaling dependent on this particular enzyme. To study the effect of miR-375 on insulin signaling, we examined the phosphorylation state of molecules functioning downstream of PDK1. Immunoblot analysis showed that in response to insulin, PKB phosphorylation on Thr-308 is less abundant in cells overexpressing miR-375 precursor compared with control cells (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Consistent with this latter observation, ectopic expression of miR-375 precursor also reduces insulin-induced phosphorylation of GSK3&#x003b2; (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>miR-375 decreases glucose-induced insulin gene expression and DNA synthesis.</title><p>Because PI 3-kinase signaling has been implicated in glucose-induced upregulation of insulin gene expression and because we found that miR-375 decreases PDK1 protein, we examined the impact of miR-375 on insulin gene expression in response to glucose in INS-1E cells. We found that, as expected, high glucose concentration (20 mmol/l) induced insulin gene expression in control cells, but this effect was lost in cells overexpressing pre-miR-375 (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). To test whether PDK1 is involved in the glucose-induced increase in cell proliferative activity, we analyzed the impact of miR-375 on cellular &#x0005b;<italic>methyl-</italic><sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;thymidine incorporation. As illustrated in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, the stimulatory effect of glucose on DNA synthesis was reduced by &#x0223c;50&#x00025; when miR-375 precursor was overexpressed.</p></sec><sec><title>miR-375 attenuates cell viability and proliferation.</title><p>Because the PI 3-kinase/PKB cascade has been involved in cell survival and proliferation, we investigated the consequences of miR-375 expression on cell viability and proliferation. Thus, INS-1E cells were transfected with pmiR-375 or pNeg, and 48 h after transfection, cell number and viability were measured. We found that miR-375 overexpression reduced cell number by &#x0223c;25&#x00025; (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) and cell viability by &#x0223c;20&#x00025; (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). To further determine the effects of miR-375 on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis was measured using &#x0005b;<italic>methyl-</italic><sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;thymidine incorporation. As shown in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, transfection with miR-375 precursor inhibited INS-1E cell proliferative activity by 20&#x00025; compared with control cells.</p></sec><sec><title>2&#x02032;<italic>-O-</italic>methyl-miR-375 increases PDK1 protein level and glucose-stimulatory action on insulin mRNA and DNA synthesis.</title><p>Because miR-375 targets PDK1 and impairs glucose-stimulated insulin gene expression and cell proliferation, we investigated whether antisense oligonucleotides of miR-375 induce effects opposite to those seen after miR-375 overexpression. Using 2&#x02032;<italic>-O-</italic>methyl-miR-375 antisense oligonucleotides, we found that blocking miR-375 augments PDK1 protein. This increase reaches &#x0223c;40&#x00025; when cells are transfected with either 250 or 500 nmol/l 2&#x02032;<italic>-O-</italic>methyl-miR-375 (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>).

Using quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>), we found that miR-375 precursor is negatively regulated by glucose. Indeed, 11 and 22 mmol/l glucose induce a decrease of &#x0223c;60 and 70&#x00025;, respectively, in miR-375 precursor levels compared with 5.5 mmol/l glucose (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). To look at whether this glucose effect was limited to miR-375, we measured the level of three other microRNAs expressed in INS-1E cells. In contrast to miR-375, both miR-296 and miR-9 are positively regulated by prolonged glucose treatment. Indeed, glucose leads to a concentration-dependent increase in miR-296 precursor (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>), whereas miR-9 precursor is robustly increased after cell exposure to 11 mmol/l glucose. At higher glucose concentration, miR-9 expression tends to decline but remains higher compared with low glucose (5.5 mmol/l) condition (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). Finally, miR-122, which presents a specific liver expression, is detected in INS-1E cells, but glucose does not modulate its expression (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The levels of miR-375 and PDK1 are inversely correlated in glucose-stimulated INS-1E cells.</title><p>To further document the role of miR-375, we analyzed the expression of premiR-375 in INS-1E cells treated for 1 or 24 h with 2 or 20 mmol/l glucose. We found that glucose induces a robust decrease in miR-375 after 1 and 24 h (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, immunoblot analyses show that PDK1 protein level is slightly, but not significantly, increased within 1 h of glucose treatment (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>). Remarkably, in INS-1E cells exposed for 24 h to 20 mmol/l glucose, PDK1 protein is increased (fourfold), and its level thus inversely correlates with that of miR-375 (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>). Finally, decreased miR-375 without change in PDK1 level seen after 1 h of glucose treatment occurs with enhanced insulin gene expression (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>E</italic></xref>). Decreased miR-375 and increased PDK1 levels are associated with enhanced DNA synthesis as reflected by increased thymidine incorporation seen within 24 h of glucose treatment (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>F</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Glucose regulates miR-375 expression in freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets.</title><p>To characterize the glucose-mediated miR-375 regulation, we analyzed the expression level of miR-375 precursor in isolated rat islets that had been exposed to 5, 10, or 20 mmol/l glucose for 2- or 72-h periods, which represent conditions in which the acute and chronic influences, respectively, of glucose can be studied. After 2 h at stimulatory glucose concentrations (10 or 20 mmol/l), miR-375 expression is lower than in the basal 5 mmol/l condition (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). After 72 h, a lower expression level was measured at 5 mmol/l than at 10 and 20 mmol/l, whereas the level at 20 mmol/l tended to be lower than at 10 mmol/l (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced miR-375 expression in freshly isolated islets from diabetic GK rats.</title><p>To study miR-375 expression under in vivo conditions of hyperglycemia, we analyzed islets from diabetic GK rats. We found that miR-375 is downregulated in diabetic GK rats compared with control Wistar rats (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>C</italic></xref>). Furthermore, in GK rats, this decrease in miR-375 expression is associated with a modest, albeit not significant, increase in insulin mRNA level (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>E</italic></xref>). Finally, the expression of miR-124a2, which has been involved in insulin mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>), is upregulated in GK rats (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>During recent years, microRNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell fate and metabolism. Although several microRNAs have been implicated in a variety of disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>), only a few have been linked to insulin signaling and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Using either a gain- or loss-of-function approach, we show here in a pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell line that miR-375, previously described to reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion by inhibiting <italic>Mtpn</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>), is able to downregulate PDK1 protein by interfering directly with its mRNA. By targeting PDK1, a key player in the PI 3-kinase signaling cascade, miR-375 decreases insulin-induced phosphorylation of PKB and GSK3, both acting downstream of PDK1.</p><p>It is interesting to mention that pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell specific PDK1 knockout in mice results in a reduced number and size of &#x003b2;-cells, and in decreased islet density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). These data and ours are intriguing in the context of a report showing that miR-375 knockout by morpholinos in zebrafish embryos leads to defects in the development of pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that inhibition of the PI 3-kinase cascade dampens glucose-induced insulin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). To document the biological role of miR-375 as an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase signaling downstream of PDK1, we analyzed the effect of miR-375 overexpression or depletion on glucose-induced insulin gene expression. Our findings that miR-375 controls insulin gene expression stimulated by glucose are consistent with the notion that the PI 3-kinase cascade is important for glucose stimulatory action on insulin gene expression. A chief observation of our study is that microRNA expression seems to be glucose sensitive. Importantly, the increased insulin gene expression seen in INS-1E cells exposed to high glucose is associated with reduced expression of miR-375 precursor. Our in silico analysis (data not shown) reveals that miR-375 is located in an intergenic region between cryba2 and Ccdc108 genes on the mouse chromosome 1. Comparison of genomic sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecrbrowser.decode.org/">http://ecrbrowser.decode.org/</ext-link>) across humans, mice, and rats shows that a 5-kb genomic region downstream of the miR-375 precursor contains highly conserved elements. Moreover, according to a recent publication, several regions located downstream and upstream of the miR-375 gene interact with NeuroD1/BETA2 and PDX-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). Taken together, these facts suggest that the gene encoding for miR-375 may behave as a locus controlled by its own promoter.</p><p>Although glucose decreased miR-375 expression within 1 h in INS-1E cells, a longer exposure time was needed to observe the downstream stimulatory effect on PDK1 protein expression. This suggests that miR-375 suppresses synthesis of PDK1 protein. Interestingly, prolonged glucose exposure of INS-1E cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>) has been shown to increase insulin receptor substrate 2 gene expression, protein localization to the plasma membrane, and PKB phosphorylation. These observations together with ours indicate that in INS-1E cells, glucose induces a decrease in miR-375 followed by an increase in PDK1 protein and an activation of the PI 3-kinase cascade and, hence, &#x003b2;-cell proliferation.</p><p>Glucose was also found to regulate miR-375 expression in primary islet tissue. A 2-h incubation was used to measure levels in freshly isolated rat islets at glucose concentrations known to have exerted dose-dependent stimulations of their metabolic, secretory, and protein biosynthetic activities. We found miR-375 expression to be lower at 10 and 20 mmol/l than at 5 mmol/l glucose, which is similar to the effect seen in INS-1E cells. The 72-h culture condition compares expression in islets that have maintained this functional responsiveness (10 and 20 mmol/l glucose during culture) with that in islets having lost this responsiveness and showing increased susceptibility to apoptosis (5 mmol/l glucose during culture) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). Expression of miR-375 is lower in islets showing viability consequences of prolonged glucose deprivation; it is unknown whether this reduction participates in the apoptotic pathway and can be interpreted in light of a report showing that miR-375 knockout by morpholinos in zebrafish leads to defects in islet development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). When comparing functionally competent islets cultured at control (10 mmol/l) versus elevated (20 mmol/l) glucose concentrations, miR-375 levels appeared lower after prolonged glucose hyperactivation (20 mmol/l). Islets isolated from diabetic GK rats exhibited a lower miR-375 expression than islets from Wistar rats, which can be considered as further evidence for the suppressing effect of supraphysiological glucose concentrations. Such reduced miR-375 level is expected to be associated with increased insulin mRNA, but this was not the case in GK rats, suggesting a possible failure of the PDK1/PKB cascade to increase insulin gene expression. On the other hand, expression of miR-124a2, previously described as inhibiting insulin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>), is upregulated in GK islets. Hence, we speculate that the antagonizing actions of miR-124a2 and miR-375 are counterbalanced, resulting in an unchanged insulin mRNA level in GK islets. An alternative explanation is that the lower expression in GK islets results from a prolonged intracellular deprivation of glucose signals, as in the case of the islets cultured in 5 mmol/l glucose for 72 h that progress to apoptosis.</p><p>According to recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>), total &#x003b2;-cell mass is reduced in patients and animals with type 2 diabetes and contributes to the disease process. Notably, &#x003b2;-cell&#x02013;specific PDK1 knockout in mice leads to diabetes as a result of a reduction in &#x003b2;-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Another in vitro study reported that decreased PDK1 in human glioblastoma cells obtained with antisense oligonucleotides or with RNA interference blocks cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). Here, we find that miR-375 downregulates PDK1 by directly targeting PDK1 mRNA and may therefore impact on cell proliferation given its key role in the PI 3-kinase/PKB cascade. In this context, several studies have revealed dysregulations in microRNA expression in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>), suggesting that microRNAs may act on cell proliferation. More directly related to our work, recent studies show that miR-375 is decreased in pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). Our results point to a similar antiproliferative action of miR-375, because we found that miR-375 attenuates cell viability and proliferation.</p><p>A first key finding of our work is that miR-375 is regulated by glucose, which is the central molecule in islet metabolism and physiology. A second important observation is that miR-375 inhibits glucose-induced INS-1E cell proliferation. This result is particularly interesting in the context of diabetes. Although a distinct disease process is responsible for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, in both cases, &#x003b2;-cell failure occurs. Developing new approaches to induce &#x003b2;-cells to replicate is a supereminent goal in diabetes research. Our data presented here reveal the pancreatic islet-specific microRNA, miR-375, as an important regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin gene expression and proliferation of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. Taking into account the fact that miR-375 also decreases insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>), miR-375 emerges as a target that should be prioritized to enhance islet function and to combat &#x003b2;-cell failure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>A.E.O. has received a PhD fellowship from la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (France).
