We present evidence that the non-core domain of recombination activating gene (RAG) protein 2 is involved in the regulation of recombinatorial order. In mice lacking the non-core domain of RAG2 the ordered rearrangement is disturbed and direct V to D rearrangements are 10- to 1000-times increased in tri-partite immune gene loci. Some forms of inter-chromosomal translocations between TCR&#x003b2; and TCR&#x003b4; D gene segments are also increased in the core RAG2 animals as compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts. In addition, the concise use of proper recombination signal sequences (RSSs) appears to be disturbed in the core RAG2 mice as compared with WT RAG2 animals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Variable exons of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes are assembled during lymphoid development by a tightly regulated and highly ordered series of site-specific DNA recombination reactions known as V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This process is essential for adaptive immunity. The first step in this reaction is performed by recombination activating gene (RAG) proteins 1 and 2 that specifically bind to a pair of recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that flank each variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segment. RSSs consist of a conserved heptamer and nonamer separated by either 12 or 23 bp of non-conserved spacer DNA. Only gene segments flanked by dissimilar RSSs can rearrange with one another (the 12/23 rule). In the <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> loci that contain these three different types of gene segments, D to J rearrangement almost invariably occurs first, then a V gene segment rearranges to the initial DJ recombinant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>A and B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The direct rearrangement of a V segment to an unrearranged D segment does occur but at a very low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Where permissible (following the 12/23 rule) D-to-J rearrangement occurs by deletion far more often than by inversion. In the TCR&#x003b2; locus, only deletions are permitted as the D&#x003b2; gene segments have 5&#x02032; RSS-12 and 3&#x02032; RSS-23 signals, and J&#x003b2; segments have RSS-12. In the <italic>IgH</italic> locus, however, DH gene segments have RSS-12 signals both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; of the coding segment so that D&#x02013;J or V&#x02013;D rearrangements can occur either by a deletional or inversional mechanism.</p><p>Mechanisms that enforce the ordered assembly of these tripartite loci remain unknown. One possibility is that V gene RSSs are inaccessible to the recombinase while D-to-J rearrangement is occurring. This cannot be the entire explanation, however, since V gene segments often bypass one or several intervening D gene segments while rearranging to a downstream DJ allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Another hypothesis is that 3&#x02032; of D segment RSSs are inherently better or stronger signals, thus favoring the D-to-J events over V-to-D events. This too fails to explain why the V gene segments, which are fully accessible to the recombination mechanism, favor the rearranged DJ segments rather than one of the intervening unrearranged D gene segments. Conceivably, the 5&#x02032; of D RSS becomes available to the recombinase only after the 3&#x02032; RSS has been deleted by D-to-J rearrangement. It is also possible that V gene segments have no preference for rearrangement and recombine with either unrearranged or rearranged D segments, but that only V gene segments that rearrange with DJ recombinants are ever fixed into the cell's genome by <italic>IgH</italic> or TCR&#x003b2; chain selection. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>PCR amplification of direct V-to-D rearrangements obtained from splenocyte genomic DNA purified from WT and cR2 mice.

RAG1 contains the so-called DDE motif, the catalytic triad of amino acids used by recombinases of this type, as well as the RSS binding domain of the V(D)J recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). While RAG2 is necessary for recombinase activity, its precise role remains uncertain. The carboxy-terminal third of the protein is dispensable for catalytic activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, but is highly conserved through evolution. Recent reports suggest that it is capable of specific interaction with histone proteins leading these workers to suggest a role for RAG2 in regulation of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). To probe the function of the dispensable domain, we and others have engineered targeted mutant mice that express only the core domain of RAG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We reported previously that the core-RAG2 mutant (cR2) mouse shows a partial block in B- and T-cell development corresponding to a defect in V-to-DJ rearrangement in the <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Independent investigations revealed a defect in the precision of signal joint formation during V-to-DJ rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) as well as increased hybrid joint formation (an inversion of the RSS-ended excised reaction byproduct) in the setting of a p53 DNA repair deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the non-core domain of RAG2 may be involved in the ordering of rearrangement in tripartite loci.</p><p>To begin to explore these issues, we undertook an investigation into the <italic>in vivo</italic> frequencies of direct V to (germline) D, D-to-J and complete VDJ rearrangements in <italic>cR2</italic> and wild-type (WT) mice. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is ideal for determining the frequency of gene segment recombination events as the primers can be placed on different gene segments and only recombination of those specific segments permits amplification. Using this simple approach, we found that the frequency of direct V-to-D recombination events in WT mice was at least five orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding V-to-DJ event in the <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> and <italic>IgH</italic> loci in various tissues. Surprisingly, direct V-to-D rearrangement was 10- to 1000-fold more frequent in <italic>cR2</italic> mice. In addition, we report that the VD coding joints formed in <italic>cR2</italic> mice display abnormal sequence properties and can involve interchromosomal rearrangements between distinct antigen receptor loci. Our data suggest that the non-core domain of RAG2 is responsible for enforcing ordered rearrangements in the tripartite antigen receptor loci and suppressing chromosomal translocations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals and DNA collection</title><p>WT B6 and heterozygous and homozygous <italic>cR2</italic> mice (backcrossed to B6 for more than 10 generations) were analyzed at approximately 1 month of age.

Splenocytes and bone marrow lymphocyte populations were obtained in a similar manner. DNA was purified by proteinase K digestion in the presence of 0.5% SDS, RNAse treatment, phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.

PCR reactions (25 &#x003bc;l) contained 30 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 0.75 U JumpStart Taq polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and up to 1000 ng of genomic DNA template. Primary reaction mixtures were heated to 94&#x000b0;C for 10 min and cycled 20- to 25-times (95&#x000b0;C for 20 s then 65&#x000b0;C for 1 min), with a final 7-min extension at 72&#x000b0;C. A secondary reaction, programmed with 1 &#x003bc;l of the completed primary reaction, used a set of nested primers and was cycled 25- to 30-times with an increased annealing/extension temperature of 68&#x000b0;C. Completed reactions were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time qPCR</title><p>Primer and probe sets were manually designed following the design guidelines set by Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA. In all cases, the forward primer and Taqman hydrolysis probe were complementary to groups of V gene segments. Reverse primers were complementary to sequences 3&#x02032; of various D gene segments, and thus were specific for direct V-to-D rearrangements. Other reverse primers anneal 3&#x02032; of various J gene segments and were used to detect complete VDJ rearrangements. A final set of reverse primers was designed to detect germline V gene segments in order to provide absolute standard curves using DNA from a non-rearranging RAG2 null cell line, 63-12. The V-to-D and V-to-DJ rearrangement frequencies were calibrated using those standard curves. DNA concentration and quality were verified using a real-time PCR assay that detects genomic DNA from the APRT locus. All rearrangement assay results were normalized by dividing by the amount of DNA determined by the APRT assay.

Stained nuclei were sorted by high-speed flow cytometry (MoFlo, Backman-Coulter; Fullerton, CA) and two discrete populations of cells were obtained reflecting either 2C or 4C DNA content. High molecular weight genomic DNA was then purified as above and LM-PCR was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

These PCR products were cloned and subjected to sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A similar PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) was carried with nested V<sub>H</sub>101 primers and a primer located just 3&#x02032; of DFL16.1 in the <italic>IgH</italic> locus, and the products cloned and sequenced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The sizes of the PCR products from the <italic>cR2</italic> mice appeared more diverse than those from WT mice for both the <italic>IgH</italic> and TCR&#x003b2; loci. Sequence analysis confirmed this difference in fragment diversity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>).

A simple means test revealed that the <italic>cR2</italic> animals (11/28 sequences) were 8-times more likely to create a VD joint that included this heptamer than their WT counterparts (1/21 sequences, <italic>P</italic> = 0.016). Limited sequencing of direct V-to-D rearrangement events involving other V gene segments failed to show such heptamer inclusions (data not shown). When examining V-to-D events that utilized the D&#x003b2;1 coding segment, we found that <italic>cR2</italic> animals (11/13 sequences) were also 8 times more likely to delete the entire D&#x003b2;1 coding segment as compared with WT animals (1/9 sequences, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0013). Inclusion of the V&#x003b2;8 heptamer occurred more frequently in joints that also displayed deletion of D&#x003b2;1 in <italic>cR2</italic> (6/13 sequences) but not WT (1/9 sequences) animals. When D&#x003b2;2 coding segments were rearranged, we found no inclusion of the V&#x003b2;8 heptamer in WT, but its inclusion was found four times in <italic>cR2</italic> animals. In stark contrast to D&#x003b2;1, D&#x003b2;2 was never deleted in either WT or <italic>cR2</italic> animals. It is possible that the <italic>cR2</italic> recombinase is recognizing the V&#x003b2;8 RSS heptamer in an opposite orientation, using a nonamer-like DNA sequence within the coding region to form an RSS-12 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). This could result in an aberrant rearrangement event consisting of a signal joint containing this unusual RSS-12 and the RSS-23 3&#x02032; of D&#x003b2;1. We conclude that the <italic>cR2</italic> recombinase is imprecise in its selection of cleavage sites, suggesting that the non-core domain of RAG2 is important for the fidelity of V(D)J recombination.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequence analysis of V<sub>H</sub>52-to-D<sub>H</sub> rearrangements reveals long <italic>N</italic>-regions in cR2 mice</title><p>We next characterized a set of direct V-to-D PCR products obtained from the spleens of either WT or <italic>cR2</italic> animals using nested primers that amplify products of V<sub>H</sub>Q52-to-DFL16.1 joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). DNA sequence analysis of 22 joints from WT animals and 44 joints from <italic>cR2</italic> animals failed to reveal any V segment heptamer inclusion. We did note, however, that the <italic>N</italic>-regions were significantly longer in the <italic>cR2</italic> animals.

Additionally we noted that the extent of V gene segment sequence deletion (three or more basepairs) in the direct VD coding joints in <italic>cR2</italic> animals (20/44 sequences) as compared with the WT animals (1/22 sequences) was significantly different (proportions test <italic>P</italic> = 0.0007).</p></sec><sec><title>An increased frequency of V-to-D rearrangements in <italic>cR2</italic> mice</title><p>As our sequence analysis suggested a higher frequency of direct V-to-D rearrangements in <italic>cR2</italic> mice, we designed a qPCR method to quantify various V(D)J rearrangements.

We found that the frequency of complete VDJ rearrangements utilizing the V&#x003b2;7 and J&#x003b2;2.7 gene segments is 5-fold higher in the thymus than in splenocytes, likely reflecting the unselected nature of the thymic repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Complete rearrangements in thymocytes from <italic>cR2</italic> mice are just a few fold less frequent than in the WT animals while in the spleen they are slightly more frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Frequency of complete V&#x003b2;7-to-D&#x003b2;-to-J&#x003b2;2.7 and direct V&#x003b2;7-to-D&#x003b2; rearrangements in cR2 and WT mice.

The thymi and spleens of <italic>cR2</italic> mice had readily detectable frequencies of direct VD rearrangements as compared with WT mice, where such events were undetectable with this qPCR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Heterozygous mice had an intermediate frequency of these VD rearrangements. The frequency of complete V(D)J rearrangements involving V&#x003b2;7 and J&#x003b2;2.7 was about 20-times greater than the frequency of direct V&#x003b2;7-to-germline D&#x003b2; rearrangement in the <italic>cR2</italic> mice. Since there are 14 total J&#x003b2; gene segments, we estimate that direct V-to-D rearrangement in cR2 mice is between 100- and 200-fold less frequent than V(D)J rearrangement. A similar quantitative analysis of direct rearrangements of V&#x003b2;2, V&#x003b2;8 and V&#x003b2;14 to germ-line D&#x003b2; gene segments revealed similar patterns (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>).</p><p>We next examined the <italic>IgH</italic> locus for direct V-to-D rearrangements. The heavy chain locus contains a suite of D<sub>H</sub> gene segments followed by a single grouping of four J<sub>H</sub> gene segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Each of the 13 heavy-chain D<sub>H</sub> segments is flanked by two similar RSS-12 sequences permitting rearrangements to occur by either deletion or inversion of the intervening sequences. The frequency of complete rearrangement of V<sub>H</sub>81X-to-D<sub>H</sub>-to-J<sub>H</sub>1 was measured in order to contrast with direct V<sub>H</sub>-to-D<sub>H</sub> rearrangement frequencies. Once again we observed that complete VDJ rearrangement was less frequent in the <italic>cR2</italic> samples. In the thymus, where complete <italic>IgH</italic> rearrangements are thought not to occur in WT mice, we were able to detect such rearrangements in <italic>cR2</italic> animals but not in their WT counterparts. The frequencies of direct V-to-D rearrangements that occur by deletion were examined in three tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). For all three tissues, the <italic>cR2</italic> mice had at least 10-fold higher levels of direct VD rearrangement than did WT mice. For the bone marrow samples, more than a 1000-fold difference was observed. Again the heterozygous animals had an intermediate level of direct VD rearrangements. For each of the three tissues, the frequency of direct V<sub>H</sub>81X to DFL16.1 rearrangement occurring by inversion was assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 3</xref>B). These results were nearly identical to those for deletional rearrangements; <italic>cR2</italic> animals contain 10- to 100-fold more such rearrangements than their WT counterparts. To rule out the possibility that these observations might be influenced by the proximity of V<sub>H</sub>81X to the D<sub>H</sub> gene segment cluster, we looked at V<sub>H</sub>1S1 that represents a large family of V<sub>H</sub> gene segments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). We again observed the same pattern in the data with direct V-to-D rearrangement in <italic>cR2</italic> animals ranging from 10- to 1000-fold higher than in WT animals. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Frequency of complete V<sub>H</sub>-to-D<sub>H</sub>-to-J<sub>H</sub> and direct V<sub>H</sub>-to-D<sub>H</sub> rearrangements in cR2 and WT mice.

To determine if this pattern was occurring at other DH gene segments, we examined in the same manner DQ52 and sp2.9, and found similar results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Single D gene segment deletions</title><p>Sequence characterization of direct <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> VD joints revealed another unusual type of joint where the entire D&#x003b2; gene coding segment is removed and a perfect signal joint is left in its place. We devised PCR assays to specifically detect such events. The first assay made use of a HaeIII restriction site within the germline D&#x003b2;2 coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). PCR primers on either side of the D&#x003b2; segments were then used to amplify across the region. Two bands were detected with the largest originating from intact germline sequences (despite overnight digestion of the DNA). The smaller band reflects the formation of a signal joint between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; D&#x003b2;2 RSSs. <italic>cR2</italic> mice were observed to contain D&#x003b2;2 coding segment deletions in the thymus more often than WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). To confirm that this reaction generates a precise signal joint, some of the PCR reactions were digested with ApaLI that cuts perfect signal joints (GTG/CAC). Here, only the lower bands were digested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Sequence characterization also confirmed that the faster migrating species represents precise signal joints (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>, Part 1). D&#x003b2;1 gene segments also underwent deletion by this mechanism more frequently in <italic>cR2</italic> than in WT mice (data not shown). We went on to examine the <italic>TCR</italic>&#x003b4; locus which also contains two D&#x003b4; segments both of which are bounded by RSS-12 and RSS-23. We were able to detect D&#x003b4; segment deletion in this setting as well, occurring more frequently in <italic>cR2</italic> than in WT animals (data not shown). Similar analyses of several of the <italic>IgH</italic> D<sub>H</sub> gene segments failed to reveal any such deletion events, suggesting that the causal mechanism is following the 12/23 rule, as D<sub>H</sub> gene segments are bounded by RSS-12. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>D&#x003b2; gene segments are frequently deleted in cR2 mice as compared with WT mice.

The possibility exists that such D gene segment deletions could be the result of inter-chromosomal recombination in which a D&#x003b2; RSS-12 on one chromosome is recombined with a D&#x003b2; RSS-23 on the other, effectively forming a chromosomal translocation that deletes a D&#x003b2; segment. To further explore this possibility, we used a mutant mouse that carries a deletion of the D&#x003b2;2&#x02013;J&#x003b2;2 cluster of gene segments and crossed this to a WT mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The F1 generation had one chromosome 6 with the D&#x003b2;2 segment and the other without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). We devised a second, direct PCR assay that made use of the perfect signal joints resulting from D&#x003b2; gene segment deletions. Here, a downstream primer that spans the signal joint was paired with the upstream primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). This arrangement effectively eliminates the larger band originating from undigested DNA sequences, making visualization easier. We observed that both the D&#x003b2;1 (data not shown) and D&#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) gene segments still underwent deletion in the F1 mice, leading us to conclude that at least a fraction and perhaps all D&#x003b2; gene segment deletion events are intramolecular. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>D&#x003b2;2 coding segment deletion can occur via an intrachromosomal recombination reaction.

To examine these D&#x003b2;1/D&#x003b2;2 events further, we used nested primers in front of D&#x003b2;1 and behind D&#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Rearrangements between the 3&#x02032; D&#x003b2;1 RSS-23 and the 5&#x02032; D&#x003b2;2 RSS-12 would result in the two D&#x003b2; segments forming a coding joint. Alternatively, the 5&#x02032; D&#x003b2;1 RSS-12 could capture the 3&#x02032; D&#x003b2;2 RSS-23 effectively resulting in the loss of both D&#x003b2; segments to a coding joint circle and the formation of a signal joint on the chromosome. In WT thymocytes, both products were detected, but the smaller signal joint products appeared to be more prevalent in the five animals analyzed. In <italic>cR2</italic> thymocytes, this situation was reversed with larger coding joint favored over smaller signal joint formation. This was also observed in splenocytes with the <italic>cR2</italic> animals again showing a much higher level of the coding joint over the signal joint. We were unable to devise a qPCR assay to properly quantify these observations due to sequence constraints. Sequence analysis confirmed the identity of these joints and failed to reveal <italic>N</italic>-region length differences between joints in WT and <italic>cR2</italic> mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>, Part 2).

To further explore the possibility that the non-core domain of RAG2 might play a role in the suppression of interchromosomal recombination events, we compared the frequency of inter-locus D&#x003b2;-to-D&#x003b4; rearrangement in WT and <italic>cR2</italic> animals. These loci are located on chromosome 6 and 14, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Genomic DNA from developing thymocytes was chosen as both these loci are accessible and undergoing RAG-mediated recombination in this tissue. Furthermore, the unselected repertoire would be available permitting the recovery of unbalanced translocation events. We chose to examine all the possible translocations that could occur between the D&#x003b2;2 and D&#x003b4;2 gene segments consistent with the 12/23 rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B).

Two of the four heterozygous <italic>cR2</italic> mice contained this type of translocation as well. D&#x003b4;2-to-D&#x003b2;2 translocation was detected in both WT and cR2 thymocytes.

This may be due, at least in part, to the cell cycle-dependent destruction of the RAG2 protein that depends upon a region within its non-core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Therefore, cR2 protein might persist after developing T or B cells re-enter the cell cycle resulting perhaps in various aberrant recombination events. To test whether the <italic>cR2</italic> mouse shows abnormal cell cycle regulation of recombinase activity, we used LM-PCR to assay for double-stranded DNA RSS breaks in genomic DNA purified from thymocyte nuclei containing unreplicated (2C) or replicated (4C) genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We readily detected broken signal ends from a variety of immune receptor loci in G1 thymocyte DNA samples. We observed very few if any such breaks in WT cells during S/G2/M, whereas the corresponding fraction in <italic>cR2</italic> mice had numerous breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus in <italic>cR2</italic> mice, V(D)J recombination may persist through S-phase, perhaps affecting the mechanisms that dictate ordered rearrangement. Alternatively, signal ends generated in G1 may not have been converted to signal joints before the start of S-phase due to a defect in the core-RAG2 containing recombinase complex. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Analysis of dsDNA RSS breaks in WT and cR2 thymocytes sorted based on DNA content (2C, 4C).

These core RAG proteins are more soluble than the full-length proteins, and hence are obtainable via traditional recombinant protein purification methods. While the core domain proteins are fully functional, one is left to wonder what the role of the highly conserved non-core domains might be. Biochemical studies have ascribed a transposition repression function to the non-core domain of RAG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and a transfection study showed a role in the suppression of hybrid joint formation in the setting of NHEJ deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Recently, two groups reported that the PHD domain within the non-core region of RAG2 specifically binds to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4Me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These reports reinforced a previous work that had shown that the non-core domain of RAG2 binds to histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Finally, Desiderio and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) showed that the non-core domain of RAG2 contains a motif that results in the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of RAG2 upon S-phase entry.</p><p>To assess function in a more biological system, our group and another developed knock-in mice that express the core domain of RAG2 and found that the mice had defects in <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> gene assembly, most profoundly at the V-to-DJ step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A subsequent study found that <italic>cR2</italic> mutant lymphocytes display a range of deletions at normally full-length signal joints and a spectrum of more subtle coding joint defects. These authors suggested a role for the non-core domain of RAG2 in the structure and stability of the post-cleavage complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In the course of our analysis of V(D)J recombination in <italic>cR2</italic> mice, we uncovered a role for the non-core domain at the pre-cleavage step during which the recombinase chooses pairs of RSSs for rearrangement.</p><p>D-to-J rearrangement almost invariably precedes V-to-DJ rearrangement in the <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> loci. We found that the frequency of direct V-to-D rearrangement in <italic>cR2</italic> mice was increased to a level consistently 10- to 1000-fold that seen in WT mice. Heterozygous mice displayed an intermediate frequency of direct V-to-D rearrangement. In both loci, several different V gene segments were analyzed, and consistently the same results were found. These direct V-to-D rearrangements, while readily detectable in cR2 mice, were still very rare as compared with conventional V(D)J rearrangements. Through sequence analysis we also noted that the <italic>cR2</italic> mice produce coding joints with much longer <italic>N</italic>-regions (&#x0003e;7 bp) as compared with WT <italic>RAG2</italic> mice indicative of a joining phase defect. Sequence characterization of the V&#x003b2;8-to-D&#x003b2; rearrangements led us to discover that <italic>cR2</italic> mice frequently included the D RSS heptamer sequence in direct V-to-D joints. This was due to the aberrant recognition the V&#x003b2;8 heptamer as part of a cryptic RSS in the inverted orientation leading to the formation of a chromosomal signal joint (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Thus, the non-core domain of RAG2 is involved in the proper selection of gene segments for V(D)J recombination and subsequent processing.</p><p>In addition, we used PCR to search for other possible recombinations that are rarely seen but permitted under the 12/23 rule. This rule stipulates that the recombinational machinery will only select RSS sequences with differing spacer sequences; 12 and 23 bp. In the <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> loci, the D&#x003b2;1 segment should be able to join the D&#x003b2;2 segment as each is flanked by a RSS-12 and RSS-23. This cannot occur in the <italic>IgH</italic> loci as the D segments are flanked by two RSS-12 signals. We found that <italic>cR2</italic> mice make D&#x003b2;1-to-D&#x003b2;2 rearrangements at much higher frequencies than do WT mice in a fashion that leaves behind a perfect signal joint. Interestingly, this is similar to what we observed previously in an analysis V(D)J recombination in <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> enhancer-deleted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We also found that <italic>cR2</italic> mice more frequently generate particular interchromosomal rearrangements between <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> and <italic>TCR&#x003b4;</italic>.</p><p>The V(D)J recombinase has been shown to play a key role in certain chromosomal translocations associated with lymphoid malignancy. Such translocations usually involve rearrangements between Ig or TCR locus RSSs and &#x02018;cryptic&#x02019; RSSs or random dsDNA breaks within various proto-oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). We recently reported an additional source of recombinase-mediated genomic instability, signal circle insertion. We found that signal circles could undergo a V(D)J recombination-like events with cryptic RSSs leading to re-insertion into the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>cR2</italic> mice showed an approximately 7-fold increase in the frequency of such events. The overall conclusion from these observations is that the non-core domain of RAG2 is required for the fidelity of RSS recognition, the suppression of genomic instability and the appropriate regulation of V(D)J recombination during lymphoid development.</p><p>It is interesting to consider how the ability of the non-core domain of RAG2 to interact with H3K4me3 chromatin might be responsible for both pre- and post-cleavage functions. With regard to gene-segment choice, the non-core domain of RAG2 might provide some degree of restriction of the recombinase to RSSs within chromatin structure carrying the activating mark. As first suggested by others, the non-core domain might limit the activity of the recombinase in the absence of H3K4me3 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Arguing against this, however, is the several-fold greater activity of the intact as compared to the core recombinase in transient transfection studies where chromatin structure is less likely to play a role than with chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It is also possible that the different levels of H3K4me3 within chromatin might be involved in the bias for D-to-J rearrangement over V-to-D rearrangement. In the absence of the non-core domain, this bias may be diminished. The non-core domain might also be involved in the preference for rearrangement to occur in <italic>cis</italic> by promoting some kind of tracking mechanisms in which a RAG&#x02013;RSS complex transiently interacts with H3K4me3 during the search for a partner RSS. Interestingly, heterozygous <italic>cR2</italic> mice display an intermediate effect on the frequency of direct V-to-D rearrangement. This dominant phenotype might be explained by the multimeric nature of the RAG1/RAG2 complex with defective RAG2 subunits influencing overall recombinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Further studies will be required to critically test these potential aspects of recombinase regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn553/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>AI40227</grant-num> to M.S.S.); Funding for open access charge: NIH RO1 A140227.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
