The lack of HD-PTP lipid phosphatase activity also is also observed with other phosphatidylinositol phosphates including PI(3,4)P, PI(3,5)P or PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005105-g004">Fig. 4B&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0005105-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005105.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>HD-PTP does not harbor lipid phosphatase activity.</title><p>HD-PTP phosphatase activity toward synthetic phosphatidylinositol phosphate substrates was evaluated using a malachite green-based assay.

This result is inconsistent with the catalytic inactivity of HD-PTP described here. Using a similar approach, we addressed the effect of HD-PTP S/A mutation <italic>in vivo</italic> by evaluating the ability of HD-PTP to inhibit colony growth formation in human cancer cell lines. In agreement with its kidney tumor suppressor potential in humans, we recently reported that mouse HD-PTP is strongly expressed in the epithelial cells of renal tubules of the kidney cortex (Gingras <italic>et al.</italic> in press). We chose two renal carcinoma cell lines (ACHN and 786-0) that originated from this location in the kidney to address the tumor suppressor potential of HD-PTP. Cells were transfected with the same amount of HD-PTP constructs containing a neomycin selection gene and were selected with a neomycin analog (G418) for 2 weeks. Expression levels of all proteins were comparable using western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005105-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The number of emerging colonies was compared with the number of colonies obtained with the empty vector (EV) control. Results show that HD-PTP expression leads to a reduction of colony growth formation in both cell lines (&#x0223c;70&#x00025; in ACHN and &#x0223c;40&#x00025; in 786-0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005105-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). However, we did not observe any difference between the WT, the C/S and the S/A mutant suggesting that the status of the HD-PTP tyrosine phosphatase activity does not influence its negative effect on colony growth formation. Strikingly, the expression of a deletion mutant of HD-PTP, containing the BRO domain but not the HIS and PTP domains, did not affect colony growth formation. This suggests that the PTP domain exhibits functional importance as demonstrated earlier by the NIH3T3 experiments using the rat orthologue of HD-PTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005105-Cao1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0005105-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005105.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>HD-PTP reduces colony growth formation independently of its phosphatase activity status.</title><p>Colony formation assays were performed in renal cell carcinoma lines (ACHN and 786-0), transfected with an empty vector (EV) containing a neomycin resistance gene or expressing Flag-HD-PTP constructs as indicated.

Using a similar mammalian expression system, a recent study reported tyrosine phosphatase activity associated with wild type HD-PTP which was similar to the background activity that we detected in our assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005105-Mariotti1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Their results are supported by the fact that the well described PTP inhibitor sodium orthovanadate abrogated 60&#x00025; of this activity. However, these results were not compared with activities of inactivating mutants (C/S), which served as controls in our assays. Strikingly, we show that the catalytically inactive C/S mutant displays the same level of PTP activity as the wild type protein. Therefore, we are confident that the low level of PTP activity detected in both studies is due to co-purification of contaminating phosphatases. In agreement with results reported here it has been shown recently that bacterially expressed HD-PTP catalytic domain was inert against a panel of 38 phosphopeptides and DiFMUP substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005105-Barr1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data strongly suggest that HD-PTP is catalytically inactive due to a conserved non-consensus key amino acid divergence in its PTP motif 9, since a back mutation of this residue (S/A) reactivates the HD-PTP tyrosine phosphatase activity. The importance of this residue for the tyrosine phosphatase activity has also been reported for two other receptor-like PTPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005105-Jiang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005105-Drake1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we propose to modify the PTP motif 9 consensus by adding the alanine in position C&#x0002b;2 to the consensus sequence (VHCS<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>GXGR&#x0005b;T/S&#x0005d;G).</p><p>The HD-PTP sequence displays several differences from the PTP consensus motifs, therefore HD-PTP could be inactivated at multiple key positions and it would be interesting to evaluate if other reconstitutions of PTP consensus motifs could increase the HD-PTP catalytic efficiency. For example, in the PTP motif 1 (<bold><underline>N</underline></bold>XXKNR<bold><underline>Y</underline></bold>), known as a phosphotyrosine recognition loop that restricts the substrate specificity to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide, HD-PTP (<bold><underline>Y</underline></bold>SLKNR<bold><underline>H</underline></bold>) displays divergences that are also observed in the two inactive receptor-like PTPs IA2 and IA2&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005105-Andersen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Another important alteration with the PTP consensus is located in motif 8 (WP<bold><underline>D</underline></bold>XGXP), where the aspartic acid (D) is replaced by a glutamic acid (E) in the HD-PTP sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005105-Andersen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This residue is known as the general acid catalyst and its replacement by an alanine residue considerably reduced PTP activity in PTP1B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005105-Flint1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This alteration is also present in a number of inactive D2 domains in receptor PTPs. However, back mutation of this residue (E/D) was not sufficient to render HD-PTP catalytically active (data not shown).</p><p>In order to rationalize the effect of the conserved residue alterations in HD-PTP, we generated a homology model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005105-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast to alanine in that position, Ser1394 in HD-PTP does not form favorable substrate interactions with the bound phosphotyrosine. The polar Ser residue may also repel the substrate phosphate group and affect the nucleophilic nature of the adjacent catalytic Cys residue. It is also evident that the tyrosine/histidine (His1223) exchange in the HD-PTP phosphotyrosine recognition loop results in the loss of &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; stacking interactions with the substrate. In addition, surface representation of the PTP1B active site associated with two phosphotyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005105-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) has been compared to a HD-PTP prediction model associated with one phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005105-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The surface representation suggests that like PTP1B, HD-PTP has an open binding pocket in its active site that may allow phosphate binding.</p><fig id="pone-0005105-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005105.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Model of the HD-PTP catalytic domain.</title><p>A) The HD-PTP homology model was based on the structure of a PTP1B substrate complex (pdb-code: 1g1h).
