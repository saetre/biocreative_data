Mechanisms mediating tumor cell adhesion, migration, and metastasis to vessel wall under flow condition are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential roles of GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins underlying the HeLa-endothelium interaction in static and dynamic flow conditions. HeLa cell migration and invasion were studied by using Millicell cell culture insert system. The numbers of transmigrated or invaded HeLa cells significantly increased by thrombin-activated platelets and reduced by eptifibatide, a platelet inhibitor. Meanwhile, RGDWE peptides, a specific inhibitor of <italic>&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin, also inhibited HeLa cell transmigration. Interestingly, the presence of endothelial cells had significant effect on HeLa cell migration regardless of static or cocultured flow condition. The adhesion capability of HeLa cells to endothelial monolayer was also significantly affected by GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins. The arrested HeLa cells increased nearly 5-fold in the presence of thrombin-activated platelets at shear stress condition (1.84 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> exposure for 1 hour) than the control (static). Our findings showed that GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins are important mediators in the pathology of cervical cancer and provide a molecular basis for the future therapy, and the efficient antitumor benefit should target multiple receptors on tumor cells and platelets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Metastasis is one of the leading causes of cancer patients' death. Tumor cells disseminate to distant organs via the lymph or the blood stream during metastasis. The metastasis includes several critical pathogenic steps which are angiogenesis, invasion into the capillary venules, circulation in the blood stream, adherence to a new local extravasation and colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The arrest of metastasizing tumor cells within the blood stream is prerequisite for their extravasation. In the blood stream, tumor cells are exposed to flow-dependent shear forces, plasma proteins, blood cells, and platelets, all of which may affect tumor cell survival, arrest, and extravasation. Mechanisms which mediate tumor cell arrest involve adhesive interactions of tumor cells with endothelial cells. Recently, intense researches have unveiled an elaborate integrin network controlling the adhesion and migration of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The integrin families overexpressed on the tumor cells have now been recognized as key regulators of various neoplastic processes by virtue of their ability to facilitating cancer cell adhesion and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors formed by the noncovalent association of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> subunits. <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin mediates cell adhesion and migration on a variety of extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, collagen, osteopontin, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin prefers to highly express on developing tissues rather than the normal or mature one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As a class of apparent malignantly developing tissue, the aberrant expression of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin has been demonstrated on various kinds of cancer including metastasis human melanoma, breast, prostate, and glioblastoma tumor cells. All these evidences lead to the confirmation that overexpression of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin may be cited as a reliable index to determine the malignancy of a specific tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that prostate cancer cell adhesion and migration to vitronectin and osteopontin were <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3-dependent. The similar pattern was also found in the model of ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the normal physiological condition, platelets do not attach to intact endothelium unless the platelet-endothelium interaction has been disturbed due to the vascular damage. The mechanism of coagulation directed by the aggregation of activated platelets is now known to involve two specific glycoproteins, that is, GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa (also called <italic>&#x003b1;</italic><sub>IIb</sub><italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3), which is composed of two subunits which are GPIIb and GPIIIa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Some disorders of GPIIb/IIIa such as Glanzmann thrombasthenia show the importance of GPIIb/IIIa in mediating the natural physiological hemostasis and thrombosis. There exists a clear medical link between thrombosis and tumor metastasis. Clinical statistics showed that half of cancer patients have accompanying platelet activation and thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Investigators have long speculated that tumor cells can induce the aggregation of platelets which will coat the former and then reduce the possible immunological attack during the hematogenous metastasis. However, how GPIIb/IIIa mediates this process under dynamic fluid stress has not been confirmed.</p><p>To investigate what are the roles of GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins for cancer cell adhesion, migration, and metastasis, our present study was designed to explore the behaviors of HeLa cell-endothelial cell interaction under the static and dynamic flow conditions. Their contributions towards the metastasis of cervical cancer were also evaluated and to elucidate whether there exists synergistic relationship between GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 during mediating the interaction process of HeLa cell-endothelial cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

These results suggest that HeLa cells may induce platelet activation through GPIIb/IIIa activation and therefore induce HeLa cell-platelet interaction or that other integrins might be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This interaction of cancer cells-platelets could promote not only platelet aggregation but also the expression of matrix metalloproteinases that are involved in the matrix degradation and invasion process. It was reported that <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin overexpressed on the HeLa cell surfaces, and which could bind to GPIIb/IIIa integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Further study showed that the number of migrated HeLa cells decreased after the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin was specifically blocked by RGDWE peptides (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3 </xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). It suggested that GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins will cooperate to mediate HeLa cell migration, or that there was a synergic effect when GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins were activated. Because cancer cell does not only interact with platelets, leucocytes and endothelial cells were also involved. Published data have provided evidence that leucocytes facilitated melanoma cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here, we found that HeLa cell migration was remarkably affected whether the endothelial cells were cultured on plate wells or the outer side PET membrane (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Endothelial cells enhanced HeLa cell migration both in static and shear flow conditions, suggesting that endothelial cells could secrete some cytokines or chemoattractants to induce HeLa cell transmigration, for instance, basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor.</p><p>We also used a laminar flow chamber to further assay HeLa cell adhesion under shear stress conditions to mimic the in vivo situation. Under physiological conditions, tumor cells which are under the hematogenous metastasis are exposed to a wide range of mechanical shear stresses from blood flow. This dynamic fluid system definitely impinges on the motion of individual tumor cells, especially their behaviors of adhesion to the endothelium. The relevant reports which focus on the behavior of the cell adhesion under dynamic condition are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 </xref>indicated that the capability of HeLa cell adhesion to endothelium is significantly affected by GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins. Previous studies have shown that the activated platelets can also bind to the cancer cells via GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 interaction through the bridges of fibronectin, fibrinogen, or von Willebrand factor. So it could be speculated that more HeLa cells would be arrested on the endothelial cells via the P-selectin and its ligand PSGL-1 is present on endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The aggregation of platelets will strengthen cancer cell adhesion and migration. Our data support the hypothesis, and a new model that activated platelets will adhere to cancer cells via GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 interaction to form a loosed platelet coating on cancer surface, which will lead to cancer cells to reduce or avoid shear stress exposure and also assist more cancer cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, the activated platelets aggregated to form tiny local thrombus, and resulting in local blood viscosity enhanced to provide more chance for cancer cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover, cancer cell-induced platelet activation possibly amplifies cancer cell adhesion to endothelium to some extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our investigation further demonstrated that cell migration, invasion, and adhesion were also highly regulated by <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin on the HeLa cells. These results might add a new aspect why the majority of actively metastatic tumors were found to highly express <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin.</p><p>Taken together, the present work demonstrates a novel role for GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins in supporting the HeLa cell migration, invasion, and adhesion. The presence of platelets and their activated state resulted in enhancement of HeLa cell transmigration and cell recruitment to HUVECs monolayer under shear flow. These findings promote our understanding of the roles of GPIIb/IIIa and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins in cancer metastasis, which could be a new strategy to cancer treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30700151), by Starting Funds (Y02002010901008), and Innovative Talent Incubation Program for Youth (Y02018023601062) from UETSC.
