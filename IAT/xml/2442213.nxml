In ERAD, misfolded proteins are removed from the ER by retrotranslocation into the cytosol where they are degraded by the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system. The identity of the specific protein components responsible for retrotranslocation remains controversial, with the potential candidates being Sec61p, Der1p, and Doa10. We show that the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of a short-lived transmembrane ERAD substrate is exposed to the lumen of the ER during the degradation process. The addition of N-linked glycan to the N terminus of the substrate is prevented by mutation of a specific cysteine residue of Sec61p, as well as a specific cysteine residue of the substrate protein. We show that the substrate protein forms a disulfide-linked complex to Sec61p, suggesting that at least part of the retrotranslocation process involves Sec61p.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>D.C.

To prevent the premature exit of improperly folded proteins from the ER, cells have evolved quality control mechanisms to actively monitor the folding state of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodsky and McCracken, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>). Proteins that irreversibly misfold are recognized by this quality control system and targeted for destruction through a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hampton, 2002</xref>). Although initial studies of ERAD implied the action of unidentified ER-localized proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Finger et al., 1993</xref>), subsequent work clearly defined roles for the cytoplasmically localized enzymes of the ubiquitin pathway and the 26S proteasome, providing the first indication that misfolded proteins must be retrotranslocated back across the membrane of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jensen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ward et al., 1995</xref>). From a mechanistic standpoint, these results established the need for an ER-localized protein-conducting channel to direct the flow of misfolded protein export from the ER.</p><p>Circumstantial evidence suggested that Sec61p, the main component of the protein-conducting channel for translocation into the ER, participates in retrotranslocation from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wiertz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pilon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plemper et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">1998</xref>). In mammalian cells, Sec61&#x003b1; can be coimmunoprecipitated with class I heavy chains that are targeted for ERAD by the human cytomegalovirus-encoded glycoprotein US2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wiertz et al., 1996</xref>). Subsequently, genetic and biochemical analysis of Sec61p mutants uncovered alleles more prone to defects in protein retrotranslocation than translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pilon et al., 1997</xref>). Certain ERAD substrates are stabilized in a partially translocation-defective mutant, <italic>sec61-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plemper et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">1998</xref>). In an independent approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmitz et al. (2000)</xref> showed that blocking Sec61 channels with translation-arrested ribosomes prevented exit of cholera toxin from the ER. However, when the crystallographic structure of SecY/E, an archaeal orthologue of Sec61p, revealed a strict upper size limit for the pore diameter, it was difficult to conceive how such a small pore could accommodate the larger retrotranslocation substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tirosh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, for certain proteins that are subject to ERAD before the completion of translocation, new evidence suggests a direct participation of Sec61p in the ERAD process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oyadomari et al., 2006</xref>). For the majority of proteins subject to ERAD after membrane assembly, the evidence favors one or more distinct retrotranslocation channels.</p><p>Another candidate channel protein, Derlin-1, was identified by virtue of its association with the human cytomegalovirus-encoded glycoprotein US11 in the process of retrotranslocation and degradation of class I heavy chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ye et al., 2004</xref>). The interaction of Derlin-1 with glycosylated class I heavy chains before retrotranslocation and its subsequent association with deglycosylated heavy chains when cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors suggest that it is positioned to interact with substrates before and immediately after they are retrotranslocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lilley and Ploegh, 2005</xref>). The role of the yeast Derlin-1 homologue Der1p in ERAD is poorly defined but is known to be required for the efficient degradation of misfolded luminal ER proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knop et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hitt and Wolf, 2004</xref>). However, numerous ERAD substrates are degraded independent of Der1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill and Cooper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>). A subset of these Der1p-independent substrates is also independent of Sec61p but requires Doa10, an ER-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase. Thus, Doa10 may represent a distinct retrotranslocation channel in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kreft et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we describe our discovery and characterization of a disulfide-linked intermediate complex formed between a short-lived transmembrane ERAD substrate and Sec61p. This complex may accomplish at least an initial stage in the retrotranslocation of unstable membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cysteine mutants of Sec61p are protein retrotranslocation proficient</title><p>To test for defects in the ER export of misfolded membrane proteins, we followed the degradation kinetics of the short-lived transmembrane substrate Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup>. The Deg1 sequence appended to the N terminus of Sec62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshaies and Schekman, 1989</xref>) diverts the hybrid protein to the ERAD pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mayer et al., 1998</xref>).

To explore the role of each of the cysteine residues of Sec61p in the ERAD of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup>, we created strains in which one or more of these residues was mutated on a CEN plasmid as the sole copy of <italic>SEC61</italic>. The rate of substrate degradation was accelerated nearly twofold in a strain harboring Sec61p C373I (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003d; 7&#x02013;8 min; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>), whereas Sec61p C121G or C150V had no influence on the degradation rate (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003d; 13 min; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>).

In this background the rate of substrate degradation was not altered, which is consistent with previous reports on the degradation of a misfolded membrane substrate containing a misfolded cytosolic domain (Ste6&#x0002a;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huyer et al., 2004</xref>; see alsoDiscussion). In wild-type and mutant strains, except C373I, we observed two electrophoretically distinct species of substrate. The more rapidly migrating species predominated in C373I (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Sec61p cysteine mutants are proficient for ER protein export.</bold> (A) Wild-type and Sec61p mutant cells expressing the transmembrane ERAD substrate Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> were pulse labeled for 5 min and chased for the indicated times.

Although the N and C termini of Sec62p are exposed to the cytosol, the N-terminal Deg signal may influence the disposition of Sec62 during ERAD. Thus, one possibility was that cryptic N-glycosylation sites in the N terminus of Sec62p may become exposed to the ER lumen during ERAD. We found that Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> was sensitive to endoglycosidase H, which is consistent with a previous report for Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> is modified by N-linked glycosylation.</bold> (A, left) Schematic representation of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> and its presumed membrane topology.

Site-directed mutagenesis of Asn90 resulted in no change in the two Deg-Sec62 species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the lower mobility glycosylated form of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> disappeared in an Asn153 mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 5), indicating that Asn153, but not Asn90, was N glycosylated.</p><p>Sec62 is a double pass unglycosylated transmembrane protein with the N and C termini facing the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshaies and Schekman, 1989</xref>). Conceivably, the attachment of Deg1 to the N terminus and ProtA to the C terminus altered the topology of the hybrid protein. However, we found that the Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> hybrid complemented a <italic>sec62</italic> mutant for growth (unpublished data). In addition, we were unable to detect substrate protein with antibodies directed against either the N- or C-terminal tail of the hybrid protein after treatment of intact ER membranes with protease (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804053/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804053/DC1</ext-link>), which ruled out a potential heterogeneous topological population of the hybrid. Thus, glycosylation of Asn153 suggested that the N terminus became exposed to the ER lumen at some point during the course of synthesis or degradation of the hybrid protein. In an attempt to further define regions of the N- or C-terminal tails that were exposed to the lumen, we introduced additional acceptor sequences throughout the polypeptide chain and evaluated the glycosylation state of these mutants. The introduction of an additional acceptor site within 30 aa of Asn153 led to the production of a doubly glycosylated substrate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). However, addition of sites at positions further removed from this site, as well as multiple sites within the C-terminal tail, maintained a singly glycosylated profile characteristic of the wild-type substrate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, lanes 3 and 7&#x02013;10). These results indicate that a minimal region of &#x0223c;50 aa within the N-terminal cytosolic tail becomes exposed to the lumen of the ER.</p></sec><sec><title>Cysteine mutants of Sec61p are protein translocation proficient</title><p>A protein translocation defect could account for the effect of the Sec61p C373I mutant on ERAD of Deg1:Sec62:<sup>ProtA</sup>.

In Sec61p wild-type and cysteine mutant cells, 3gp&#x003b1;f was not observed because transport and proteolytic maturation were too rapid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, top, lanes 1, 7, 9, and 11). Pretreatment of cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, led to the accumulation of signal-cleaved p&#x003b1;f in the ER (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, top, lanes 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12).

The difference between s<italic>ec61-32</italic> (C150Y) and C150V may be attributable to the nature of the substitution. C150Y also produced a cold-sensitive defect, whereas C150V did not.

To test this, we constructed a Deg1:Sec62 deletion hybrid containing residues of Sec62 up to the first transmembrane segment (Deg1:Sec62 1&#x02013;149). Cells were radiolabeled in the absence and presence of tunicamycin and flag-tagged hybrid proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates. Unlike the Deg1:Sec62 full-length hybrid, Deg1:Sec62 1&#x02013;149 accumulated in an unglycosylated form (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). As a control, we fused the prepro region of &#x003b1;f, which contains a signal peptide and a pro peptide with three N-glycosylation sites, to the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Sec62 (proFactor:Sec62 1&#x02013;149). This hybrid produced multiple glycosylated tunicamycin-sensitive species that accumulated in cells (lysate) and secreted glycosylated forms, which were sensitive to Endo H, into the culture fluid (supernatant; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). We conclude that the N terminus of Sec62 can be translocated and glycosylated as directed by a standard signal sequence but that the Deg1 sequence does not act as a typical secretory signal.</p><p>The lack of a protein translocation defect for the Sec61p cysteine 373 mutant suggested that glycosylation of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> may occur during ERAD. We next measured the rate of formation of the glycosylated substrate in backgrounds that stabilized substrate yet did not affect its import. Thus, if glycosylation occurred during the degradation process, the formation of the glycosylated species may be delayed in mutants defective in ERAD. After a short pulse label of 2 min, the glycosylated and unglycosylated forms were labeled in roughly equal amounts in wild-type cells (glycosylated/unglycosylated &#x0003d; 1; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). This ratio increased with labeling time and approached a ratio of four at 8 min of pulse label (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). The ratio was decreased in a mutant lacking the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc7p, with ratios of 0.5 and 2.7 at 2 and 8 min, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Although the delay was significant, it was clearly not complete. This observation is likely caused by the independence of ubiquitination for the initial stages of retrotranslocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flierman et al., 2003</xref>). We then introduced site-specific mutations in the Deg1 signal itself in an effort to disrupt an early step in the retrotranslocation event. A systematic study of the Deg1 signal localized its degradation determinant to a relatively short peptide segment spanning residues 13&#x02013;32. We selected mutations that significantly stabilize a Deg1:&#x003b2;gal fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 1998</xref>; <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2s</sub> for deg1 mutant hybrids: F18S &#x02248; 40 min, F18S/l29H &#x02248; 120 min, &#x00394;13&#x02013;32 &#x02265; 200 min [unpublished data]).

The primary sequence of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> contains five cysteine residues, three of which (Cys33, Cys34, and Cys200) are localized within the N-terminal cytosolic tail, one (Cys255) within transmembrane domain one, and the last (Cys315) to the C-terminal cytosolic tail. Cysteine to serine mutation of residues 33, 34, 255, or 315 had no effect on the formation of the glycosylated substrate species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). However, mutagenesis of cysteine 200 produced an unglycosylated form of the hybrid protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>).

Thus, a disulfide bond may form between the hybrid protein and the translocation channel (or with other proteins) as an intermediate in the ERAD process.

One (spot A) represented the monomeric substrate protein because it migrated at the predicted molecular weight for monomer in both dimensions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, spot A, molecular mass 41 kD). Another (spot C) migrated in the nonreducing dimension at a position of roughly 100 kD and likely represents a disulfide-bonded homodimer of the substrate protein (see subsequent paragraph and Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804053/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804053/DC1</ext-link>).

Moreover, this disulfide complex persists in the Sec61p C373S mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, spot C). A final species (spot B) migrated at a position consistent with an apparent molecular mass of &#x0223c;70 kD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, spot B). The size of this complex in the nonreducing dimension conformed to the range of molecular masses expected for a Sec61p-Deg1:Sec62 disulfide complex (35 kD &#x0002b; 41 kD &#x0003d; 76-kD complex). Furthermore, this species was not detected in a strain harboring the Sec61p C373S mutation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, compare wild type and C373S).

This form was observed in membranes from a strain in which all three Sec61p cysteine residues were mutated (unpublished data). This species may represent a stable nondisulfide dimer of Sec61p that resists complete denaturation at the high protein concentration used in sample preparation for this analysis. Nevertheless, we reproducibly observed a sixfold difference in the abundance of Spot B in wild-type versus the C373S Sec61p mutant background (wild type/C373S &#x0003d; 5.8 &#x000b1; 0.45; see Materials and methods).

Deletion of the deg1 degradation signal confers to the hybrid protein stability and an inability to become modified with glycan (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>), presumably because it can no longer enter the ERAD pathway. When this mutant is analyzed by two-dimensional nonreducing/reducing electrophoresis only monomeric substrate protein is observed (Fig. S2, spot A). The absence of the Sec61p&#x02013;Deg1:Sec62 disulfide complex, spot B, confirms that the substrate protein must be degradation competent to form a disulfide complex with Sec61. Disappearance of the higher molecular mass complex, spot C, suggests that this spot represents a disulfide-bonded homodimer of the substrate protein, which is consistent with removal of a large segment of the region shown to mediate MAT&#x003b1;2 homodimerization (&#x003b1;2A residues 18&#x02013;43; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Improperly folded secretory proteins are recognized and targeted for degradation by a quality control system in the ER. Misfolded substrates are degraded by the cytosolic 26S proteasome. Hence, they must first be retrotranslocated back across the membrane of the ER. Despite significant progress in understanding the events of misfolded protein recognition, targeting, and degradation, the retrotranslocation process remains poorly defined. A significant obstacle to further defining this event is the observation that different substrate molecules display distinct genetic and biochemical requirements for their degradation.</p><p>Our discovery of a disulfide intermediate complex between Sec61p and the short-lived transmembrane ERAD substrate Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> provides direct evidence for the participation of Sec61p in the retrotranslocation process, possibly serving as a retrotranslocation channel. In support of this view is the recent characterization of proteasome binding sites within Sec61p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng et al., 2007</xref>) and the ER stress-induced induction of subunits of the TRAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nagasawa et al., 2007</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the action of alternative channels in the ERAD of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup>, it is degraded independently of Der1p and its yeast orthologue Dfm1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hitt and Wolf, 2004</xref>; unpublished data). In contrast, yeast cells lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Doa10p stabilize the hybrid twofold (unpublished data). However, because Doa10p functions in the degradation of ER-associated and cytosolic substrates, we cannot discriminate roles in the recognition of the deg signal or as an ERAD channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The byproduct of disulfide complex formation is the addition of oligosaccharide to a short segment of the N-terminal tail of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup>. This tail is otherwise cytoplasmically localized, indicating that during the retrotranslocation of membrane substrates, cytosolic loops and/or tails pass through the lumen of the ER. The formation of a glycoprotein intermediate may require the action of Sec61p and may become apparent only when substrate extraction is delayed by formation of the disulfide complex. Given the small number of misfolded transmembrane substrates available for study and the specific requirements for an appropriately placed cysteine residue and glycosylation acceptor site, this unusual intermediate may have escaped detection in other ERAD substrates. As an example, a recent study on the degradation of a Deg1:Vma12<sup>ProtA</sup> hybrid protein failed to reveal a glycoprotein intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ravid et al., 2006</xref>). Vma12p is similar in size and membrane topology to Sec62p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jackson and Stevens, 1997</xref>), and the Deg-Vma12 hybrid is degraded with a half-life of 7 min, which is identical to the degradation rate of the Deg-Sec62 cysteine mutant hybrid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>; and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>). Degradation of Deg-Vma12 proceeds without apparent covalent modification, perhaps because the coding sequence contains no glycosylation acceptor sites and the only cysteine present in the N-terminal cytosolic domain is 75 residues away from the first transmembrane domain. In contrast, the Sec62 coding sequence contains two potential glycosylation sites (N90 and N153; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), and the cysteine involved in disulfide bonding to Sec61p is only 40 residues removed from the first transmembrane domain.</p><p>How are cytoplasmic regions of misfolded transmembrane proteins reoriented during the retrotranslocation process so that they become exposed to the lumen of the ER? Our results suggest that the Deg signal recruits the N-terminal domain of the hybrid protein, possibly through the first transmembrane anchor domain, into the Sec61p channel where at least a portion of the polar N terminus is imported into the ER lumen (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A [II&#x02013;IV] or B [III-IV]</xref>). This event may be preceded by the retrotranslocation of the C-terminal domain of the hybrid, as depicted in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B (I&#x02013;III)</xref>, or by the prior action of a distinct channel.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Models for disulfide complex formation and substrate glycosylation.</bold> (A) A model depicting a role for Sec61p in the initial state of Deg1 translocation into the ER. In this model, the amphipathic Deg1 region mimicks a signal peptide and is recruited to the Sec61p channel (I and II). After inversion of this segment, the N-terminal cytosolic region is looped back through the channel and may either be actively translocated or passively backslide through the channel (III). Next, the cysteine residues of the substrate protein and Sec61p complex form a disulfide intermediate that provides for the extended exposure and glycosylation at Asn153 within the N-terminal tail of the substrate protein (IV and V). After this initial translocation step, the misfolded Deg-Sec62 may be transferred to another channel (cylindrical symbol) to execute retrotranslocation. (B) A model depicting a role for Sec61p in membrane protein retrotranslocation from the ER. Substrate is initially targeted to Sec61p, and its C-terminal transmembrane helix partitions into the channel through a lateral gate (I). Ubiquitination and the Cdc48p and/or 19S RP complex assist in membrane extraction of the substrate protein (II). The substrate's N-terminal transmembrane partitions into the channel where the extraction force at the C terminus results in the reorientation of the N-terminal transmembrane segment within the channel (III). The N-terminal segment inverts, resulting in a reorientation of the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail with regions exposed to the lumen of the ER. Next, the looped segment may enter the lumen further by backsliding within the channel (IV). Finally, the disulfide complex formation between Sec61p and substrate stalls the N terminus in the channel, permitting glycosylation of Asn153 (V).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1811095f07"></graphic></fig><p>A fortuitous apposition of cysteine residues in Sec61p and the Deg hybrid permits the formation of a transient disulfide that stabilizes the N terminus of Deg-Sec62 in the ER lumen long enough to make it available for N glycosylation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A [IV] or B [V]</xref>). Of importance to this model is the relative position of cysteine 373 of Sec61p in the crystal structure of the SecY complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>). C373 resides in the cytoplasmic half of TM8 (transmembrane segment eight) with the &#x02212;SH side chain pointing to the channel interior. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic half of the lateral gate is thought to form at the interface between TM8 and TM2b and between TM2b and TM7. Thus, this residue may contact a retrotranslocating polypeptide chain.</p><p>Derlin (yeast Der1p) and Doa10p represent other potential retrotranslocation channels that may act alone or in concert with Sec61p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wahlman et al., 2007</xref>).

Der1p, despite being tested against a large panel of membrane-bound ERAD substrates (e.g., Vph1p, Pdr5&#x0002a;, Ste6-6&#x0002a;, CT&#x0002a;, and CTG&#x0002a;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plemper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill and Cooper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taxis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>), is only known to be partially required for the chimeric ERAD substrate KWW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>). Sec61p, although not as extensively tested as Der1p, is required for the degradation of Pdr5&#x0002a; that contains a misfolded luminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plemper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huyer et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Sec61-2</italic>, which is partially defective in the ERAD of CPY&#x0002a; but not in the ERAD of the Deg-Sec62 hybrid, possesses a mutant residue predicted to face the ER lumen (G213D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>).

Because Hrd1 and Der1p display overlapping substrate preferences, it is tempting to propose that Der1p organizes the machinery necessary for ubiquitination and extraction of misfolded luminal proteins. In contrast, substrates requiring the Doa10p ubiquitin ligase show Der1p independence because they require other factors for assembly of the degradation machinery.

An aliquot equivalent to 12 ODs was centrifuged, and cells were resuspended in fresh prewarmed SCGal-Met-Ura medium and allowed to grow at 30&#x000b0;C for 15 min. Labeling was initiated by the addition of <sup>35</sup>S-Translabel at 50 &#x003bc;Ci/OD. After 5 min, 0.4 ml of a 10&#x000d7; chase solution was added. At time zero and the indicated chase times, 1 ml was removed and immediately quenched by the addition of ice-cold sodium azide to 10 mM. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> with IgG Sepharose beads was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biederer et al., 1996</xref>). In brief, cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 110 &#x003bc;l of ice-cold buffer A (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, and Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors [Roche]). Cell disruption was performed with 1 vol of glass beads by four cycles of vortex mixing for 30 s, interrupted by 30-s incubation on ice. The lysate was next diluted to 900 &#x003bc;l with ice-cold buffer A and cleared by low-speed centrifugation at 1,000 <italic>g</italic>. Membranes were isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l buffer B (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl), and diluted to a final volume of 900 &#x003bc;l in buffer C (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 11.3 mM EDTA, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.11% SDS, and complete protease inhibitors). IgG Sepharose (100 &#x003bc;l of a 20% slurry in buffer C) was added and the mixtures were incubated with rotation at 4&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02013;4 h. Beads were collected, washed three times with 900 &#x003bc;l of buffer C, and resuspended in 50 &#x003bc;l 2X sample buffer. Samples were heated at 55&#x000b0;C for 10 min and proteins were separated on 9.5% SDS-PAGE. After drying, the gels were exposed to a phosphoimager cassette for detection and quantitation. Degradation kinetics are expressed as the sum of decay for the two substrate species over time. Although the degradation rates for glycosylated and unglycosylated substrate are different, we chose to express decay in this manner because the glycosylation site mutant, N153D, is degraded at a rate identical to the sum of the two wild-type substrate species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>).</p><p>Labeling and immunoprecipitation of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> for pulse-time experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) was performed as described for pulse-chase experiments (previous paragraph), with the only difference being the time cells were exposed to radiolabel. Cells were quenched at the indicated pulse time (i.e., 2, 4, 6, or 8 min) by the addition of sodium azide to 10 mM. Data are presented as the ratio of glycosylated to unglycosylated forms of the substrate protein at each labeling time.</p></sec><sec><title>Endoglycosidase H treatment</title><p>Steady-state levels of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> were immunoprecipitated from wild-type cells as described for the pulse-chase experiments (Pulse chase and immunoprecipitation). Bound protein was eluted from the IgG Sepharose beads by heating in 1% SDS/50 mM Tris, pH 7.4. The eluted sample was diluted 20-fold into a final buffer concentration of 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5. Samples were aliquoted into separate tubes and mock treated or treated with 1 mU of endoglycosidase-H (Boehringer Ingelheim). Mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C and stopped by the addition of 2&#x000d7; sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 9.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and developed with anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Microsomal membrane isolation and protease protection</title><p>Yeast cells expressing Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> were grown in SD-Ura 2% raffionose, 0.1% glucose overnight at 30&#x000b0;C.

Cells (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0003d; 15) were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of 10-mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, containing 10 mM dithiothreitol and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with spheroplast buffer (1 M sorbitol, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM dithiothreitol). Cells were recollected and resuspended in 1 ml of spheroplast buffer. Cell walls were digested with 140 &#x003bc;g zymolase 100T (Seikagu Corporation)/10 OD<sub>600</sub> equivalents for 20 min at 30&#x000b0;C. Spheroplasts were centrifuged (5 min at 600 <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C) and washed in prechilled spheroplast buffer containing 20 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.

Lysis was achieved by the addition of 300 &#x003bc;l of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 min of agitation with a vortex mixer at 4&#x000b0;C. Unlysed cells and cell debris were centrifuged for 5 min at 600 <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C. Crude microsomal fractions were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 200 mM NaCl) at &#x0223c;0.5 OD<sub>600</sub> equivalents/ml. The microsome fraction was split into three aliquots (&#x0223c;4 OD<sub>600</sub> equivalents each). One was mock treated with buffer and the others were digested with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml trypsin in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Digestions were stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 15%. After a 30-min incubation on ice, precipitated material was collected by centrifugation and washed once with ice-cold acetone. Pellets were resuspended in 50 &#x003bc;l SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 55&#x000b0;C for 15 min, and subjected to electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Kar2 (microsomal integrity control), anti&#x02013;Protein A (C terminus of hybrid), or anti-Flag (N terminus of hybrid) antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Two-dimensional nonreducing/reducing SDS-PAGE</title><p>Cells expressing &#x00394;Cys4:Deg1:Sec62<sup>&#x00394;ProtA</sup> or &#x00394;13-32:&#x00394;Cys4:Deg1:Sec62<sup>&#x00394;ProtA</sup> (Fig. S2) were grown and membranes were isolated from the cell pellets as described for the pulse-chase experiments (Pulse chase and immunoprecipitation). Membrane pellets were then resuspended in 4&#x000d7; SDS-PAGE sample buffer without reducing agent to a concentration approximately corresponding to 0.4 OD<sub>600</sub> equivalents/&#x003bc;l (for substrate blots) or 1.5 OD<sub>600</sub> equivalents/&#x003bc;l (for Sec61p blots). After 10 min at 55&#x000b0;C, 60 &#x003bc;l of the sample was electrophoresed on 9.5% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis in the first dimension, the lane was excised with a razorblade and soaked in 5 ml of sample buffer containing 10% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol at 90&#x000b0;C for 5 min. The gel sliver was then placed on top of a second 9.5% SDS-PAGE trough gel and electrophoresed in the second dimension. After transfer to nitrocellulose, but before detection with anti-flag or anti-myc antibodies, the membrane was stained with Ponceau S to demarcate the protein diagonal band. Blots were developed with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) and scanned with a typhoon imager for quantitation. To compare the relative amounts of Sec61p and Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> between the strain backgrounds, we sampled serial dilutions of the membrane suspension under reducing conditions and quantified the resulting protein species. In all experiments, there was a &#x0003c;5&#x02013;10% difference in the total amount of Sec61p or Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup> applied to the two-dimensional gels.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows the protease susceptibility of Deg1:Sec62<sup>ProtA</sup>.
