The MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl, a long-standing antiparkinsonian therapy, is currently used clinically in concert with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA. Clinical studies suggesting that deprenyl treatment alone is not protective against PD associated mortality were targeted to symptomatic patients. However, dopamine loss is at least 60&#x00025; by the time PD is symptomatically detectable, therefore lack of effect of MAO-B inhibition in these patients does not negate a role for MAO-B in pre-symptomatic dopaminergic loss. In order to directly evaluate the role of age-related elevations in astroglial MAO-B in the early initiation or progression of PD, we created genetically engineered transgenic mice in which MAO-B levels could be specifically induced within astroglia in adult animals. Elevated astrocytic MAO-B mimicking age related increase resulted in specific, selective and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), the same subset of neurons primarily impacted in the human condition. This was accompanied by other PD-related alterations including selective decreases in mitochondrial complex I activity and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. Along with a global astrogliosis, we observed local microglial activation within the SN. These pathologies correlated with decreased locomotor activity. Importantly, these events occurred even in the absence of the PD-inducing neurotoxin MPTP. Our data demonstrates that elevation of murine astrocytic MAO-B by itself can induce several phenotypes of PD, signifying that MAO-B could be directly involved in multiple aspects of disease neuropathology. Mechanistically this may involve increases in membrane permeant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which can oxidize dopamine within dopaminergic neurons to dopaminochrome which, via interaction with mitochondrial complex I, can result in increased mitochondrial superoxide. Our inducible astrocytic MAO-B transgenic provides a novel model for exploring pathways involved in initiation and progression of several key features associated with PD pathology and for therapeutic drug testing.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is found in the brain primarily in non-neuronal cells such as astrocytes and radial glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001616-Westlund1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001616-Levitt1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Selective reductions in complex I activity are associated with PD and selective inhibition of complex I via systemic administration of either rotenone or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) results in patterns of morphological damage in rodents similar to that observed in the human Parkinsonian midbrain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001616-Betarbet1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001616-Przedborski1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although deprenyl was found to be ineffective in slowing or halting the ultimate mortality in clinical PD it was given to patients only after symptoms were present which is known to coincide with the presence of an already extensive (&#x0223c;60&#x00025;) midbrain dopaminergic cell loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001616-Fearnley1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest that inhibition of MAO-B activity at this advanced stage in the disease is ineffective but this does not necessarily prove that MAO-B elevation is not a factor in initial neuropathology associated with the disorder and MAO-B inhibitors if given pre-symptomatically might not be protective. In order to test the hypothesis that elevations in MAO-B can directly contribute to pathologies observed in PD and to better understand the possible mechanisms underlying its effects on these parameters, we created genetically engineered mouse lines in which MAO-B levels can be inducibly increased specifically within astrocytes in adult animals. This allowed us to bypass any impact of its increased expression during the developmental time period. We report here that astrocytic elevation of MAO-B in adult mice recapitulates many of the pathological hallmarks associated with human PD and that these effects can be prevented by treatment with the selective MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl or the antioxidant EUK189.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Creation of transgenic mouse lines in which astrocytic MAO-B activity can be inducibly increased in adult animals</title><p>Double transgenic mouse lines were generated in our laboratory that constitutively express a reverse tetracycline responsive transactivator (rtTa) protein specifically within astrocytes via a glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (pGFAP).

Recent work in isolated brain mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001616-Zoccarato1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that dopamine oxidized to dopaminochrome (DACHR) can remove electrons from the auto-oxidizable site in mitochondrial complex I forming dopaminochrome radical. Dopaminochrome radical can in turn react with O<sub>2</sub> present in the mitochondria converting it to O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> in concert with re-reduction of the dopaminergic radical, setting up a redox cycling event. This would be manifest as an increase in mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> levels and ROS-induced complex I inhibition within the dopaminergic neurons which could result in their selective demise. We hypothesized that membrane-permeant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by increased MAO-B activity within astrocytes could interact with intercellular dopamine and produce selective degenerative effects on dopaminergic neurons via a similar mechanism. To first test for the ability of astrocytes with elevated MAO-B activity to produce increased levels of extracellular ROS, we measured H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated in the culture medium in mesencephalic cultures isolated from our inducible MAO-B transgenics following dox induction. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels released into the media in dox-induced cultures were significantly higher than those produced from untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001616-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Co-treatment with deprenyl prevented the increase in extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as did treatment with the antioxidant superoxide dismutase-catalase mimetic compound EUK-189. Co-treatment with apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, resulted in a partial reduction in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>levels indicating that microglial activation contributes to the ROS increase although it is not clear whether this is directly due to astroglial activation or a secondary effect of dopaminergic cell death in the cultures.

In this study, we demonstrate that elevations in astrocytic MAO-B levels results in a relatively selective loss of dopaminergic SN neurons and the severity of this loss appears to be age-dependent. It is not clear why there was not a more dramatic increase in SN DA cell loss with age in the MAO-B transgenics. Normally, cell loss coincides with an age-related increase in MAO-B enzyme activity. Our results suggest that perhaps the elevation of MAO-B to aging levels in the young animals was sufficient on its own to produce significant cell loss and that the additional stress of an aging brain contributed marginally (yet significantly) to this effect. Observed cell loss was accompanied by increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and selective decreases in mitochondrial complex I activity in these cells along with local microglial activation all of which we assume contribute to subsequent cell death. These pathological alterations were found to correlate with a significant decrease in locomotory behavior. Our data, taken in total, demonstrates that elevations in levels of astrocytic MAO-B activity results in several of key pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>ROS produced by MAO-B-expressing astrocytes can be released into the extracellular environment and, due to its high membrane permeability, diffuse into neighboring cells. Within dopaminergic neurons, it can oxidize dopamine to DACHR which can interact with electrons at the auto-oxidizable site of mitochondrial complex I at a higher affinity than oxygen itself producing DACR radical. Electrons can then be transferred from DACR radical to oxygen resulting in re-reduction of DACR to DACHR and production of superoxide as part of an ongoing redox cycling event. These events are shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001616-g009">Figure 9</xref>. We have demonstrated in this current study that increased astrocytic MAO-B results in elevations in extracellular ROS levels and increased intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> within the terminals of SN dopaminergic neurons accompanied by increased dopamine oxidation to DACHR, selective mitochondrial complex I inhibition and elevations in mitochondrial superoxide levels. These events are prevented by either co-treatment with the MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl or the antioxidant compound EUK189 which also prevented subsequent dopaminergic SN cell loss.</p><fig id="pone-0001616-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001616.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>A schematic representation of the events occurring upon the elevation of glial MAO-B.</title><p>Increased astroglial levels of MAO-B results in elevation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels; this can be prevented by deprenyl.

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>can diffuse out of astroglia and into neighboring cells including local dopaminergic neurons and microglia; this can be prevented by EUK. Dopamine can be oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through dopamine quinone formation to stable dopaminochrome (DACHR). DACHR can extract an electron from the auto-oxidizable site of mitochondrial complex I forming DACR radical and impacting selectively on complex I function. Due its high affinity for molecular oxygen, DACR radical can pass an electron on to this molecular species resulting in its re-reduction to DACHR and increased formation of mitochondrial superoxide radical. MAO-B generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can also stimulate local microglia; microglial activation can be greatly secondarily enhanced within the SN due to dopaminergic cell demise which can also exacerbate ROS production and impact on local dopaminergic neurons.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001616.g009"/></fig><p>Another prominent feature noted in our model was local microglial activation within the nigrostriatum.
