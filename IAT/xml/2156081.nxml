A critical challenge is to understand the actions of these proteins in cells, especially in settings where multiple regulators are present. In a systematic study of the sequential multicomponent actin assembly processes that accompany endocytosis in yeast, we examined and compared the roles of WASp, two type-I myosins, and two other Arp2/3 activators, along with that of coronin, which is a proposed inhibitor of Arp2/3. Quantitative analysis of high-speed fluorescence imaging revealed individual functions for the regulators, manifested in part by novel phenotypes. We conclude that Arp2/3 regulators have distinct and overlapping roles in the processes of actin assembly that drive endocytosis in yeast. The formation of the endocytic actin patch, the creation of the endocytic vesicle, and the movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm display distinct dependencies on different Arp2/3 regulators. Knowledge of these roles provides insight into the in vivo relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>A branched network of growing actin filaments, pushing against a membrane, provides the force for certain cellular movements. The Arp2/3 complex plays a central role in this process by generating new filaments and branch points. A number of proteins bind to and, in some cases, regulate Arp2/3. It is important to determine, in the cell, the precise roles of each of the many Arp2/3 regulators in generating actin networks during a complex, multistep, cellular movement. In yeast, endocytosis occurs at the plasma membrane in association with the assembly and movement of cortical actin patches, which contain six Arp2/3 regulators. We have used the actin patch as a model system to determine the specific roles of these regulators during patch assembly and movement. We used high-speed video microscopy, coupled with computer-aided particle tracking, to monitor the movement of fluorescently labeled actin patches in cells with one or more mutations of the Arp2/3 regulators. The sensitivity of this technique allowed us to identify previously unappreciated functions for Arp2/3 regulators and to assign each of the regulators a specific role during actin patch assembly and movement. Our results demonstrate that Arp2/3 regulatory proteins play overlapping roles at certain stages of actin patch movement, but distinct roles at other stages. In addition, our results provide new insight into how the assembly of an actin filament networks powers the movement of endocytic vesicles away from the membrane.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Branched networks of actin filaments, nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex, power many cellular movements.

A key step in the formation of a branched actin filament network is the activation of the Arp2/3 complex, which nucleates a new actin filament from the side of an existing filament. This new growing filament pushes against the membrane. Arp2/3 normally exists in an inactive state and requires an activator protein to induce a large conformational change, which allows for nucleation of a new actin filament (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;).

In phase I, actin patches assemble at the cortex and display a limited amount of motion, as if tethered in place. Many proteins are recruited to the actin patch during this phase, including WASp/Las17 and endocytic adaptors Sla1, Sla2, and Pan1.

This defect was due in part to a decrease in the frequency with which Sla2-GFP patches left the origin and an increase in the time the patches spent at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">3</xref>C).

To address this question, we examined Abp1-GFP patch behavior in <italic>myo3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>myo5</italic>&#x00394; double mutants. MSD curves showed a severe defect in patch motility, with a nearly complete loss of movement away from the origin and an increase in median patch lifetime, when compared to wild-type or single-mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). The percentage of Abp1-GFP patches leaving the membrane was very small, and the lifetime of patches at the origin was greatly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">Figure 3</xref>F&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">3</xref>G). The number of patches leaving the membrane was not sufficient to permit a direct analysis of phase III movement.

The results are consistent with the previous observation of endocytosis defects in <italic>myo5</italic>&#x00394; but not <italic>myo3</italic>&#x00394; single mutants, and with multiple observations that <italic>myo5</italic>&#x00394; <italic>myo3</italic>&#x00394; double mutants are more severely affected in growth and endocytosis than either single mutant alone &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Arp2/3-Binding Regions of Type-I Myosin and WASp</title><p>To determine if the actin patch phenotypes of the type-I myosin null mutants, <italic>myo3</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>myo5</italic>&#x00394;, result from loss of Arp2/3 interaction, we truncated the acidic/DDW region of each type-I myosin. For Myo5, loss of the acidic/DDW region had no effect on phase I and II movement except for a small, statistically significant increase in movement in MSD plots of Sla2-GFP patch tracks aligned at the end of their lifetime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">Figure 3</xref>H&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">3</xref>J).

These results were a surprising contrast to those for the <italic>myo5</italic>&#x00394; null mutant, which had a strong defect in phase III and significant ones in phases I and II. For Myo3, a similar truncation of the acidic/DDW region had no effect on phase I or II of actin patch movement, which were examined with Sla2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">Figure 3</xref>H&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">3</xref>J), or on phase III, which was examined using Abp1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">Figure 3</xref>K&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g003">3</xref>M).

To be fair, the fluorescence of these foci of GFP-Las17 was weak, and Abp1-tdimer2 patch movement in these cells was defective. Therefore, it remains a possibility that Las17 may not normally leave the membrane with patches.</p><p>Our results with coronin address this question of how the patch moves through the cytoplasm. The coronin null mutant showed increased patch movement during phase III, which is consistent with the prediction from biochemical studies that coronin inhibits the activity of Arp2/3 complex. Yeast Arp2/3 complex is highly active in the absence of any activator when actin from yeast is used &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, so an inhibitor, namely coronin, may be quite important in this system. The loss of the capping protein resulted in a specific defect of phase III movement &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, which is also consistent with the model. Together, these results with WASp/Las17, coronin, and capping protein provide evidence that Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly powers the movements of phase III, which supports the relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for this process. Several key components of the dendritic nucleation model are known to be present on patches during phase III movement, including actin, the Arp2/3 complex, capping protein, and now WASp/Las17 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The location of actin filament nucleation and the orientation of the actin filaments during actin patch assembly and movement is an important question. When endocytosis is blocked in <italic>sla2</italic>&#x00394; cells, actin &#x0201c;comet tails&#x0201d; appear at the plasma membrane, with growing barbed ends oriented toward the membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is unclear where actin filaments are nucleated when endocytosis is proceeding normally, especially during invagination and during movement after the patch leaves the plasma membrane. No actin connection between the plasma membrane and a phase II or III patch can be seen. If filaments growing at the plasma membrane were responsible for this movement, the newest parts of the network would be at the membrane, and would likely be relatively bright when monitored by fluorescent fusion proteins. This is not the case. Previous results show that actin cables do not drive patch movement in the cytoplasm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore favor a model where actin filaments are being nucleated at the surface of the endocytic vesicle, during and after invagination<italic>.</italic></p><p>We observed some longer-lived GFP-Las17&#x02013;labeled particles moving in the interior of the cell without first seeing them leave the plasma membrane. For actin patches, this type of observation was very rare. Whether these GFP-Las17 particles represent a later stage of actin patches, endocytic vesicles, or another cellular compartment remains to be determined. The character of the movement of these particles is reminiscent of what has been seen by studying the membrane receptor Ste2 or the lipid dye FM4&#x02013;64, which follow endocytic trafficking pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. In previous studies, the movement of Ste2-GFP particles was impaired when WASp/Las17 was truncated or when Lsb6, a Las17-binding protein, was absent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060001-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, which also supports the hypothesis that Las17 is needed to drive Ste2 vesicles.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains.</title><p>The strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060001-st001">Table S1</xref> and their construction is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060001-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Microscopy.</title><p>For each genotype, two or three mutant and wild-type haploid segregants from a heterozygous diploid were tested.

GFP fluorescence movies were made using a spinning-disc confocal microscope system consisting of an upright microscope (BX52, Olympus) with a PlanApo100X 1.4 NA oil immersion objective, a CSU10 Yokogawa spinning disc head (Solomere Technology), and an intensified charge coupled device (CCD) video camera (XR Mega10 S30 camera, Stanford Photonics). Two color images were collected sequentially using a LMM5 Laser Merge Module (Spectral Applied Research), a multipass dichroic mirror, and emission filters in a Lambda 10&#x02013;3 high-speed filter wheel (Sutter Instruments). The temperature was maintained at 30 &#x000b0;C. Large budded cells were selected for observation. Images were collected from a single focal plane at the equator of the cell. Abp1-GFP, Abp1-tdimer2, Sla2-GFP, and GFP-Las17 movies were collected at frame rates of 5/s, 5/s, 2/s, and 2/s, respectively. For quantitative motion analysis, 200 consecutive frames were collected.

The experimenter verified every patch track using an ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) plug-in that overlaid the position information from the tracking software onto the original movie, and necessary corrections were made by hand. The data were then imported into an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft). Tracks were retained for analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) The patch was observed for at least 30 frames (6 s for Abp1-GFP and 15 s for Sla2-GFP). (2) The patch originated near the cortex. (3) The patch disappeared during the movie. (4) The patch was readily distinguished from other patches. These criteria enrich our sample for patches whose entire lifetime is captured in the movie. Zero time for a track was defined as the time at which the patch was first observed, and the end point was defined as the last time point at which the patch was observed.</p><p>The character and extent of the motion of GFP-labeled patches was analyzed first with plots of MSD versus time. To calculate MSD, the square of the distance of each patch from its origin was calculated at each time point. The squared displacement values were averaged for all the patches from all the cells of each segregant of a particular genotype. The degree of variation among individual tracks was high, as seen in previous studies, so we averaged the data for 150 to 542 patches for each genotype. To test for statistical significance, MSD curves from each segregant of one genotype were first compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to ensure that they yielded the same result. A grand MSD versus time plot was then generated, averaging the data for all of the patches from all of the segregants of a given genotype within one experiment. Before averaging, the squared displacement values for each patch were aligned at the beginning or end of the track lifetime. Examples of how a set of data was aligned in the two ways before averaging are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060001-g001">Figure 1</xref>C. Plots aligned &#x0201c;at the start&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;on the left&#x0201d; provide information about the behavior of patches in the early part of their life. These curves are truncated at the time when 50&#x00025; of the patches have disappeared, representing the median lifetime. Plots aligned &#x0201c;at the end&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;on the right&#x0201d; allow for a better understanding of the motion of GFP-labeled actin patches later in their lifetime, away from the origin. Comparisons between genotypes were evaluated using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>The patch tracking data were analyzed in additional ways. For individual patch track data of X-Y position and time, we determined if a patch left its origin and how long it remained at its origin before it moved away or disappeared. To analyze &#x0201c;phase II only&#x0201d; data after initiation of movement, the data for Sla2-GFP patches after they moved away from the origin were selected. MSD versus time plots were generated with these data. To analyze &#x0201c;phase III only,&#x0201d; we selected the data for Abp1-GFP labeled patches after they moved more than 200 nm away from the origin. MSD plots were generated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0060001-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Histogram of the Time between Sla2-GFP and Abp1-tdimer2 Recruitment to Actin Patches</title><p>All strains express Sla2-GFP and Abp1-tdimer2.
