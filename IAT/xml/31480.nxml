We report the discovery, characterization, and genomic context of a novel human NBC-like gene, <italic>SLC4A9</italic>, on chromosome 5q31.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><italic>SLC4A9</italic> was initially discovered by genomic sequence annotation and further characterized by sequencing of long-insert cDNA library clones. The predicted protein of 990 amino acids has 12 transmembrane domains and high sequence similarity to other NBCs. The 23-exon gene has 14 known mRNA isoforms. In three regions, mRNA sequence variation is generated by the inclusion or exclusion of portions of an exon. Noncoding <italic>SLC4A9</italic> cDNAs were recovered multiple times from different libraries. The 3' untranslated region is fragmented into six alternatively spliced exons and contains expressed <italic>Alu,</italic> LINE and MER repeats. <italic>SLC4A9</italic> has two alternative stop codons and six polyadenylation sites. Its expression is largely restricted to the kidney. <italic>In silico</italic> approaches were used to characterize two additional novel <italic>SLC4A</italic> genes and to place <italic>SLC4A9</italic> within the context of multiple paralogous gene clusters containing members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF), ankyrin (ANK) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) families. Seven human EGF-SLC4A-ANK-FGF clusters were found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The novel sodium bicarbonate cotransporter-like gene <italic>SLC4A9</italic> demonstrates abundant alternative mRNA processing. It belongs to a growing class of functionally diverse genes characterized by inefficient highly variable splicing. The evolutionary history of the EGF-SLC4A-ANK-FGF gene clusters involves multiple rounds of duplication, apparently followed by large insertions and deletions at paralogous loci and genome-wide gene shuffling.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The human sodium bicarbonate cotransporters (NBCs), along with the inorganic anion exchangers, comprise the <italic>SLC4A</italic> subfamily of proteins, a part of the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily. The coupled transport of Na<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> across the plasma membrane of epithelial cells is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH, intracompartmental pH, and intercompartmental pH gradients in many organ systems, as suggested by expression of NBCs in the kidney, pancreas, heart, retina, skeletal muscle and other organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Basolateral HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransport is necessary for proper buffering of digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. NBCs are also responsible for electrogenic transepithelial bicarbonate cotransport in kidney proximal tubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Five human NBC transcripts (<italic>SLC4A4-SLC4A8</italic>) have been previously cloned and mapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Most recently, <italic>NBC4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and <italic>SLC4A10</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have been cloned. We report the discovery and a genomic analysis of a sixth member of this family, <italic>SLC4A9</italic>, a novel and alternatively spliced NBC-like gene expressed at high levels in normal adult kidney. We also present an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the genomic structure of <italic>NBC4</italic> and evaluate conserved paralogous clustering of <italic>SLC4A</italic> genes with the members of the ankyrin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene families in the human genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation and genomic structure of <italic>SLC4A9</italic></title><p>As part of a positional cloning project, we became interested in a region of 5q31 between D5S393 and D5S2927. We annotated all draft and finished genomic sequence from this region using SeqHelp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Presubmission contig h174.3 of bacterial artificial chromosome (EAC) clone CTC-329D1 (now GenBank AC008438) included four regions of high translated sequence similarity with known mammalian NBCs. GeneFinder, Genie and GRAIL 1.3 predicted exons throughout the contig, including, but not limited to, the regions of NBC homology. We named the gene with the HUGO-approved symbol <italic>SLC4A9.</italic> It is currently represented by ten kidney clones and one testis clone from the IMAGE consortium (Unigene: Hs.166669). Two expressed sequence tag (EST) clones (IMAGE: 1734773 and 1533693) were sequenced to completion, yielding a 1,036 base pair (bp) cDNA contig. The ESTs were later found to cover exons 15-18 and 20B-D (1734773) and 20C-E (1533693) of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> when exons are numbered as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The assembled cDNA sequence matched an NBC-like portion of 329D1 and additional new sequence elsewhere on the genomic contig. The presumptive gap in the draft was closed by designing primers c67F and c67R from confirmed sequence and sequencing an approximately 1.8 kilobase (kb) PCR fragment from genomic DNA. The resulting 30,161-bp contig included known sequence from two pieces of 329D1, as well as 659 bp of new sequence.</p><p>Putative exons on the 12-kb h174.3 contig were defined by a consensus of multiple-algorithm exon predictions, NBC homologies, and IMAGE clone coverage. Primers were designed from flanking intronic sequences. Exons and adjoining splice sites were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA. Snonymous coding sequence polymorphisms 111046 C&#x02192;T and 115744 C&#x02192;T and intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 107724 A&#x02192;T were identified (all 329D1 sequence coordinates refer to positions on GenBank AC008438.1, GI no. 5686628).</p><p>To extend the known 5' portion of the gene's coding sequence, an adult human kidney library (Clontech, cat. no. HL5031t) and a &#x003bb;TriplEx2 long-insert fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech, cat. no. HL5504u) were probed with the two IMAGE clones. The libraries were also amplified with primers 5-LDA and oi-E (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates the genomic structure and splicing variation of <italic>SLC4A9</italic>. <italic>SLC4A9</italic> exon sizes vary from 56 bp (exon 4) to 263 bp (exon 9). Intron phase is distributed quite randomly in the 5' half of the sequence, although toward the 3' end of the gene, phase o introns become prevalent. The SNP in exon 10A is immediately adjacent to an alternatively used 5' splice site, but no correlation between the presence of exon 10B in cDNA clones and C or T at nucleotide 111,046 was observed. All introns conform to the GT-AG rule.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning the 5' end of the <italic>SLC4A9</italic> transcript</title><p>Two observations suggested to us that none of the known <italic>SLC4A9</italic> mRNA isoforms is full length: the open reading frames (ORFs) of all the isoforms start at the very first or second base at the 5' end of the clones, and the complete inserts of the clones are &#x02264; 3.6 kb, whereas the <italic>SLC4A9</italic> transcripts on northern blots are 4.3 and 6.0 kb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We therefore undertook a comprehensive effort to find the 5' end of <italic>SLC4A9</italic>.</p><p>The lack of full-length clones in the Clontech adult kidney cDNA library was not surprising, because the library was dT-primed and mostly contained inserts of under 3.8 kb in length (manufacturer's data). Therefore, we used PCR-based approaches to determine the sequence of the 5' end of the mRNA. Nested RACE-PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends with PCR) on Marathon kidney cDNA (Clontech) with four different primer combinations (three within known exons and one within a GeneFinder-predicted exon 5' of exon 1) and appropriate nested adaptor primers produced smears and multiple bands over several attempts. Analysis of the RACE products by sequencing the gel-extracted bands and random TA clones revealed 100% mispriming, even though the gene-specific RACE primers did not have any homologies to non-<italic>SLC4A9</italic> human sequence. The sequenced TA clones most frequently corresponded to mitochondrial DNA sequences and to the <italic>FBN2</italic> gene, which coincidentally maps to 5q23 centromeric of <italic>SLC4A9</italic>.</p><p>In addition to RACE on the Marathon cDNA, we used the Advantage 2 PCR technique (Clontech) on undiluted aliquots of the kidney and fetal brain long-insert phage libraries multiple times with all possible primer combinations of one vector primer (either forward or reverse) and one appropriately oriented gene-specific primer. All gene-specific RACE primers and all internal sequencing primers used during the determination of the complete sequences of the IMAGE clones were tried, one by one. With the exception of the three TA clones obtained with the oi-E primer, all such experiments resulted in 100% mispriming. This result was identical to that obtained when both gene-specific and random-primed reverse transcription, followed by RACE with the same multiple gene-specific primers as above, were performed on a non-Clontech sample of total RNA freshly extracted from a kidney biopsy. In summary, we have been unable to obtain a full-length <italic>SLC4A9</italic> transcript with current commercial RACE and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>The 5'-adjoining region of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> on 5q31</title><p>Despite the failure of experimental attempts to characterize the 5' end of <italic>SLC4A9, in silico</italic> analyses of the region expected to contain this portion of the gene have been informative. The gene immediately centromeric to, and 12,840 bp from, <italic>SLC4A9</italic> is <italic>HEGFL,</italic> which encodes a heparin-binding member of the EGF family. Genomic DNA sequence between the 5' end of <italic>HEGFL</italic> and exon 1 of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> provides some clues as to the structure of the 5' end of <italic>SLC4A9.</italic> A putative promoter on the <italic>SLC4A9</italic>-encoding strand was predicted by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories (LBL) neural network promoter prediction algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], with a score of 1.0 at bp 129,291-129,242 of AC008438.1. This sequence has been shown to have promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] on the strand opposite to the coding strand of <italic>SLC4A9.</italic> As <italic>HEGFL</italic> and <italic>SLC4A9</italic> are transcribed in opposite orientations and have 5' ends facing each other, the promoter may be bidirectional. Four possible exons are predicted 5' of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> by GeneFinder. However, neither protein homologies nor consensus Kozak sequences are seen in the region.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>SLC4A9</italic> expression, ortholog comparison and protein sequence analysis</title><p>Northern blot analysis reveals that expression of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> is extremely restricted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Transcripts of 4.3 and 6.0 kb are seen at high levels in kidney but not in any other tissues tested. This is consistent with the kidney origin of 10 of the 11 public ESTs corresponding to <italic>SLC4A9.</italic> The consistently smeary background, observed regardless of the probe and hybridization stringency, may be due to the presence of low levels of alternatively spliced <italic>SLC4A9</italic> mRNA variants.</p><p>While this manuscript was undergoing revision, the first mammalian <italic>SLC4A9</italic> ortholog, that in the rabbit, was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The rabbit gene encodes a sodium-independent anion exchanger; this underscores the importance of not assigning functions to NBC-like genes in the absence of experimental evidence. Similarly to human <italic>SLC4A9,</italic> the rabbit gene is alternatively spliced. Both the RACE-verified complete rabbit cDNA and our incomplete human cDNA are approximately 3.2 kb long. In rabbit this is, however, consistent with the size of the major transcript on the northern blots, and no transcripts over 3.8 kb are seen. In human, the known cDNA size is much less than the 4.3-kb and 6.0-kb signals on the northern blots. In the absence of major differences in coding sequence, this strongly suggests rapid evolution of species-specific 5' and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), which are longer in the human gene.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> summarizes the properties of six human NBC and NBC-like genes. <italic>NBC4</italic> and <italic>HNBC7</italic> were discovered during our <italic>in silico</italic> annotation of genomic sequences. <italic>NBC4</italic> has since been described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>SLC4A9</italic> has the most restricted expression pattern, evidenced by high tissue specificity and low dbEST representation.</p><p>The amino-acid sequence of the 990 amino acid SLC4A9 inferred from the major splice isoform was subjected to secondary structure and hydropathy analysis by TMPRED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Consistent with the results for NBC4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], SLC4A9 is predicted to be a 12-transmembrane protein with a relatively long (amino acids 1-265) cytoplasmic amino terminus and a shorter, also cytoplasmic, carboxyl terminus (amino acids 929-990). NetPhos v.2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] predicted several serine and threonine phosphorylation sites. The relative lengths of the cytoplasmic domains and the distribution of phosphorylation sites were strikingly similar to those observed for NBC4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The predicted transmembrane segments and phosphorylation sites are indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.</p><p>The predicted SLC4A9 protein aligns both to human (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and rat (data not shown) NBCs. SLC4A9 is most similar to SLC4A4 (49% identity) and SLC4A6 (48%), followed by NBC4 (44%) and SLC4A8 (43%). The exact extent of protein sequence similarity of HNBC7 to SLC4A9 cannot be determined since too little HNBC7 sequence can be inferred.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>SLC4A9</italic> as a part of an ancient, multiply duplicated EGF-SLC4A-ANK-FGF gene cluster</title><p>To identify gene clusters containing NBC-like SLC4A genes, we consolidated information from human radiation hybrid (RH) maps and the GSS and HTGS databases for seven SLC4A NBCs, 19 FGF family members, and 10 EGF family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The electronic mapping strategy involved anchoring genomic sequences that matched each gene to the GB4 RH map via RH-mapped sequence-tagged sites (STSs) or gene-based markers. The possibility that ankyrins might also be a part of this cluster was suggested by the presence of a novel ankyrin gene, <italic>ANKfc</italic> (from fetal cochlea), less than 100 kb distal to <italic>SLC4A9</italic> on 5q31. We were able to determine map positions for all five SLC4A, all four ANK, 9 of 10 EGF, and 17 of 19 FGF family members. All cases where members of at least two of the four families cluster are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>.</p><p>We used SLC4A family members to test the hypothesis that the origin and repeated duplication of the EGF-FGF cluster predated the human-mouse divergence. Four of the seven known SLC4A genes were found near either an EGF gene or an FGF gene, or both. The genomic location of EGF and FGF family members on human chromosome 5q conforms to the syntenic relationship with mouse chromosome 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Ten human genes belong to the EGF family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>HEGFL</italic> on 5q31, <italic>EGF</italic> on 4q25, <italic>TGFA</italic> (transforming growth factor &#x003b1;) on 2p13, and <italic>AREG</italic> (amphiregulin), <italic>EREG</italic> (epiregulin), and <italic>BTC</italic> (betacellulin) on 4q13-q21 are <italic>EGF</italic> paralogs. <italic>TDGF1</italic> (teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor), approximately 20.5 megabases (Mb) proximal to <italic>SLC4A7</italic> on 3p22, shares structural similarities with <italic>TGFA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Distance approximations are based on the sum of draft clone lengths and estimated gap sizes obtained from the Draft Human Genome Browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Three neuregulin genes (<italic>NRG1-3</italic>) are also in the EGF family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. All these genes have orthologs in the mouse, suggesting that multiple duplications of an ancestral EGF-like gene predated the mouse-human divergence. Nineteen known loci encode members of the FGF family, of which at least five map near EGF paralogs: <italic>FGF1</italic> on 5q31 (approximately 1.5 Mb distal of <italic>HEGFL</italic>), <italic>FGF2</italic> on 4q25 (approximately 14.7 Mb distal to <italic>EGF</italic>), <italic>FGF8</italic> on 10q25 (cytogenetically close to <italic>NRG3</italic>), <italic>FGF17</italic> on 8p21 (approximately 11.0 Mb distal to <italic>HGL</italic>), and <italic>FGF5</italic> on 4q21 (approximately 5.0 Mb from <italic>BTC</italic>). Mouse genes <italic>Btc</italic> and <italic>Fgf5</italic> are located close to each other in the region of mouse chromosome 5 syntenic to human 4q13-q21. The cluster size in the mouse is unknown because of the lack of sequence data.</p><p>As expected, a novel NBC-like gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] is located at 2p11-12 proximal to <italic>TGFA.</italic> The distance between the two genes is approximately 4.0 Mb. The protein sequence of NBC4 is similar to that of SLC4A9 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), but the genomic structures of the two genes differ. Exon boundaries are only partly conserved, and <italic>NBC4</italic> includes an intron of 20.5 kb, longer than the genomic sequence containing exons 1-20 of <italic>SLC4A9</italic>. Portions of the <italic>NBC4</italic> mRNA are completely identical to the expressed regions of two human genes on 2p13: <italic>DCTN1</italic> (dynactin, a homolog of the <italic>Drosophila p150Glued</italic> gene) and <italic>MTHFD2</italic> (methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Specifically, the 5'-UTR of <italic>NBC4</italic> matches 1,646 nucleotides of coding sequence and 87 nucleotides of the 3'-UTR of <italic>DCTN1,</italic> and the 3' UTR of <italic>NBC4</italic> matches 92 nucleotides of coding sequence and 75 nucleotides of the 3'-UTR of the published <italic>MTHFD2</italic> sequence. In addition, a 241 nucleotide overlap of <italic>NBC4</italic> and <italic>MTHFD2</italic> ESTs in the antisense orientation is inferred from annotation of GenBank AC073263. These ESTs correspond to alternate, extended 3'-UTR forms of the two genes, which are different from the 3'-UTRs of the published full-length mRNAs.</p><p>We used public genomic resources to determine whether chromosomal locations of genes from any one of the four families (EGF, SLC4A, ANK and FGF) can be used to predict the genomic location of novel members of the remaining families. Ankyrins mapped near several known EGF ligand and/or FGF genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In particular, on chromosome 4q25, <italic>ANK2</italic> is located between <italic>EGF</italic> and <italic>FGF2,</italic> and <italic>EGF</italic> is proximal to <italic>FGF2;</italic> this gene ordering is supported both by the Human BAC Accession Map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and direct HTGS-to-GB4 RH mapping. It was therefore not surprising to discover a novel ankyrin, <italic>ANKfc,</italic> immediately distal to <italic>SLC4A9,</italic> and thus distal to the <italic>EGF</italic> paralog <italic>HEGFL,</italic> on 5q31.</p><p>Searching the HTGS database with human NBC and NBC-like cDNA queries yielded draft-phase genomic sequences (AL139426, AC018411, AC064816) similar to some, but identical to none, of the five HNBC genes described above (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). NBC-homologous exons from these sequences were combined with Unigene cluster Hs.211115 to predict yet another novel sodium bicarbonate cotransporter-like gene, <italic>HNBC7.</italic> This gene maps to 1p31-32, where no EGF-FGF cluster is currently known to exist. Similarly, <italic>SLC4A8</italic> is at 12q13, where no EGF-FGF cluster is yet known.</p><p>To test our hypothesis that the dispersed paralogous gene clusters are a product of multiple ancient duplications, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the EGF, SLC4A, and FGF genes we believe to fall in the clusters, along with their non-human orthologs. Neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods were used to construct phylogenetic trees for each of the gene families (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a-c</xref>). This enabled us to infer the most likely history of the cluster duplications (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>).</p><p>Two irregularities in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref> are interesting from the standpoint of genomic history of duplicated genes. <italic>NRG2</italic> at 5q31 is phylogenetically closer to the 8p gene <italic>NRG1</italic> than to any other EGF gene, yet that relationship makes little sense if the duplication giving rise to clusters at 4q13 and 5q13 is far more ancient than that giving rise to the 8p and l0q clusters, as the EGF and FGF data suggest. The location of <italic>NRG2</italic> at 5q31 is therefore noteworthy because only single members of the other families are present there and because <italic>NRG2</italic> is phylogenetically very distant from the 5q EGF gene (<italic>HBEGF</italic>), making either multigene or single-gene tandem duplications within 5q highly unlikely. This product of a very recent duplication involving the 8p <italic>NRG1</italic> gene may have been deposited at 5q31 as a random insertion of a newly duplicated gene away from its ancestral locus, in a process similar to that which deposited some SLC4A genes outside of their ancestral paralogous clusters. In addition, the history of the 2p cluster is somewhat obscure, as the 2p EGF gene is closest to the EGF gene at 4q27, whereas the 2p SLC4A gene is closest to the SLC4A at 4q13 (as no SLC4A gene is currently known to exist at 4q27). With the exception of these irregularities, the duplication history in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref> is very well supported by the gene family trees in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a-c</xref> and the full PHYLIP trees (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Alternative splicing of <italic>SLC4A9</italic></title><p>The existence of multiple cDNA sequences as a result of alternative splicing is the most interesting feature of <italic>SLC4A9.</italic> Most <italic>SLC4A9</italic> alternative splicing is accounted for by the selective inclusion or exclusion of portions of exons 8, 10, 11, 19 and 20. In contrast to these alternatively spliced portions of the gene, the use of exons 4-7, 9 and 12-17 appears to be a constant feature of the various isoforms. No splice variation is observed for these exons in any cDNA clones or dbEST entries examined, with the exception of the fetal brain clone, in which exon 12 contains extra sequence from the 5'-adjoining intron.</p><p>All intron-exon junctions of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> feature consensus splice site sequences. Therefore, alternative splicing of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> is not consistent with the hypothesis that weak or nonconsensus splice sites lead to intron retention or alternative splicing. Instead, yet-undetermined <italic>cis</italic>-acting intronic sequences may be responsible. The recurrent noncoding <italic>SLC4A9</italic> transcripts may escape the normal mechanisms of nonsense decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] responsible for degradation of incorrectly spliced mRNAs with disrupted ORFs.</p><p>Of all alternative splicing in humans, only 20% occurs within coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. <italic>SLC4A9</italic> may be a member of a class of genes characterized by highly variant and inefficient splicing, a class first suggested by a comparison of ESTs to genomic sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The high degree of alternative splicing of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> may be the result of inefficient spliceosomal processing. One possible outcome of such inefficiency, IMAGE clone 2130425, is not included in the 14 isoforms on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. This nonlinearly spliced clone includes unique exons dissimilar to any exons of any other <italic>SLC4A9</italic> cDNAs. A unique fragment in the exon 10-11 region is followed by a correctly spliced exon 11B and a part of exon 12, which splices backwards from a unique donor site to a unique partial version of exon 9, and continues directly to a unique fragment of exon 20, terminating at the common late polyadenylation signal.</p><p>The 3'-UTR of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> is fragmented into six alternatively spliced exons, of which no more than two appear to be used per isoform and four harbor polyadenylation signals within expressed repetitive elements. Two alternate 3'-terminal untranslated exons of <italic>SLC4A9</italic>, exons 21 and 23, consist entirely of repetitive elements, except for a 10-nucleotide spacer in exon 23. The two polyadenylation sites within exon 20 are used at roughly equal frequencies, both in experimentally derived clones and public EST sequences corresponding to <italic>SLC4A9.</italic> Alternative polyadenylation is observed in fewer than 29% of human genes, based on an analysis of 8,700 human 3'-UTRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The structurally invariant carboxy-terminal 591 amino acids of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> include the 12 transmembrane domains characteristic of sodium bicarbonate transporters. The alternatively spliced amino-terminal portion of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> contains hydrophilic domains of unknown function. It is possible that alternative splicing of these domains leads to different spatial or electrochemical specificity. For example, in chick cochlea, different transcripts produced by alternative splicing of the <italic>SLO</italic> gene (homolog of <italic>Drosophila slowpoke</italic>) generate kinetically distinct calcium-activated potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that proteins encoded by the alternative <italic>SLC4A9</italic> transcripts might differ in stoichiometry or in the minimum voltage potential threshold required to activate cotransporter function.</p></sec><sec><title>SLC4A9 protein sequence: comparison to paralogous genes</title><p>Four large blocks of highly conserved amino acid sequence characterize all known HNBCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). They correspond to SLC4A9 amino acid positions 68-210, 223-352, 384-578 and 629-960. At both ends of blocks 68-210 and 629-960, at the carboxy-terminal end of block 384-578, and throughout block 223-352, SLC4A9 has significant sequence differences from most or all of the paralogs. Non-SLC4A9 proteins in the alignment have considerably greater homology between themselves in the equivalent regions than they do with SLC4A9.</p><p>The exon 8 and exon 10-11 hypervariably spliced regions correspond to SLC4A9 amino acid positions 353-494 and 583-702, respectively. It is intriguing that short amino-terminal portions of both of these regions (amino acids 353-383 and amino acids 583-631) are located in areas where the sequences of the paralogs are quite diverged. Extensive alternative splicing in these areas has not been reported for the other paralogs.</p><p>Alternately used exon 10d contains an almost perfect 41 nucleotide polypyrimidine tract. This region consists exclusively of Cs and Ts, except for the A at position 110,655 of AC008438.1. It codes for FFSLLLFLTSFFF, a highly hydrophobic stretch predicted by TMPRED to be within the sixth transmembrane domain of the protein. Exon 10D is absent from three <italic>SLC4A9</italic> cDNA isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) whose ORFs are not disrupted except for the deletion of the 53 amino acids corresponding to this fragment. TMPRED analysis suggests that absence of exon 10D abrogates the sixth transmembrane domain but does not affect the 11 remaining transmembrane segments. Consequently, isoforms lacking exon 10D would be predicted to have an extracellular carboxyl terminus. The biological viability and function, if any, of such a protein cannot be known without biochemical analyses. However, the extracellular exposition of the normally hidden carboxyl terminus might be relevant to autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Dispersed paralogous gene clusters containing <italic>SLC4A</italic> genes</title><p>Four human SLC4A genes are each included in a conserved gene cluster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). On 5q31, <italic>SLC4A9</italic> is located between genes encoding <italic>HEGFL</italic> and <italic>FGF1</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The murine orthologs of <italic>HEGFL</italic> and <italic>FGF1</italic> are in close proximity on mouse chromosome 18, suggesting that an as-yet-undescribed mouse ortholog of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> may be located in the same region. This putative mouse ortholog of <italic>SLC4A9</italic>, partly contained in the BAC clone RG-MBAC_173P21 (GenBank AC027276), has 82-96% similarity to the human gene over 1897 nucleotides. Almost all exon boundaries are conserved between the coding portions of the mouse gene and <italic>SLC4A9</italic> isoform I. However, exon 4 of human <italic>SLC4A9</italic> does not appear in mouse.</p><p>Novel human <italic>SLC4A9</italic> paralogs may be predicted on the basis of the genomic locations of the EGF-FGF clusters. The clusters in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> that contain the members of at least two of the other three gene families may also contain yet-uncharacterized SLC4A genes. Only a deeper sequence coverage of human EST libraries and draft genomic sequences will help determine if this hypothesis is correct. Ancient conserved paralogous clusters involving multiple functionally unrelated genes have been previously suggested to exist in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, the existence of some SLC4A genes outside conserved clusters suggests that intra-cluster rearrangements may have led to the expulsion of these genes from the conserved clusters. Yet other SLC4A duplication mechanisms may have complemented both the cluster duplication and the subsequent rearrangements.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic implications of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> splicing and structure</title><p>The genomic structure of <italic>SLC4A9</italic> raises intriguing questions. What properties are unique to tissue-specific, repeat-expressing, alternatively spliced genes? Are introns containing repetitive elements spliced out more efficiently than introns without repeats, as appears to be the case for <italic>SLC4A9</italic>? What spliceosomal properties are responsible for frequent unconventional processing, in this case of four exons (8, 10, 11 and 20)? How did the repetitive elements 3' of the coding region become incorporated into the splicing framework of the gene?</p><p><italic>SLC4A9</italic> is a case study in the complexities of splicing. To identify such complexities, automated computational approaches to analyzing the structures of novel genes will have to incorporate full-length sequences of multiple long-insert cDNA clones. It is not known how many riddles similar to <italic>SLC4A9</italic> there will be in the complete human genome sequence. Their very existence suggests, however, that individually characterizing and understanding numerous unconventional genes will be a major challenge.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>PCR-based screening of cDNA libraries</title><p>PCR with the Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix was performed in 50-&#x003bc;l volumes.

The known 990 amino acid carboxy-terminal portion of SLC4A9 isoform I is shown, preceded by spaces. The longest publicly available protein sequence was selected for SLC4A4/A5, SLC4A6/A7 and SLC4A8. Spaces indicate undetermined amino-terminal portions of SLC4A9 and undetermined amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal portions in the currently available HNBC7 sequence. Dashes indicate known gaps or known absence of sequences at indicated positions. White on black background, identity across most or all of the proteins shown.

Phylogenetic trees were constructed for each of the three gene families using four methods per family: neighbor-joining with uncorrected p, neighbor-joining with gamma correction, neighbor-joining with Poisson correction, and maximum parsimony. Non-bootstrap and 100-bootstrap inputs were used for each of the four methods. Therefore, 24 phylogenetic trees were constructed altogether. All phylogenetically informative orthologs known for each of the human genes were used. Human genes in the three families that did not map to any of the seven cluster loci are not shown. Alignments in MSF (text) format and the trees produced by PHYLIP from them can be found as additional data files available with the online version of this article. An intuitive interpretation of the unrooted trees is presented in a simplified cladogram format. Unlabeled nodes were supported by all four methods used. In (d), I, II, and III refer to three consecutive rounds of local duplication at the locus ancestral to 4q13. Nodes indicated by an asterisk (*) are supported solely by the three neighbor-joining trees. Nodes indicated by a hash mark (#) are supported by neighbor-joining with either gamma or Poisson correction only.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2001-2-4-research0011-6"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Selected primers used for the amplification, cloning and sequencing of <italic>SLC4A9</italic></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Primer name</td><td align="left">Sequence (5' to 3')</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">oi-A</td><td align="left">CGGGGCTCAGGACCTTTTAATG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">oi-B</td><td align="left">ACTCCTACTCCAGCTAATTC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">oi-C</td><td align="left">CTCTGAATCTTCACTGTCAC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">oi-D</td><td align="left">TGAAGAGGTGGACCCTGGTC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">oi-E</td><td align="left">AGATGGAGGCTCCTGTAAGG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">oi-F</td><td align="left">ACTCATTCAGTGGAAGTGAC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">6797up</td><td align="left">CCAGGACTGAGGAGAAGTCG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">5219up</td><td align="left">TTGGCAGAGGCACCCGTAGG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">345F</td><td align="left">GGTCCTCTGCCTACGGGTGCC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">345R</td><td align="left">GGATGACTGCTGTGATCTGTTG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">5-LDA</td><td align="left">CTCGGGAAGCGCGCCATTGTGTTGGT</td></tr><tr><td align="left">3-LDA</td><td align="left">ATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGCC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Unigene F</td><td align="left">CTGCAAGGCGATTAAGTTGGGTAAC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Unigene R</td><td align="left">GTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">c67F</td><td align="left">CATTTCTGTGAATTAGCTGGAGTAG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">c67R</td><td align="left">CGACTGAGCATCTGGAAGTTAAG</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Human Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporter and cotransporter-like genes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Gene name (and common aliases)</td><td align="center">Longest coding mRNA sequence (in nucleotides) (with GenBank accession number)</td><td align="center">Genomic sequence (GenBank accession number)</td><td align="center">Chromosomal location</td><td align="center">Number of known ESTs<sup>*</sup></td><td align="left">Tissues/organs/cell types where expression is shown by ESTs nad/or northern blots (order: normal tissues;
