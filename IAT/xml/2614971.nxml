Current estimates suggest that nearly half of the global population is at risk of malaria and there are annually approximately 250 million cases resulting in a million deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, <italic>An. gambiae </italic>vectors o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), a single-stranded (+) RNA virus (Togaviridae; Alphavirus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Symptoms of ONNV infection in humans include rash, fever and polyarthritis often resulting in high morbidity rates during epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although most arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are vectored by culicine mosquitoes, ONNV is primarily vectored by the anopheline mosquitoes <italic>An. gambiae </italic>and <italic>An. funestus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In spite of the unusual vector specificity, ONNV shares a common host cell entry mechanism with many other arboviruses. Endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the host's membrane in the endosome are exploited by ONNV to infect host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Alphaviruses, including ONNV, Sindbis virus, and Chikungunya virus have class II fusion proteins such as E glycoproteins that mediate membrane fusion between virus and host cells during virus entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Class II E glycoproteins mainly consist of beta sheet-folded domains while class I E proteins are &#x003b1;-helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Since membrane fusion is one of the protein maturation processes mediated by molecular chaperones, such as the HSP70 family, it is possible that HSP70 may enhance or suppress maturation of viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Members of the HSP70 family contain three conserved domains: an ATPase domain at the N-terminus, a peptide binding domain, and a GP-rich region at the C-terminus that contains an EEVD motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. HSP70, a molecular chaperone, changes its conformation in an ATP dependent manner to mediate proper target protein folding, degradation and translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The carboxy-terminal EEVD motif is a unique feature of cytosolic heat shock proteins that is recognized by chaperone cofactors to initiate chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) is a constitutively expressed member of the HSP70 family and functions as a molecular chaperone under normal cellular conditions. However, the expression of the HSC70 gene may be increased in response to environmental and physiological stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>An. gambiae </italic>HSC70B is an ortholog of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>Hsc70-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. cDNA microarray studies demonstrated that HSC70B is upregulated during ONNV infection in adult <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, suggesting an important role during virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The functional importance of HSC70B upregulation in ONNV-infected female <italic>An. gambiae </italic>was further elucidated by RNAi gene silencing of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Reduction of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>transcript by RNAi silencing enhanced ONNV replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. Likewise, enhanced ONNV replication in HSC70B-knockdown mosquitoes suggests that HSC70 proteins play an important role in arbovirus suppression and maintaining homeostasis during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>To further elucidate the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>locus in response to viral infection, we characterized the 5' upstream region of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>coding sequence <italic>ex vivo </italic>using cell culture and luciferase reporter systems. Herein, we report the identification of a regulatory region essential for <italic>hsc70B </italic>transcription. Furthermore, the kinetic properties of <italic>hsc70B </italic>transcription during arbovirus infections were examined with ONNV (Togaviridae; Alphavirus), West Nile virus (Flaviviridae; Flavivirus) and La Crosse virus (Bunyaviridae; Orthobunyavirus). The results showed that the <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter region was responsive to all three arboviruses. Induction of <italic>hsc70B </italic>transcription by three taxonomically different arboviruses suggests that the HSC70B protein may be expressed to cope with cellular stress imposed during infection. The biological implications of these data are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence analysis of the 5' upstream of <italic>hsc70B</italic></title><p>Transcription factor binding elements along the 5'-upstream sequence of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>gene (2559 bp) were analyzed <italic>in silico</italic>.

Deletions of 449 bp, 975 bp, 1649 bp and 2267 bp from the 5' end of the full length promoter produced pGL3-2.2k, pGL3-1.6k, pGL3-0.9k and pGL3-0.3k, respectively.

This enhanced <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter activity in ONNV-infected cells appeared to occur with increasing ONNV titers at 48 and 72 hpi.

Of particular interest in this result is the transcriptional regulation of <italic>hsc70B </italic>expression in response to ONNV infection in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. To map and characterize the promoter activity of <italic>hsc70B</italic>, the upstream region up to 2599 bp from the putative starting codon of <italic>hsc70B </italic>was subjected to a luciferase reporter assay. Initially, the 2599 bp upstream sequence of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>showed a promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Subsequent deletion analysis of this region revealed that the regulatory elements critical for <italic>hsc70B </italic>transcription reside between 2150 ~ 1615 bp upstream of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>starting codon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Deletion of this 535 bp region abolished the promoter activity of <italic>hsc70B</italic>. This regulatory region contains several binding sites for transcription factors such as HSE-bind, CRE, NF-&#x003ba;B, dorsal, and Ftz (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). HSE is a binding site for heat shock transcription factors that are activated in response to environmental and physical stresses such as heat shock and microbial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In <italic>hsc70B</italic>, there is one putative HSE consisting of a block of three repeats of a 5-bp sequence, 5'-nGAAn-3'. Although the number of HSE blocks can vary among different HSPs, the 5-bp HSE repeat is highly conserved in the regulatory region of various heat shock proteins such as <italic>hsp70</italic>, <italic>hsp83</italic>, and <italic>hsp27 </italic>in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The second and third repeat in the HSE block of <italic>An. gambiae hsc70B </italic>has a tail-to-tail (5'nTTCnnGAAn3') arrangement with 6-bp gaps between them (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila </italic>HSPs, there are 5 or less gaps, if any, between the 5-bp repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It will thus be interesting to learn how the additional gap in <italic>An. gambiae hsc70B </italic>regulates <italic>hsc70B </italic>expression.</p><p>CRE is a response element for phosphorylated CREB (c-AMP response element-binding protein) which regulates transcription of genes. CREB is involved in human hsp90 gene expression which is constitutively expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, CRE may be a key element to induce basic transcription of <italic>An. gambiae hsc70B </italic>gene as it is also a constitutively expressed member of HSPs. NF-&#x003ba;B is a transcription factor which responds to stresses including viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Transcription of NF-&#x003ba;B was shown to be increased by downregulation of HSC70B protein in rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Ftz is a transcription factor that was originally isolated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. It has many orthologs in various species and is involved in <italic>fushi tarazu </italic>gene expression which functions in embryonic segmentation in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and sex determination in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Further biochemical and molecular characterization using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and DNase I protection assay should elucidate key elements that transcriptionally regulate <italic>An. gambiae hsc70B </italic>expression in response to ONNV infection. These assays will further improve our understanding of transcriptional regulation of <italic>hsc70B</italic>, and facilitate the identification of transcriptional factors and co-factors in the signal transduction pathway of <italic>hsc70B </italic>expression.</p><p>ONNV was used to infect Vero cells to examine the effects on <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter activity. The different lengths, 2150 bp and 2599 bp, of the 5' upstream sequences were tested because these two constructs contain the regulatory sequence for the basic transcription of <italic>hsc70B</italic>. Both 2150 bp and 2599 bp upstream genomic fragments responded to ONNV infection and the promoter activities of both constructs increased during ONNV infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). When Vero cells were transfected with either pGL3-2.6k or pGL3-2.2k reporter plasmid, the promoter activity in the reporter plasmids was about 2-fold higher in infected cells than the uninfected control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This suggests that induction of <italic>An. gambiae hsc70B </italic>gene, leading to expression of the HSC70B protein, results from virus infection. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that cellular signals are transduced to the regulatory region of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>locus in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>.</p><p>The 2150-bp 5' upstream sequence was used to further investigate the effects of ONNV infection on the <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter activity at different time points after infection. The promoter activity of <italic>hsc70B </italic>was significantly higher in infected cells at later time points (48 and 72 hpi) than earlier points (1 and 24 hpi) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The elevated <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter activity corresponded with increasing viral titers at 48 and 72 hpi because plaque assays of the cell culture media showed higher ONNV titers at these later time points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These plaque assay data were further evaluated by observing CPE in ONNV-infected Vero cells. CPE became apparent at 48 and 72 hpi in Vero cells while uninfected control cells did not show cell lysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The appearance of CPE in ONNV-infected Vero cells corresponded to higher ONNV titers at 48 and 72 hpi. It can be thus inferred that induction of <italic>hsc70B </italic>transcription may be triggered in response to cellular stresses burdened by rapidly replicating viruses. In cells at immediate or early infection stages, <italic>hsc70B </italic>expression may not be activated.</p><p>The inducibility of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter was also examined using two additional arboviruses, WNV (Flaviviridae) and LACV (Bunyaviridae). Like ONNV, both WNV and LACV were also able to upregulate the transcription activity of <italic>hsc70B </italic>during infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Due to more rapid kinetics of replication, both WNV and LACV caused the <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter activity to rise earlier than ONNV. For example, WNV-infected Vero cells started to show transcriptional induction as early as 24 hpi. Transcriptional activation of <italic>hsc70B </italic>by three different arboviruses suggests that upregulation of <italic>hsc70B </italic>expression indeed results from cellular stresses caused by virus infection in host cells. In addition, activation of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter by virus infection was recently shown in shrimp (<italic>Penaeus monodon</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Using a luciferase reporter in Sf21 cells, Chuang <italic>et al</italic>. (2007) demonstrated 5.5-fold induction of the shrimp <italic>hsc70B </italic>promoter when the Sf21 cells were infected with <italic>Autographa californica </italic>multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (Ac<italic>M</italic>NPV; MOI = 0.1). Therefore, it appears that induction of <italic>hsc70B </italic>expression may be a general cellular response of host cells to virus infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We previously reported that the transcriptional activation of <italic>hsc70B </italic>in ONNV-infected <italic>An. gambiae </italic>renders the mosquito an ability to repress ONNV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These <italic>in vivo </italic>findings and our current <italic>ex vivo </italic>characterization of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>regulatory region unequivocally indicate that the induction of HSC70B may be a mosquito innate immune response against virus infection. To support this hypothesis, mosquito cells (e.g., C6/36 cells from <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>) do not show any CPE during arbovirus infection while mammalian cells including Vero cells display prominent CPE and subsequent cell lysis due to overreplication of viruses. Evolutionally, mosquitoes may have acquired the ability to maintain viral titers below a certain threshold, below which mosquitoes may serve as arboviral vectors without pathogenesis from viral infections. Interestingly, a potent antiviral drug, prostaglandin A, showed antiviral effects against Sendai or Sindbis virus through induction of HSP70 proteins in AGMK cells (African green monkey kidney) or Vero cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore, comparative studies on HSP expression in response to viral infection between mosquito and mammalian cells will provide a deeper insight into innate immune responses to viral infection between mosquito vectors and mammalian hosts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of <italic>An. gambiae hsc70B </italic>promoter-luciferase reporter gene</title><p>The 2599 bp 5' region upstream of the putative starting codon of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>gene was amplified from BAC clone 132E18 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org"/> by a PCR method using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB, MA).

Briefly, Vero cells (ATCC: CCL-81) were seeded and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well. When the cells reached ~80% confluency, the culture media was removed and 200 &#x003bc;l of fresh DMEM without antibiotics or fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added. The cells were then co-transfected with 400 ng of pGL3 firefly (<italic>Photinus pyralis</italic>) luciferase constructs containing varying lengths of the <italic>hsc70B </italic>upstream region (<italic>e.g</italic>., pGL3-2.6k, pGL3-2.2k, pGL3-1.6k, pGL3-0.9k, pGL3-0.3k, or pGL3-Basic) and 0.05 ng of a pRL-cmv <italic>Renilla reniformis </italic>luciferase construct. The pRL-cmv construct was used as an internal control, in which the <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase expression is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (cmv). Because the pGL3-Basic is a promoterless reporter plasmid containing only the coding sequence of firefly luciferase it served as a background control. At 3 h post transfection, the transfection mixture was replaced with a complete medium including 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 10% FBS. Cells were harvested at pre-defined time points post transfection. The luciferase activities were measured by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of the luminescent signals was performed using a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek, USA). In order to account for heterogeneous transfection efficiencies and cell viabilities among different samples, the firefly luminescence values were normalized as a ratio of the <italic>Renilla </italic>luminescence values. A minimum of three biological replicates were included for the time course experiments with ONNV. For time course experiments with WNV and LACV, the mean values and standard deviations were calculated from four biological replicates out of six replicates. The largest and the smallest values from these replicates were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Viruses</title><p>The SG650 strain of ONNV has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The WNV isolate (LA-11-2005) was isolated by BDB from the brain tissue of a blue jay (<italic>Cyanocitta cristata</italic>) found in New Iberia, LA during 2005. A cloacal swab from the bird tested positive for WNV by the Rapid Analyte Measurement Platform (RAMP, Adapco, Inc.). Subsequent nucleic acid amplification and sequencing of the PreM-Envelope region of the isolate confirmed the RAMP identification (GenBank Accession Number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ646699">DQ646699</ext-link>). The virus was isolated in Vero cells and had not been further passaged.

For ONNV, confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected at an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 0.001. The infected cells were harvested at predetermined time points (<italic>e.g</italic>., 1, 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection) during time course experiments. Otherwise, the cells were harvested at 60 h post infection when CPE were evident. For the WNV and LACV time course experiments, confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 and the infected cells were harvested at 1, 24, 36 and 48 hpi.
