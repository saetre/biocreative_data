In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> a possible genetic link between Sir2 and the insulin/IGF-1 pathway has been reported. Here we investigate such a link in mammals. We show that Sirt1 positively regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells. Sirt1 represses the uncoupling protein (UCP) gene UCP2 by binding directly to the UCP2 promoter. In &#x003b2; cell lines in which Sirt1 is reduced by SiRNA, UCP2 levels are elevated and insulin secretion is blunted. The up-regulation of UCP2 is associated with a failure of cells to increase ATP levels after glucose stimulation. Knockdown of UCP2 restores the ability to secrete insulin in cells with reduced Sirt1, showing that UCP2 causes the defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Food deprivation induces UCP2 in mouse pancreas, which may occur via a reduction in NAD (a derivative of niacin) levels in the pancreas and down-regulation of Sirt1. Sirt1 knockout mice display constitutively high UCP2 expression.

Insulin is part of an organismal physiological axis in which it stimulates glucose uptake in metabolic tissues, such as muscle, and stores energy in the form of fat in white adipose tissue (WAT). Short-term food limitation (i.e., overnight &#x0005b;O/N&#x0005d; fasting) will therefore elicit the mobilization of glycogen stores and then fat from WAT for metabolism, and the lower level of blood glucose during fasting will result in low levels of insulin production by &#x003b2; cells.</p><p>Long-term calorie restriction (CR) has been known for 70 years to extend the life span of mammals dramatically &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, and it can also work in a variety of organisms, including yeast, flies, and rodents &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, although the mechanism of this effect has remained obscure. In mammals a characteristic set of physiological changes takes place during long-term CR, which overlaps the rapid physiological adaptations to short-term food limitation.

In addition, gluconeogenesis is activated in the liver. These changes keep glucose available for the brain, and are closely associated with the longevity elicited by CR.

The homolog of the yeast silencing information regulator2 (Sirt1) has also been implicated in several aspects of food limitation and CR in mammals. In WAT, Sirt1 represses the key regulatory protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x003b3;), resulting in fat mobilization in response to food limitation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

UCPs belong to a family of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins. They function to uncouple oxygen consumption during respiration from the production of ATP by allowing proton leakage down an electrochemical gradient from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our findings suggest that UCP2 is thus used in &#x003b2; cells to modulate the insulin response pathway as a function of diet. The fact that Sirt1 is a positive regulator of insulin may seem surprising, in light of the fact that <italic>sir-2.1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> appears to be a negative regulator of the insulin-like signaling pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

A representative islet is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g001">Figure 1</xref>A (see lower left panel for hematoxylin-eosin staining).

First, we determined whether Sirt1 KO mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; showed any defects in the pancreatic &#x003b2; cells or the islets. Pancreases from wild-type, Sirt1+/&#x02212; heterozygotes, or Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; KO mice (4&#x02212;5 each) were sectioned and stained with antibodies against insulin (blue), glucagons (red), and somatostatin (green). These stains mark islets for &#x003b2; cells, &#x003b1; cells, and &#x003b4; cells, respectively. As shown in a typical section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), no differences were observed in the staining pattern of these three markers between wild-type and mutant islets. We measured pancreatic islet areas using Image-Pro 4.1 Plus software, and expressed the islet areas as a percentage of the total pancreatic area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). There were no significant differences in islet areas comparing wild-type, heterozygous, and KO mice. The absolute islet size was also not appreciably different in the mutant mice.</p><p>Next, we determined whether insulin production was altered in Sirt1 KO mice. Blood insulin was measured in males 2&#x02013;4 mo old fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> or after 18 h of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Sirt1 KO mice (black bars) had much lower blood levels of insulin compared with littermate control animals (open bars) when the samples were collected under <italic>ad libitum</italic> conditions. This difference was also observed when the animals were starved O/N, in which case insulin levels were very low in both wild-type and KO mice. To assess more precisely the ability of animals to produce insulin, mice were given an injection of glucose after O/N starvation and insulin was measured after 2, 10, and 20 min. Whereas insulin induction was clearly evident in the wild-type mice at 10 min (open bars), induction was not observed in Sirt1 KO animals (black bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, <italic>n</italic> = 4 or 5 for each measurement). A similar trend was noted at 20 min.</p><p>To further investigate the defect in insulin production, islets from four wild-type or four Sirt1 KO animals were isolated and incubated in vitro with or without glucose for 1 h, and insulin secretion was determined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, the basal level of insulin secreted into the media from islets of Sirt1 KO mice (black bars) was significantly lower than wild-type controls (open bars). Moreover, the islets isolated from Sirt1 KO mice were not induced to secrete insulin by glucose, while control islets were inducible, as expected.</p><p>Levels of blood glucose were then determined and, surprisingly, were lower in Sirt1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Further, these mice appeared to be hypermetabolic, since they ate more food per body weight than the wild-type (unpublished data). These findings suggested that the KO mice had a better ability to use the lower levels of insulin for glucose uptake, i.e., were more insulin sensitive. To address this possibility, we performed glucose tolerance tests in both wild-type and KO mice by injecting glucose intraperitoneally and measuring the kinetics of glucose clearance from the blood. The KO mice cleared the glucose significantly faster than the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). This increased glucose tolerance explains why the KO mice maintained lower levels of blood glucose, even with reduced levels of insulin. The surprising effect of knocking out Sirt1 on glucose tolerance likely derives from tissues other than the pancreas and is currently being investigated in greater detail. In summary, we do not know whether the reduction in insulin in Sirt1 KO mice is due to a &#x003b2; cell defect or is an indirect consequence of increased glucose tolerance in these animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sirt1 Drives Glucose-Induced Insulin Secretion in Cultured Cells</title><p>To address whether Sirt1 played a positive role in insulin production specifically in &#x003b2;-cells, the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell lines, INS-1 from rat, and MIN6 from mouse were employed.

Because the insulin receptor is part of an autocrine induction loop for insulin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, we also determined by Western blot the levels of this receptor (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits) and observed no difference between control and knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Next, we investigated whether Sirt1 affected the levels of the K<sup>+</sup> channel by Western blot, and again found no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). While this analysis suggests that Sirt1 does not function by altering levels of these factors, it does not rule out the possibility that Sirt1 regulates their activity.</p><p>Finally, because of the central role of ATP in insulin secretion, we surmised that Sirt1 could play a role in the energetics of glucose utilization in &#x003b2; cells. We thus measured the ATP/ADP ratio in control and Sirt1 knockdown INS-1 cells after glucose induction. Control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>D, open bars) responded to glucose by increasing the ratio of ATP to ADP, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). In contrast, in cells with the knockdown levels of Sirt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>D, black bars), the ATP/ADP ratio did not increase upon glucose stimulation. These findings show that knocking down Sirt1 results in a defect in ATP production in response to glucose. Basal ATP levels are not significantly altered in knockdown cells, consistent with the fact that they grow as well as control cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>UCP2 Levels Are Increased in Sirt1 KO Mice and Knockdown Cells</title><p>One possibility for the failure of the Sirt1 knockdown cells to make ATP is that respiration is more uncoupled than in control cells, which would square well with the known link between the UCP2 and insulin production in &#x003b2; cells (36). Thus, we determined by Western blot the levels of UCP2 in control and Sirt1 knockdown cells. Strikingly, there was a significant increase in the UCP2 protein level in the knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). This increase in protein level was mirrored by an increase in the mRNA in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>F), indicating that Sirt1 regulates UCP2 transcription. It was previously shown that UCP2 expression reduced NADH levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore determined NADH levels by autofluorescence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; and found a significantly lower level of NADH in the knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>G).</p><p>Western blot for UCP2 in Sirt1 KO mice showed a similar effect. We observed an increase in UCP2 protein in the whole pancreas (unpublished data), which is a measure of the islets, since UCP2 is expressed in only the endocrine cells of the pancreas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, UCP2 protein was also up-regulated in isolated islets of Sirt1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g004">Figure 4</xref>H). In summary, our expression studies suggest that Sirt1 is a repressor of UCP2 transcription in &#x003b2; cells, and by repressing this UCP, this sirtuin may allow cells to secrete insulin in response to glucose.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sirt1 Binds to the UCP2 Promoter</title><p>To study further the repression of UCP2 by Sirt1, we carried out reporter assays in 293T cells transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene, whose expression is driven by the UCP2 promoter. Cells were also transfected with a control vector or with an expression vector for PPAR&#x003b3;, which is known to bind to and activate the UCP2 promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. In a control experiment, PPAR&#x003b3; activated the reporter in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, left bars). In a parallel experiment, cells were also co-transfected with a Sirt1 expression vector. Sirt1 clearly repressed the activation of the UCP2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, right bars). Repression of this reporter by endogenous or expressed Sirt1 was alleviated by nicotinamide, a known inhibitor of Sirt1 (unpublished data).</p><p>To determine whether repression of UCP2 was due to the direct binding of Sirt1 at the promoter, INS-1 cells were subjected to chromatin-immunoprecipitation, using Sirt1 or control antibodies. Primers specifically designed to span a known regulatory region of the UCP2 promoter (43) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, primer set 5) were used to probe by PCR the DNA in the immunoprecipitate. Sirt1 bound to this region of the UCP2 promoter in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, column 3) and to a significantly lesser extent in the Sirt1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, column 6). Control primers designed in a different region of UCP2 upstream DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, primer set 4) showed no amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, columns 2 and 5). An anti-gal4 antibody control using primer set 5 also showed no binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, columns 1 and 4). These findings indicate that Sirt1 represses UCP2 transcription by binding directly at the UCP2 promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Reduction of UCP2 Restores Insulin Secretion in Sirt1 Knockdown &#x003b2; cells</title><p>The above findings show that Sirt1 represses UCP2, and alleviation of this repression correlated with blunted insulin secretion in response to glucose. To address whether the increase in UCP2 in Sirt1 knockdown cells <italic>caused</italic> the failure to secrete insulin, UCP2 was also knocked down in INS-1 cells with reduced Sirt1. Stable cell lines with UCP2 knocked down by SiRNA were derived from two different lines in which Sirt1 was already knocked down, as well as from control INS-1 cells. Several different UCP2 sequences were inserted into a pSUPER hairpin vector with the neomycin-resistance drug marker. These constructs were transfected into the SiRNA Sirt1 puromycin resistant cells or control cells, and stable populations of NeoR cells were assayed for UCP2 RNA and protein by Northern and Western blots. In the case of two different UCP2 SiRNA constructs, the levels of UCP2 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) and protein (unpublished data) were clearly reduced in transfected cells. The levels of Sirt1 remained low in the double knockdown cells (unpublished data).</p><p>Next, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was assayed in Sirt1 or UCP2 knockdown cells and in cells with both Sirt1 and UCP2 knocked down. The Sirt1 knockdown cells were again defective in induction of insulin secretion, as expected. However, the double knockdown cells or cells with only the UCP2 SiRNA construct displayed insulin secretion in response to glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). A similar effect was observed in the second Sirt1 knockdown line in which UCP2 was also knocked down (unpublished data). This result demonstrates that the failure of Sirt1 knockdown cells to secrete insulin is due to the elevated levels of UCP2 in these cells. We conclude that Sirt1 acts as a positive regulator of insulin secretion in wild-type cells by repressing UCP2, thereby allowing coupling of glucose metabolism to ATP synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>UCP2 Levels Increase in Food-Deprived Mice</title><p>Does the regulation of UCP2 play any role in the normal secretion of insulin in &#x003b2; cells of wild-type mice in response to diet?

The levels of UCP2 in KO mice fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> were elevated compared with wild-type, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). Most importantly, these elevated levels in the fed KO mice were not further induced by starvation. In contrast, starvation induced UCP2 in wild-type mice, as before. A similar pattern of UCP2 RNA induction by starvation in wild-type but not KO mice was observed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). The above findings suggest that an increase in UCP2 in &#x003b2; cells is part of a normal mechanism to regulate the capacity of &#x003b2; cells to produce insulin. Moreover, this induction appears to be mediated by alleviation of Sirt1-mediated repression.</p><p>These findings suggest that starvation causes a decrease in Sirt1 activity in &#x003b2; cells. In yeast, Sir2p activity is regulated by the NAD/NADH ratio. We thus measured NAD and NADH in the pancreas of seven fed and seven starved wild-type mice. Strikingly, there was a significant decrease in the level of NAD but not NADH in the starved mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The level of Sirt1 protein in starved pancreas is roughly comparable to fed controls (unpublished data). These findings suggest that changes in NAD levels in the pancreas regulate Sirt1 activity and insulin secretion in response to diet.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we show that Sirt1 regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells. Both in Sirt1 KO mice and in cultured &#x003b2; cell lines, a reduction in Sirt1 levels reduces the capacity of these cells to secrete insulin in response to glucose. Classical studies show that an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio due to glucose metabolism is the critical trigger in the induction of insulin secretion. In cells with reduced Sirt1, the increase in this ratio is blunted due to elevated levels of UCP2, which reduces the synthesis of ATP during respiration. Sirt1 directly represses UCP2 by binding to the promoter. Thus, by controlling UCP2, Sirt1 regulates the amplitude of insulin induction by glucose. We do not know whether the low levels of insulin in the whole body of Sirt1 KO mice represents a &#x003b2; cell defect, an indirect consequence of the elevated glucose tolerance in these animals, or both.</p><p>The use of UCP2 to regulate insulin production is distinct from the canonical role of UCPs. By uncoupling respiration from ATP synthesis in brown fat, for example, UCP1 generates heat and is critical for the non-shivering thermogenesis in rodents (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;).

This increase did not occur in Sirt1 KO mice, which already displayed higher levels of UCP2 when fed <italic>ad libitum</italic>. These findings suggest that regulation of UCP2 by Sirt1 is a physiologically important mechanism to blunt the chronic levels of insulin in starved animals. This mechanism may explain why insulin levels are so low during fasting, even though &#x003b2; cells are actively metabolizing fat and respiring (see following section).

The experiment was carried out twice with four mice per treatment, and the repeat experiment gave data comparable to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040031-g002">Figure 2</xref>E.</p><p>Four to five pancreases each from WT, Sir2+/&#x02212;, and Sir2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were fixed in 2&#x00025; chilled paraformaldehyde, and paraffin embedded, and three sections (5 &#x003bc;m) separated by at least 100 &#x003bc;m were dewaxed using xylene, rehydrated through serial dilutions of ethyl-alcohol, and subjected to antigen retrieval using 10 mM citrate (pH 6.1), followed by DAKO high pH antigen retrieval solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The sections were washed and stained with the respective antibodies in staining buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 3&#x00025; BSA, 0.5&#x00025; Triton-X-100, and 50 mM Na-PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.4). Primary antibodies included sheep anti-insulin (The Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom), mouse anti-glucagon (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States), and rabbit anti-somatostatin (Dako). The entire pancreatic section of each stained slide was arbitrarily divided into non-overlapping contiguous portions (using a microscope inset measuring guide) and imaged at 10&#x000d7; magnification. The islet area (in square micrometers) and the total area of each section were determined by tracing the outline to assess the area of the islets, using image analyzer software (Image-Pro 4.1 Plus). The percentage of islet cell area in the pancreas was expressed as a percentage of the total pancreatic area. For 4&#x000d7; images, islets were stained using a cocktail of antibodies against insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin and HRP-linked secondary antibodies with DAB as a chromogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>ATP/ADP measurements</title><p>1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were washed with 1&#x000d7; PBS.

For Northern blot analysis, 10 &#x003bc;g of RNA samples was separated on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and then hybridized with gene-specific probes. Normalization of mRNA was done by using actin as probe (kind gift from K. Olson). For whole-pancreas RNA extraction, fresh pancreas was stored in the RNA later solution (Ambion, Austin, Texas, United States) before extracting total RNA with the Qiagen system (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States). The UCP2 probe was a kind gift from D. Ricquier, CNRS, Paris, France. RT-PCR/cDNA was synthesized from 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA from the pancreas. The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed at 25 &#x000b0;C for 10 min, 42 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, 95 &#x000b0;C for 5 min, for one cycle. The PCR reaction (95 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 58 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 72 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, for 25 cycles) was performed using the respective sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers: UCP2: 5&#x02032;- GCCCGGGCTGGTGGTGGTC and 5&#x02032;- CCCCGAAGGCAGAAGTGAAGTGG; &#x003b2;-actin: 5&#x02032;- GAACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAAAAGAT and 5&#x02032;- ACCGCTCGTTGCCAATAGTGATG. </p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>CAT assay</title><p>Transfections for CAT assays were done as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040031-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSU2N2-mUCP2-CAT (which contains 7 kb of the mouse UCP2 promoter; gift from D.
