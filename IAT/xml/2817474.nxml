A human homolog of the RPA2 subunit, called RPA4, was previously identified and shown to be expressed in colon mucosal and placental cells; however, the function of RPA4 was not determined. To examine the function of RPA4 in human cells, we carried out knockdown and replacement studies to determine whether RPA4 can substitute for RPA2 in the cell. Unlike RPA2, exogenous RPA4 expression did not support chromosomal DNA replication and lead to cell-cycle arrest in G2/M. In addition, RPA4 localized to sites of DNA repair and reduced &#x003b3;-H2AX caused by RPA2 depletion. These studies suggest that RPA4 cannot support cell proliferation but can support processes that maintain the genomic integrity of the cell.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In order to proliferate and maintain genomic integrity, a cell must recognize and repair DNA damage and replicate DNA with high fidelity. One protein intricately involved with these processes is the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, Replication Protein A (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). RPA was originally isolated as a factor essential for simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and has since been shown to have integral roles in DNA repair, recombination, chromosome stability and cell-cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>).</p><p>In addition to ssDNA binding, RPA interacts with a number of proteins involved in genome maintenance and cell-cycle control (e.g. XPA, ATR-ATRIP, p53) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and mutations in RPA or in proteins that interact with RPA are often correlated with human disease, particularly cancer. It has been shown that a cancer predisposing mutation in BRCA2 (Y42C) disrupts the interaction between BRCA2 and RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution (L221P) in RPA1 results in a high rate of lymphoid tumor development and shortened lifespan when heterozygous in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This mutation is analogous to a mutation, <italic>rfa1-t48</italic>, originally isolated in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> that displays multiple DNA damage sensitivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that increased expression of RPA1 and RPA2 correlates with increased severity of colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This is not surprising, since RPA is essential for cells to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Although &#x02018;canonical&#x02019; RPA is composed of the subunits RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3, some organisms, such as seed plants (e.g. rice, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) and some protists, contain multiple RPA subunit genes that form multiple RPA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In the case of plants, the different RPA complexes appear to have different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In human cells, a single homolog of the RPA2 subunit has been identified, called RPA4. RPA4 was isolated through a HeLa cell library interaction-trap/yeast two-hybrid screen as a factor that interacts with RPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Initial studies showed that RPA4 also interacts with RPA3, but not with RPA2, and immunoprecipitation of RPA1 coprecipitates RPA4 after expression in rabbit reticulocyte lysate or in 293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). RPA4 transcribed/translated <italic>in vitro</italic> with RPA1 and RPA3 is retained on ssDNA cellulose, suggesting that this &#x02018;alternative&#x02019; complex has ssDNA-binding capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that RPA4 forms a stable complex with RPA1 and RPA3 and has solution properties indistinguishable from canonical RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>The studies presented here focus on understanding the function of RPA4 in human cells. We present a genomic analysis of the RPA4 gene that indicates that RPA4 is mammalian-specific. We show that expression of RPA4 in cells does not support chromosomal DNA replication or cell-cycle progression. However, we present evidence that RPA4 functions in cellular DNA metabolism. RPA4 can localize to DNA repair foci and appears to participate in the cellular DNA damage response. We identify the region of RPA4 responsible for the observed phenotypes. These findings suggest that RPA4 expression may be involved in maintaining cell quiescence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Exogenous RPA expression constructs</title><p>To identify exogenous expression of RPA in HeLa cells, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged RPA1, RPA2, RPA3 and RPA4 constructs were generated; EGFP-tagged RPA1 (pEGFP-hsRPA70), RPA2 (pEGFP-hsRPA32) and RPA3 (pEGFP-hsRPA14) were generated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). EGFP-RPA4 (pEGFP-hsRPA4) was generated by PCR amplification of the RPA4 coding region from pBABE-puro-RPA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) using primers O-606 (5&#x02032;-CAGATCTCGAGGTGGAGGCATGAGTAAGAGTGGGTTTGGG-3&#x02032;) and O-607 (5&#x02032;-CCCGCGGTACCTCAATCAGCAGACTTAAAATG-3&#x02032;) and inserted into the <italic>Xho</italic>I-<italic>Kpn</italic>I sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech).

This localization is observed in cells that have been exposed to DNA damage and extracted to visualize tightly associated, chromatin bound protein. To determine whether RPA4 has similar localization, cells expressing endogenous RPA2 or RPA2-depleted cells expressing GFP-RPA2 or GFP-RPA4 were treated with camptothecin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>d shows that like both endogenous and exogenous RPA2, RPA4 localized to foci after DNA damage. To confirm that the foci observed are sites of DNA repair, we examined co-localization with the phosphorylated forms of two proteins known to localize to sites of DNA in the DNA damage response: phosphorylated H2AX (&#x003b3;-H2AX) and phosphorylated Chk2 (P-Chk2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). After DNA damage, both RPA2 and RPA4 co-localize to foci with &#x003b3;-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a) and with P-Chk2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). The RPA2 homolog from yeast (<italic>S. cerevisae</italic>) was used as a control for these experiments. Yeast RPA2 (sc2) does not form a complex with human RPA subunits and was not observed to form foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This demonstrates that localization is dependent on a human RPA2 isoform and is not an artifact of the expression system. In the absence of DNA damage, foci were not observed in cells expressing RPA2 or sc2. However, RPA4 and &#x003b3;-H2AX foci but not P-Chk2 foci were observed in cells expressing RPA4 in the absence of DNA damage. This suggests RPA2-depleted cells expressing RPA4 contain abnormal DNA structures, but that these structures do not cause Chk2 activation.</p><p>The G2/M arrest and foci formation observed in RPA4-expressing cells in the absence of DNA damage could be caused by a deficiency in either replication or DNA repair leading to checkpoint activation (or both). To try to determine the checkpoint status in these cells, total &#x003b3;-H2AX and P-Chk2 staining was examined by flow cytometry. Unstressed RPA2 expressing cells have low levels of &#x003b3;-H2AX staining (left peak, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). Unstressed cells expressing yeast RPA2 also mostly have low levels &#x003b3;-H2AX staining cells; however, a small population of cells was observed that stain very strongly for &#x003b3;-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). Since the cells examined by flow cytometry have not been extracted, these two populations cannot be directly compared to extracted cells observed by immunofluorescence. However, given that RPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>c, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1062/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1a</ext-link>) or RPA1 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) appear to cause apoptosis, we propose that the high &#x003b3;-H2AX staining cells indicate apoptotic DNA fragmentation with robust &#x003b3;-H2AX staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). When RPA4 was expressed in unstressed cells, no high staining &#x003b3;-H2AX cells were observed. This argues that expression of RPA4 prevents the formation of this population of cells. Most of the unstressed cells expressing RPA4 had low &#x003b3;-H2AX staining but some cells were observed with slightly elevated &#x003b3;-H2AX staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). The later population is consistent with some &#x003b3;-H2AX foci being observed in unstressed cells expressing RPA4.</p><p>After DNA damage, a population with high &#x003b3;-H2AX staining was observed with all forms of exogenous protein consistent with a normal cellular DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). With all three forms of exogenous RPA, we observed low levels of P-Chk2 in the absence of DNA damage and uniform, high levels of P-Chk2 after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>d). Taken together with the &#x003b3;-H2AX data, these results indicate that cells expressing RPA4 can support checkpoint activation and that expression of RPA4 can suppress cell death caused by RPA2 depletion. Further they indicate that RPA4-expressing cells contain some type of abnormal DNA structure that is sufficient to cause elevated &#x003b3;-H2AX but not Chk2 activation (low P-Chk2). It is most likely that the abnormal DNA structure is triggering G2/M checkpoint activation observed in RPA4-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec><title>RPA4 function DNA replication</title><p>The RPA4-expressing cells had a similar percentage of cells in S-phase as RPA2 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). This suggests that RPA4 may have a defect in DNA replication. To confirm these findings, we examined the ability of RPA4 to support DNA replication in synchronized cells. Cells were treated with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (APH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) to synchronize cells at the G1/S boundary. The cells were subsequently released into APH-free medium, and progression through S-phase was monitored. As expected, RPA2- and RPA2-depleted cells expressing a control, yeast RPA2 (<italic>Sc</italic>2), were unable to progress through S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). Exogenous RPA2-expressing cells were proficient for DNA replication as indicated by a population of cells progressing through S-phase by 8 h after APH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). In contrast, the RPA4-expressing cells were unable to progress through S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). These results are consistent with the finding that an RPA complex containing RPA4 in place of RPA2 is unable to support SV40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We conclude that RPA4 is unable to support chromosomal DNA replication. We hypothesize that the &#x003b3;-H2AX/RPA foci and the G2/M arrest observed in proliferating cells containing RPA4 is caused by incomplete chromosomal DNA replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Identifying the region responsible for RPA4 phenotypes</title><p>RPA2 can be divided into three regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b): (i) the N-terminal phosphorylation domain (PD, aa 1&#x02013;44), (ii) the central DBD-D (aa 45&#x02013;172) and (iii) the C-terminal region (aa 173&#x02013;270) containing a linker and a WHD. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that RPA4 shares 47% amino acid sequence identity and 63% amino acid similarity to RPA2 and appears to have a similar domain organization. The similarity of the putative phosphorylation domain, putative DBD (DBD-G), and the putative WHD (without the linker) of RPA4 are 67, 71, 52%, respectively. To identify the region(s) of RPA4 responsible for the differences in activity, we generated a &#x02018;cassettized&#x02019; GFP-RPA2 by inserting a unique restriction site immediately upstream and downstream of each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). Each region of RPA2 was then substituted with the corresponding region of RPA4 producing three hybrid forms, called 422, 242 and 224, where numerals indicate the source of each of the three domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b).</p><p>The GFP-RPA2/RPA4 &#x02018;hybrid&#x02019; constructs were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c) and examined in cells as described above. All hybrid constructs reduced the percentage of cells in S-phase compared to RPA2-depleted or RPA2-depleted/RPA4-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d). However, only the 242 hybrid construct containing DBD-G displayed the G2/M arrest phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d and e). We conclude that DBD-G is not able to substitute for DBD-D in RPA2 (i.e. DBD-D is essential for chromosomal DNA replication).</p><p>These studies using asynchronous cell cultures indicated that the hybrid constructs can rescue, to varying degrees, the replication defect due to RPA2 depletion, whereas RPA4 expression cannot. We next tested each hybrid in cells synchronized with aphidicolin. The hybrid constructs supported S-phase progression to different extents: 422-expressing cells entered S-phase as efficiently as RPA2-expressing cells, 224-expressing cells entered S-phase (but less efficiently) and very few 242-expressing cells were able enter S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). We conclude that the putative phosphorylation domain of RPA4 has no effect on replication, the C-terminus of RPA4 affects the efficiency of replication, and that the DBD of RPA2 is essential for cellular replication, since only hybrid 242, which contains the putative DBD of RPA4, completely prevented replication. These results are consistent with the previous finding that the DBD of RPA2 is the only essential domain required for cell viability in unstressed yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The replication defect cannot be directly attributed to differences in DNA-binding affinities, because Mason <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) demonstrated that the alternative RPA complex (containing RPA4) binds ssDNA similarly to wild-type RPA (containing RPA2).</p><p>Only hybrid 242 caused G2/M arrest similar to RPA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d and e). To explore a possible cause for this G2/M arrest, we examined the ability of the hybrid constructs to participate in genome maintenance by examining &#x003b3;-H2AX staining. All hybrid constructs had &#x003b3;-H2AX staining similar to RPA4: no high &#x003b3;-H2AX staining cells were observed. In addition, all hybrids were localized to foci after DNA damage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1062/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). This suggests that all of the domains of RPA4 can substitute for the comparable domain of RPA2 in these cellular processes.</p><p>We also measured whether RPA2 DBD-D is sufficient for replication in human cells and if RPA4 DBD-G is sufficient for G2/M arrest using &#x02018;core&#x02019; constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). Following RPA2 depletion, cells expressing DBD-D progressed through S-phase, although the efficiency of progression was reduced compared to exogenous RPA2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1062/DC1">Supplemental Figure S3</ext-link>). In contrast, cells expressing DBD-G showed a dramatic reduction in progression through S-phase, similar to RPA4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1062/DC1">Supplemental Figure S3</ext-link>). These studies do not rule out DBD-G supporting a low level of DNA synthesis but demonstrate that DBD-G activity is similar to RPA4 while DBD-D is closer to RPA2. The DBD is the domain most highly conserved between RPA2 and RPA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), yet one, DBD-D, is functional for replication and the other, DBD-G, is defective for replication and causes unstressed cells to arrest in G2/M.</p></sec><sec><title>Function of the L34 loop region of RPA4</title><p>There is a short region, noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), where RPA2 contains an acidic stretch of amino acids not found in RPA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a).

Exogenous expression of 2Basic in RPA2-depleted HeLa cells resulted in G2/M arrest, similar to, but more pronounced than, exogenous expression of RPA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>e). Conversely, 4Acidic expression resulted in percentages of G2/M cells more similar to RPA2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c). This suggests that L34 is critical for RPA2 function, and that the RPA4 basic loop is both necessary and sufficient for the arrest phenotype observed for constructs containing DBD-G. S-phase progression was also examined using synchronized cells. Neither 2Basic nor 4Acidic could support S-phase progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>d) indicating that L34 from RPA4 is sufficient to inactivate RPA2, but that the corresponding loop from RPA2 does not restore function to RPA4.</p><p>Since RPA4 is deficient for DNA replication and proficient for G2/M arrest, we tested whether or not exogenous RPA4 expression could inhibit endogenous RPA2 function. Cells were transfected with GFP-RPA2 or GFP-RPA4 without depletion of endogenous RPA2. One would predict a dominant negative phenotype to result in an increase in S-phase cells (replication deficiency), a G2/M checkpoint (arrest proficiency), or both. We were unable to detect an appreciable increase in S- or G2/M-phase after exogenous RPA4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>e). However, expression of 2Basic, which contains the L34 region (only 16 aa) of RPA4, caused a detectable increase in G2/M arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>e). This is consistent with 2Basic having a stronger phenotype in RPA2-depleted cells than RPA4. The absence of a dominant negative phenotype with RPA4 could be the result of expression levels, protein stability, or complex preference. Recently, RPA complexes containing 2Basic or RPA4 (but not 4Acidic) have been shown to inhibit wild-type RPA function in SV40 replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Together these findings suggest that 2Basic, and probably RPA4, can inhibit normal RPA2 functions in cells when expressed at high enough levels, and that the basic L34 region of RPA4 is sufficient for this inhibition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>RPA4 and RPA2 have different cellular functions</title><p>All cells require DNA repair to maintain the integrity of their genome, and canonical RPA is required for multiple DNA repair pathways.

However, we show that in human cells, a substantial amount of chromosomal DNA replication was observed in cells containing only hybrid 224. This indicates that the inability of the hybrid 224 to support <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA replication is specific to the SV40 system and not to cellular replication. These conclusions are also consistent with the observation in yeast that the C-terminus of RPA2 is dispensable for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The putative DBD of RPA4 is responsible for the observed phenotypes (replication defect and G2/M arrest). This domain shares the highest sequence identity between RPA2 and RPA4, especially in regions that have been shown to be important for the global fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This domain of RPA2 is required for formation of the RPA complex, has weak ssDNA-binding activity, and participates in specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Recent biochemical characterization of an alternative RPA complex (containing RPA4) demonstrated that it has properties indistinguishable from the canonical RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). This suggests that the phenotypes caused by RPA4 are most likely due to changes in protein&#x02013;protein interactions. In particular, the loop (L34) region shows a large charge difference between RPA4 and RPA2. By manipulating this region in RPA2 and RPA4, we were able to show that RPA2 containing the L34 loop region of RPA4 behaved similarly to RPA4. Given that this loop is flexible, we propose that this loop region may be responsible for altering specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions in the cell that result in the inability to replicate DNA and trigger cell-cycle arrest. We are currently investigating this possibility.</p></sec><sec><title>RPA4 and cell-cycle regulation</title><p>Initial observations found that RPA4 protein was detected predominantly in quiescent cells, and RPA2 was detected predominantly in proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). For example, RPA4 was originally found to be expressed in colon mucosal cells, which are mostly non-proliferative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). More recently it has been noted that RPA2 expression is increased and correlates with the severity of colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Keshav <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) suggested that preferential expression of RPA4 versus RPA2 may be indicative of tissue differentiation and cell quiescence. We have shown that RPA4 is unable to support DNA replication, and that DBD-G (specifically, L34 of RPA4) also causes accumulation of cells in G2/M. Our data are consistent with Keshav&#x02019;s hypothesis. RPA4 cannot support DNA replication but does appear to participate in DNA recognition and DNA repair. This suggests a model in which cells expressing predominantly RPA4 would be able to maintain their genome but not carry out DNA replication or cell proliferation. This model also suggests either that expression of RPA4 contributes to modulation of cell proliferation or that RPA4 expression must be down-regulated for proliferation to occur.</p><p>A prediction of this model is that if both RPA4 and RPA2 are present in cells, the RPA4 should compete with endogenous levels of RPA2 and inhibit DNA replication and cell-cycle progression. This type of inhibition was observed <italic>in vitro</italic>: a RPA complex containing RPA4 inhibits the function of canonical RPA2 containing complex in SV40 DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We did not observe a G2/M arrest in cells expressing both RPA2 and RPA4; however, we did observe a dominant negative phenotype when both RPA2 and RPA2Basic were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>e). One explanation for these results is that exogenous RPA4 expression in this system may simply not be high enough to observe an effect in the presence of endogenous RPA2, but that a similar level of expression of the 2Basic subunit competes more efficiently with wild-type RPA2 and results in a phenotype. We are currently examining whether increasing the expression of RPA4 using other promoters or different cells results in modulation of cell growth.</p><p>The different distributions of cells observed in asynchronous RPA2-depleted cells also suggest an inhibitory function for RPA4 in the cell. In asynchronous cells, we observed an asymmetric distribution of cells in S-phase when RPA2 is depleted (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c). This distribution is most easily explained by the fact that RPA2 depletion is gradual, and some percentage of cells will exit G1 and enter into S-phase before RPA2 is depleted below a critical level. This asymmetric distribution is not observed in cells expressing exogenous RPA4 (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c). In these cells, RPA4 is being expressed at high levels as RPA2 depletion is occurring. If RPA4 did not inhibit RPA2 function, an asymmetric distribution similar to the depleted cells should have been observed. Since it was not, this suggests that the level of RPA4 present was sufficient to inhibit cells with residual (lower) amounts of RPA2 from exiting G1 phase and entering S-phase. This supports the conclusion that RPA4 can inhibit RPA2 function.</p><p>Together, these analyses support a maintenance function for RPA4 in non-proliferating cells. These studies suggest that RPA4 expression levels could have dramatic effects during development and could help modulate cell proliferation status.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1062/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship (0525735Z to S.J.H.); <funding-source>National Institute of Health</funding-source> Research Grant (<award-id>GM44721 to M.S.W</award-id>.); Center for Aging Program at the University of Iowa (CA103672 to M.S.W.).
