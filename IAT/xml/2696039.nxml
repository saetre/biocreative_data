Accumulation of amyloid &#x003b2;-peptide (A&#x003b2;) and neurofibrillary tangles are considered hallmarks for neuropathological changes in AD. At this time, neither the precise pathogenesis nor radical cure is available for AD. Although majority of AD cases are idiopathic, an autosomal dominant disorder triggered by mutation in the &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) or presenilin 2 (PS2) has been identified to be responsible for familial AD (FAD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Selkoe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, AD is associated with a high prevalence of heart dysfunction in the elderly . Recent data has indicated a close tie between heart dysfunction and AD. A number of studies have revealed that the onset and progression of AD are closely associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, hypoxia, myocardial infarction and the presence of ApoE4 allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Bleumink1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Rosendorff1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, limited information is available with regards to the cardiovascular function in AD. Given that the AD genes PS1 and PS2 are also expressed in the heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Hebert1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, it may be speculated that mutations in these genes in familial AD affect cardiac function. Presenilins have been suggested to play a key role in the regulation of cardiovascular function. PS1-deficient mice exhibit ventricular septal defect and double outlet right ventricle in the mutant hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Nakajima1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. PS2 also play an important role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling by interacting with ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Takeda1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. PS1 and PS2 mutations are associated with a higher risk of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in AD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Li1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The recent development of transgenic mouse models of AD has provided an important avenue for AD research. Double transgenic mice overexpressing FAD-linked amyloid precursor protein with Swedish mutation and PS-1 with deletion of exon 9 (APPswe/PS1dE9) demonstrated early A&#x003b2; deposition as early as 4&#x02013;6 months of age that correspond to a form of early onset AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Jankowsky1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. At 9 months of age, APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice display high levels of amyloid &#x003b2;-peptide and numerous amyloid &#x003b2;-peptide deposits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Taniuchi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice exhibit a consistent &#x003b2;-amyloid accumulation early on and age-associated cognitive decline, consolidating the model for AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-GarciaAlloza1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Although many studies have used this transgenic line to investigate aspects of neurodegenerative lesions in AD, no information is available with regards to the cardiac function of this mouse model of AD. Therefore, we took advantage of this mouse model of AD to examine cardiomyocyte mechanical function and underlying mechanisms. Since intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are known to be closely associated with cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Bers1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Ren1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, key intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory proteins such as sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban (PLB) and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger (NCX) as well as crucial protein markers of ER stress including inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1), calregulin and Bip (GRP78) were also monitored in myocardium of APP/PS1 transgenic and wild-type C57BL/6 mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with humane animal care standards outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental and were approved the University of Wyoming Animal Care and Use Committee. In brief, 10-month-old male C57BL/6 (WT), APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice and mice with transgenic expression of only APPswe (APP) or PS1dE9 (PS1) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) were maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle, with free access to food and water.

In brief, APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were developed by co-injection of the two transgene constructs &#x0005b;mouse/human (Mo/Hu) chimeric APP695 harboring the Swedish (K594M/N595L) mutation and exon-9-deleted PS1&#x0005d; into pronuclei with a single genomic insertion site resulting in the two transgenes being transmitted as a single mendelian locus. To identify the transgenic founder mice, genomic DNA was isolated from 1-cm tail clips from 10-month-old mice and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using the PCR conditions suggested by Jackson Laboratory.

The Morris water maze tests were conducted in a 120-cm (diameter) tank filled with opaque water. The water was kept at 25&#x000b0;C and surrounded by dark walls containing geometric designs that served as distal visual cues. In the first phase of the training, mice were required to find a platform (15&#x000d7;15 cm) marked with a colored pole, placed in different quadrants of the pool. Each animal underwent four trials per day for 4 days, with a maximum of 60 s to find the submerged platform. If the mice failed to find the platform within 60 s, they were physically guided to it and allowed to remain on the platform for 20 s. After visible platform training, two consecutive days of hidden platform training was conducted in which the platform is submerged in the opaque water 1 cm deep, with 4 trials per day. A probe trial was performed at the end of training, in which the platform was removed. Performance in all tasks (latency to platform, time spent in target quadrant) was recorded by a computer-based video tracking system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Galvan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>ECG measurement</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine HCl/xylazine HCl solution (1 ml/kg) and were placed in a supine position on a warm pad (37&#x000b0;C) for acclimatization.

Hearts were digested with Liberase Blendzyme 4 (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 20 min. Left ventricles were removed and minced before being filtered. Tissue pieces were gently agitated and pellet of cells was resuspended. Extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was added incrementally back to 1.20 mM over a period of 30 min. Isolated myocytes were used within 8 hrs of isolation. Normally, a yield of 50&#x02013;60&#x00025; viable rod-shaped cardiomyocytes with clear sarcomere striations was achieved. Only rod-shaped myocytes with clear edges were selected for mechanical study. To directly assess the role of oxidative stress in AD-associated cardiomyocyte contractile function, a cohort of cardiomyocytes from WT and APP/PS1 mice were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 hrs in the absence or presence of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 500 &#x000b5;M) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Guo1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> prior to mechanical function assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Cell shortening/relengthening</title><p>Mechanical properties of cardiomyocytes were assessed using a video-based edge-detection system (IonOptix Corporation, Milton, MA, USA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Doser1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In brief, cells were placed in a Warner chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus, IX-70) with a buffer containing (in mM): 131 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, at pH 7.4. The cells were field stimulated with suprathreshold voltage at a frequency of 0.5 Hz, 3 msec duration, using a pair of platinum wires placed on opposite sides of the chamber connected to a FHC stimulator (Brunswick, NE, USA). The polarity of stimulation electrodes was reversed frequently to avoid possible build up of electrolyte by-products. The myocyte being studied was displayed on the computer monitor using an IonOptix My&#x000b0;C am camera, which rapidly scans the image area at every 8.3 msec such that the amplitude and velocity of shortening/relengthening is recorded with good fidelity. The soft-edge software (IonOptix) was used to capture changes in cell length during shortening and relengthening. Cell shortening and relengthening were assessed using the following indices: peak shortening (PS), which indicates peak ventricular contractility; time-to&#x02212;50&#x00025; and 90&#x00025; PS (TPS<sub>50</sub> and TPS<sub>90</sub>), which indicate rapid and entire phase of myocyte shortening, respectively; time-to&#x02212;50&#x00025; and 90&#x00025; relengthening (TR<sub>50</sub> and TR<sub>90</sub>), which indicates early and entire phase of myocyte relengthening, respectively; as well as maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (&#x000b1; dL/dt), which depicts maximal velocity of cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. For duration of myocyte shortening and relengthening, 90&#x00025; rather 100&#x00025; of the entire duration was used in an effort to avoid noisy signal near baseline. In the case of altering stimulus frequency (from 0.1 Hz to 5.0 Hz), the steady-state contraction of myocyte was achieved (usually after the first five to six beats) before PS amplitude was recorded. The grid-crossing method was used for random cell selection to minimize the influence of heterogeneous cell contraction in response to field stimuli. Myocytes with obvious sarcolemmal blebs or spontaneous contractions were not used for mechanical recording. All measurements were performed at 25&#x02013;27&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> fluorescence measurement</title><p>A separate cohort of myocytes was loaded with fura-2/AM (0.5 &#x000b5;M) for 15 min and fluorescence measurements were recorded with a dual-excitation fluorescence photomultiplier system (Ionoptix) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Doser1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In brief, myocytes were placed on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope equipped with a temperature-controlled (25&#x000b0;C) Warner chamber and imaged through a Fluor &#x000d7;40 oil objective. Myocytes were exposed to light emitted by a 75W lamp and passed through either a 360 or a 380 nm filter (bandwidths were&#x000b1;15 nm), while being electrically stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz. Fluorescence emissions were detected between 480&#x02013;520 nm by a photomultiplier tube after first illuminating the cardiomyocytes at 360 nm for 500 msec then at 380 nm for the duration of the recording protocol (9 sec at a sampling rate of 333 Hz). The 360 nm excitation scan was repeated for another 500 msec at the end of the protocol and qualitative changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration (&#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i) were inferred from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at two wavelengths (360/380). This &#x0201c;interpolated&#x0201d; technique was used since 360 nm is the isobestic point for fura-2 at which the numerator is independent of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration. The majority of the recording was done using the 380 nm filter (except the first and last 500 msec) since the strongest signal is the 380 nm-excited emission. The time course of the fluorescence signal decay was fit to a single exponential equation, and the time constant (&#x003c4;) was used as a measure of the rate of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> decay.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>The total protein was prepared as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Doser1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Elevated catecholamine levels and ablated vagal tone were reported in AD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Giubilei1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Raskind1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, supporting the higher heart rate observed in our current study. Impaired vagal parasympathetic function was reported in AD patients evaluated by R-R interval variation (RRIV) and sympathetic skin response and orthostatic cardiovascular reflexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Wang1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, QT dispersion was found to be tightly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment in AD patients. As shown in our current study, surface ECG revealed for the first time increased heart rate, reduced RR interval and diminished QRS amplitude in the APP/PS1 mice compared with WT mice.</p><p>The most prominent cardiac dysfunctions in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model observed in our study were reduced cardiomyocyte contraction and diminished maximal velocity of contraction/relaxation (&#x000b1;dL/dt) at both low and high stimulus frequencies associated with unchanged duration of contraction and relaxation. Several factors may contribute to the impaired mechanical function including defected contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin heavy chain isoform), reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release, depressed SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> load and altered myofilament Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity. The intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> measurement confirmed a decrease in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> rise associated with unchanged resting and peak intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels in cardiomyocytes from APP/PS1 mice. The unchanged intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> decay coincides with the normal TR<sub>50</sub> and TR<sub>90</sub> in APP/PS1 mouse cardiomyocytes, which is also supported by the normal protein levels of SERCA2a and NCX, the main machineries to remove Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from cytosolic space for cardiac relaxation to occur, in APP/PS1 myocardium. In addition, our data revealed exaggerated decline in the steady-state myocyte peak shortening in response to increased stimulating frequency in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting a possibly reduced capacity in SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> storage and release in this murine model of AD. The reduced cardiomyocyte shortening capacity received convincing support from the reduced R-wave height in ECG reading. Our data revealed down-regulation of phospholamban, an endogenous inhibitor of SERCA, in APP/PS1 mouse hearts. Although the link between reduced phospholamban expression and altered cardiac contractile function in APP/PS1 hearts is unclear, reduced phospholamban levels may trigger altered intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis <italic>en route</italic> to affect cardiomyocyte contractile function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Bers1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study revealed enhanced protein carbonyl formation in the absence of ER stress in myocardium from APP/PS1 mice, suggesting a likely role of oxidative stress in the altered cardiomyocyte contractile function in APP/PS1 mice. This notion received further support from our <italic>in vitro</italic> study where antioxidant NAC alleviates the cardiomyocyte mechanical dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice.</p><p>Catecholamine desensitization is a hallmark of heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Brodde1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown that heart failure may trigger catecholamine desensitization to both isoproterenol and norepinephrine in the presence and absence of ganglionic blockade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Brodde1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. This is in line with our observation of reduced responsiveness to norepinephrine and isoproterenol in APP/PS1 mouse cardiomyocytes. However, the lack of overt change in myocardial histology and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor expression suggest the absence of any advanced heart failure and adrenergic desensitization in APP/PS1 hearts. Although sympathetic denervation may lead to postsynaptic supersensitivity due to lack of neural uptake for norepinephrine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Brodde1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, to what extent adrenergic denervation or desensitization contributes to myocardial complications in AD patients remains controversial. Several reports have been seen to discriminate changes in cardiac sympathetic innervation of AD patients from other neurodegenerative disease such as dementia with Lewy bodies and vascular dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Estorch1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-WadaIsoe1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies measured cardiac uptake of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a physiologic analogue of norepinephrine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006033-Wieland1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, as a mean of noninvasive index of the integrity of sympathetic neurotransmission in the heart of AD patients. It was found that cardiac MIBG uptake in AD patients was essentially unaffected compared with other neourodegenrative diseases. Nevertheless, subtle differences may exist in the diagnostic criteria of AD and different stages of disease process.</p><p>In summary, this study provides evidence for the first time of altered cardiomyocyte contractile function in the APP/PS1 transgenic model of AD. Cardiomyocytes from APP/PS1 mice exhibited decreased inotropic response and impaired intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis possibly due to mechanisms associated with reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release, altered expression in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory proteins, reduced adrenergic function and oxidative damage. However, other mechanisms should not be excluded at this time such as susceptibility of myofilament Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity and altered expression of cardiac contractile proteins. Future study is warranted to elucidate the subcellular signaling mechanisms responsible for cardiac abnormalities in AD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Drs.
