Two regions in human eRF1, position at 281-305 and position at 411-415, were proposed to be involved on the interaction to eRF3. In this study we have constructed and characterized yeast eRF1 mutant at position 410 (correspond to 415 human eRF1) from tyrosine to serine residue resulting eRF1(Y410S). The mutations did not affect the viability and temperature sensitivity of the cell. The stop codons suppression of the mutant was analyzed <italic>in vivo</italic> using <italic>PGK-stop codon-LACZ</italic> gene fusion and showed that the suppression of the mutant was significantly increased in all of codon terminations. The suppression on UAG codon was the highest increased among the stop codons by comparing the suppression of the wild type respectively. <italic>In vitro</italic> interaction between eRF1 (mutant and wild type) to eRF3 were carried out using eRF1-(His)6 and eRF1(Y410S)-(His)6 expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and indigenous <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> eRF3. The results showed that the binding affinity of eRF1(Y410S) to eRF3 was decreased up to 20% of the wild type binding affinity. Computer modeling analysis using Swiss-Prot and Amber version 9.0 programs revealed that the overall structure of eRF1(Y410S) has no significant different with the wild type. However, substitution of tyrosine to serine triggered the structural change on the other motif of C-terminal domain of eRF1. The data suggested that increasing stop codon suppression and decreasing of the binding affinity of eRF1(Y410S) were probably due to the slight modification on the structure of the C-terminal domain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>eRF1</kwd><kwd>eRF3</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>termination translation</kwd><kwd>nonsense codon suppression</kwd><kwd>binding affinity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Protein biosynthesis is a complex phenomenon involving RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. This process is carried out in three distinct steps: initiation, elongation and termination. While the first two steps have been extensively studied, our understanding of the termination process has lagged behind.</p><p>Protein biosynthesis terminates when one of the three stop codons enters the aminoacyl site (A-site) and signals polypeptide chain release from the peptidyl-tRNA located in the ribosomal P-site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. The process is facilitated by two general groups of accessory proteins: a class I release factor, codon-specific RFs (RF1 and RF2 in prokaryotes; eRF1 in eukaryotes), and a class II release factor, codon-non specific RFs (RF3 in prokaryotes and eRF3 in eukaryotes) that binds guanine nucleotides-binding proteins possessing GTPase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. Although the basic biological action of class-1 RFs is similar between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, they exhibit distinct structural and functional features. Yeast eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) encoded by <italic>SUP45</italic> gene, recognizes any of the three stop codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. Eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) in yeast encoded by <italic>SUP35</italic> gene, stimulates the termination reaction in GTP dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. Following stop codon recognition, eRF1 also induces polypeptide chain release by activating peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome.</p><p>Both eRF1 and eRF3 are essential for viability of yeast cells and deletion of the C-terminal part of each protein separately lead to lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. Crystal structure of human eRF1 has been determined and found that the protein is composed by three domains. The N-terminal domain (domain1) has been proposed to be responsible for stop codon recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>. This proposal was supported by mutational approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> and crosslinking experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. The middle domain (domain 2) is responsible for peptidyl transferase hydrolytic activity and includes a GGQ motif that has been highly conserved through evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Mutations in GGQ (Gly residues) are dominant-negative in vitro and lethal in vivo in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>. The domain 3 corresponds to the C-terminal part of eRF1 that is necessary for the interaction with eRF3 although there are discrepancies in the precise location of the region of eRF1 that interacts with eRF3. Progressive deletion of the C-terminal of eRF1, 6-19 amino acids in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> and 17 amino acids of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> resulted in a corresponding loss of eRF3 binding. In any case, the core eRF3-binding region identified for <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> eRF1 (by the yeast two-hybrid and deletion analysis), showed that two regions in each release factor are critical for mutual binding, position 281-305 and 411-415 (GILRY) of eRF1 and position 478-530 and 628-637 of eRF3 (11]. Although deletion of residues within domain 3 of eRF1 resulted in the loss of eRF3 interaction, however detail position and amino acid residues for the interaction are still unclear yet.</p><p>Preliminary study using computer modeling analysis on the structure of yeast eRF1, especially on the above two regions showed that tyrosine at position of 410 (Y410) and threonine at position of 295 (T295) of eRF1 exposed to the surface of molecules. Tyrosine at position of 410 is one of amino acid residues in AMLRY (GILRY like) motif of yeast eRF1 protein. Among of the amino acid residues on the AMLRY motif, tyrosine is one of best possible amino acid residues that contributing on its interaction since this residues containing hydroxyl group. In order to probe the role of tyrosine at AMLRY motif (Y410) of eRF1, here we reported the effect of mutation Y410 on the termination of protein biosynthesis. The nonsense codon suppressions have been used to assay the accuracy of termination process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Microbial strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Comparison among the C-terminal domain of human eRF1 (1DT9), yeast eRF1 and eRF1(Y410S) showed that there was 7 amino acid residues from position at 343 - 349 (yeast position) changed from non-helix to helix forms (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Ramanchandran Plot between yeast eRF1 and eRF1(Y410S) at the above position (343 - 349) revealed that the residues in eRF1(Y410S) tend to be more stable in helical form (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Domain3 of eRF1 was proposed to be responsible for the interaction with eRF3 protein respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>.

However, mutation on <italic>sup45</italic> gene could enhance the activity of <italic>SUQ5</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref> to suppress nonsense mutation on <italic>ade2</italic> gene. Mutation on <italic>sup45</italic>-Y410S enhanced all of stop codon suppressions (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However the quantitative values were variation depend on the type of stop codons. UAA codon was the most readthrough in all strains examined including the wild type. This was not surprising since all strains carrying <italic>SUQ5</italic> genetic background. <italic>SUQ5</italic> is codon specific tRNA suppressor for UAA codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. While on UAG and UGA codons, the suppression of the wild type strain was very low, almost no suppression (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However for the mutant strains, the suppression of UAG and UGA were significantly increased. The UAG codon was the mostly leaky codon in the mutant. This was unexpected since eRF1 reported to recognize all of stop codons in the same manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>.</p><p>Termination translation in eukaryotic system that involved interaction between eRF1 and eRF3 is a complex phenomenon. Detail mechanism of the process is still unclear yet. eRF1 was reported to be phosphorylated by CK2 protein but the product did not significantly affect directly to translation termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>. Urakov <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> demonstrated that IttIp could modulate the efficiency of termination translation in yeast. Meanwhile, recent report showed that eRF1 protein participates not only on termination translation but also in mRNA degradation and translation initiation via interaction with other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>.</p><p>In order to characterize the causes of an elevation of suppression in <italic>sup45</italic>-Y410S, <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction of eRF1(Y410S) to eRF3 was examined. The result showed that there was significant reduction on the binding affinity of eRF1(Y410S) to eRF3 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As consequences the suppressor was preferable to recognize the nonsense codons and thus increase the read-through. Further analysis on three dimensional structures of eRF1(Y410S) showed there was alteration on secondary structure of some amino acids residues from non-helix to helix form (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The structural modification in eRF1(Y410S) did not directly affect on the structure of AMLRY motif but triggered structural modification of neighboring motifs (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). This modification might affect the interaction of eRF1(Y410S) to eRF3 and thus increasing the suppression of codon terminations.</p><p>The AMLRY motif lies at position 406- 410 residues of yeast eRF1 which has 437 amino acid residues. Amino acid substitution in the end of C- or N-terminal of protein usually does not affect the overall structure of the protein since these residues will be stabilized by water solvent. Substitution of tyrosine at position 410 to serine did not significantly affect the overall structure of eRF1 but triggered alteration on the secondary structure of amino acid residues lied at position 343-349. This was quite surprising since the distance of the residues is a far way. Tyrosine and serine both contained hydroxyl group, however, the proton on serine could not ionized while tyrosine does, in addition tyrosine contains bulky functional group and electron dense. These differences in electrostatic and electronic features might affect the probability of secondary structure of surrounding amino acid residues, however simulation result showed that substitution of tyrosine to phenylalanine did not affect the secondary structure of amino acid residues at the above position (unpublished data) so it is unlikely that the bulky functional group and the electron dense caused the structural change. The most possible explanation is that the differences on the properties of hydroxyl group was the key factor for the structural change on the region and thus substitution of tyrosine to serine reduced the energetic state and stabilized secondary structure to form helix (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>All the data obtained suggests that tyrosine at AMLRY motif is important amino acid residue for the interaction to eRF3, however the hydroxyl group of tyrosine seems does not directly involve on the binding to eRF3. The intact of three dimensional structure of domain 3 of eRF1 is suggested as a key factor for the interaction to eRF3.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Prof M. F.
