The Tec family kinase Itk has been suggested to be an amplifier of signals emanating from the TCR and the loss of Itk partially affects most stages of thymopoiesis. Loss of Itk also differentially affects the development of conventional vs. non-conventional or innate memory phenotype T cells. Here, we examine whether these lineage choices are affected by a combination of TCR affinity and Itk by analyzing mice lacking Itk and carrying two TCR transgenes with differing affinities, OT-II and DO11.10. Our results show that developing thymocytes receive a gradient of signals, DO11.10&#x0003e;OT-II&#x0003e;DO11.10/Itk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x0003e;OT-II/Itk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>. We also show that the development of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is controlled by TCR signaling via Itk, which regulates the expression of the transcription factor, Th-POK, an enforcement factor for CD4 commitment. This results in a reduction in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell development, and an increase in the development of MHC class II restricted TCR transgenic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that resemble non-conventional or innate memory phenotype CD8 T cells. This alteration accompanies increased expression of Runx3 and its target genes Eomesodermin, Granzyme B and Perforin in Itk null OT-II CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocytes. All together, these data suggest that Itk plays an important role in CD4/CD8 commitment by regulating signal thresholds for the lineage commitment. Our data also suggest that the lower level of TCR signaling that occurs with a low affinity TCR in the absence of Itk can redirect some MHC class II restricted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell to class II-restricted CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> innate memory phenotype T cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mature T cell development takes place in the thymus and is critically dependent on signals through the TCR. During T cell development, TCR signals generated by interaction with major histocompatibility complex class (MHC)-II peptide complexes are required for differentiation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, while TCR signals generated by interaction with class I MHC-peptide complexes are required for differentiation of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. This process, referred as CD4 and CD8 commitment, is a major developmental process after positive and negative selection.

These findings support the idea that attenuating TCR signaling could redirect thymocytes with class II restricted TCRs from CD4 to the CD8 lineage, while enhanced signaling could redirect thymocytes with class I specific TCRs from CD8 to CD4 lineage. Other evidence indicates that the duration of signaling as well as the number of TCRs triggered are key factors in determining CD4/CD8 T cell fate decision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Yasutomo1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Liu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A role for TCR affinity has not been implicated in these events, but may play a role dependent on whether TCR affinity affects these implicated signaling events.</p><p>The IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (Itk), a Tec family kinase, regulates TCR signals and is considered an amplifier of these signals in T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-August1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Berg1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Readinger1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Prince1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based on these observations and the important roles of other TCR signaling proteins such as Lck and ZAP70 in the CD4/CD8 commitment, it seems likely that the Itk may also influence CD4/CD8 commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Schaeffer3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Berg and colleagues have examined this issue by crossing Itk deficient mice to mice carrying the AND MHC class II restricted TCR, along with different MHCs that had varying affinities for TCR, and observed that while Itk affects positive selection and development of CD4 SP thymocytes, CD8 SP thymocyte development is not affected, suggesting that the Itk signaling is not involved in the lineage commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Lucas3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these experiments did not rule out the possibility that signals in the TCR transgenic systems used in this study may be above a certain threshold that, even in the absence of Itk, does not affect CD4 and CD8 lineage commitment.</p><p>We and others have recently reported that large majority of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in mice lacking Itk have the characteristics of memory cells and innate immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Berg2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Broussard1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Atherly1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Dubois1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Hu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These cells have been referred to as &#x0201c;non-conventional CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;innate memory phenotype cells&#x0201d;. By contrast, cells carrying the surface phenotype of na&#x000ef;ve CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have the characteristics of conventional CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and are drastically reduced in the absence of Itk. These data suggest that Itk modulated signals may regulate the development of specific subpopulations of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. However, it is not clear if these CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells develop because they are destined to become CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and the Itk signals regulate whether they develop into conventional or non-conventional CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, or whether Itk signals regulate the development of these cells regardless of their initial cell fate choice. Here, we have analyzed mice lacking Itk and carrying two low affinity TCR transgenes specific for a peptide derived from Ovalbumin (OT-II mice, DO11.10, presented by different respective MHC class II molecules in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice), to determine if cells destined to become class II restricted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are affected by the absence of Itk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Barnden1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results show that compared to thymocytes developing in DO11.10/Itk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, thymocytes in OT-II/Itk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice receive reduced TCR signals, with reduced development of &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; transgenic CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and subsequent development of significant numbers of peptide specific MHC class II restricted TCR transgenic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Furthermore, a large majority of these TCR transgenic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have the characteristics of non-conventional or innate memory phenotype CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. We also show that the absence of Itk affects the expression of Th-POK (T help inducing POK factor), Runx3 (runt-related transcription factor 3) and TOX (thymocyte selection-associated HMG box), transcription factors that regulate the development of CD4 and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. These data indicate that the absence of Itk allows the development of non-conventional CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells even if they carry a class II restricted TCR, and suggest that the development of these cells is regulated in part by altered signals from this low affinity TCR. Altered development of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> na&#x000ef;ve T cells in the absence of Itk may be a consequence of reduced TCR signaling, resulting in reduced expression of the transcription factor, Th-POK, a master regulator of CD4 commitment, and increased expression of Runx3 with accompanying changes in cell fate decision.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Absence of Itk Results in Reduced Development of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T Cells</title><p>We compared the development of CD4 and CD8 single-positive (SP) T cells in the thymi of mice lacking Itk and found, as previously reported, that the absence of Itk results in reduced percentages of CD4 SP T cells, with an increase in the percentage of CD8 SP T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008891-g001"><bold>Fig. 1a</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Hu2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Hu3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Broussard2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Atherly2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Horai1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008891-Dubois2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data here suggest that a Lck-Itk-MAP kinase signaling pathway in double positive thymocytes may modulate the development of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, with perhaps default development of CD8 T cells (with of course consequences for the development of conventional vs. non-conventional or innate memory phenotype CD8 T cell development). Our data also suggest that components of the TCR signaling pathway may affect the lineage choices of T cells dependent on the affinity of the TCR. Final decisions on lineage choice may thus be determined by the combination of TCR affinity and strength of the TCR signals with absolute levels of signaling determining lineage commitment choices.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>We used WT or Itk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice all on a C57BL/6 background, between 6&#x02013;12 weeks of age, which were kept in specific pathogen free conditions.
