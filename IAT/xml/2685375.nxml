For example GM-CSF upregulates expression of TLR2 in human neutrophils and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], elicits IL-8 release from neutrophils through TLR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and enhances expression of TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and TLR9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in neutrophils. Administration of anti-GM-CSF antibody after LPS challenge effectively reduced neutrophil counts and endotoxin-induced TLR4 expression in the lungs of BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], indicating that GM-CSF may contribute to a protective immunity against bacteria infection. As an active proinflammatory cytokine, GM-CSF can be generated by several cell sources including T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, keratinocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The reports that human mast cells can produce substantial level of GM-CSF following bacterial PGN activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and human cord blood-derived mast cells and human mast cell line (HMC-1) can release GM-CSF in response to IgE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or calcium ionophore A23187 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], suggest that GM-CSF is likely to affect mast cell functions.</p><p>Mast cells have long been recognized as the primary effector cells of allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, recent insight into mast cells has revealed this cell type as key players in the regulation of innate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as well as adaptive immunity through TLRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It was found that Peptidoglycan (PGN) from Staphylococcus aureus stimulated bone marrow-derived mast cells in a TLR2-dependent manner to produce TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], whereas LPS from Escherichia coli stimulated mast cells in a TLR4-dependent manner to produce TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Poly(I:C), R-848, and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, which are TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 activators was able to induce proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-2) release from murine fetal skin-derived cultured mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the mechanisms through which these TLR expressions on mast cells and cytokine release from mast cells were regulated remain poorly understood.</p><p>TLRs are a group of single membrane-spanning non-catalytic receptors that recognize structurally conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from microbes, and activate immune cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Among the 11 known TLRs, TLR3 has been shown to be present in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and murine mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], which responds to viral double-stranded RNA and single-stranded RNA of selected species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. TLR7 has also been found in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and murine mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which can be recognized by synthetic imidazoquinoline as well as several single-stranded RNA sequences of viral origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Similarly, TLR9 have been located in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] or murine mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which can be activated by DNA sequences that are rare in mammalian genomes but common in the genetic materials of bacteria, fungi, and DNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Since TLRs are receptors for micro-organism pathogens, mast cells highly express them, GM-CSF can regulate TLR expression and cytokine production in inflammatory cells, we anticipate that GM-CSF ought to regulate TLR expression and cytokine production in mast cells, and through which participate in innate immunity against bacterial and viral invasion. We found that GM-CSF were able to upregulate expression of TLR3 and TLR7 on P815 mast cells and provoke IL-13 and IL-6 release from P815 mast cells in the present study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of TLRs in P815 cells</title><p>In order to ensure if P815 cells are the appropriate cells for the investigation of regulatory effect of GM-CSF on TLR expression, we first examine the expression of TLRs in these cells.

However, little is known of the ability of GM-CSF in induction of cytokine release from mast cells. In order to examine if GM-CSF can induce cytokine release from mast cells, P815 cells were challenged with GM-CSF, and levels of IL-6, IL-12 and IL-13 were measured. They represent proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6), Th1 cytokines (IL-12) and Th2 cytokines (IL-13), respectively. The results showed that GM-CSF at 0.1 to 100 ng/ml induced a concentration dependent release of IL-6 from P815 cells following 16 h incubation. Approximately up to 2.3 fold increase in IL-6 release was achieved when 100 ng/ml of GM-CSF was incubated with cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Similarly, GM-CSF provoked approximately up to 2.4 fold increase in IL-13 release from P815 cells following 16 h incubation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Preincubation of anti-GM-CSF antibody with cells for 30 min significantly eliminated GM-CSF induced IL-6 and IL-13 secretion (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>).

Since MAPK pathway inhibitors and PI3K inhibitor inhibited GM-CSF induced expression of TLR3 and TLR7 as well as IL-13 and IL-6 secretion, it is most likely that GM-CSF induced IL-13 and IL-6 secretion is through TLR3 and TLR7 related mechanisms. GM-CSF could also prime the cells to respond to R-848 a TLR7 ligand stimulation. The previous findings that TLR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], TLR7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and TLR9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] are present in mast cells, and that GM-CSF can regulate expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] support our observation above.</p><p>As the main TLR related to the viral recognition, TLR3 have been shown to be able to respond to viral RNAs of selected species, and resulted in production of IFN-&#x003b2; and RANTES/CCL5 that are critical in regulating T-cell functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, TLR3-activated mast cells elicited strong chemotactic responses to CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Like TLR3, TLR7 has also been demonstrated to recognize several single-stranded RNA sequences of viral origin. TLR7 activators, R-848 could activate murine mast cell to release proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6) and chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1&#x003b1; and MIP-2), and these factors, in turn, can contribute to antiviral effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recent study found that mucosal activation of TLR7 by virus is one of the main mechanisms for the mast cell-dependent anorexia and hypothermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Since TLR3 and TLR7 play critical roles in innate immune recognition of virus, our results suggest that GM-CSF is likely to play a promising role as immunodulator for enhancing virus recognition by mast cells.</p><p>To confirm the potential pivotal role of GM-CSF in immunity, we measured the levels of IL-12, IL-13 and IL-6 in GM-CSF treated cell supernatant. Instead of induction of IL-12 production, GM-SCF elicited a significant IL-13 release from P815 cells. Since IL-13 is emerging as an important mediator in the development of Th2 cell responses, which can induce IgE secretion from activated human B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and acts more prominently as a molecular bridge linking allergic inflammatory cells to the non-immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we believe that GM-SCF also play a role in acquired immune response such as allergic reactions. GM-SCF has been implicated in allergic inflammation in the previous studies. It was reported that a higher proportion of cells expresses GM-CSF mRNA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from asthma patients compared with healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. When asthma patients were challenged with allergen, GM-CSF levels increased in the BAL fluid, and the levels correlated with the number and percentage of BAL eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Administration of a GM-CSF-neutralizing mAb attenuated allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma, significantly reducing airway hyperresponsiveness, airway eosinophilia, and pulmonary inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. IL-6 has long been recognized as a potent proinflammatory cytokine, which can be released from activated mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and contributes to local inflammation and vessel expansion in airway walls of asthmatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Induction of IL-6 from P815 cells by GM-SCF proves further that GM-CSF participates in the pathogenesis of inflammation.</p><p>GM-CSF induced IL-13 secretion appeared to be through activation of MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, whereas GM-CSF elicited IL-6 release seemed via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as MAPK pathway inhibitors or PI3K inhibitor inhibited GM-CSF induced IL-13 or IL-6 secretion. While little information on GM-CSF signal pathways of mast cells is available, a study which showed that GM-CSF modulates the CpG-independent, MyD88-dependent neutrophil response to bacterial DNA, by increasing the activation of the ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] may help to understand our above observations. The work demonstrated that C3a stimulated substantial MCP-1 and RANTES/CCL5 production, and ERK and Akt phosphorylation in human LAD 2 mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; and our former study that IL-12 induced IL-4 release through activation of ERK and Akt signaling pathways in P815 mast cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] may support our current findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ability of GM-CSF in modulation of expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in P815 mast cells and in stimulation of IL-13 and IL-6 release from P815 mast cells in vitro suggests that GM-CSF might play an important role in enhancing the innate immune responses of mast cell to viral infection</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and cells</title><p>Paraformaldehyde, bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V) and 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole (SB203580) were from Sigma Inc.
