Most of the biological function of Id2 has been ascribed to its helix-loop-helix motif. Overexpression of Id2 is frequently observed in various human tumors, but its role for invasion potential in tumor cells is dispute. We aimed to reveal the role of Id2 in invasion potential in poorly invasive and estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;)-positive MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells were stably transfected with the wild-type, degradation-resistant full-length or helix-loop-helix (HLH)-deleted Id2, respectively.

Transfection of the wild-type Id2 significantly induced the invasion potential and migratory capacity of cells, which was further augmented by transfection with the degradation-resistant full-length or HLH-deleted Id2. E-cadherin protein expression and transactivation of the proximal E-cadherin promoter were markedly suppressed by the degradation-resistant full-length or HLH-deleted Id2 but not wild-type Id2.

In carcinomas, the metastasis is thought to be a complex biological process. The first crucial step is the movement of cancer cells into tissue surrounding the tumor and vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. During this step, a small proportion of epithelial tumor cells lose cell-cell adhesion and gain higher mobility, thus allowing them to invade the adjacent tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Hence, the molecular events that contribute to the increased motility of tumor cells has become important for understanding tumor metastasis as well as for targets for potential therapeutic intervention in human cancers. Both human breast cancer MCF-7 and human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells are estrogen-receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;)-positive epithelial tumor cell lines. They are usually used as experimental cell models because of their poorly invasive capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These cell models are helpful for exploring genes aberrantly expressed in tumor cells that contribute to tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Inhibitor of differentiation 2 (Id2) is one of the four members of the Id protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In normal organisms, Id proteins are key regulators in development. They control lineage determination, differentiation, and proliferation in a variety of diverse cell types by regulating transcriptional networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Id mRNA and protein levels are elevated in diverse human tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. By fueling several key features of tumor progression, including deregulated proliferation, invasiveness and metastasis, Id proteins contribute to multiple steps of tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although the general role of Id2 proteins has been considered pro-growth and anti-differentiation in various human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], their role in modulating invasion and metastasis of some specific tumor cells remain to be investigated.</p><p>All members of the Id protein family share a similar structure consisting of a highly conserved helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Apart from the HLH structure, both the NH<sub>2 </sub>and COOH region sequences vary greatly among Ids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The growing interest in the biology of Id proteins during the past decades has not substantially modified the primary function of "inhibitor of DNA binding" as originally assigned in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This function has been ascribed to the HLH sequence motif, which mediates heterdimerization with the basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, ETS and PAX-DNA binding proteins, and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. When engaged by Id proteins, the transcription factor is no longer able to bind to DNA target sequences and activate transcription. Although the HLH motif of Id2 lies at the center of a molecular network controlled by Id2, evidence suggests that Id2 performs its HLH-independent function prominently in some specific cell types. For example, in both interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32D.3 myeloid progenitors and U2OS osteosarcoma cells, the non-HLH region of Id2 performed a prominent apoptosis-promoting function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Id2 protein is very unstable in cells. It contains a canonical D-box motif (RxxLxxxN) at residues 100 to 107. Recently, expression of Id2 with D-box mutation was found to be resistant to APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>-mediated degradation in cells, subsequently extending the half-life of Id2 to more than 10-fold that of the wild-type Id2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, ectopic expression of the degradation-resistant form of Id2 protein in certain tumor cell types might provide beneficial effects for displaying Id2-mediated signaling and phenotypic traits, which might easily be overlooked with transfection of wild-type Id2.</p><p>We aimed to reveal the role of Id2 and its degradation-resistant mutants in cell invasiveness and migration in poorly invasive MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cancer cells positive for ER&#x003b1;. We were particularly interested in whether the HLH feature of Id2 was implicated in the Id2 function and the Id2 protein effect on the metastasis suppressor E-cadherin. Ectopic expression of the wild-type human Id2 markedly increased the <italic>in vitro </italic>invasion capacity of MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cancer cells, which was further augmented by transfection with the degradation-resistant form of Id2. Strikingly, the HLH-deleted Id2 form could also significantly increase cell invasiveness and migration, which indicates that the invasion-promoting role of Id2 is independent of its ability to dimerize with bHLH members. The invasion potential induced by Id2 was only partially associated with the down-regulation of the metastasis suppressor E-cadherin, suggesting that multiple molecules associated with tumor metastasis may be implicated in this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The full-length coding region of the wild-type human Id2 in plasmid pLXSN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], was obtained from Prof. Desprez (California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, CA). The plasmid pcDNA3-Id2-DBM containing the complete coding sequence of the full-length human Id2 with D-box mutation was kindly donated by Prof. Iavarone (Columbia University Medical Center, New York) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The luciferase reporter gene construct (E-cadK1-<italic>Luc</italic>) containing the <italic>E-cadherin </italic>sequence and its mutants (E-cadK1-Luc-E-boxA, E-cadK1-Luc-E-boxB and E-cadK1-Luc-E-boxC) were provided by Dr. Eric R Fearon (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). The E-cadherin expression vector was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The Id2-DBM-&#x003b4;HLH fragment, lacking the entire HLH domain (codons 35 to 76 aa), was derived from pcDNA3-Id2-DBM by a sequential PCR scheme. In PCR reaction A, pcDNA3-Id2-DBM was amplified with 5'-atgaaagccttcagtcccgt-3' and 5'-gtccagggcgatcaggctcatcgggtcg-3' as the upstream and downstream primers, respectively, to give a 117-bp fragment. In PCR reaction B, pcDNA3-Id2-DBM was amplified with 5'-ccgatgagcctgatcgccctggactcgc-3' and 5'-ttagccacacagtgctttgc-3' as the upstream and downstream primers, respectively, to give a 189-bp fragment. Aliquots of each PCR product were purified after agarose gel electrophoresis and combined to serve as a template for a final PCR with the use of the PCR A upstream primer and the PCR B downstream primer. The 282-bp PCR product was then subcloned into <italic>Hind </italic>III and <italic>BamH </italic>I sites of pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA3.1-Id2-DBM-&#x003b4;HLH.

After 10- to 14-day G418 screening, the drug-resistant clones appeared and were mixed for amplified culture. All of the parental cells were killed by G418 within this period. On western blot analysis, endogenous Id2 protein was not detected in MCF-7 cells and weakly detected in SKOV-3 cells, but ectopic transfection of Id2 markedly increased the expression of Id2 protein in both cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Ectopic transfection of D-box mutant Id2 further increased Id2 protein expression 2 to 3-fold that of transfection with the wild type Id2. A band corresponding to HLH-deleted Id2-DBM was detected using a rabbit anti-Id2 monoclonal antibody. Next, we further measured the mRNA levels of Id2 and its mutants in transfected cells by RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and found the mRNA expression of Id2 are consistent with protein levels in empty vector- and wild-type Id2-transfected cells.

Id2-DBM-&#x003b4;HLH mRNA could be detected in cells, which confirms the effective expression of the HLH-deleted Id2.

Both MCF-7 and SKOV-3 are poorly invasive cell lines, but their invasion potential is moderately increased in the presence of fibronectin as the chemoattractant.

In contrast to mock transfection, Id2 transfection produced a 40% and 50% increase of the invasiveness of MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, right panel).

These results pointed to a linear link between the invasive capacity of MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells and Id2 expression level and also indicate that this functional link did not depend on the presence of HLH domain of Id2.

Thus, down-regulation of E-cadherin expression is responsible only in part for the HLH domain-independent Id2-enhanced invasion, and over-accumulated Id2 could induce other unknown signaling through its non-HLH region to promote cell invasion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Tumor progression is the evolution of already tumorigenic cells towards increasing malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During tumor progression, further aberrant molecular events may occur in a specialized subset of low invasive cancer cells and ultimately promote these cells to acquire the ability of highly invasive growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Identification of the molecules that predispose tumor cells to a more invasive phenotype is helpful for understanding the tumor metastasis process as well as providing potential therapeutic targets for tumor progression. In this study, we manipulated Id2 expression in poorly invasive MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cancer cells and determined the effects on cell proliferation, <italic>in vitro </italic>invasion and migration. Id2 could facilitate the invasive and migratory capabilities of MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, structure and function analyses revealed that the HLH domain of Id2 is not required for its pro-invasive function. These observations suggest that the aberrant accumulation of Id2 in some specific non-aggressive epithelial tumor cells may be sufficient to convert them into more invasive cells.</p><p>Elevated levels of Id2 expression have been reported in carcinomas of breast, ovary, colon and prostate, in neural tumors, melanoma, Ewing's sarcoma and in hematological malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In some cases, high levels of Id2 expression are associated with disease severity and poor prognosis. However, significant contradictions exist in various types of human tumors. In addition, cell-based experiments indicated that Id2 has diverse and complex biological effects depending on cell lineage, differentiation state, and other contextual considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For example, down-regulation of Id2 expression in highly metastatic PC-3 human prostate cancer cells reduced their growth potential and invasiveness, which indicates the pro-proliferation and pro-invasion roles of Id2 in some epithelial cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Conversely, ectopic expression of Id2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 human breast cancer cells did not significantly affect cell growth but markedly reduced the cells' invasive capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These controversial functional consequences of Id2 on tumor growth and invasion suggest the diverse nature of Id2 target signaling pathways in different cell contexts. Therefore, careful evaluation is required to unambiguously identify the tumor cell types or subtypes that may use Id2 to control their different phenotypes. Although MCF-7 is also a human breast cancer cell line, its genetic background and phenotypic characteristics differ greatly in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells. Generally, the MCF-7 cell line is representative of ER&#x003b1;-positive and non-aggressive human breast cancers; however, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 are representative of ER&#x003b1;-negative breast cancer cells. In addition, SKOV-3 is an ovarian carcinoma cell line with ER&#x003b1;-positive and non-aggressive phenotypes. In this study, overexpression of Id2 or either of its two mutants increased the invasive capacity of MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells but did not alter the proliferation of either of these two cell lines. The functional role of Id2 in the cell invasion phenotype in MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells is completely contrary to that previously observed in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells. Considering the expression of ER&#x003b1; in MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells, we postulated that the aberrant Id2 expression may play an important role in converting ER&#x003b1;-positive epithelial tumor cells into highly invasive cells. Although a high expression of Id2 in primary breast cancer cells was reported to confer favorable clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], our findings suggest that the analysis of Id2 expression in combination with ER&#x003b1; status may be better for prognostic reevaluation of breast cancer.</p><p>Our important finding is that the HLH domain of Id2 is not required for the pro-invasive activity of the protein and that the level of expression of an invasion-suppressing molecule, E-cadherin, is down-regulated by only the degradation-resistant Id2 form. These observations raise the possibility that different expression levels of Id2 can influence different gene expression through a heretofore unknown transcriptional activity of its non-HLH region. Consistent with this is our observation that the transactivation of E-cadherin promoter is significantly suppressed by the degradation-resistant full-length and HLH-deleted Id2 forms but not the wild-type form. Although MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells are highly sensitive to changes in the levels of E-cadherin and will undergo enhanced invasion if E-cadherin is down-regulated, supplementation of E-cadherin in cells does not completely antagonize the invasion potential induced by Id2-DBM-&#x003b4;HLH. Overexpression of the wild-type Id2 in MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells did not reduce E-cadherin expression but did indeed promote the invasion and migration of both cell lines. So, different mechanisms are involved in the invasion potential induced by different Id2 expression levels in cells.</p><p>Previous studies have linked Id and E-cadherin expression in some specific cell types. Id proteins have been shown to activate E-cadherin in normal epithelial cells by inhibiting E2A protein, which represses the most proximal E-cadherin promoter in these cells through interaction with the E-box elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, apparent contradiction exists in some specific cell types. For example, in uveal melanoma Mel202 and Mel290 cells, Id2 suppressed E-cadherin expression through inhibiting the transactivation of its proximal promoter by an unknown regulatory mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In this study, Id2 suppressed E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells through a mechanism independent of its dimerization to bHLH factors when Id2 was accumulated to a high level in cells.</p><p>E-cadherin is often positive in ER&#x003b1;-positive cancer cells and often negative in ER&#x003b1;-negative tumor cells (such as MCF-7 versus MDA-MB-231 cells), and loss of E-cadherin may result in the more aggressive growth of ER&#x003b1;-positive cells by increasing the probability of invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Epithelial cancers arise within an epithelium where cells are constrained by E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions. Hence, in the early stages of these cancers, E-cadherin must be down-regulated to escape the local epithelial environment and invade local structures. In this paradigm, the aberrant accumulation of Id2 and the subsequent E-cadherin down-regulation as we described should provide a selective growth advantage in the tumor microenvironment by increasing the probability of invasion and metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, in our analyses of the expression of Id2 and its mutants in ER&#x003b1;-positive MCF-7 and SKOV-3 cells, aberrant accumulation of Id2 in certain ER&#x003b1;-positive epithelial tumor cells indeed increased the cells' invasive potential through a novel mechanism independent of dimerization to bHLH factors and E-cadherin partially contributes to Id2-induced cell invasion in an HLH domain-independent manner when Id2 is accumulated to a high level in some specific cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WH participated in the design of the study, performed the experimental data acquisition, performed data analyses and interpretation and drafted the manuscript.
