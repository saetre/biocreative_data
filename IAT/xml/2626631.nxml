Based on histology two different types of lung cancer, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are defined. Overall 50&#x00025; of all adenocarcinomas, the most prevalent form of NSCLC, harbor mutations in constituents of the mitogenic signaling cascade i.e EGFR, K-Ras and B-RAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Marks1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations of C-RAF are also found in NSCLC, however, at a lower frequency.</p><p>Several systems that model lung cancer in the mouse have been reported. The strategies to establish these models have basically followed two different paths. 1) Induction of oncogene expression and deletion of tumor suppressor genes via adenovirus directed expression of Cre-recombinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Meuwissen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Dankort1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This approach mimics occurrence of somatic mutations in adult tissues. 2) Constitutive oncogene expression in target cells through the use of cell type specific promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Fisher1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Kerkhoff1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter models may be more appropriate for gestationally acquired mutations. While the virally induced models show a somewhat undefined target cell spectrum the transgenic approach has the potential of targeting all the transformation sensitive cells that show expression from a particular cell type specific promoter.</p><p>We previously described the generation of transgenic lines expressing an oncogenically activated version of the C-RAF kinase (C-RAF BXB) under the control of the human alveolar type two (AT2) cell specific surfactant protein C (SP-C) promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Kerkhoff1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Two founder lines, further on referred to as BXB11 and BXB23, show lung targeted adenoma development with high penetrance, high incidence and short latency. Tumors are phenotypically rather stable as no nuclear atypia or metastasis was seen on a C57Bl/6 background. A cuboidal cell type predominantly forms the adenomas. No bronchial epithelial hyperplasia continuous with cuboidal tumors as described for oncogenic K-Ras models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Jackson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> has been observed. The BXB23 founder line has been used extensively in genetic studies to analyze tumor progression influencing factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Kerkhoff1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Kramer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the transgene expression in principal targets all AT2 cells only a subset of them responded to expression of the C-RAF BXB with the formation of tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Kerkhoff1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. One explanation of this finding is that a lung progenitor compartment responds to mitogenic cascade signaling with expansion. Alternatively shut down of transgene expression in the majority of AT2 cells may occur. We favour the first possibility and assume that this progenitor compartment is Bmi1 positive and depends on mitogenic cascade signaling for self-renewal since treatment with a MEK inhibitor led to preferential reduction in the fraction of Bmi1 positive tumor cells and a dramatic decrease in tumor mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Kramer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with these findings cells of the primitive endoderm which will give rise to lung progenitor cells show dependence on mitogenic signaling for self-renewal rather than differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Yamanaka1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It has previously been shown that the polycomb group protein Bmi1 is a crucial factor for self-renewal in adult stem cells/tumor stem cells through the inhibition of the INK4a/ARF locus encoding p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>/p19<sup>ARF</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Sangiorgi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Sparmann1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>). Bmi1 has also recently been identified as a prognostic marker for NSCLC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Breuer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Vrzalikova1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and belongs to a group of factors that have been identified as a death-from-cancer signature in human malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Glinsky1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study we set out to evaluate Bmi1 function in RAF induced adenoma formation.

As judged from H&#x00026;E staining there was no difference in histopathology of tumors from both lines. However, the number of tumor foci per area was strikingly different. Quantification of tumors showed a 4&#x02013;5 fold higher incidence in lungs of BXB11 as compared to BXB23 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004230-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Based on the number of tumors per section we calculated the total amount of tumors per lung in the range of 3000 in an average BXB23 lung and 12000&#x02013;15000 tumors in an average BXB11 lung.

Comparison of tumor volume between founders did not reveal significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004230-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

We show that BXB11 has a four fold higher incidence and shorter latency of adenomas allowing examination of advanced disease in the absence of Bmi1. Depletion of Bmi1 in both the BXB23 and BXB11 background led to a pronounced decrease in tumor growth rate and an increase in cell death within the adenomas. In contrast no significant reduction in tumor initiating events could be observed in both founder lines, arguing for Bmi1 being an important factor for tumor expansion rather then initiation.</p><p>Based on the observation, that Bmi1 is expressed in the C-RAF BXB initiated lung adenomas and that Bmi1 is a target of RAF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Voncken1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> we decided to investigate adenoma formation in the absence of Bmi1. The abrogation of Bmi1 expression in the BXB23 and BXB11 background did not yield a significant reduction in tumor initiation events as defined by the number of tumors that were formed in the various genetic combinations by two weeks of age. Analysis of lung adenoma cells in the absence or presence of Bmi1 did not reveal differences at the morphological and at cell marker expression level. Therefore the absence of Bmi1 did not affect the process of tumor initiation. These results are consistent with a previously published report showing Bmi1 independent glioma initiation albeit in the absence of INK4a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004230-Bruggeman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The absence of Bmi1 did not affect the identity of the resulting tumor cells with respect to morphology and expression of a limited set of markers. These results also indicate that Bmi1 is not required for the specification of a tumor initiating cell within the lung. Phospho-ERK levels may compensate Bmi1 loss for short term but not long term self renewal divisions of initiated cells as we observed significant tumor growth in Bmi1&#x02212;/&#x02212;BXB11 showing higher nuclear phospho-ERK followed by cessation of cell division at late time points (three months of age) when nuclear phosphor-ERK was still present. In the course of our studies we also did not observe changes in lung morphology in Bmi1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice indicating that Bmi1 is not a crucial factor for proper lung development. We found a strong up-regulation of p19<sup>ARF</sup>, p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and, p15<sup>INK4b</sup> in whole lung RNA preparations of Bmi1&#x02212;/&#x02212; animals as compared to wild type littermates.

Obviously, expression of cdkis does not impair normal lung cell function.

In this system BASCs have been described to be involved in lung tumor formation. Specifically it has been reported that K-Ras amplifies BASCs at bronchiolar alveolar duct (BAD) junctions and that these transformed stem cells form a stream that supplies lung tumor foci. SP-C promoter controlled expression of RAF clearly does not expand BASCs at BAD junctions yet is very efficient in giving rise to NSCLC. Consistently we did not observe any BASCs within RAF driven tumors that infrequently localize in the vicinity of BAD junctions indicating that the histogenesis of NSCLC in these two tumor models may differ.
