We show that CT inhibits Th1 responses in vivo in mice infected with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii.</italic> This correlated with low serum IL-12 levels and a selective reduction in the numbers of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> conventional DCs (cDCs) in lymphoid organs. CT inhibited the function of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 8, a transcription factor known to positively regulate IL-12p35 and p40 gene expression, and the differentiation of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed that exposure to CT, forskolin, or dibutyryl (db) cAMP blocked LPS and IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced IRF8 binding to chromatin. Moreover, CT and dbcAMP inhibited the binding of IRF8 to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)&#x02013;like element in the mouse IL-12p40 promoter, likely by blocking the formation of ISRE-binding IRF1&#x02013;IRF8 heterocomplexes. Furthermore, CT inhibited the differentiation of pDCs from fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand&#x02013;treated bone marrow cells in vitro. Therefore, because IRF8 is essential for IL-12 production and the differentiation of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDCs and pDCs, these data suggest that CT and other Gs-protein agonists can affect IL-12 production and DC differentiation via a common mechanism involving IRF8.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Cholera toxin (CT) is composed of a monomeric A subunit (CTA) and a pentameric B subunit (CTB). After binding of CTB to cell surface gangliosides, CTA acts to catalyze the ADP ribosylation of the intracellular G protein subunit Gs&#x003b1;, which then dissociates from Gs&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-dimer and activates adenylate cyclase. This results in the induction of cAMP and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Enzymatically active CT, as well as other ligands that induce cAMP production, can inhibit the production of IL-12 from monocytes and DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). CT also inhibits expression of IL-12&#x003b2;1 and -12&#x003b2;2 receptors on activated T cells, suppresses the function of Th1 but not Th2 T cell clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), and drives the differentiation of Th2 and IL-10&#x02013;producing Tr1 T cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In vivo<italic>,</italic> CT inhibits the production of both IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; in mice given LPS systemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Given orally with most soluble protein antigens, CT preferentially drives Th2 responses locally and systemically, which is associated with production of IgA and IgG1&#x0003e;IgG2a antibodies; and after repeated oral dosing, CT induces high IgE levels to coadministered antigens that results in anaphylaxis to subsequent antigenic challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Together with several additional effects on immune and nonimmune cells, the ability of CT to block IL-12 production and responsiveness likely contributes to its ability to drive Th2 responses when given orally with protein antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>).</p><p>Although it has been reported that CTB alone can down-regulate IL-12 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), its inhibitory potency is a fraction of that caused by CT holotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). This indicates that the ability of CT to suppress IL-12 production is primarily dependent on the enzymatically active A subunit, as is its ability to act as an adjuvant in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In addition, the suppression of IL-12 by ligand-mediated activation of Gs protein&#x02013;coupled receptors, such as those for prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, histamine, &#x003b2;2-adrenergic agonists, adenosine, cannabinoids, and opiates, as well as by the cell-permeable cAMP analogue dbcAMP, suggests that the direct induction of cAMP by Gs protein activation plays a key role in CT-mediated IL-12 suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). However, the downstream effects of Gs protein&#x02013;induced cAMP on the signaling pathways required for IL-12 production are not clear.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Gs protein&#x02013;mediated inhibition of IL-12 production by cDCs</title><p>Prior studies demonstrated the ability of CT to inhibit the production of IL-12 from human monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). We initially determined whether this also applied to freshly isolated mouse conventional DCs (cDCs), and whether it extended to other Gs protein agonists. CT, as well as agonists for &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor (salbutamol), and the adenosine A2a receptor (CGS 21680; 2-p-[2-Carboxyethyl] phenethylamino-5-<italic>N</italic>-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine hydrochloride) suppressed the production of both IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 from spleen cDCs stimulated with SAC and IFN-&#x003b3; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080912/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>), whereas IL-10 production was not suppressed (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>CT inhibits the production of IL-12 after infection with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> in vivo</title><p>CT has been shown to induce Th2 responses after oral administration with soluble protein antigens; however, because CT is normally given with inactivated proteins, the extent to which CT can modify the helper T (Th) cell phenotype during the induction of strong Th1 responses, as occurs after infection with intracellular pathogens, is not clear. Furthermore, when given intranasally, or orally with less purified antigens, CT has been reported to induce Th1 and Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Therefore, we decided to test the ability of CT to modify Th1 responses in mice during systemic infection of BALB/c mice with a high dose of the ME-49 strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. In this model, mice develop IL-12&#x02013;dependent Th1 responses that clear the infection with 100% survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, systemic administration of CT during the course of infection resulted in 100% mortality with nearly identical kinetics to that occurring after systemic neutralization of IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In addition, parasite loads were high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and serum levels of IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; were suppressed in both CT and anti&#x02013;IL-12&#x02013;treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), consistent with CT having a dominant inhibitory effect on IL-12 production and the induction of Th1 responses to this infection.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; production in CT-treated mice results in increased parasite burden and mortality after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection.</bold> (A) Survival rate of BALB/c mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>.

To address this issue more directly, we infected mice after treatment with 0.5 &#x000b5;g of CT, which has only minor effects on CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDC numbers. At this dose, the effects of CT on the course of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection were highly variable, yet in some experiments we observed a significant effect on survival and parasite load, despite only a minor change in CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDC numbers (Fig. S3 and not depicted). To test the possibility that CT may affect IL-12 production independent of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDC loss, we gave graded doses of CT to mice, administered LPS systemically, and measured IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; levels in the serum. Prior studies have shown that CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDCs are a significant source of IL-12 under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), and that IFN-&#x003b3; production after LPS administration can be blocked with antibodies to IL-12p40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). We found that low doses of CT (0.5 &#x000b5;g) consistently suppressed both IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; production in response to LPS (Fig. S3). Furthermore, the total percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, were unchanged after CT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These studies suggest that systemic administration of CT has two dose-dependent effects in vivo, one resulting in the loss of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDCs and the other resulting in the inhibition of IL-12 production by DCs and possibly other cells.</p></sec><sec><title>CT blocks IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 8&#x02013;chromatin interactions</title><p>In our initial studies using human monocytes stimulated with LPS alone or LPS and IFN-&#x003b3;, CT had no effect on the activation of signaling molecules positively regulating IL-12 production, such as NF-&#x003ba;B, STAT-1, or the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and JNK (unpublished data). In addition, CT had no effect on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK, which is a known negative regulator of IL-12 expression (unpublished data). Moreover, CT treatment did not affect the surface expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 or IFN-&#x003b3; receptor on LPS-stimulated or unstimulated monocytes (unpublished data) or the IFN-&#x003b3; receptor signaling pathway, as IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced up-regulation of HLA-DR and CD40 was unaffected (unpublished data).</p><p>We next focused our study on the effect of CT on the function of IRF8, which is a transcription factor expressed by DCs, macrophages, granulocytes, and B cells; it is a positive regulator of IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and has a central role in the differentiation of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDC and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) populations. Furthermore, production of IL-12 in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is dependent on IRF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). IRF8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice lack the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> and pDCs, although they have CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Moreover, in these mice, the residual IRF8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cDCs display impaired responsiveness to TLR-mediated signals and fail to produce IL-12p40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Thus, IRF8 is essential for both IL-12 production by myeloid cells including cDCs and the development of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDCs that likely represent an IL-12&#x02013;producing DC subsets during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection.</p><p>We initially studied the dynamic interaction of IRF8 with chromatin in live cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, a method that was recently applied to the study of IRF8&#x02013;chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). For these studies, IRF8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Tot2 cells were stably transduced with IRF8-GFP that localizes to the nucleus. In the nucleus, IRF8-GFP is present in two functionally distinct forms: a fraction of low-mobility IRF8 molecules engaged in interactions with chromatin and a pool of highly mobile, unbound IRF8. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, in untreated IRF8-transduced Tot2 cells, a small fraction of immobile chromatin-bound IRF8 molecules was present, and 80% of the initial fluorescence signal is recovered within 4 s after photobleaching. When cells were stimulated with LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; that favored IRF8&#x02013;chromatin interaction, an increase in the immobile IRF8 pool, and a consequent reduction of the highly mobile unbound IRF8 fraction, occurred, resulting in significantly slower fluorescence recovery. In these samples, only 60% of the recovery occurred within the first 4 s of analysis, and the maximal recovery achieved was 70% of initial signal compared with 90% observed in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, red vs. black line). Treatment with CT, but not CTB, before stimulation with LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; produced a recovery curve similar to that of unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). Similar to what we observed with CT, cells pretreated with the G protein&#x02013;independent adenylate cyclase activator forskolin or the membrane-permeable cAMP analogue dbcAMP and stimulated with LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; displayed a quick recovery of fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>). Importantly, treatment with CT, CTB, forskolin, or dbcAMP alone did not alter the kinetics of fluorescence recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and D</xref>). IRF8-GFP was not overexpressed in IRF8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Tot2 cells because levels were below those of endogenous IRF8 in a macrophage cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that increased levels of cAMP, secondary to CT-induced Gs protein ADP ribosylation, impair the ability of IRF8 to bind to chromatin, and therefore to interact with its target promoters. Interestingly, IRF8 amplifies the transcription of its own gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Thus, the cAMP-dependent inhibition of IRF8 binding to its own promotor would lead to reduced IRF8 mRNA expression, a concept that is consistent with prior studies showing cAMP-dependent IRF8 mRNA down-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>cAMP-elevating agents reduce IRF8&#x02013;chromatin interaction elicited by LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; stimulation.</bold> IRF8-deficient myeloid progenitor Tot2 cells were transduced with IRF8-GFP, left untreated (untreated), or treated with LPS (1 &#x000b5;g/ml) and IFN-&#x003b3; (100 ng/ml) for 4 h (LPS+IFN-&#x003b3;), and subjected to FRAP analysis.

Similar to IRF8, stimulation with LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; induced IRF1 binding; however, neither CT nor dbcAMP reduced such interaction. Moreover, binding of TFIIB, a component of the RNA polymerase II complex, to the TATA box element included in the probe sequence, was unaffected by CT treatment, indicating that the inhibition exerted by CT and dbcAMP was specific for IRF8. Moreover, similar levels of IRF8 and IRF1 were detected in nuclear extracts of all cells stimulated with LPS and IFN-&#x003b3;, indicating that observed effects were not caused by reduced IRF8 expression in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).</p><p>The concomitant ability of IRF1 and inability of IRF8 to bind to the IL-12p40 promoter in cells treated with CT or dbcAMP prompted us to determine whether CT treatment could inhibit the formation of the IRF1&#x02013;IRF8 heterocomplex. Consistent with this possibility, CT markedly reduced the amount of nuclear IRF1&#x02013;IRF8 complex induced by LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRF1 is a crucial event for IRF1&#x02013;IRF8 complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). However, the amount of phosphorylated IRF1 induced by LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; was not modified by CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). This indicates that the ability of CT to block IRF1&#x02013;IRF8 complex formation is not caused by impaired IRF1 phosphorylation.</p><p>Together with IL-12 suppression, CT can enhance the ability of TLR ligands to induce DC production of IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-10, while inhibiting their production of TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). We confirmed the ability of CT and dbcAMP to inhibit the production of IL-12 and TNF-&#x003b1;, but not IL-10, in human peripheral blood monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs, and the RAW 264.7 cell line stimulated with LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080912/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). Interestingly, recent data indicate that TNF-&#x003b1; gene transcription in mouse macrophages is also regulated by IRF1 and IRF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Therefore, it is feasible that the mechanism by which CT and cyclic AMP blocks TNF-&#x003b1; production is also caused by effects on IRF1&#x02013;IRF8 interactions. The molecular events triggered by CT that lead to reduced IRF1&#x02013;IRF8 interaction remain unclear. In addition to IRF1, IRF8 has been reported to form heterocomplexes with other binding partners, including NFAT and PU.1. Interference with physical interaction between these proteins and IRF8 might regulate its ability to associate with DNA and IRF1. In support of this possibility, increased cAMP levels have been reported to inhibit NFAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). PKA-dependent phosphorylation of NFAT increased 14&#x02013;3-3 binding and reduced NFAT transcription activity at the IL-2 promotor. Whether CT and other cAMP inducers might affect such interactions is currently under investigation in our laboratories.</p></sec><sec><title>CT blocks the differentiation of pDCs from bone-marrow cells cultured with fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT-3L) in vitro and mouse spleen cells in vivo</title><p>Results of the FRAP analysis indicate that CT induces a general inhibition of IRF8 function, suggesting that other IRF8-dependent processes might also be affected. IRF8 plays a key role not only in the activation of IL-12p35 and p40 genes, but also in the normal development of pDC and CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDC populations in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Moreover, IRF8-deficent bone marrow cells fail to differentiate into pDCs when cultured in the presence of FLT-3L in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). We therefore studied the effect of CT on the generation of pDCs from FLT-3L&#x02013;stimulated bone marrow cultures. In keeping with previous reports, after culture with FLT-3L, one third of mouse bone marrow cells differentiated into CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells that also expressed B220 and Ly6c and could therefore be identified as pDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). In the presence of CT, we observed a dramatic reduction of the CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subset (from 34.6 to 4.28%), and a concomitant increase in the CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> population. In addition, only 50% of the remaining CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells expressed Ly6C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Conversely, exposure to CTB did not alter FLT-3L&#x02013;induced pDC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>), indicating that this effect of CT is dependent on the CTA activity. Consistent with these results, and similar to our findings with CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DCs, pDCs were preferentially lost after CT treatment in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). The ability of CT to inhibit the differentiation of pDCs from FLT-3L&#x02013;treated bone marrow and to induce pDC depletion in vivo is consistent with the hypothesis that IRF8&#x02013;DNA interaction is a major target of CT activity.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>CT, but not CTB, blocks pDC differentiation in vitro and in vivo.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Bone marrow from BALB/c mice femurs was cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml rh-FLT-3L with or without CT or CTB (both at 20 ng/ml).

In addition, we identify the inhibition of IRF8 function as a major molecular mechanism by which CT and other cAMP-inducing agents prevent IL-12 production in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the CT-induced block of IRF8 function is associated with impaired IRF1&#x02013;IRF8 heterocomplex formation that is independent of the phosphorylation state of IRF1. Finally, by blocking IRF8 function, CT may simultaneously inhibit IL-12p40 mRNA expression in macrophages and differentiated DCs and interfere with normal differentiation of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DCs (and pDCs) that represent a primary source of IL-12, at least under certain stimulation conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and cell lines.</title><p>8&#x02013;12-wk-old conventionally housed female BALB/c mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute and were used as approved under animal study protocol LMI11E by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/National Institutes of Health (NIH) Animal Care and Use Committee.
