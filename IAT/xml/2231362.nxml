Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes, but can also differentiate into non-mesenchymal cell, i.e. neural cells in appropriate <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>experimental conditions.

In RG, the mitogenic effect of thrombin is correlated with increased expression of nestin but in MSCs, this mitogenic effect is associated with nestin down-regulation. Both cell types express the PAR-1 type receptor for Thrombin and the effect of Thrombin on both cell types can be mimicked by its analogue TRAP-6 activating specifically this receptor subtype or by serum which contains various amount of thrombin. Moreover, we also demonstrate that serum deprivation-induced expression of nestin in MSCs is inhibited by high cell density (&#x0003e; 50,000 cells/cm2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work shows that thrombin stimulates the growth of both RG and MSCs and that nestin expression by MSCs and RG is regulated in opposite manner by thrombin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thrombin effect is thus associated in both cell types with a proliferating, undifferentiated state but in RG this involves the induction of nestin expression, a marker of immaturity for neural progenitors. In MSCs however, nestin expression, as it corresponds to a progression from the mesenchymal "undifferentiated", proliferating phenotype toward acquisition of a neural fate, is inhibited by the mitogenic signal.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Stem cells have the capacity to self-replicate or to produce progeny of one or several specific differentiated cell types. There are two types of stem cells: embryonic and somatic stem cells, which are found in foetal and adult tissue respectively. While they are generally committed to a particular tissue fate, somatic stem cells can alternatively generate cells belonging to different tissue types when they are exposed to specific cues produced by a different tissue. High hopes rest on the future application of stem cells in cellular therapies, including those of the central nervous system disorders. For this reason, the mechanisms that regulate the acquisition of a neural fate by somatic stem cells are under intensive study. In this work, we will extend our investigations of the regulation of the expression of nestin, a neural stem cell marker, by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and compare it to the corresponding process occurring in radial glial cells (RG), a major form of neural stem cell in mammalian central nervous system (CNS) development.</p><p>MSCs can differentiate into many types of mesenchymal phenotypes, i.e. osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes, and they can also differentiate into non-mesenchymal cell, i.e. neural cells, when grafted in the lesioned central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] or when grown <italic>in vitro </italic>together with neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the latter case, MSCs adopt a neural fate in co-culture only after expressing nestin, an intermediate filament protein which is predominantly expressed during early stages of development by stem and progenitor cells of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In cultivated MSCs, nestin expression requires serum-free conditions and at least 25 cell population doublings (corresponding to 10 cell passagings) to occur, suggesting a kind of maturation and/or selection of rat nestin-positive neurogenic MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>During development, the CNS of vertebrates contains an abundant cell type designated as radial glial cells (RG). These cells while classically known as guiding cues for migrating neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], play a major role as precursor cells for pyramidal neurons and astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Since RG express a number of astroglial characteristics and can differentiate into astrocytes after completing their guidance function, they have been previously considered as integral part of the glial lineage. However, it was recently demonstrated that RG may persist as neural stem cells in several discrete regions of the adult brain. RG are expressing nestin both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] as well as an antigen related to nestin and recognized by the RC2 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While several growth factors and activities are known to act on the proliferation and differentiation of RG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], their phenotype is also controlled <italic>in vitro </italic>by factors contained in serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Indeed, the transition between RC2-positive RG and stellate GFAP-positive astrocytes and its reversal can be induced, respectively, by withdrawal and addition of serum in the growth medium of cultures of developing cerebellar glial cells. In the case of MSCs, it is the withdrawal of serum that allows their expression of nestin suggesting that some serum-derived factors inhibit nestin expression in these cells.</p><p>Because serum-dependent effects on the stellation of astrocytes have been attributed to thrombin which is a normal serum component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we addressed the question of the regulation by thrombin of nestin expression in both MSCs and RG. Indeed there are indications that thrombin can have a regulatory role in nestin expression <italic>in vivo </italic>after experimental intracerebral haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We demonstrate that the presence of thrombin in the culture medium stimulates the growth of both RG and MSCs in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to the mitogenic effect, we demonstrate that thrombin represses nestin expression by MSCs but increases its expression by RG. We found that the PAR-1 receptor is involved in the regulation of nestin expression by both cell types to thrombin. Finally, we demonstrate that the modulation of nestin-expression by MSCs in serum-free conditions is dependent on their cell density.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Serum and thrombin mitogenic effect on Radial Glia and Mesenchymal stem cells</title><p>To measure the effect of serum and thrombin on the proliferation of MSCs and RG, cells that had been maintained in serum-free conditions were allowed to incorporate BrdU in the presence of serum or thrombin (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). An increase of the BrdU labelling index was observed for both MSCs and RG that were treated with serum or thrombin. While RG did not incorporate BrdU in the absence of serum, addition of thrombin at 2 nM stimulated their BrdU incorporation to 28% of that induced by serum. With MSCs, about 80% of all cells were incorporating BrdU in serum-free medium and addition of either serum or 900 pM thrombin to the medium lead to similar increases of labelling indexes up to 88 and 90% of all cells.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effect of serum and Thrombin on the proliferation of radial glia and rat MSCs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center">- serum</td><td align="center">+ serum</td><td align="center">+ Thrombin</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">RG (n = 3)</td><td align="center">1.8 +/- 1.62</td><td align="center">43.73 +/- 3.95 (**)</td><td align="center">12.2 +/- 3.22 (*)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MSCs (P10): all cells (n = 3)</td><td align="center">79.9 +/- 0.35</td><td align="center">88.5 +/- 0.23 (**)</td><td align="center">90.4 +/- 2.29 (**)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Nestin-negative MSCs (n = 3)</td><td align="center">68.8 +/- 0.74</td><td align="center">84.7 +/- 1.54 (**)</td><td align="center">83.2 +/- 2.21 (**)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Nestin-positive MSCs (n = 3)</td><td align="center">86.0 +/- 4.9</td><td align="center">92.0 +/- 8.9 (ns)</td><td align="center">89.6 +/- 1.06 (ns)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Ns: no significant difference.</p><p>*: p &#x0003c; 0,05.</p><p>** p &#x0003c; 0,01.</p><p>RG and rat MSCs were cultured for respectively 2 and 3 days in the absence of serum and then were grown for two further days in the presence of serum or with 2 nM (RG) or 900 pM (rat MSCs) of thrombin.

A decrease in the number of nestin-positive MSCs was observed when, after 72 hours in serum-free culture medium allowing them to express nestin, they were grown further for 3 days in the presence of serum or thrombin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>).

(L) There is however no difference when HS in MEM (18% of cell expressing nestin) is used instead of FBS in DEM (10% of cell expressing nestin). These results were confirmed by Western blotting (D), where nestin expression in rat MSCs cultivated in DEM, DEM + 1 nM of thrombin and DEM + 10% FBS was compared after 3 days of induction of nestin expression. The actin immunostaining controls the amount of protein loaded on the gel in each condition and allows to calculate the ratio between the intensity of the nestin and actin signals and to normalize data to the level of nestin expression in rat MSCs treated with DEM only (E). Rat MSCs were cultured for 3 days in serum-free medium to induce nestin expression. Then, those cells were renewed in DEM supplemented with different concentration of TRAP6, for a further 3 days period and then fixed and labelled with nestin antibody.

In immunoblots, the signal for nestin was observed in each condition but decreased in the presence of serum or thrombin while the signal obtained for actin remained unchanged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>).</p><p>In order to exclude an apoptotic effect of thrombin on MSCs that would lead to a specific decrease of the number of nestin-positive cells, we performed a TUNEL assay on MSCs treated with different concentrations of thrombin. No apoptotic cells were found in any condition, while a positive control, in which MSCs were treated by DNAse, showed a strong TUNEL labelling (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H,I</xref>).</p><p>An indirect effect of thrombin that would regulate nestin expression through an increase in cell density and cell to cell interactions can also be excluded. Although thrombin induces a proliferative effect on rMSC, no change in cell density occurred in cultures treated with increasing concentrations of thrombin for 3 days (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>). When, FUdR (10<sup>-5 </sup>M) was added to inhibit DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, a significant decrease of nestin expression by rMSC cultivated in DEM + 900 pM thrombin or 10% serum was still observed indicating that thrombin inhibits directly nestin expression by rMSC (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>).</p><p>An opposite effect was seen with radial glial cells which stop expressing nestin after 48 hours without serum but maintain this expression in the presence of serum, thrombin or TRAP-6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>).

No significant difference was found when nestin-positive rat MSCs were treated with DEM+10% FBS and MEM+10%HS, the medium used for RG cultivation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref>), suggesting that FBS and HS exert the same effect on nestin expression of rat MSCs. A similar effect was observed when mouse MSCs (after 25 cell population doublings) were tested (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), suggesting that the species difference between rat MSCs and mouse RG is not responsible for the observed different regulation of nestin expression by serum and thrombin.</p></sec><sec><title>Thrombin receptor in Radial Glia and Mesenchymal Stem Cells</title><p>The presence of the specific Thrombin receptor PAR-1 was demonstrated on both RG cells and MSCs by immunocytochemistry using the H-111 antibody.

In order to determine how cell density could regulate the expression of nestin by MSCs, cells were plated at various densities in growth medium without serum for 3 days to induce nestin expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>). We observed that at a density of 50,000 cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>or above, MSCs decrease by more than 8-fold their nestin expression in response to serum withdrawal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Those results were confirmed by Western blot on cultures established at a density of 20, 50 or 100&#x000b7;10<sup>3 </sup>MSCs/cm<sup>2 </sup>which reached about 70, 90 and 100% confluence before extraction as shown by phase contrast microscopy (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D&#x02013;F</xref>). Using identical amounts of total protein extracted from MSCs plated in serum-free conditions, nestin signal decreases with increasing cellular density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). Quantification of the nestin expression in each condition was determined by calculating the ratio between the intensity of the nestin bands and the corresponding actin signals used as internal control for the protein contents loaded on the gel.

Protein extracts were separated and revealed with anti-nestin and anti-actin antibodies. A decrease of nestin expression is apparent from an initial density of 50&#x000b7;10<sup>3 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>(G). Actin immunostaining controls the protein amounts loaded on the gel in each condition (H). Rat MSCs were cultivated at a density of 10,000 rat MSCs/cm<sup>2 </sup>together with different densities of rat MSCs in a physically separated millicell co-culture device. No significant difference was observed when the proportion of rat MSCs immunolabelled for nestin was compared in each condition (I) (n = 3, ANOVA1). Serum added in a millicell device as a positive control strongly inhibits nestin expression by rMSCs in the same setup. Scale bar A, B, D, E, F = 40 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-8-104-4"/></fig><p>To further characterize the mechanism (soluble factor versus membrane-bound factor) responsible for such an effect, we co-cultivated MSCs coated on coverslips at a permissive density for 48 hours in serum-free medium together with different densities of MSCs physically separated in a millicell device (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). No significant decrease in nestin expression is observed in the MSCs grown at a permissive density on coverslips (n = 3, ANOVA-1 test, p &#x0003e; 0.05) in the presence of a high density of MSCs in a millicell. This clearly suggests that the decrease of nestin expression at high MSCs cell density requires a direct cell-to-cell contact. As a positive control of the permeability of the millicell device in such setup, MSCs were cultivated at a permissive density in serum-free medium with 30% FBS loaded into a millicell device. A strong decrease of nestin expression was indeed observed under this condition.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease, plays central functions in haemostasis but also promotes a wide range of cellular responses via an interaction with specific seven-transmembrane domains receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thrombin and perhaps other coagulant proteases, mediates proliferative responses triggered by tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, thrombin is the most potent activator of blood platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], is chemotactic for monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and is a potent mitogenic factor for vascular smooth-muscle cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thrombin signalling is mediated by a family of G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs), for which PAR1 is the prototype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thrombin activates PAR1 through binding to and subsequent cleavage of the N-terminal domain of the receptor to expose a new amino-terminus that then acts as a tethered ligand to initiate intracellular signalling by the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We found on both radial glial cells and rat MSCs a membranous expression of PAR1 suggesting that thrombin may act on these cells physiology. We also found that PAR1 is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The intracellular staining for PAR1 can be explained by the presence of intracellular store of PAR1 in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>There is increasing evidence suggesting that members of the serine protease family, including thrombin, chymotrypsin, urokinase plasminogen activator, and kallikrein, may play a role in normal development and/or pathology of the nervous system. Thrombin-like proteases have been shown to exert deleterious effects on different neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations <italic>in vitro</italic>, including neurite retraction and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Moreover, the proteolytic activity of thrombin has been shown to inhibit long-term morphological differentiation in serum-free cultures of several cell types, including spinal cord and brain neurons, neuroblastoma cells, astroglial and neuroepithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Nestin expression in the adult nervous system has been detected in a number of pathological conditions including cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]., and traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] have demonstrated that intracerebral injections of low doses of thrombin that induces neuroprotection without causing detectable brain injury resulted in a marked increase in nestin expression indicating that this could constitute a protective mechanism induced in astrocytes by levels of stress that do not produce a definable lesion. Nestin expression could, therefore, represent an embryonic reversion of the mature cytoskeleton that may aid in the response to and recovery from a wide variety of cerebral injuries, but might also perhaps aid in damage prevention.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that nestin expression is regulated by thrombin in opposite manner in RG and MSCs although the proliferation of both cell types is stimulated by this protease. Thrombin effect is thus associated in both cell types with a proliferating, undifferentiated state but in RG cells this involves the induction of nestin expression, a marker of immaturity for neural progenitors. In MSCs however, nestin expression corresponds to the first step toward acquisition of a neural fate and thus corresponds to a progression from the mesenchymal "undifferentiated", proliferating phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Maintenance of MSCs proliferation in the presence of thrombin would indeed be associated with an inhibition of nestin expression by MSCs as it constitutes one feature of their undifferentiated state. A possible selection of one population type over the other can be discounted as an explanation for the decrease of nestin expression by MSCs in the presence of thrombin because this effect still occurs in cells that cannot proliferate when treated with FUdR. Furthermore, the absence of apoptotic cells in the cultures treated with thrombin as well as the similar proliferation rates for both nestin-negative and nestin-positive MSCs which are induced in the presence of serum or thrombin in the growth medium demonstrate that thrombin represses directly the expression of nestin by MSCs and does not act by selecting the population of nestin-negative cells.</p><p>Thus unlike radial glial cells, MSCs <italic>in vitro </italic>respond to thrombin by a decrease of nestin expression. The nestin gene contains two tissue-specific transcriptional elements : a cis-element in the first intron drives nestin expression in somitic muscle precursors, while an enhancer in the second intron directs expression to CNS precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and thus to radial glial cells. Which of these two regulatory elements controls nestin expression by MSCs remains to be determined.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate that nestin expression by MSCs decreases at a high cell density, as observed by immunocytofluorescence and Western blot assay. Tropepe <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] have found that embryonic stem cells express nestin when they differentiate into neural cells. This expression and the subsequent neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells are inhibited by a high cell density suggesting a similar behaviour for both MSCs and embryonic stem cells. It has also been demonstrated that a high cell density could accelerate the differentiation of human bone marrow MSCs into chondrocyte in a chondrogenic differentiation medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, this chondrogenic differentiation is mediated by soluble factors while the decrease of nestin expression observed in our experiments is mediated by a direct cell-to-cell contact. Since our experiments were made with MSCs obtained after more than 10 passages, we cannot exclude that these apparently different regulatory processes for the high cell density effect on MSCs mesodermal fate result from the use of MSCs of early and late passages.</p><p>There are however indications that MSCs of late passage secrete a soluble factor that can act on other cell types. Indeed Wislet-Gendebien <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] have already demonstrated that nestin-positive MSCs secrete BMP4, a member of TGF&#x003b2; family, which stimulates the astrocytic differentiation of co-cultured neural stem cells, a maturation process that involves a loss of nestin expression by these cells. However, our co-culture experiments did not show any significant decrease in the proportion of nestin-positive MSCs when cells at a permissive density were grown with other MSCs at higher densities in a setup that allows no direct contact, suggesting rather a requirement for a direct cell-to-cell contact for nestin repression. Alternatively, high cellular density by increasing the direct cell-to-cell contact in the culture dish could inhibit specifically the proliferation of nestin-positive MSCs which then could explain their decrease in number as the overall cellular density increases.</p><p>During the last few years, a number of studies have addressed the phenotypic plasticity of MSCs. Most of these studies were performed <italic>in vivo </italic>and demonstrated that environmental factors play important roles in determining the ability of grafted MSCs to adopt a neural-like phenotype. Nakano et al. showed that murine bone marrow cells adopt a neural fate when they are directly injected into the striatum of previously irradiated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Similarly, MSCs also adopt neural fate after systemic injection in lethally irradiated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, the systemic injection of MSCs in non-irradiated but brain-lesioned mice had positive effects on injury repair, but very few MSCs-derived cells expressed neural marker in such conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work shows that the presence of thrombin in the culture medium stimulates the growth of both RG and MSCs and that nestin expression by MSCs and RG can be regulated in opposite manner by thrombin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thrombin effect is thus associated in both cell types with a proliferating, undifferentiated state but in RG this involves the induction of nestin expression, a marker of immaturity for neural progenitors. In MSCs however, nestin expression, as it corresponds to a progression from the mesenchymal "undifferentiated", proliferating phenotype toward acquisition of a neural fate, is inhibited by the mitogenic signal. As we know that thrombin is expressed in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and is present in higher concentration during brain injury and implicated in the response to brain lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], it will be interesting to study the effect of thrombin on the regulation of the neural phenotypic plasticity of MSCs <italic>in vivo </italic>in the context of their proposed use as grafting material for cell therapeutic approaches of the central nervous system lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation and culture of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)</title><p>Tissue used for preparing the cell cultures was obtained from animals bred and kept in the University central animal facility in accordance with the rules set by the local animal ethics committee.
