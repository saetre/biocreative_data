Even unprimed T cells are under excessive replication pressure, suggesting an intrinsic defect in T cell regeneration. In naive CD4 CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells from RA patients, DNA damage load and apoptosis rates were markedly higher than in controls; repair of radiation-induced DNA breaks was blunted and delayed. DNA damage was highest in newly diagnosed untreated patients. RA T cells failed to produce sufficient transcripts and protein of the DNA repair kinase ataxia telangiectasia (AT) mutated (ATM). NBS1, RAD50, MRE11, and p53 were also repressed. ATM knockdown mimicked the biological effects characteristic for RA T cells. Conversely, ATM overexpression reconstituted DNA repair capabilities, response patterns to genotoxic stress, and production of MRE11 complex components and rescued RA T cells from apoptotic death. In conclusion, ATM deficiency in RA disrupts DNA repair and renders T cells sensitive to apoptosis. Apoptotic attrition of naive T cells imposes lymphopenia-induced proliferation, leading to premature immunosenescence and an autoimmune-biased T cell repertoire. Restoration of DNA repair mechanisms emerges as an important therapeutic target in RA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prototypic autoimmune syndrome characterized by cartilage and bone-destructive inflammation in small and large joints. Synovial inflammation is sustained by continuous activation of adaptive immune responses with T cells promoting multiple disease pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). RA patients typically produce autoantibodies against a wide spectrum of posttranslationally modified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), supporting the concept of broad regulatory anomalies within the immune system. In support of this hypothesis, T cell abnormalities in RA extend into the compartment of naive unprimed T cells that have not yet participated in immune responses. Naive CD4 T cells from RA patients display several abnormalities, which are best summarized as premature senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Specifically, such naive CD4 T cells are restricted in clonal expansion and have age-inappropriate telomeric shortening, indicating excessive proliferative turnover. Reduced frequencies of T cell receptor circle&#x02013;containing T cells and contraction in receptor diversity further support the concept that the naive RA T cell pool is under replicative pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). To identify factors that perturb T cell homeostasis in RA, the current study has explored mechanisms controlling T cell survival, as disproportionate apoptotic loss would necessitate compensatory homeostatic proliferation, leading to telomeric loss and premature senescence.</p><p>Naive T cells have a relatively long life span and are exposed to a multitude of genotoxic stressors. Genomic DNA is continually damaged by both environmental and endogenous agents, such as UV and ionizing radiation and intracellular reactive oxygen species. To maintain genomic stability, cells recognize and respond to DNA damage by continuously surveying the intactness of the DNA strands. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), typically induced by &#x003b3; irradiation, pose the greatest challenge. When detecting damaged DNA, the cell has two options: to activate cell cycle checkpoints and arrest the cell cycle to allow for repair, or, if damaged beyond repair, to undergo apoptosis by linking to mitochondria-dependent and -independent death machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>A major sensor of DNA breaks is the MRE11 complex (MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1), which subsequently recruits the protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia (AT) mutated (ATM), the protein mutated in AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Activated ATM phosphorylates members of the complex itself, as well as a variety of proteins, together forming the executive DNA damage repair machinery. Thus, ATM is the pinnacle kinase of the DSB signaling cascade. ATM has a unique position in lymphocyte biology, as the generation of programmed DSB is part of the gene rearrangement process, underlying formation of the highly diverse receptor repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we have analyzed DNA damage and DNA repair capabilities in primary CD4 T cells from RA patients. Patients&#x02019; unprimed resting CD4 T cells carry a high load of damaged DNA, which is even higher before immunosuppressive therapy is initiated. The defect equally affects the memory T cell population. Accumulation of damaged DNA is associated with insufficient expression of key proteins of the DNA damage response pathway, including ATM, MRE11, NBS1, RAD50, and p53. RA T cells fail to up-regulate the DNA repair machinery in response to ionizing radiation. Transfection of p53 restores transcriptional induction of the MRE11 complex members, but overexpression of ATM is necessary to correct all anomalies. Accumulated DNA damage renders RA T cells sensitive to apoptotic death, imposing replicative stress and premature senescence onto the naive T cell pool.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Naive CD4 T cells from RA patients accumulate DNA strand breaks</title><p>Naive and memory CD4 T cells in RA patients are prematurely aged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), which is indicative of high proliferative pressure.

In healthy individuals, DNA damage in naive CD4 T cells was low through the first seven decades of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), and increased DNA strand breaks only appeared in individuals older than 70 yr. Naive CD4 T cells from RA patients reached similar levels of DNA strand breaks as the elderly; DNA damage was already evident in 20- to 40-yr-old patients. Overall, the load of DNA strand breaks was higher in memory than naive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1, B&#x02013;D</xref>) in both controls and patients.

Essential components of this machinery include MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50, which act as sensors for DNA DSBs and mediate activation of the kinase ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Activated ATM phosphorylates several proteins, including p53 and BRCA. Concentrations of MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 transcripts measured in naive and memory CD4 T cells were significantly reduced in RA versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Also, production of ATM-specific sequences was markedly down-regulated in the patients. As far as ATM substrates were concerned, p53 transcription was decreased but BRCA1 transcripts were significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Western blotting for MRE11 and ATM protein confirmed that RA naive CD4 T cells produced minimal amounts of these proteins, whereas strong signals were obtained for control T cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). p53 protein levels, as well as concentrations of the phosphorylated (p) forms of ATM and p53, were quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). p53, pATM, and pp53 were detected at significantly reduced levels in the patient-derived T cells (P = 0.001, P = 0.022, and P = 0.005, respectively).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Defective expression of multiple components of the DNA repair machinery in RA CD4 T cells.</bold> (A and B) CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells were purified from RA patients and age-matched controls.

Immediately after radiation exposure, TMs raised fivefold above baseline.

Naive RA T cells had equally intensely damaged DNA immediately after the radiation injury. However, their DNA repair capacity was significantly delayed.

In essence, the insufficiency of DNA damage-sensing and repair molecules translated into radiation hypersensitivity in RA T cells.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Defective DNA damage repair capability in RA T cells.</bold> (A) CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells were irradiated with 10 Gy &#x003b3; rays.

Radiation injury was sufficient to strongly enhance ATM transcription in control T cells; within 60 min, ATM transcript levels increased 5.5-fold (P = 0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). By 120 min after radiation, ATM transcript production had almost returned to preirradiation levels. Similar induction kinetics applied to the components of the MRE11 complex, including MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). A different picture emerged for RA T cells. All four components of the DNA sensing and repair machinery failed to be up-regulated by 60 min. Over the subsequent 2 h, ATM transcript levels slowly increased and, in some patients, reached levels comparable to those of controls by 4 h. Responses of NBS1, MRE11, and RAD50 were similarly delayed and diminished; RAD50 transcript levels stayed flat over the entire observation period. The defect in signaling-enhanced transcription of ATM, MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 was associated with a failure of ATM activation. Activated ATM, which is phosphorylated at Ser-1981, was visualized in nuclear foci by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Irradiation-induced foci (IRIF) formation was highly efficient in healthy T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

Western blotting confirmed induction of MRE11, ATM, and p53 protein in healthy T cells with prompt and sustained increase in p-ATM and p-p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). RA T cells induced minimal amounts of MRE11 protein. Similarly, kinetics of ATM, pATM, p53, and pp53 demonstrated the inability of patient-derived T cells to respond to DNA fragmentation with the same intensity as the controls. Response patterns for MRE11, ATM, p53, and the phosphorylated forms of ATM and p53 were blunted and delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>), lacking the early increase in protein concentration typically seen in irradiated control T cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Irradiation-induced up-regulation of the DNA damage pathway is delayed in RA T cells.</bold> CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells from RA patients and matched controls were irradiated with 10 Gy &#x003b3; radiation.

Functional remodeling of the T cell pool primarily affects the naive compartment, excluding chronic antigenic stimulation as the underlying mechanism of accelerated senescence. In this paper, we find that the naive CD4 T cell pool in RA has a high DNA damage load that is independent from immunosuppressive therapy. Underlying molecular mechanisms include insufficient expression of several components of the DNA damage survey pathway, particularly ATM, the MRE11 complex, and p53. In RA CD4 T cells, the &#x003b3; radiation&#x02013;induced DNA repair response is blunted and delayed. Reconstitution of p53 restores DNA damage repair capability, but overexpression of ATM is necessary to correct all abnormalities in RA T cells. In essence, CD4 T cells in RA mimic cellular anomalies typically found in patients with the genetic disorder AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Despite their lack of p53, RA CD4 T cells are explicitly apoptosis sensitive. Excessive T cell loss necessitates high homeostatic proliferation to prevent lymphopenia. By imposing replicative stress on unprimed T cells, ATM deficiency, DNA damage accumulation, and apoptosis hypersensitivity emerge as a molecular pathway underlying T cell senescence in RA.</p><p>Insufficient production of ATM and p53 affected both unprimed and primed T cells. However, in the setting of RA, memory T cells could be functionally biased as a result of chronic antigenic stimulation, and, thus, we focused our studies on the population of T cells that has not yet been recruited for immune responses. In non&#x02013;T cells and B cells from RA patients, ATM and p53 transcript levels were indistinguishable from those in controls. Down-regulation by chronic inflammation appears unlikely because CD4 T cells from patients with active SLE produced ATM and p53 transcript levels similar to those in controls.</p><p>AT is an autosomal recessive disorder manifesting with cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In 1957, AT was recognized as a disease entity; in 1988, the AT gene was mapped to chromosome 11q22-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). ATM was eventually identified as a member of the family of PI3K-related genes. ATM is predominantly localized in the nucleus and undergoes activation when recognizing DNA DSB, with involvement of the MRE11 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Among the multiple substrates phosphorylated by ATM is the tumor suppressor protein p53, which prevents cells from passing from G1 to S phase or, alternatively, leads cells into apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Cells from AT patients have a G1/S cell cycle checkpoint defect, which is corrected by constitutive expression of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Similarly, p53 overexpression in RA T cells corrected the insufficient transcriptional activity of the MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 genes and markedly improved DNA repair. However, p53-transfected T cells continued to transcribe insufficient levels of ATM. Conversely, transfection of ATM restored transcriptional activity of all members of the MRE11 complex as well as that of the p53 gene. These experiments established that in human T cells, p53 is a target gene for ATM and that the ultimate defect can be assigned to ATM insufficiency.</p><p>T cells from RA patients were apoptosis sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), a finding which is also typical for AT patients&#x02019; lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). At first view, this seems perplexing, as ATM and p53 are considered to be necessary elements in mediating apoptosis. AT patients and RA patients share the combination of increased apoptotic susceptibility despite deficiency in ATM and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Thus, it can be predicted that ATM&#x02013;deficient cells can use p53-independent pathways to undergo apoptosis. Also, although AT patients fail to up-regulate p53 when stressed with &#x003b3; radiation, other genotoxic stressors, such as UV light, can still elicit a p53 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In contrast to &#x003b3; radiation, UV light produces photoproducts in DNA that are sensed and repaired through alternative pathways, often involving ATR-ATRIP. ATR induction was well maintained in RA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>), emphasizing the molecular similarities between AT cells and RA T cells.</p><p>A subset of AT patients has a primary immunodeficiency syndrome, with defects in T cell and B cell immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Clinical manifestations include recurrent bacterial infections, whereas opportunistic infections, such as fungal and protozoan infections, are unusual. Typically, AT patients have lymphopenia with reduction in CD4 T cell numbers and expansion of &#x003b3;/&#x003b4; T cells. Notably, AT is associated with failed thymic development and paucity of thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Not unexpectedly, defective ATM predisposes to malignancies. Two thirds of AT patients develop lymphomas and leukemias, which are mostly of T cell origin. This association emphasizes the critical role that ATM plays in T cell development and lymphomagenesis. Heterozygotes carrying one mutated ATM gene have a predisposition for cancer, particularly breast cancer in women. Thus, haploinsufficiency for ATM has biological relevance. Patients with RA are known to have increased risk for lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>RA patients have long been known to have increased susceptibility for infectious complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Obviously, it has been difficult to assign increased infection rates to either a primary defect or iatrogenic immunodeficiency in chronically immunosuppressed individuals. Treatments with strong antiinflammatory action in RA fail to correct the infectious risk but, rather, increase it, suggesting that such therapies do not rectify the underlying pathogenic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Data presented in this paper indicate that the naive T cell pool in RA patients has abnormalities that jeopardize the ability to mount effective immune responses. Naive CD4 T cells had high levels of damaged DNA and failed to repair their DNA when stressed with ionizing radiation. Most importantly, these unprimed CD4 T cells were highly sensitive to apoptosis. Compared with control T cells, they died at excessive rates when kept unstimulated and unstressed for 4 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Human naive CD4 T cells have a half-life of &#x0223c;150&#x02013;160 d, and 1% of a pool of 300 billion T cells has to be replaced daily. In young individuals, T cell attrition is partially compensated for by newly generated T cells, although homeostatic T cell proliferation functions as a mechanism of T cell repopulation, even in newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Later in life, humans depend upon T cell autoproliferation as a means to generate the enormous numbers of T cells needed to maintain homeostasis in the T cell compartment. Inappropriate T cell loss, caused by excessive apoptotic propensity, strains the regenerative potential and imposes excessive replicative stress.</p><p>PBMCs harvested from RA patients have been reported to have reduced p53 transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) and decreased sensitivity to radiation-induced apoptosis. We have also seen dampened death rates after &#x003b3; radiation of RA T cells, which is compatible with the failure to up-regulate the apoptosis inducer p53. In contrast, in unstressed and unstimulated T cells, reconstitution of p53 leads to rapid repair of DNA fragmentation and enhances survival (Fig. S4). A similar discrepancy exists for AT cells, which are reported to be highly radiosensitive, yet radiation-induced up-regulation of p53 is defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Whether the cell survives or dies may simply reflect the extent of DNA damage. If repairable, p53 may extend survival. If irreparable, p53 may facilitate apoptosis. In the current study, we measured spontaneous apoptosis of T cells, which is certainly closer to the physiological condition in the patient than breaking DNA with high doses of &#x003b3; radiation. However, the radiation stress test revealed that the entire DNA breakage-sensing and repair machinery is defective in RA T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). The underlying defect seems to lie in transcriptional repression of multiple components of the DNA damage response machinery. All components tested, ATM, p53, MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50, were insufficiently transcribed. Protein levels were decreased, and accumulation of pATM in IRIF was impaired. The ultimate question is why resting and unprimed CD4 T cells from RA patients have down-regulated this essential pathway of cellular function. Notably, ATM transcription was maintained in non&#x02013;T cells harvested from the buccal surface, as well as in RA B cells, indicating that this is a selective defect in T cells. ATM has broad regulatory functions, among others, the control of transcriptional regulators AP1, E2F, SP1, and p53 at protein and transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). In the current study, knockdown of ATM had profound effects in depressing the transcription of p53 as well as the components of the MRE11 complex. Interestingly, knockdown of p53 (Fig. S5) had a marked effect on MRE11 and NBS1 but only marginally suppressed RAD50, raising the possibility that p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms regulate RAD50 transcription. Transcriptional regulation of these molecules that are so critically involved in the DNA damage repair machinery is insufficiently understood and needs to be addressed in further studies. The lack of ATM and p53 must have wide-ranging consequences for the cellular functionality of CD4 T cells in RA patients; a significant proportion of the transcriptome should be affected, and T cell function should be profoundly altered.</p><p>A typical feature of naive CD4 T cells in RA is the shortening of telomeres by &#x0223c;1,500 kb compared with age-matched healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). This degree of telomeric erosion indicates prematurity of T cell aging by &#x0223c;20&#x02013;30 yr. Several mechanisms may contribute to this age-inappropriate loss of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Increased proliferative turnover would cause cell division&#x02013;induced shortening. We have recently found that naive RA T cells fail to up-regulate telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Telomeric DNA is highly susceptible to DNA damage, even more so than nontelomeric DNA. Plasmid-inserted human telomeres accumulated sevenfold higher strand breakage than control sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Also, the frequency of single-strand breaks is multifold higher in telomeres than in minisatellites or in the bulk genome when cells are treated with alkylating agents or exposed to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Thus, telomeric loss of RA CD4 T cells may be attributable to DNA damage mechanisms and the inability for timely repair.</p><p>The question remains whether the defect in DNA damage repair functions to render individuals susceptible to RA or is a consequence of disease. Patients with RA have a contraction of T cell diversity, affecting both the memory and the naive compartment, attesting to increased proliferative turnover of the entire T cell compartment. In animal models, autoimmunity has been associated with a state of lymphopenia. To fill the compartment, T cells in a lymphopenic host undergo homeostatic expansion. In the NOD mouse, autoimmune disease is associated with the overproduction of IL-21, a T cell expansion factor mobilized by lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Dilution of T reg cell populations caused by antigen-nonspecific homeostatic proliferation could further bias the T cell compartment toward self-reactivity. In HIV patients, repopulation of the T cell pool has been associated with severe and diffuse tissue inflammation, a condition named immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Obviously, repertoire diversity maintains dilution of individual T cells and may well serve as a tolerance mechanism because the frequency of T cells will also determine the likelihood of responses. An alternative mechanism relates to the impact of homeostatic proliferation on the T cell. Cell cycling may alter cellular response thresholds, even if the proliferative trigger did not derive from antigenic stimulation. As a minimum, replicative stress of naive T cells will result in shortening of the T cell life span. Restoring apoptotic resistance should relieve naive CD4 T cells from excessive replicative stress. Accumulation of DNA damage may also have broader implications on impairing diverse cellular functions. Counteracting ATM deficiency may reinstate T cell competence in RA and prevent premature immunosenescence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Patients and control individuals.</title><p>The study group included 92 RA patients and 83 control subjects.

Proteins were detected by MRE11, ATM, ATR, pATM, p53 (Novus Biologicals), pp53 (ser15; Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies, and secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) with the use of a chemiluminescent detection system (GE Healthcare). To ensure equal loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed for &#x003b2;-actin using anti-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). To ensure full lysis of nuclei, HDAC1 was detected using anti-HDAC1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).

Fig. S2 shows intact messenger RNA stability of ATM and the MRE11 complex in RA T cells. Fig. S3 reveals normal transcript levels for ATM and p53 in RA non&#x02013;T cells, RA B cells, and SLE CD4 T cells. Fig. S4 demonstrates a gatekeeper function for p53 in the DNA repair of human T cells as forced p53 overexpression diminishes DNA DSBs. Fig. S5 establishes that repression of p53 in CD4 T cells results in down-regulation of MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 but leaves ATM unaffected. Fig. S6 shows that ATM regulates not only p53 but all members of the MRE11 complex, as silencing of ATM down-regulates transcription of p53, RAD50, NBS1, and MRE11. Data in fig. S7 demonstrate that even in normal CD4 T cells the protein kinase ATM is a limiting factor in DNA repair, as forced overexpression of the enzyme improves repair of fragmented DNA.
