Previous observations using overexpression and pharmacological approaches suggest that vaccinia enhances its release by modulating the cortical actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting RhoA signalling using the viral protein F11. We have now examined the role of F11 and its ability to interact with RhoA to inhibit its downstream signalling in the spread of vaccinia infection both in vitro and in vivo. Live cell imaging over 48 hours reveals that loss of F11 or its ability to bind RhoA dramatically reduces the rate of cell-to-cell spread of the virus in a cell monolayer. Cells infected with the &#x00394;F11L virus also maintained their cell-to-cell contacts, and did not undergo virus-induced motility as observed during wild-type infections. The &#x00394;F11L virus is also attenuated in intranasal mouse models of infection, as it is impaired in its ability to spread from the initial sites of infection to the lungs and spleen. Loss of the ability of F11 to bind RhoA also reduces viral spread in vivo. Our results clearly establish that viral-mediated inibition of RhoA signalling can enhance the spread of infection not only in cell monolayers, but also in vivo.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vaccinia virus, the prototypic and most characterized member of the <italic>orthopoxvirus</italic> genus of the <italic>poxvirdae</italic> is a large double stranded DNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm of its infected host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Schramm1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Moss1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Roberts1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

This conclusion was based on the effects of over-expression of dominant negative and active RhoA and mDia clones combined with pharmacological inhibition of RhoA signalling and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. In our current study, we directly examined whether inhibition of RhoA signalling promotes viral release and spread using recombinant viruses lacking the F11L gene or expressing an F11 mutant that is deficient in RhoA binding. Our data now clearly demonstrates using an intranasal mouse model of infection that F11-mediated inhibition of RhoA signalling enhances the spread of vaccinia infection not only in cell monolayers but also <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Consistent with previous publications using recombinant viruses with nonsense mutations in the F11L gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Morales1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Kato1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that deletion of the majority of the F11L gene and loss of F11 expression did not affect viral morphogenesis. The loss of F11 or its ability to bind RhoA did however result in significantly higher levels of GTP bound RhoA at 8 hours post infection, consistent with the presence of actin stress fibres in &#x00394;F11L or F11-VK as compared to WR or WR-A36R-YdF infected cells. We also found that the increased RhoA signalling resulted in a significant reduction in the number of actin tails and amount of virus released into the culture medium. This reduction must at least in part be responsible for the smaller plaques formed by the &#x00394;F11L and F11-VK viruses, as the ability to induce actin tails is know to promote the formation of larger plaques and enhance viral spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Roberts1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Ward2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although plaque size gives a measure of the efficiency of cell-to-cell spread it provides no information concerning the dynamics of the process as it represents a single fixed time point. Given this we imaged viral spread in live cells during plaque formation to assess more directly how F11-mediated inhibition of RhoA signalling enhances the spread of infection. We found that F11 promotes the spread of infection not only by enhancing viral release but by also stimulating the migration of infected cells after their loss of cell-cell adhesion.

This morphological change is dependent on F11, as well as its ability to bind RhoA, as it was not observed in &#x00394;F11L or F11-VK infected cells. This suggests that virus induced cell rounding or contraction is at least in part dependent on the modulation of RhoA signalling as well as changes in cell adhesion and migration. Curiously, F11-VK infected cells still exhibited some loss of cell-cell adhesion and limited cell migration. These small changes cell-cell adhesion and cell migration, rather than viral release, probably accounts for the increased spread of F11-VK <italic>in vivo</italic> and larger plaques at 4 days post infection when compared to &#x00394;F11L, as both viruses induce similar numbers of actin tails and also release similar amounts of infectious virus particles in the media.</p><p>The similar rate of &#x00394;F11L or F11-VK spread observed during live cell imaging over the first 48 hours of infection would however, suggest that viral release rather than cell migration represents the main factor contributing to the intial spread of infection. This hypothesis also agrees with the delayed spread of F11-VK <italic>in vivo</italic> as compared to WR. Our data are also consistent with the notion that it is the extra-cellular enveloped virus (EEV), which is released from infected cells and resistant to complement or antibody mediated neutralization, that is largely responsible for the spread of infection throughout the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Payne1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Boulter1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Smith2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The residual RhoA binding observed in our F11-VK pull downs may account for the differences between &#x00394;F11L and F11-VK viruses. However, the similar levels of GTP-bound RhoA in &#x00394;F11L or F11-VK infected cells, would suggest that F11 has additional functions beyond inhibition of RhoA. One attractive possibility is that F11-VK interacts with additional RhoGTPases that are also involved in regulation of cell-cell adhesion and cell migration.</p><p>Finally, recombinant poxviruses vectors currently represent highly attractive delivery systems for vaccination against a variety of infectious diseases as well as oncolytic agents against a wide range of different cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Gomez1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-Thorne1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008506-McFadden1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.
