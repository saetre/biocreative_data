By activating adenylyl cyclases (ACs) 1 and 8, Ca<sup>2+</sup> acting via calmodulin impacts on the signaling of the other major cellular second messenger cAMP. In possessing two CaM-binding domains, a 1-5-8-14 motif at the N terminus and an IQ-like motif (IQ<italic>lm</italic>) at the C terminus, AC8 offers particularly sophisticated regulatory possibilities. The IQ<italic>lm</italic> has remained unexplored beyond the suggestion that it bound CaM, and the larger C2b region of which it is part was involved in the relief of autoinhibition of AC8. Here we attempt to distinguish the function of individual residues of the IQ<italic>lm</italic>. From a complementary approach of <italic>in vitro</italic> and cell population AC activity assays, as well as CaM binding, we propose that the IQ<italic>lm</italic> alone, and not the majority of the C2b, imparts CaM binding and autoinhibitory functions. Moreover, this duality of function is spatially separated and depends on amino acid side-chain character. Accordingly, residues critical for CaM binding are positively charged and clustered toward the C terminus, and those essential for the maintenance of autoinhibition are hydrophobic and more N-terminal. Secondary structure prediction of the IQ<italic>lm</italic> supports this separation, with an ideally placed break in the &#x003b1;-helical nature of the sequence. We additionally find that the N and C termini of AC8 interact, which is an association specifically abrogated by fully Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free, CaM. These data support a sophisticated activation mechanism of AC8 by CaM, in which the duality of the IQ<italic>lm</italic> function is critical.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The divalent calcium ion, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, plays a key role in modulating cellular processes as diverse as fertilization and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations inside the cell are held &#x0223c;100 n<sc>m</sc>, despite a perpetually higher level of 1&#x02013;2 m<sc>m</sc> in the extracellular medium. This steep gradient across the plasma membrane allows for a large influx when Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open, with subsequent signaling events that often rely on transduction via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The archetypal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor is calmodulin (CaM),<xref ref-type="other" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> a small, acidic protein so strictly conserved that all vertebrate CaM genes encode an identical 148-residue sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Multifunctional in its downstream effects, CaM can bind to at least 300 target proteins with novel partners continuing to be discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The list of effectors includes two isoforms of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) superfamily, AC1 and AC8, which comprise the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulable subset of the nine particulate ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In intact cells, AC8 exhibits a predilection for store-operated, or capacitative, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (CCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This mode of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is triggered by the emptying of endo/sarcoplasmic reticular stores by physiological or pharmacological stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Although the mechanism of the regulation of AC8 in nonexcitable cells by CCE (or voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in neurons) can be viewed to rely on facets of cellular compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), the detailed molecular mechanism whereby Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulates the enzyme is unclear. Consequently, the present investigation addresses the molecular mechanism whereby Ca<sup>2+</sup>, acting via calmodulin, stimulates AC8.</p><p>The broad features of CaM that hold the key to its multiple regulatory strategies are understood. CaM is organized into two homologous globular domains (or lobes) united by a short linker segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Both the N-terminal (N-lobe) and the C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) include two EF-hands (specialized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating helix-loop-helix motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>)), endowing CaM with four Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to either lobe of CaM induces a structural reconfiguration determined by the two helices of each EF-hand separating from near-antiparallel to perpendicular arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This exposes hydrophobic trenches in the C- and N-lobes sequentially (because the former has the highest affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>), which are notably lined with a disproportionate number of flexible methionine side chains, ready to accommodate a remarkable array of unrelated sequences. Initially, the mode of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded CaM association with targets was considered to be uniform; the N- and C-lobes collapsed around the target peptides of <italic>e.g</italic>. smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and CaMKII&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) with the N-lobe favoring the C-terminal target sequence and vice versa. However, CaM has since proven to be more versatile and unpredictable in how it associates with and regulates effectors, with reports of N-lobe-N-terminal/C-lobe-C-terminal interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), target dimerization promoted by CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), CaM binding to fatty acyl modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and other deviations from the early model.</p><p>Nevertheless, three main forms of CaM regulation have been proposed as follows: relief of autoinhibition; active site remodeling; and dimerization of target domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Whether the precise mechanism of CaM binding and subsequent regulation of AC8 falls into these categories of CaM regulation is not resolved. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) established that AC8 possesses two calmodulin-binding domains (CaMBDs). CaM recognition sequences generally show little homology, although classifications based on relative positions of key hydrophobic residues have been usefully applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 conforms to a &#x0201c;1-5-8-14 motif&#x0201d; having large hydrophobic side chains from Trp, Val, or Ile residues at these spatially conserved sites. The C-terminal CaMBD contains an IQ-like motif (IQ<italic>lm</italic>), in accordance with a signature (IVL)Q<italic>XXX</italic>R(K) arrangement, to which CaM binds directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). By truncating one terminus or both termini, Gu and Cooper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) asserted that the N terminus contributed little to direct CaM regulation of AC8, whereas the C terminus was critical for the maintenance of an auto-inhibited state, which was relieved upon binding of CaM. Thus, functional elements of both autoinhibition and pre-association, imparted by noncontiguous CaMBDs, have been suggested, thereby excluding AC8 from a simple model of CaM binding to an autoinhibitory domain leading to activation, as is sometimes observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the proposal that the two CaMBDs play separate roles in AC8 activation was reinforced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This study suggested that CaM tethering by the N-terminal 1-5-8-14 motif provides the catalytically relevant C-terminal CaMBD with privileged access to CaM, thereby circumventing the need for AC8 to compete for CaM, whose free concentration in the cell is far exceeded by that of its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). 1&#x02013;14 motifs are more generally employed in relieving autoinhibitory influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), so the use by AC8 of a 1-5-8-14 motif as a CaM-tethering site is unusual. The proposal that CaM pre-associates here was based on limited mutagenesis of residues within the 1-5-8-14 motif of AC8 and the use of CaM mutants whose Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding capability was abolished completely or limited to discrete lobes. In contrast to the 1-5-8-14 motif at the N terminus, very little is known of the IQ<italic>lm</italic> at the C terminus, in terms of the roles of the individual residues in CaM binding or autoinhibition, or even on the interplay between CaMBDs at the N and C termini of AC8.</p><p>Against this background, the present study sought to assess the contribution of IQ<italic>lm</italic> residues to the function of AC8, focusing on consequences of key mutations on CaM-binding efficiency, regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, and maintenance of the autoinhibited state. Through this series of experiments, the level of coordination between the IQ-like and 1-5-8-14 motifs became evident. The provision of a pre-associated CaM molecule was found to allow for potentially deleterious mutations of the IQ<italic>lm</italic> to be tolerated. Within this latter motif, Leu<sup>1196</sup>, Val<sup>1197</sup>, and Leu<sup>1200</sup> are residues essential to autoinhibition, whereas the main responsibility of binding CaM directly at the C terminus lies with Arg<sup>1202</sup> and Arg<sup>1204</sup>. In this regard, the AC8 IQ<italic>lm</italic> spatially separates the two functions of CaM binding and maintenance of autoinhibition, a separation that is supported by a predicted break in the helicity of the IQ<italic>lm</italic> region. Thus, a new variation is revealed in the manner by which a target exploits the CaM device into a sophisticated activation mechanism.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All materials were purchased from Sigma with exceptions as noted.

The C2b region of AC8 performs at least three functions, including binding of CaM, allowing subsequent regulation by CaM, and maintenance of autoinhibition. Whether or how these functions are divided within the C-terminal sequence is unknown. Earlier truncation experiments had concluded that the main autoinhibitory element of AC8 lies between residues 1184 and 1248 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Because the IQ<italic>lm</italic>, potentially important in regulation by CaM, lies between residues Val<sup>1197</sup> and Asn<sup>1212</sup>, we wondered whether an autoinhibitory domain might follow in the subsequent C-terminal sequence. Hence, four truncation mutants were generated as follows: the first three representing successive 12 amino acid deletions from the C terminus, and the final one also truncating the entire IQ-like motif. <italic>Arrows</italic> on the schematic diagram of AC8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic> at the C2b region indicate truncation points of the four numbered mutants.

As reported previously, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated WT-AC8 activity in this heterologous system is usually from 5- to 11-fold over basal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Aggregated maximal stimulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM shows that WT-AC8, AC8&#x00394;1, AC8&#x00394;2, and AC8&#x00394;3 all display activation in this range (8.3 &#x000b1; 2.0, 7.6 &#x000b1; 3.1, 8.3 &#x000b1; 3.4, and 7.2 &#x000b1; 2.1; mean &#x000b1; S.E.), but AC8&#x00394;4 falls dramatically short of the lower limit (1.5 &#x000b1; 0.2).

However, activity of the AC8&#x00394;4 is not eliminated, because robust FSK-induced stimulation, comparable with that of WT, is still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). When the Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation of WT and mutant ACs is expressed as a percentage of FSK activity over three experiments, AC8&#x00394;4 is the only mutant to be significantly compromised (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></ext-link>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The C-terminal CaMBD and autoinhibitory domain of AC8 are both contained within the same 24-residue sequence.</bold><italic>A</italic>, schematic representation of AC domains. <italic>M1</italic> and <italic>M2</italic> denote transmembrane cassettes 1 and 2, which, together with C1a and C2a, are homologous among all ACs.

Thus, the truncation mutants were also assessed in cell populations for their response to CCE, the mode of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to which AC8 preferentially responds. CCE was triggered by pretreatment with EGTA and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor TG. Subsequent application of CaCl<sub>2</sub> to the extracellular medium initiated CCE (exemplar traces depicting the resultant [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> rise(s) in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). Having pre-labeled the ATP pool with [<sup>3</sup>H]adenine, accumulation of radiolabeled cAMP could be quantified. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic> shows a representative data set, where the robust stimulation typical of AC8-transfected cells contrasts with a lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation observed in empty vector-transfected cells. Although the absolute levels of activity varied somewhat, the stimulation profiles of AC8&#x00394;1, AC8&#x00394;2, and AC8&#x00394;3 closely match that of WT-AC8 in terms of the graded increases in cAMP accumulation in response to increasing external Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the ratio of basal to maximal activity. Again, AC8&#x00394;4 stood apart from the other truncation mutants; a strikingly high basal activity was observed, which was refractory to further stimulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These data, together with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, allowed us to conclude that residues 1197&#x02013;1212 are required for both Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation and maintenance of autoinhibition. Very curiously, we did note that AC8&#x00394;4 retained a small degree of stimulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Concerned that residues N-terminal to Val<sup>1197</sup> might contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM regulation, we compared AC8&#x00394;4 with a more severe truncation mutant, AC8&#x00394;5 (truncated from residue 1184), and we found that it too responded slightly to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cell population assays (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></ext-link>). Because Pro<sup>1184</sup> marks the C-terminal limit of the catalytic C1a domain, further truncation is not practical, and we must conclude that although Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM stimulation is almost exclusively imparted by the C2b region (1184&#x02013;1248), CaM contributed by the N terminus can activate AC8 to a very minor extent.</p></sec><sec><title>Truncation of the AC8 N Terminus Does Not Affect Exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM Stimulation in Vitro</title><p>Previous experiments indicated only a marginal contribution of the N terminus to stimulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM of AC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), because deletion of the first 106 amino acids (referred to henceforth as AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub>) did not affect <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of the enzyme.

Two resident arginines, and separately the sole lysine, were charge-reversed to glutamate (R1202/R4E and K1206E). A pair of proximal leucine residues at the C-terminal end of the sequence was mutated (L1208/L9E).

We considered the latter proposal more credible because of the following.

Two mutations, R1202/4E and K1206E, sought to assess the reliance of AC8 activation on these charged features by substitution with glutamate, an amino acid of opposing polarity. As with all other AC8-based mutations, both AC8<sup>RR/EE</sup> and AC8<sup>KE</sup> were strongly stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of exogenous CaM (8.7- and 5.0-fold, respectively). Representative CECs indicate that the maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM activity of AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>KE</sup> was lower than AC8<sup>KE</sup>, and the EC<sub>50</sub> value for Ca<sup>2+</sup> was increased. Over three similar experiments, the mean maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation of AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>KE</sup> (2.7-fold) was lower than that of AC8<sup>KE</sup> (5.0-fold); the difference between data sets was quantified by a <italic>p</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Possible concerns with expression and catalytic fidelity can again be put aside given the strong FSK stimulation of AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>KE</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 4</ext-link>). However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>RR/EE</sup> was nearly ablated, yielding a mere 1.3-fold stimulation over basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>viii</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>).

The exposure of nonpolar grooves in both CaM lobes after Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding provides essential loci for interaction with hydrophobic amino acids of target sequences. Accordingly, and aside from a valine residue already discussed above, the AC8 IQ<italic>lm</italic> contains four leucine residues as follows: two are adjacent and sequentially more C-terminal, and the another two are close to each other but sequentially more N-terminal. The C-terminal Leu<sup>1208</sup> and Leu<sup>1209</sup> were substituted by glutamate. AC8<sup>LL/EE</sup> and AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>LL/EE</sup> had similar levels of stimulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (6.9- and 5.5-fold, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>ix</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>), indicating that, because this mutation was well tolerated, these C-terminal hydrophobic residues do not play an important part in stimulation of AC8.</p><p>The S1199D mutation aimed to initiate a consideration of local phosphorylation at the only candidate residue of the sequence. The negatively charged side chain of aspartate approximates the presence of a phosphate group added to serine. Although the IQ<italic>lm</italic> sequence does not provide this serine with the characteristic basic residue at the &#x02212;3 position, it does lend hydrophobic residues at &#x02212;5 and +1, which have been found to be important for CaMKII and CaMKIV recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). As with all other IQ<italic>lm</italic> mutants introduced to the whole AC8 enzyme, little effect was observed with the introduction of S1199D; stimulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM was robust at 4.2-fold and not significantly different from that of WT-AC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). In the absence of the N terminus, however, maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM stimulated activity was stunted at 2.2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>).

This use of AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub> was validated by the established observation that in the <italic>in vitro</italic> context, AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub> is indistinguishable from AC8 in the presence of exogenous CaM. The 1-5-8-14 motif lies between amino acids 34 and 52, so 88 non-CaMBD residues are deleted in AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub>. Therefore, we asked whether uncovering the consequences of the C-terminal IQ<italic>lm</italic> mutations was due simply to the lack of CaM binding or to some other structural effect, resulting from removal of the N terminus. Another previously characterized mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) (originally named M34 but hereafter referred to as AC8<sub>38&#x02013;40,49&#x02013;51ala</sub>) was ideal for this purpose because six alanine substitutions imposed at key positions of the 1-5-8-14 motif render it impotent at binding CaM at the N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Taking an effective IQ<italic>lm</italic> mutation as an example, we introduced the consensus residue triple substitution to the C terminus of AC8<sub>38&#x02013;40,49&#x02013;51ala</sub>, thereby creating AC8<sub>38&#x02013;40,49&#x02013;51ala</sub><sup>VQR/AAA</sup>. This latter mutant displayed a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM stimulation of only 2.15 &#x000b1; 0.21-fold over basal as compared with 7.34 &#x000b1; 1.12 with AC8<sub>38&#x02013;40,49&#x02013;51ala</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>); a similar severity of attenuation in terms of maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation was between AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>VQR/AAA</sup> and AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>).

We wished to address the significance of these mutations in the more realistic setting of the intact cell, where AC8 must compete with the plethora of other CaM-binding proteins for CaM, a situation that might be expected to exacerbate compromised CaM binding. Whole-cell cAMP accumulation assays were seen to be an appropriate means to test basal activity and thereby CaM-independent relief of autoinhibition (in addition to CCE-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). A limitation of this type of assay is that only AC8 species with intact N termini can be used. AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub>, for example, displays a greatly diminished response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry by CCE, a deficit that is proposed to reflect the role of the N terminus in recruiting CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) as well as possible association with other factors that confer sensitivity to CCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus only full-length AC8 IQ<italic>lm</italic> mutants could be assessed. AC activity induced by CCE triggered by 4 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular medium was compared with the activity when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was absent from the medium. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>panels i&#x02013;iv</italic>, shows representative experiments for each of the mutants, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic> basal activity was expressed as a percentage of maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity over three identical assays. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, very little Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation is observed in pcDNA3-transfected cells, but a large (4&#x02013;6-fold) enhancement is seen with high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> in AC8-expressing cells. Basal activity of WT-AC8 was routinely around 20% of the maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated value. A similar relationship applies to AC8<sup>KE</sup>, AC8<sup>RR/EE</sup>, AC8<sup>QK</sup>, and AC8<sup>LL/EE</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A</italic>, <italic>panel i</italic>, and <italic>B</italic>). Clearly, in this system these mutations were of little consequence to the CCE regulation of AC8. AC8<sup>LL/AA</sup> (in which Leu<sup>1196</sup> and Leu<sup>1200</sup> have been substituted with alanine), however, had a consistently high basal activity, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation at a similar level to AC8. This elevated cAMP accumulation, manifest as 50% of maximum over three experiments, was more than 30% higher than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). Because an abnormally high constitutive activity indicates a relief of autoinhibition, Leu<sup>1196</sup> and/or Leu<sup>1200</sup> appear to contribute to the maintenance of the autoinhibited state. Considering AC8<sup>VN</sup>, AC8<sup>RQ</sup>, and AC8<sup>VR/NQ</sup> together, we see that the R1202Q mutation increased basal activity slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A, panel ii</italic>) but not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>), and it still retained appreciable Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation. AC8<sup>VN</sup> and AC8<sup>VR/NQ</sup>, however, both displayed significantly higher basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A, panel ii,</italic> and <italic>B</italic>); a minor contribution from Arg<sup>1202</sup> is suggested from the more prominent basal activity of AC8<sup>VR/NQ</sup> compared with AC8<sup>VN</sup>. So, it seemed that Val<sup>1197</sup> played a privileged role in the stabilization of AC8 autoinhibition. This impression was further supported by two other mutants, AC8<sup>VQ/AA</sup> and AC8<sup>VQR/AAA</sup>, both of which contained Val<sup>1197</sup> substitutions, and displayed elevated basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A, panel iv,</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The phosphomimetic S1199D mutation produced an enzyme whose maximal CCE regulation was consistently lower than WT-AC8 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A, panel iii</italic>). AC8<sup>SD</sup> also displayed a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity that was significantly higher than that that of WT-AC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>).

To permit this analysis, the C2b region containing the IQ<italic>lm</italic> (Leu<sup>1183</sup>&#x02013;Pro<sup>1248</sup>) was N-terminally fused to glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST-8C2b), and the cDNA encoding this fusion was subject to the same site-directed mutagenesis used for the generation of AC8 and AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub> mutants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>) to create six example mutations of GST-AC8<sub>C2b</sub>. A simple <italic>in vitro</italic> co-pulldown assay was then developed, which proved suitable to detect CaM binding by GST-8C2b (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;). Our AC8 antibody recognizes an epitope at the extreme C terminus and thus can be used to confirm expression of the fusion proteins. GST alone did not bind CaM at any of the concentrations used, despite its presence at higher quantities than the fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic>). However, GST-8C2b clearly bound CaM in a concentration-dependent manner. By contrast, the R1202E/R1204E mutant of GST-8C2b showed greatly diminished CaM binding, with only a faint signal at the maximal (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) CaM input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). By comparison, GST-8C2b<sup>VQ/AA</sup> appeared to bind CaM as strongly as the wild-type sequence. This latter observation is important as it implies that two of three consensus residues that define the sequence as a CaMBD are not directly involved in AC8 association with CaM at the C terminus. GST-AC8<sub>C2b</sub><sup>LL/EE</sup> pulled down equivalent levels of CaM to GST-8C2b at each concentration used, indicating that these mutations do not perturb CaM binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>). The triple consensus residue mutant, GST-8C2b<sup>VQR/AAA</sup>, could bind CaM, albeit to a lesser extent than the wild-type GST fusion construct.

However, when CaM was added to the mixture, less MBP-8Nt was pulled down by GST-8Ct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>, compare <italic>lanes 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> under <italic>GST-8Ct</italic>) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (from 120% of input to 20%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>C</italic>). This coincided with a strong pulldown of CaM. In the presence of EGTA and CaM, however, only a very small amount of CaM is pulled down with GST-8Ct, and the level of associated MBP-8Nt partially recovers (to 60% of input, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>C</italic>). Less MBP-8Nt is pulled down in the presence of EGTA/CaM (<italic>lane 3</italic>) compared with EGTA only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>C, lane 1</italic>), but this can be accounted for by the association of the AC8 N terminus with CaM in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus, MBP-8Nt and GST-8Ct could interact, but the binding of MBP-8Nt by GST-8Ct was specifically inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free CaM. This indicates that the terminal domains of AC8 could interact at resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], but this association was not supported when fully Ca<sup>2+</sup>-saturated CaM is present. So, we envisage that, as developed under &#x0201c;Discussion,&#x0201d; upon activation of AC8 by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, its termini dissociate as part of the structural rearrangement responsible for relief of autoinhibition.</p><p>Given the above suggestion that terminal regions of AC8 interact as part of a resting autoinhibitory interaction, and a subset of IQ<italic>lm</italic> residues contributes to autoinhibition, we considered that Leu<sup>1196</sup>, Val<sup>1197</sup>, and Leu<sup>1200</sup> might impart binding to the N terminus. So the GST-8C2b fusion protein, and mutants thereof, used in CaM binding assays were directly assessed for their ability to pull down MBP-8Nt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 7</ext-link>) in the same manner as described for GST-8Ct in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. GST-8C2b is shorter than GST-8Ct, but it could associate effectively with MBP-8Nt, as shown by the greatly increased signal observed relative to GST alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). When the level of MBP-8Nt is expressed as a function of the total input signal of the GST or GST fusion lanes (including degradation products of the latter), GST-8C2b pulled down 2.3-fold more MBP-8Nt than GST alone. By the same analysis, the inherent mutations in GST-8C2b-VQ/AA reduced this binding efficiency to 1.7-fold over basal. The association of GST-8C2b-LL/AA with MBP-8Nt was equivalent to the nonspecific binding seen with GST, which indicated that the L1196A/L1200A double substitution abolished specific binding of the two termini of AC8. Therefore, it seems from this experiment that Leu<sup>1196</sup> and Leu<sup>1200</sup> are major determinants of autoinhibition by promoting interaction of the N and C termini of AC8. Although Val<sup>1197</sup> likely contributes to this same process, its importance is less emphatic, indicating that other regions of AC8, in the native domain organization, also play a role in maintaining the autoinhibited state.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> of ion channels and signaling enzymes can be expected to be sophisticated, given the importance of this mode of influencing cellular activity. Nevertheless, the expanding range of modes of utilization of this device continues to be surprising. In particular, CaM regulatory formats are emerging as mechanistically highly diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In this regard, some processes such as complex Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation or inactivation of various voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) are becoming well understood, and yet the activation of an apparently simple enzyme, AC8, by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM turns out to involve unexpected layers of complexity. Initial studies identified a CaM-binding domain at each terminus of AC8, but only one was required for stimulation of catalytic activity, in an apparently disinhibitory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). A later study suggested a role in the intact cell for the catalytically less significant N-terminal binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and most recently this domain was viewed to provide a stable reserve of CaM for use by the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In this study we tried to unravel and reconcile these interactions by a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> and intact cell experiments on variously mutated and truncated AC8 constructs.</p><p>A series of deletion mutants first revealed that the CaMBD and autoinhibitory domain of AC8 co-localized to the region between Val<sup>1197</sup> and Leu<sup>1212</sup>. Truncation from 1212 to 1248 did not affect AC8 activity as measured <italic>in vitro</italic> or in cell population cAMP accumulation assays. Only when the majority of the IQ<italic>lm</italic> was deleted did the resulting enzyme become almost unresponsive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation. The observation that a little Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent activity persisted after this deletion agrees with the finding that an even more severe truncation of the entire C2b region, &#x00394;1184&#x02013;1248, retained some stimulability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This finding was recapitulated in the present series of experiments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></ext-link>) and might be taken to suggest some interaction between CaM bound at the N terminus and the catalytic domains. Only AC8&#x00394;4 (truncated from Val<sup>1197</sup>) displayed robust disinhibited activity in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cell population assays. AC8&#x00394;1, AC8&#x00394;2, and AC8&#x00394;3 all resembled WT-AC8 with regard to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cell populations. Thus, we considered that the IQ<italic>lm</italic> contains both autoinhibitory and CaM-binding elements, which could either be overlapping (like those found in skeletal myosin light chain kinase, plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and CaM-dependent kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>)) or spatially distinct, even within this short sequence.</p><p>In attempting to separate these two functions of the IQ<italic>lm</italic>, a number of point mutations (single and multiple) were introduced in this domain. To our considerable surprise, although the maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM stimulation varied somewhat between preparations, all mutants displayed a robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> that was basically indistinguishable from that of WT-AC8. We speculated that pre-associated CaM at the N terminus could allow Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM activation to proceed even in the presence of mutation at the C-terminal IQ<italic>lm</italic>. This speculation was consolidated when we introduced the same IQ<italic>lm</italic> mutations into AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub>, a truncation that lacks the N-terminal CaMBD. Two IQ<italic>lm</italic> mutations, L1208E/L1209E and Q1198K, were of no consequence to AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub> activity, so we can propose that these residues are not involved in the activation of AC8. However, all other mutations inhibited the maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation of AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub>, in the following rank order: R1202E/R4E = V1197N/R1202Q &#x0003e; V1197A/Q1198A/R1202A &#x0003e; S1199D &#x0003e; V1197N &#x0003e; V1197A/Q1198A &#x0003e; K1206E &#x0003e; R1202Q. So not only does CaM tethering advantageously sequester a limited cellular transduction factor, it also might support the CaM-regulated activity of AC8. The latter must be a minor effect because the N-terminal truncation mutant, AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub>, retains full Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. To confirm that the deleted 106 amino acids performed no other function in this context than binding CaM, we introduced the V1197A/Q1198A/R1202A triple substitution into an AC8 mutant that retains the N terminus but is mutated in six critical residues in the CaMBD (AC8<sub>38&#x02013;40,49&#x02013;51ala</sub>), so that it can no longer bind CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). AC8<sub>38&#x02013;40,49&#x02013;51ala</sub> is functionally equivalent to AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><italic>in vitro</italic>, because Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM stimulation is not affected, but it is dependent on exogenous CaM for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). AC8<sub>38&#x02013;40,49&#x02013;51ala</sub><sup>VQR/AAA</sup> displayed a similar degree of attenuation in Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM activity as did AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>VQR/AAA</sup>, when compared with the respective parent mutant enzymes. This emphatically suggests that the CaM-binding residues of the N-terminal 1-5-8-14 motif, and not any others contained in the first 106 amino acids, impart tolerance to mutation of the IQ<italic>lm</italic>.</p><p>Intact cell assays assessed the cellular consequences on the disruptions caused by AC8 IQ<italic>lm</italic> mutations. Again, overall levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation seemed unaffected for all mutations (as with AC8 mutations <italic>in vitro</italic>), but, very strikingly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity of those containing Val<sup>1197</sup> and Leu<sup>1196/1200</sup> substitutions were significantly higher than WT-AC8. This Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity reflects disinhibition, so that the contribution of Val<sup>1197</sup> and Leu<sup>1196/1200</sup> to the maintenance of an autoinhibited state is promoted.</p><p>Direct CaM binding of GST-fused C2b regions allowed us to separate binding from the functional effects of IQ<italic>lm</italic> mutants. This revealed that the mutation R1202E/R1204E almost ablated association of the C2b region with CaM, whereas V1197A/Q1198A, L1196S/L1200A, and L1208E/L9E were of little consequence. Hence, two of the three signature IQ-like residues are not directly involved in CaM binding, but the third plus another noncanonical more C-terminal arginine are critical. The diminished regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM of AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>VQ/AA</sup>, AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>VQR/AAA</sup>, and AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub><sup>VN</sup><italic>in vitro</italic> is most probably because of an inherently elevated basal production of cAMP, which limits further activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. The key residues of autoinhibition appear then to be Leu<sup>1196</sup>, Val<sup>1197</sup>, and Leu<sup>1200</sup>, which do not contribute directly to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding.</p><p>Very little is known about the precise organization of the cytosolic regions of AC8, other than the certainty that catalytic C1a and C2a domains dimerize to form the catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Here we have shown that a GST-tagged C terminus interacts with an MBP-tagged N terminus and that this association is abrogated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free, CaM. It is further suggested that Leu<sup>1196</sup> and Leu<sup>1200</sup> are key to the interaction of the C2b region and N terminus, with a lesser contribution from Val<sup>1197</sup>. This experiment reinforces our cell population cAMP assays that showed the importance of these residues in autoinhibition. We also now entertain the possibility that, although having a minor role in inter-termini association, Val<sup>1197</sup> acts as an autoinhibitory anchor to distinct regions of AC8. This could involve either one or both of the catalytic C1a/C2a domains.</p><p>On the basis of the current experiments and previous work, we would now propose a new model for the regulation of AC8 by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and the steps involved. We propose that CaM pre-associated at the N terminus of AC8 is incorporated into an autoinhibitory complex, involving the C terminus, at resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. From previous work, we suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to the C-lobe of CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), which has the higher affinity for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] than the N-lobe, an affinity that is potentially enhanced by association with the 1-5-8-14 sequence. The IQ<italic>lm</italic> of AC8, like many other CaM-binding sequences, is predicted to be &#x003b1;-helical in structure. Using Jpred, an on-line server that provides predictions from six secondary structure algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, we find a break in the helix at residue Asn<sup>1201</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 6</ext-link>). This break bifurcates the following two groups of amino acids we have now characterized: those that contribute mostly to basal autoinhibition (Leu<sup>1196</sup>, Val<sup>1197</sup>, and Leu<sup>1200</sup>), and those that are directly involved in CaM binding (Arg<sup>1202</sup> and Arg<sup>1204</sup>). Perhaps this proposed break in structure reflects a separation of function of IQ<italic>lm</italic> residues. If the helical region before the break is called H1 and the helical region after the break is called H2, it is seen that H1 is highly hydrophobic and H2 contains all of the positively charged residues of the entire IQ<italic>lm</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental Fig. 6</ext-link>). These features may be important for the divergent responsibilities we propose for the residues therein. Incorporating this into the data described above, it is conceivable that H1 is buried in the autoinhibitory complex, and H2 is solvent-exposed, because of their respective nonpolar and polar characters. Therefore, we present a resting organization schematized in <italic>state 1</italic> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>. A previous study concluded that CaM pre-associates with the 1-5-8-14 motif via its C-lobe, and here we have demonstrated a resting interaction of the N and C termini. By this arrangement, H2 might act as a hook for a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded CaM N-lobe, bait which is only available after initiation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal when pre-associated CaM senses a rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> via its basally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free N-lobe. An intermediary step could here be captured in which we find CaM straddling the two termini of AC8; its C-lobe is still associated with the 1-5-8-14 motif, and its N-lobe is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-saturated and bound to the IQ<italic>lm</italic> helix 2 (<italic>state 2</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). From here, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM must dissociate from the 1-5-8-14 motif and bind only to the IQ<italic>lm</italic> (recall that AC8<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;106</sub> achieves maximal stimulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM). Consequent conformational changes in the whole IQ<italic>lm</italic> release H2 from the autoinhibitory complex, and the two termini dissociate, and disinhibition (activation) of AC8 is achieved (<italic>stage 3</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). This proposal can be taken further based on a very recent report showing that of two CaM mutants (CaM<sub>12</sub> and CaM<sub>34</sub>, which can only bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the C- and N-lobe, respectively), CaM<sub>34</sub> can partially activate AC8 activity, whereas CaM<sub>12</sub> cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). This fully supports the mechanism just described, because the binding of the CaM N-lobe to H2 (wherein the critical residues for CaM association lie, as uncovered in the present study) is the first step in CaM-mediated disinhibition of AC8. <italic>Stage 4</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> indicates the dissociation of CaM from the IQ<italic>lm</italic> after the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration returns to basal and the re-association of CaM with the 1-5-8-14 motif. The whole system then returns to rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, <italic>stage 1</italic>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed mechanism of AC8 activation by CaM.</bold> The dumb-bell represents CaM, where <italic>N</italic> and <italic>C</italic> indicate N- and C-lobes, respectively. <italic>Orange</italic> depicts Ca<sup>2+</sup> saturation of a CaM lobe, and <italic>gray</italic> depicts a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free state.

At rest (<italic>stage 1</italic>), the N and C termini of AC8 interact, as part of a larger autoinhibitory complex, with CaM pre-associated at the N-terminal 1-5-8-14 motif via its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-saturated C-lobe. Upon a Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise (<italic>stage 2</italic>), the N-lobe of CaM becomes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-saturated (indicated by a change of color from <italic>gray</italic> to <italic>orange</italic>) and subsequently binds to H1 of the C-terminal IQ<italic>lm</italic>. Fully Ca<sup>2+</sup>-saturated CaM then leaves the 1-5-8-14 motif (<italic>stage 3</italic>), binding solely to the IQ<italic>lm</italic>, and the whole autoinhibitory complex dissociates, resulting in activation of AC8. As local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations decrease, the N-lobe of CaM becomes Ca<sup>2+</sup> free and binds once more to the 1-5-8-14 motif (<italic>stage 4</italic>), whereupon the whole system returns to rest with the re-association of the autoinhibitory complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0250976740009"/></fig><p>Overall, this study has revealed unexpected complexity in the regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM of the IQ<italic>lm</italic> of AC8. Three separable events occur as follows: (i) binding of CaM; (ii) activation by CaM; and (iii) autoinhibitory events. There is a less than perfect overlap between the amino acid residues mediating these phenomena. Indeed, it appears that the IQ<italic>lm</italic> has a helix-loop-helix structure in which mainly hydrophobic, autoinhibitory residues are found in H1 and basic CaM-binding residues lie in H2. Although this mechanism is more elaborate than was expected, it is not dissimilar to the types of mechanisms used by CaM in regulating the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Curiously, the level of mechanistic complexity suggested for AC8 is unlikely to occur with the other Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-stimulated AC, AC1, because this enzyme possesses only one CaMBD. Distinct physiological roles are envisaged for these functional homologues, which were recently attributed to their distinct affinities for CaM, dependences of CaM lobe Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy, kinetics of activation, and thereby their overall dissimilarity in activation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The present data reinforce this assertion, because the more complex utilization of CaM by AC8 permits temporally distinguishable activation steps that could contribute to the cAMP oscillations that are seen with AC8 but not with AC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Future studies may reveal yet more creative exploitation of the apparently simple motif of Ca<sup>2+</sup> exerting its regulatory effects by the intercession of the ubiquitous CaM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_23_15573__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M809585200_SUPPleg.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by Wellcome Trust Grant RG31760.</p></fn><fn id="FN2" fn-type="supplementary-material"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M809585200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Results,&#x0201d; Table 1, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN3"><label>2</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">CaM</term><def><p>calmodulin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">AC</term><def><p>adenylyl cyclase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">AC8<sub>38&#x02013;40,49&#x02013;51ala</sub></term><def><p>AC8 N-terminal CaM-binding mutant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">CaMBD</term><def><p>CaM-binding domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">CCE</term><def><p>capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">CEC</term><def><p>concentration-effect curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">IQ<italic>lm</italic></term><def><p>IQ-like motif</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">FSK</term><def><p>forskolin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">GST</term><def><p>glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">MBP</term><def><p>maltose-binding protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">TG</term><def><p>thapsigargin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">WT</term><def><p>wild-type</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">TBS</term><def><p>Tris-buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">PBS</term><def><p>phosphate-buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G15">ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are very grateful to our colleagues Nana Masada and Dr. Debbie Willoughby for careful review of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Clapham</surname><given-names>D.
