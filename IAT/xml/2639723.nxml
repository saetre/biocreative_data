The consequence of this rearrangement remains enigmatic, but deletion of this 3.3-kb macrosatellite element might affect the expression of the FSHD-associated gene(s) through position effect mechanisms. We investigated this hypothesis by creating a large collection of constructs carrying 1 to &#x0003e;11 <italic>D4Z4</italic> repeats integrated into the human genome, either at random sites or proximal to a telomere, mimicking thereby the organization of the 4q35 locus. We show that <italic>D4Z4</italic> acts as an insulator that interferes with enhancer&#x02013;promoter communication and protects transgenes from position effect. This last property depends on both CTCF and A-type Lamins. We further demonstrate that both anti-silencing activity of <italic>D4Z4</italic> and CTCF binding are lost upon multimerization of the repeat in cells from FSHD patients compared to control myoblasts from healthy individuals, suggesting that FSHD corresponds to a gain-of-function of CTCF at the residual <italic>D4Z4</italic> repeats. We propose that contraction of the <italic>D4Z4</italic> array contributes to FSHD physio-pathology by acting as a CTCF-dependent insulator in patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Facio-Scapulo-Humeral Dystrophy (FSHD) is the third most common myopathy with an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance. FSHD is caused by contraction of an array of repeated sequences, <italic>D4Z4</italic>, in the terminal region of chromosome 4 (4q35 locus). This genetic disease is not caused by classical mutations within the sequence of a gene but rather is associated with a change in the organization of the chromatin fiber. Because of the complexity of the region implicated in the disease, the exact pathogenic mechanism is still unclear. Our goal was to engineer genomic tools that would reproduce the organization of the chromosomal region linked to FSHD in order to understand the biological function of the <italic>D4Z4</italic> repeat using cellular models. We have identified a new mechanism for the regulation of the <italic>D4Z4</italic> array depending on both the number of repeats and the presence of CTCF and A-type Lamins. Our work reveals that D4Z4 acts as a potent insulator element that protects from the influence of repressive chromatin in patient cells but not in controls.

In cells stably transfected with the T construct, telomere proximity reduces the percentage of eGFP positive cells compared to the pCMV vector that integrates randomly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000394-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000394.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) both in polyclonal populations of transfected cells and in isolated clones as previously published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000394-Baur1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000394-Koering1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

By contrast, <italic>D4Z4</italic> significantly increases the expression of the reporter construct inserted randomly in the genome (C1X <italic>vs</italic> pCMV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000394-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 using a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000394.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This effect is not attributable to an increased distance between the genomic environment at the site of integration and the reporter gene since progressive silencing is also observed after insertion of 3.5 kb of heterologous DNA (data not shown). Importantly, this potent effect of <italic>D4Z4</italic> on the expression of <italic>eGFP</italic> is not dependent upon the cell type since similar results were obtained in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (TE671) and mouse myoblasts (C2C12) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000394.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). This first observation suggests that <italic>D4Z4</italic> acts either as an enhancer or an insulator by activating the <italic>eGFP</italic> reporter gene or protecting its expression from surrounding sequences. By cloning the <italic>D4Z4</italic> element upstream of the <italic>eGFP</italic> reporter or upstream of the <italic>HyTK</italic> resistance gene, we showed that <italic>D4Z4</italic> does not enhance the <italic>eGFP</italic> expression and concluded that it may act as an insulator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000394.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000394-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000394.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A single <italic>D4Z4</italic> acts as a boundary that interferes with position effect and enhancer-promoter communication.</title><p>A.

The integrity of each construct was verified in stable populations of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000394.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). B. In order to evaluate the enhancer blocking activity of <italic>D4Z4</italic>, we used the test previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000394-Chung1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The K562 human erythroleukemia cell line was stably transfected with the constructs shown on the left. Each construct carries the neomycin resistance gene driven by the human A <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-globin promoter (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-Neo) flanked with the mouse <italic>5&#x02032;HS2</italic> enhancer (E). Most constructs contain the <italic>5&#x02032;HS4</italic> insulator upstream of the promoter in order to block from the influence of regulatory elements at the site of integration. For each assay, colony number was normalized to the un-insulated control (pNI). Data are the average of three independent transfections. The mean values with S.D. are plotted. As controls, the following constructs, kindly provided by Dr. G.

In order to discriminate between chromatin insulation and enhancer blocking activity for <italic>D4Z4</italic>, we performed enhancer blocking assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000394-Chung1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> by cloning <italic>D4Z4</italic> in sense (pNI-<italic>D4Z4</italic>-S) and antisense (pNI-<italic>D4Z4</italic>-AS) orientation into the pNI vector between the enhancer and the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000394-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>D4Z4</italic> reduced the colony number in an orientation-independent way suggesting that it interferes with transcriptional enhancement. In order to distinguish insulation from repression, the right <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> insulator (<italic>5&#x02032;HS4</italic>) protecting from the influence of regulatory elements at the site of integration was replaced by <italic>D4Z4</italic> (p-E-<italic>D4Z4</italic>-S). In this configuration, the number of G418-resistant colonies is similar to the control indicating that <italic>D4Z4</italic> is not a repressor but showing that it protects the <italic>&#x003b3;-Neo</italic> gene from the influence of repressive chromatin at the site of integration also in this context. Lastly, we tested the ability of <italic>D4Z4</italic> to enhance gene expression by removing the <italic>5&#x02032; HS2</italic> enhancer (E) in sense (p<italic>D4Z4</italic>-S) and antisense (p<italic>D4Z4</italic>-AS) constructs. In this assay, <italic>D4Z4</italic> does not activate <italic>&#x003b3;-Neo</italic> expression. We conclude from these experiments that a single <italic>D4Z4</italic> is unable to activate or repress the expression of a reporter gene in a sense or antisense orientation, while it is able to block enhancer-promoter communications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000394-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall, our findings indicate that <italic>D4Z4</italic> acts both as a transcriptional insulator (boundary element) protecting against the repressive influence of various chromosomal contexts and as an enhancer insulator interfering with enhancer-promoter communication. The <italic>5&#x02032; HS4</italic> insulator of the chicken <italic>b-globin</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000394-Chung1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> behaves similarly in our randomly integrated construct settings, albeit at a lower efficiency against CPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000394-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we mapped the portion of <italic>D4Z4</italic> responsible for this insulation activity by studying <italic>eGFP</italic> expression in constructs encompassing various truncated forms of <italic>D4Z4</italic>. Approximately half of the anti-silencing activity of <italic>D4Z4</italic> is present within a 432-bp region (position 382 to 814, C1X&#x00394;B1-3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000394-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 compared to pCMV using a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test,) called hereafter the proximal insulator. Interestingly, in contrast to the full-length <italic>D4Z4</italic> element, this proximal insulator also counteracts TPE suggesting an antagonistic effect between the proximal insulator and a distal silencer in a telomeric context (T1X&#x00394;B1-3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000394-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In agreement with this possibility, a construct containing the distal sequence (position 1549 to 3303) inserted either randomly (C1XDF) or terminally (T1XDF) is more repressed than the control <italic>eGFP</italic>. Moreover, a <italic>D4Z4</italic> sequence deleted of a distal 623 bp fragment (DE, deletion from position 2269 to 2892) recapitulates the insulator activity of the 1&#x02013;1381 proximal fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000394-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000394-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000394.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Mapping of the regulatory fragments within <italic>D4Z4</italic>.</title><p>A.

Therefore, we propose a model in which the loss of CTCF binding changes the spatial configuration of the region rather than the condensation of the chromatin of the locus.</p><p>Our results also implicate CTCF and A-type Lamins as important players in FSHD. In agreement with this notion, patients with FSHD display some clinical and transcriptional resemblances to Emery-Dreifuss, a muscular dystrophy linked to mutation in the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000394-Bakay1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the affinity of <italic>D4Z4</italic> for A-type lamins might contribute to the epigenetic regulation of the 4q35 locus by providing the proper subnuclear environment for the regulation of the gene(s) causing the dystrophy.

Although one cannot exclude that soluble lamins A/C are bound to <italic>D4Z4</italic>, one can speculate that depending on the position of the locus at the nuclear periphery, the lamina may either provide a high concentration of regulatory factors or favor looping between distant sequences. With respect to FSHD, the corollary of this hypothesis is that the pathogenic 4q35 allele carrying a shortened <italic>D4Z4</italic> array might be repositioned along the inner nuclear envelope from a repressive to a permissive compartment modulating thereby the microenvironment of the genes causing the disease.</p><p>Thus, beyond the importance of a better characterization of <italic>D4Z4</italic> for its relevance to the peculiar Facio-Scapulo-Humeral dystrophy, this work reveals the existence of a human insulator element that depends on both CTCF and A-type Lamins. In addition, this work suggests that the mosaic nature of human subtelomeres might directly influence the higher-order organization of the corresponding chromosome end. This may serve as a paradigm for our understanding of numerous pathologies linked to subtelomeres such as idiopathic mental retardation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinky.

A. Description of the seeding constructs and procedure. Telomere seeding is based on the non-targeted introduction of cloned telomeres into mammalian cells. The constructs carry a hygromycin resistance gene fused to the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase suicide gene (<italic>HyTK</italic>), an <italic>eGFP</italic> reporter gene, both driven by CMV promoters. We inserted <italic>D4Z4</italic> between the reporter and the telomere in order to investigate the effect of <italic>D4Z4</italic> on gene expression. The transfection of constructs linearized downstream of a 1.2 kb (TTAGGG)n seed of human telomeric repeats (<italic>Bst</italic>XI site, B) allows <italic>de novo</italic> telomere formation at the integration site while constructs lacking these repeats integrate randomly in the host genome. Conditions of transfection of the C33A cell line were optimized in order to have a single integration of the transgene per cell. Successful <italic>de novo</italic> formation of <italic>eGFP</italic>-tagged telomeres and single integration was confirmed in the polyclonal population of transfected cells and in a set of clones by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) on metaphase spreads (as illustrated in photographs 1, 2 for telomeric insertion and in photographs 3, 4 for internal integration) and by detection of a diffuse hybridization signal in Southern blot (data not shown). In agreement with previous data, the rate of <italic>de novo</italic> telomere formation in stably transfected cells is very high in the C33A cells reaching 80&#x02013;90&#x00025; of the hygromycin resistant cells for the T and T1X constructs. We also confirmed by Multiplex FISH analysis that in the presence of <italic>D4Z4</italic>, the constructs do not integrate at preferential sites (Ottaviani et al., Submitted). Three days after transfection, Hygromycin B was added to the medium. Then, cells were grown for an extended time in selective medium. The percentage of eGFP-positive cells and the average level of eGFP were monitored by Flow Cytometry (FACS) every 3 days for up to 90 days. B. Kinetics of the expression of <italic>eGFP</italic>. After 10&#x02013;12 days, the percentage of eGFP-positive cells decreases in cells containing the T construct that plateaus at 10&#x02013;20&#x00025;. A low <italic>eGFP</italic> expression is also observed in cells carrying a single <italic>D4Z4</italic> element at a subtelomeric position (T1X). On the opposite, the level of eGFP is high in C1X cells and remains constant throughout the course of the assays. C. The pCMV and C1X constructs were transfected into C2C12 mouse myoblasts or a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (TE671) and the level of eGFP was monitored by FACS for up to 30 days. As previously described for C33A cells, <italic>D4Z4</italic> protects the expression of the <italic>eGFP</italic> from CPE in the different cell types tested indicating that insulation mediated by <italic>D4Z4</italic> is not dependent upon the cell type. D. The integrity of each construct was verified by Quantitative PCR from genomic DNA of hygromycin resistant cells using different set of primers. The Ct values obtained for each construct were normalized to the H4 promoter as an internal control and compared to the values obtained for the T construct containing only the resistance gene, eGFP reporter and the telomere seed. Untransfected C33A cells were used as negative control (data not shown). For each primer set, the average fold-increase from 3 independent cell populations (&#x000b1;S.D. shown by error bars) is indicated in representative populations of cells.
