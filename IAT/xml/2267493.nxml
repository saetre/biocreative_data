The mutant animals exhibited bipolar disorder-like phenotypes, such as a distorted day&#x02013;night rhythm and a robust activity change with a period of 4&#x02013;5 days, and the behavioral abnormalities were improved by lithium. In this study, we tested the effect of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) on the behavioral abnormalities of the model. Electroconvulsive therapy, which has long been used in clinical practice, provides fast-acting relief to depressive patients and drug-resistant patients. We performed long-term recordings of wheel-running activity of Tg and non-Tg mice. While recording, we administrated a train of ECS to mice, six times over two weeks or three times over a week. The treatment ameliorated the distorted day&#x02013;night rhythm within three times of ECS, but it had no effect on the activity change with a period of 4&#x02013;5 days in the female mice. To study the mechanism of the action, we investigated whether ECS could alter the circadian phase but found no influence on the circadian clock system. The potent and fast-acting efficacy of ECS in the mutant mice supports the predictive validity of the mice as a model of bipolar disorder. This model will be useful in developing a safe and effective alternative to lithium or electroconvulsive therapy.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bipolar disorder is a major mental disorder characterized by recurrent manic and depressive episodes. The involvement of genetic factors in bipolar disorder has been recognized from twin, adoption, and family studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Goodwin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Although linkage analyses and case-control association studies have been conducted, robustly replicated loci susceptible to bipolar disorder have not been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Crow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Kato1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, several symptom-based animal models have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Kato2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Einat1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. But such models hardly satisfy the construct validity; that is, these animals do not mimic aspects of the etiology.</p><p>Our group has focused on a single major gene defect with pleiotropic effects, one of which manifests bipolar disorder. Patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) are sometimes affected with comorbid mood disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Kasahara1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. CPEO is a rare disease (MIM 157640) inherited in a Mendelian fashion. It is characterized by slowly but progressive ptosis and ophthalmoparesis and is associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) aberrations such as deletions, duplications, and point mutations. Mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder has been suggested by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, association studies of polymorphisms of mtDNA and nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial protein, and genome-wide gene expression analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Kato3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, we generated transgenic mice as a model of bipolar disorder, in which mutant POLG (mtDNA polymerase) was expressed in a neuron-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Kasahara1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>POLG</italic> gene is reported to be one of the causative genes for CPEO comorbid with mood disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-vanGoethem1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The transgenic mice (mutPOLG Tg mice) harbor mtDNA defects in the brains, which show altered activities of serotonin and noradrenalin. When the mutant animals are subjected to voluntary wheel running, they show distorted day&#x02013;night rhythm; they exhibit continued activity after the light is turned on (delayed activity) and untimely activity before the light is turned off (anticipatory activity). In addition, female mutPOLG Tg mice show a robust periodic activity pattern associated with the estrous cycle. These behavioral abnormalities are improved by lithium. Therefore, we propose that mutPOLG Tg mice satisfy the construct, face, and predictive validities of a model for bipolar disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Kasahara1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our group has begun to pursue the cellular pathomechanism of mutPOLG Tg mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Kubota1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, as the model would accelerate medication development as well as basic research. Prior to medication development using this model, we focused on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in this study. ECT has long been used since before the discovery of lithium's efficacy as a mood-stabilizing agent, and ECT provides fast-acting relief to depressive patients and drug-resistant patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-American1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we report that electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) markedly and immediately ameliorated the behavioral aberration of mutPOLG Tg mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The effect of ECS on the behavioral phenotypes of mutPOLG mice</title><p>We delivered ECS six times over 2 weeks in the first experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001877-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>); this treatment schedule conformed to the standard ECT regime for patients with mood disorder. ECS seemed to improve the distorted day&#x02013;night rhythm of the mutPOLG Tg mice; however, more than half of the treated mice died after ECS probably due to respiratory failure, and it became impossible to statistically analyze the effect of ECS. Therefore, in the second experiment, mice breathed in oxygen gas for about 1 min before receiving the electroshock. Oxygenation was highly effective, and mice rarely died after ECS.</p><fig id="pone-0001877-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001877.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Wheel-running activity records of representative mice receiving ECS.</title><p>Mice were delivered ECS (red triangles) six times (A) or three times (B).

The immediate effect of ECS allowed us to assume that ECS induced phase shifts of the circadian clock and adjusted the day&#x02013;night rhythm. ECS as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation induced <italic>c-fos</italic> mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Ji1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, where the master circadian clock located.

Thus, it might be possible that ECS improved the phenotype of the mice by directly affecting the SCN. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether ECS could alter the phase of circadian clock system. Animals were transferred and maintained in constant darkness, resulting in the free-running of circadian clock. Then we delivered a single ECS under dim red light at various times of day. We observed no phase shift caused by the ECS at any time of the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001877-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001877-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001877.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>No influence of ECS on the circadian clock.</title><p>Double-plotted activity records of representative mice receiving one ECS (red triangles) at different times of the day: circadian time (CT) 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.

Delayed and anticipatory activities, indices of distorted day&#x02013;night rhythm, were markedly improved by ECS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001877-g002">Fig. 2B, C and E</xref>). This rapid and potent effect of ECS is quite similar to that of ECT for patients with mood disorder. ECT is regarded as the most effective treatment for depression and mania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-American1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. According to several reports, patients with bipolar disorder respond more rapidly to ECT and require fewer treatments than unipolar patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Perris1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Daly1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In mutPOLG Tg mice, three treatments of ECS sufficiently improved both delayed and anticipatory activities. We observed the wheel-running activity of ECS-treated Tg mice for one month and found two significant outcomes. First, delayed activity suppressed by ECS gradually relapsed about 2 weeks afterward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001877-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, upper), whereas anticipatory activity was completely suppressed over the 1-month period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001877-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, lower). These findings suggest that there might be different mechanisms underlying delayed and anticipatory activities. Second, a robust activity change associated with the estrous cycle was not improved by ECS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001877-g001">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001877-g002">2D</xref>). Since lithium improved the periodic activity change as well as the distorted day&#x02013;night rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Kasahara1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, we had hypothesized that the two phenotypes of the mutPOLG mice were closely related. The present result, however, indicate that these two phenotypes have different treatment response.</p><p>The potent and fast-acting efficacy of ECS in the mutant mice supports the predictive validity of the mice as a model of bipolar disorder. Although the molecular mechanism underlying the actions of lithium and ECT/ECS remains unclear, neurotrophic growth factors are suggested to be upregulated by lithium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Fukumoto1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Angelucci1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and ECS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Newton1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001877-Altar1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Ear-clip electrodes were dampened with saline and attached to the pinnae, and electroshock (12&#x02013;50 mA, 60 pulses/sec, 0.5-msec pulse width, 1-sec duration) was delivered using an electroconvulsive device (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy) and a bipolar square-wave pulse generator (Ugo Basile). A tonic seizure was characterized by extension of all limbs and forward head extension that lasted for about 10 sec. We titrated the dose (current amplitude) upward in 2-mA steps beginning at 10&#x02013;15 mA, which depended on body weight.
