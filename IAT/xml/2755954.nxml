Using single particle analysis methods, we have determined the first three-dimensional structure, at 23 &#x0212b; resolution, for a member of the low voltage-activated voltage-gated calcium channel family, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, a T-type channel. Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 has dimensions of &#x0223c;115 &#x000d7; 85 &#x000d7; 95 &#x0212b;, composed of two distinct segments. The cytoplasmic densities form a vestibule below the transmembrane domain with the C terminus, unambiguously identified by the presence of a His tag being &#x0223c;65 &#x0212b; long and curling around the base of the structure. The cytoplasmic assembly has a large exposed surface area that may serve as a signaling hub with the C terminus acting as a &#x0201c;fishing rod&#x0201d; to bind regulatory proteins. We have also determined a three-dimensional structure, at a resolution of 25 &#x0212b;, for the monomeric form of the cardiac L-type voltage-gated calcium (high voltage-activated) channel with accessory proteins &#x003b2; and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; bound to the ion channel polypeptide Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. Comparison with the skeletal muscle isoform finds a good match particularly with respect to the conformation, size, and shape of the domain identified as that formed by &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, modeling of the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 structure (analogous to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 at these resolutions) into the heteromeric L-type voltage-gated calcium channel complex volume reveals multiple interaction sites for &#x003b2;-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 binding and for the first time identifies the size and organization of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; polypeptides.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>To date, five different types of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>4</sup></xref> have been identified, L, N, P/Q, R, and T, and classified according to their physiological and pharmacological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). On the basis of their electrophysiological properties, VGCCs can be divided into two classes: high voltage-activated (HVA) and low voltage-activated (LVA). T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels form the LVA family and are characterized by their low threshold of activation, small single channel conductance, slow deactivation, and a low sensitivity to classical blockers of HVA channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). T-type channels have a central role regulating, for example, cardiac pacemaking of sinoatrial node cells and tonic firing patterns in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Three T-type channel isoforms have been identified and cloned: Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3, with each isoform possessing several splice variants showing distinct functional properties (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Each VGCC is composed of a pore-forming polypeptide termed the Ca<sub>V</sub> &#x003b1;1-subunit, with 10 mammalian &#x003b1;1 isoforms identified, divided into three subfamilies: Ca<sub>V</sub>1&#x02013;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Housed within the Ca<sub>V</sub> &#x003b1;1 subunit are the calcium pore, voltage-sensing apparatus, drug binding sites, and numerous structural determinants required for binding auxiliary subunits and other regulatory proteins. Analysis of the amino acid sequences and predicted secondary structure of the T-type channels suggests a similar topology to the HVA Ca<sub>V</sub> &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> subunits and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channels, implying that they are evolutionarily related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>HVA channels are heteromeric complexes formed by the Ca<sub>V</sub> &#x003b1;1 polypeptide, with several accessory subunits non-covalently bound. For example, the cardiac L-type voltage-gated calcium channel is formed by the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunit in association with the soluble &#x003b2;-polypeptide localized to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane and a largely extracellular &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The &#x003b2;-subunit has a role in regulating activation, inactivation, and voltage dependence as well as targeting of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 to the plasma membrane. The crystal structure of the core region of the &#x003b2;-polypeptide in complex with a peptide corresponding to the interacting region of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (AID) has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), revealing that it is comprised of two domains, a type 3 Src homology (SH3) domain and a guanylate kinase-like domain. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 is associated, on the extracellular side of the membrane, with the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; subunit, the product of post-translational cleavage of a single gene comprised of a glycosylated extracellular &#x003b1;2 domain linked by disulfide bonds to the transmembrane &#x003b4; polypeptide, which is also mainly extracellular and glycosylated. Four isoforms of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The role of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; protein is not as well understood as that of the &#x003b2;-subunit, but it has been shown to increase the current amplitude and have effects on inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). An additional membrane-spanning auxiliary subunit, &#x003b3;, was initially thought to be unique to the skeletal muscle LTCC; however, recent studies have identified neuronal isoforms, although it remains unclear whether they have any role as calcium channel subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>We report here the purification of a recombinant Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, leading to the calculation of the first three-dimensional structure for a member of the LVA channel family. Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 is formed by two distinct segments, which we have been able to assign to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. We have identified the C-terminal domain that forms a tail that winds around the base of the structure, providing insights as to how this channel may be regulated through the binding of accessory/regulatory proteins and/or long range conformational movements. Furthermore, we have been able to utilize this new three-dimensional structure to probe the assembly of the polypeptides forming the cardiac LTCCs after having also calculated a novel three-dimensional structure for the monomeric form of the channel purified from bovine heart. At the resolutions described here, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 can be considered analogous to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic> for a sequence alignment overview. No mandatory auxiliary subunits for the T-type, LVA, channels have been identified. However, studies have shown that co-expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 with &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; subunits led to a 2-fold increase in T-type-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and thus this model may also provide an insight as to how accessory proteins may associate with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 to exert regulatory effects.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 Expression and Purification</title><p>The Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 rat neuronal clone was a kind gift from Dr. Edward Perez-Reyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).

This final step was repeated four times, and thus four eluted fractions were collected. The eluted protein was concentrated using a Centricon YM-50, applied to a size exclusion column (Sephacryl S-200), and eluted off using the buffer above (without the imidazole and with 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl).

Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and cardiac LTCC samples were checked for homogeneity and presentation of different views. Matrix analysis of sampling over Euler angles, &#x003d5;, &#x003b8;, and &#x003c8;, showed a good coverage of three-dimensional space for each data set (not shown).

Three-dimensional reconstructions of small asymmetric proteins are complex, and rigorous experimentation must be undertaken to ensure that the features in the final model are robust. A wide variety of starting models were tested including Gaussian blobs, transmembrane domain of K<sub>V</sub>1.2 (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2R9R">2R9R</ext-link>, edited), and the full K<sub>V</sub>1.2 crystal structure (2R9R) filtered to an appropriate resolution. In all reconstructions the principal structural features were consistent, indicating the fidelity of the final three-dimensional reconstruction. Approximately 11,500 particles were selected interactively using the graphical interface boxer (EMAN image processing software) into a box of 64 &#x000d7; 64 pixels (230 &#x000d7; 230 &#x000c5;). Particles were band-pass-filtered and centered, and a preliminary three-dimensional model was calculated from a set of unbiased reference-free class averages showing different orientations of the complex (using the refine2d.py program under EMAN). The three-dimensional model was iteratively refined at each step using a projection matching routine, whereby projections with uniformly distributed orientations of the preliminary three-dimensional model were used as references for classification of the raw data set, with the class averages from this step used to construct a new three-dimensional model. Refinement was carried out with an angular coverage of 7&#x000b0; generating 388 classes containing between 10 and 48 particles per class. The final reconstruction included 86% of the selected images. Convergence, <italic>i.e.</italic> stabilization of the three-dimensional structure, was monitored by examining the FSC of the three-dimensional models generated from each iteration.</p><p>The presence of the C-terminal His tag allowed labeling of the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 C terminus using Ni-NTA-gold&#x000ae; (Nanoprobes Inc). Excess Ni-NTA-gold was added to the purified Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and incubated for 3 h. Aliquots were then stained with uranyl acetate as above. Approximately 4,500 Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 particles with a gold label associated were selected. The class averages shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> illustrate that a good sampling of different orientations of labeled Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 was observed.

Silver staining is not a quantitative method, with the intensity of the band being dependent upon a number of physicochemical properties of the protein.

Furthermore, it can be seen that the width of the two structures is similar, except that the skeletal muscle volume is more rounded when compared with the cardiac LTCC, which is tapered toward the base of the volume; this may be due to the absence of the &#x003b3; subunit in the cardiac LTCC assembly.

Examination of samples of tetrameric ConA with purified cardiac LTCC by transmission electron microscopy after negative staining allowed selection of LTCC-ConA complexes, and using reference-free alignment and classification algorithms, a series of class averages was generated, examples of which are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>.

Subtraction of the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 map from the LTCC three-dimensional structure leaves a volume that correlates to a protein mass of &#x0223c;210 kDa, which equates to the combined mass of the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;-polypeptides (taking into account that Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 is &#x0223c;20 kDa larger than Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2).

The placement of the K<sub>V</sub>1.2 crystal as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> is consistent with the lower domain (termed C) being formed by the cytoplasmic segments and in agreement with experiments identifying the C-terminal domain, by virtue of its His tag. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 has two large cytoplasmic domains forming loops between IS6 and IIS1 (&#x0223c;38 kDa, amino acids 396&#x02013;743) and IIS6 and IIIS1 (&#x0223c;31 kDa, amino acids 965&#x02013;1272) with a smaller loop of &#x0223c;7 kDa between IIIS6 and IVS1 (amino acids 1538&#x02013;1610). The three-dimensional volume of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 shows that the C domain is indeed formed by several large densities extending below the region assigned to the lipid bilayer to form a vestibule that is in many respects reminiscent of the organization of the intracellular domains of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Furthermore, the organization proposed here shows that the pore of the K<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel lies directly above the chamber formed by the putative cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>), thus providing a passageway for calcium ions to exit through into the cytosol. Intracellular loops of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Na<sup>+</sup> channels have been suggested to form domains that act as a &#x0201c;ball and chain&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;hinged lid&#x0201d; that play central roles in channel gating as well as binding sites for &#x003b2; auxiliary subunits. Current data suggest that the T-type channel inactivation process probably also operates by involving multiple domains, <italic>i.e.</italic> the S6 helix in repeats I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), and the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). A recent report has also determined that the proximal region (first 55 amino acids) of the I-II loop functions as a gating particle with the distal portion effecting trafficking to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Although the I-II and II-III cytoplasmic loops are not completely resolved from each other in the three-dimensional volume presented here, they can be seen to form ridges of protein density (<italic>e.g.</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). This arrangement of the intracellular domains forms an exposed surface that is accessible for forming structural associations with regulatory proteins to exert cellular effects. For example protein kinase C has been described to stimulate Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 with effects localized to the II-III loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p><p>We have also reported a three-dimensional structure for a monomeric cardiac LTCC, in contrast to the channel dimers described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The isolation of a monomeric cardiac, LTCC, cannot be solely attributed to the detergent exchange step because purification of the skeletal muscle channel monomers also employed digitonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) but probably relates to the number of purification steps, the endogenous lipids co-purified, and channel complex stability. Our experiences suggest that lipid association plays a role, and we have previously described how dilution with buffer not containing lipids coupled with a further size exclusion chromatography step led to a partial dissociation of the cardiac dimers to monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It may be, therefore, that the introduction of the detergent exchange step has tipped the monomer-dimer balance in the subsequent purification steps we employed, resulting in less co-purifying lipid and thus favoring the monomer form.</p><p>We noted that both the finger of the cardiac LTCC and the tail domain of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 have similar characteristics in that they extend out from the main protein density. However, a comparison of the two finds that the tail is much shorter than the finger segment with a different orientation and angle of extension from Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 when compared with the way in which the finger domain protrudes out from the body of the cardiac LTCC. Moreover, modeling of the two structures so that the finger domain corresponds to the C terminus of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 found that the majority of the protein density would lie within the membrane, which is not consistent with known topology, and consequently, it would seem that this is not the case. Furthermore, modeling of the two structures as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> shows that the region attributed to the C-terminal domain of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 will be intimately associated with the &#x003b2;-polypeptide and thus is likely not resolved in the cardiac LTCC three-dimensional volume.</p><p>Murata <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) first reported two-dimensional projection images of negatively stained (uranyl acetate) monomeric rabbit skeletal muscle LTCCs, describing a rod-like structure with a height of &#x0223c;210 &#x000c5; and diameter of &#x0223c;100 &#x000c5; with a small spherical domain extending from the upper portion of the rod. Labeling studies led to the proposal that the skeletal muscle channel spans the T-tubular membrane by &#x0223c;210 &#x000c5; with the spherical density corresponding to the &#x003b1;2 polypeptide placed on the extracellular side. This work was followed by the first three-dimensional structure of a skeletal muscle LTCC monomer by Serysheva <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) determined from frozen hydrated protein. However, the three-dimensional volume was found to be substantially smaller (&#x0223c;115 &#x000d7; 130 &#x000d7; 120 &#x000c5;), but the proposed orientation of the two principal domains, termed a heart and a handle region, agreed with that of Murata <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), with an asymmetric distribution of protein density across the bilayer, consistent with the predicted topology. The three-dimensional monomer structure for the skeletal muscle LTCC described by Wolf <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) a year later was not only larger than the other directly comparable structure from Serysheva <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) but was positioned so that the majority of the protein density was within the membrane, leaving only the leg domain extending into the extracellular milieu. On the basis of labeling of the intracellular and extracellular polypeptides of the channel dimers studied by this group, we proposed a similar orientation of the skeletal and cardiac dimer structures, with respect to the lipid bilayer, as that suggested by the Murata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and Serysheva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) groups and in contrast to that proposed by Wolf <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>We have now advanced this work further and show a direct comparison between the monomeric cardiac LTCC structure described here and the skeletal muscle LTCC structure of Wolf <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), finding them to be very similar. Our new structure shows that the finger extends out from the nose density that lies directly above the domain ascribed to the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 ion channel pore subunit, and so, in agreement with our ConA labeling, we suggest that this region is also attributable to a portion of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, fitting of the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, K<sub>V</sub>1.2, and &#x003b2;-core crystal structures into the LTCC three-dimensional volume also allows the approximate region corresponding to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; to be defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>C&#x02013;F</italic>) (due to the small size of the &#x003b4; polypeptide, we cannot resolve it from &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>). This region corresponds to a protein mass of &#x0223c;170 kDa (at the thresholds displayed here) and has been colored <italic>green</italic> to give an impression of the shape, size, and architecture of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; polypeptide. The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; subunit forms a &#x0201c;cap&#x0201d; on the top of the Ca<sub>V</sub> polypeptide, and the view shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>G</italic> reveals that the pore of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 is open to the extracellular milieu below the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;. This arrangement suggests that several extracellular domains of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 are likely to be engaged in binding &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;. We have previously noted that both the LTCC &#x003b1;2-subunit and many cell adhesion molecules, including integrin &#x003b2;-subunit, contain a Von Willebrand factor-A domain with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif and that integrin dimers form a loose hairpin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). It is therefore interesting to find that the details of the finger domain shown here reveal that it also forms a hook-shaped structure.</p><p>The new structure for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 described here also allows us to propose another orientation for the LTCC complex, whereby the long axis traverses the plasma membrane as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>F</italic>, tilted at an angle of &#x0223c;50&#x000b0; with respect to the plane of the bilayer. An alternative orientation would be whereby the long axis is orthogonal rather than tilted; however, this would place a portion of the finger domain (which corresponds to the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; polypeptide) within the lipid bilayer. Because this domain may be quite flexible in its native environment <italic>in vivo</italic>, there may be movement of the finger placing it above the membrane, and so this orientation cannot be discounted. An alternative interpretation would be one in which the finger domain corresponds, in part, to the transmembrane &#x003b4;, but because only a single helix is suggested to span the membrane, then the volume of the finger domain (even accounting for associating detergent) is much too large. Therefore, on the basis of the data we currently have available, we propose the orientation as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>F</italic>.</p><p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> places the HVA &#x003b2;-subunit nestled between the base of the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 with the C terminus wrapped around and the AID domain in close proximity to the TM assembly. This arrangement helps explain how the &#x003b2;-polypeptide may bind to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 because in addition to the interaction domain crystallized with the &#x003b2;-subunit (AID), there are multiple reports of other interaction sites between &#x003b2; and &#x003b1;1, which would be consistent with the &#x003b2;-subunit fitting, in part, into the pocket formed by the cytoplasmic domains of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1. For example, the N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), regions between loops I-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) and III-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), and the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) of various &#x003b1;1 polypeptides have all been implicated in interactions with the &#x003b2;-subunit. The &#x003b2;-polypeptide as shown here is exposed to the cytoplasm from the base of the structure and thus is also able to bind regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). This arrangement leads to a region of low density identified in the surface-rendered LTCC volume, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>, labeled <italic>hole</italic>, and thus it is tempting to suggest that this organization of polypeptides forms a tunnel leading to the interior of the structure and may be the exit route for Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the LTCC into the cytosol after translocation across the lipid bilayer passing through the ion channel as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>.</p><p>Our study presents the first three-dimensional structure of a T-type voltage-gated calcium channel.
