Here we show POLG&#x003b2; has additional roles in mitochondrial DNA metabolism. Mitochondrial DNA is arranged in nucleoprotein complexes, or nucleoids, which often contain multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome. Gene-silencing of POLG&#x003b2; increased nucleoid numbers, whereas over-expression of POLG&#x003b2; reduced the number and increased the size of mitochondrial nucleoids. Both increased and decreased expression of POLG&#x003b2; altered nucleoid structure and precipitated a marked decrease in 7S DNA molecules, which form short displacement-loops on mitochondrial DNA. Recombinant POLG&#x003b2; preferentially bound to plasmids with a short displacement-loop, in contrast to POLG&#x003b1;. These findings support the view that the mitochondrial D-loop acts as a protein recruitment centre, and suggest POLG&#x003b2; is a key factor in the organization of mitochondrial DNA in multigenomic nucleoprotein complexes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mitochondria maintain a separate genome from the nucleus, which produces essential components of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Mammalian mitochondrial (mt) DNA is &#x0223c;16 kb and most cells contain over a thousand copies of the mitochondrial genome. Because there is no evidence for mitochondrial histones, it was widely believed for many years that mtDNA was largely naked. However, in the past decade a host of proteins has been found to be associated with mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>) and so it is now generally accepted that mtDNA is arranged in nucleoprotein complexes, or nucleoids. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years in cataloguing the protein components of mitochondrial nucleoids much less is known about how they contribute to nucleoid architecture and dynamics.</p><p>In mammals, many mtDNA molecules contain a short triple-stranded region or D-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) located in the major non-coding region of mtDNA, or NCR. The length of the third strand is somewhat variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), but as they sediment at seven svedbergs, they are collectively known as 7S DNA. The D-loop spans &#x0223c;650 nt in humans, and is located entirely within the NCR or control region of mtDNA. Synthesis of 7S DNA is believed to depend ultimately on mtRNA polymerase to provide an RNA primer derived from 7S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), whose 5&#x02032; end maps to the light-strand promoter (LSP). The 3&#x02032; end of 7S-DNA is located close to a sequence predicted to form a clover-leaf structure, which has been proposed to act as a termination signal for 7S-DNA synthesis, and so it is called the Termination Associated Sequence, or TAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The abundance of 7S DNA varies considerably among tissues and cells, and its synthesis is enhanced by electrical stimulation of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), as the electrical stimulus also induces mitochondrial biogenesis and an increase in mtDNA mass, it implies that 7S DNA plays a positive role in mtDNA metabolism. In the orthodox model of mtDNA replication 7S DNA is presumed to be a stalled or aborted replication intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>); however, the orthodox model has been challenged in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), thereby calling into question this hypothesis. Moreover, the identification of a candidate nucleoid protein, ATAD3p, with specific D-loop-binding properties suggested that the mitochondrial D-loop might be involved in protein recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), among other things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>DNA polymerase &#x003b3; (POL&#x003b3;&#x003b1; or POLG&#x003b1;) is the sole recognized DNA polymerase of animal mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and so presumably synthesizes 7S DNA, but beyond this little is known of the regulation of the process. Certainly POLG&#x003b1; is essential for mtDNA maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and together with mitochondrial single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) and the DNA helicase Twinkle it can be used to synthesize 16-kb stretches of DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). POLG&#x003b1; has an accessory subunit POLG&#x003b2;, which enhances polymerase processivity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), and is assumed to be a component of mitochondrial replisomes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Analysis of the behaviour of mutants and resolution of the structure of POLG&#x003b2; indicate that binding to POLG&#x003b1; and binding to DNA involve distinct domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). POLG&#x003b2; binds to double-stranded (ds) DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>; however, this function is not required for stimulation of DNA synthesis on a ss template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>). POLG&#x003b2; has sequence and structural similarity to type IIa aminoacyl&#x02013;tRNA synthetases, and to a lesser extent to thioredoxin, which is known to play an accessory role in the priming of DNA replication by T7 DNA polymerase. Hence, it has been proposed that POLG&#x003b2; may be involved in primer recognition as well as DNA strand elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The dsDNA-binding properties of POLG&#x003b2; suggested to us that it might have a general role in mtDNA maintenance. In the current study, POLG&#x003b2; expression was modulated to determine the effect on mtDNA stability. Gene-silencing of POLG&#x003b2; decreased mtDNA multimers, increased the number of mitochondrial nucleoids and altered their structure in cultured cells, whereas elevated expression of POLG&#x003b2; increased the size of mitochondrial nucleoids. Experiments with recombinant protein indicated that POLG&#x003b2; is a specific D-loop-binding protein, and so it is concluded that this property enables POLG&#x003b2; to contribute to the organization of mtDNA in multigenomic complexes, in addition to its previously reported role as a replication processivity factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and RNAi</title><p>Human cultured cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 110 mg/l pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum.

Transcript levels were &#x0223c;20% of control levels 24 h after transfection and gene-silencing could be extended to 144 h by re-transfecting cells with dsRNA, 72 h after the first transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). RNA interference led to a slow but inexorable decline in mtDNA copy number, such that by Day 6 the amount of mtDNA per cell had almost halved compared to mock transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). By comparison, gene-silencing of the mtDNA helicase Twinkle was more dramatic, reducing mtDNA copy number to half the control value, 72 h after transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This suggested that mtDNA replication was inhibited in POLG&#x003b2; silenced cells, but not halted entirely, and so mitochondrial replication intermediates were screened from POLG&#x003b2; siRNA treated cells. Total cellular DNA was harvested 5 or 6 days after the first transfection and <italic>Acc</italic>I digested fragments of DNA were separated by neutral 2D-AGE and hybridized to a probe detecting the 2.8-kb fragment of human mtDNA spanning nt 15 255&#x02013;1504, which includes the NCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D). Based on previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), several of the non-linear species correspond to replication intermediates. These were the molecules resolving near the apex of a standard replication fork (Y) arc, partially degraded replication forks migrating below the standard Y arc (sub-Y), and replication forks joined to the adjacent fragment (nt 8157&#x02013;15 254), creating a compressed slow-moving Y-like arc (smy). In addition there was an uncharacterized molecular species, D and molecules resolving close to the apex of a so-called X arc. X-arcs comprise DNA molecules with a four-way junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), which may be termination or recombination intermediates. Quantification of the various species indicated a modest 1.4- to 2-fold increase in the abundance of mitochondrial replication intermediates, i.e. the species comprising the Y, sub-Y and smy arcs, relative to non-replicating linear mtDNA (1<italic>n</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). In contrast, there were marked decreases in the abundance of species&#x02019; D and X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), which were significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). In an earlier study, we noted that mtDNA fragments including the major non-coding region where the D-loop forms were associated with a prominent spot or smear on the Y or initiation arc, close to the linear fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Further analysis of fragments of mouse mtDNA confirmed that species D was exclusive to fragments containing the D-loop region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A&#x02013;D). Extraction of species D from 2D gels and its subsequent separation after heat denaturation demonstrated that such species contain 7S DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E), and so species D represents fragments of mtDNA with a D-loop. </p><p>When mtDNA is extracted without the use of protease, restriction fragments of mtDNA encompassing the D-loop region are held together by protein, producing a series of X-like species upon 2D-AGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). To determine whether or not the protease sensitive X-like species contained 7S DNA, whole cellular DNA extracted without protease treatment was digested with <italic>Acc</italic>I and separated by 2D-AGE. After first dimension electrophoresis, the gel slice was treated with or without proteinase K, separated in the second dimension, blotted and hybridized to a probe that detects the nt 15 255&#x02013;1504 mtDNA fragment containing the NCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). A spot at the apex of the simple X arc persisted after in-gel protease treatment, but the adjacent less mobile species collapsed, yielding linear molecules and a much smaller molecular species (b), which, based on its mobility in the second dimension and the probe applied (nt 16 343&#x02013;151), is 7S DNA. Therefore, the protein-dependent X-like species, which declined in response to POLG&#x003b2; siRNA appears to contain 7S DNA.</p><p>In light of the decrease in the abundance of the two species containing 7S DNA (D and X), the level of total 7S DNA in POLG&#x003b2; siRNA cells was determined. POLG&#x003b2; siRNA treatment produced a 90% decrease in 7S DNA level compared to controls, based on the ratio of 7S DNA to genome-length molecules of mtDNA (16.6 kb), analysed by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). </p><p>ATAD3p binds to synthetic D-loops <italic>in vitro</italic> and ATAD3 gene-silencing leads to the loss of mtDNA multimers from DNA samples extracted from cultured human cells without a protease treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). We concluded that ATAD3p might be recruited to mtDNA via the D-loop; if this is true, a shortage of mitochondrial D-loops should also lead to a loss of mtDNA multimers. Therefore, DNAs from POLG&#x003b2; gene-silenced and control cells were isolated without a protease step and after digestion with <italic>Acc</italic>I separated by 2D-AGE. Hybridization to a probe detecting the NCR-containing fragment revealed a series of X-like spots resolving well above the linear duplex arc in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), whereas such species were greatly reduced after POLG&#x003b2; siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and D), as was the case with ATAD3 gene-silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>POLG&#x003b2; expression affects nucleoid size, number and structure</title><p>To determine if the level of expression of POLG&#x003b2; affected the organization of mitochondrial nucleoids, human cultured cells were examined by confocal microscopy after inducing or repressing POLG&#x003b2; gene expression. Staining of mitochondrial nucleoids with the DNA intercalating dye, Picogreen, was markedly reduced after POLG&#x003b2; gene-silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). There was no such marked decrease in mitochondrial nucleoid signal based on anti-DNA antibody labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). We have shown previously that a 50% decrease in mtDNA copy number is difficult to detect using anti-DNA antibodies, and that Picogreen signal is reduced when DNA is supercoiled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>); hence the marked reduction in Picogreen signal is attributed to changes in the structure or topology of mitochondrial nucleoids and not merely to the 40% decrease in mtDNA copy number associated with 120 h of POLG&#x003b2; siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). On the other hand, anti-DNA labelling revealed a significant increase in mitochondrial nucleoid number (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), after POLG&#x003b2; siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The maximum number of nucleoids in one airy plane (<italic>z</italic>-section) was 198 &#x000b1; 21 in mock transfected cells, whereas POLG&#x003b2; dsRNA treated cells contained 318 &#x000b1; 34 nucleoids. In theory, the increase in nucleoid number (decreased mtDNA number per nucleoid) could be a general response to a decrease in mtDNA copy number, rather than a specific effect of limiting POLG&#x003b2;. However, inhibiting mtDNA replication with dideoxycytidine to decrease mtDNA copy number to the same extent as POLG&#x003b2; siRNA had no effect on mitochondrial nucleoid number (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4A</ext-link>), nor was there any suggestion of increased nucleoid numbers in Twinkle siRNA treated HOS cells, where the copy number was 50% of controls (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4B</ext-link>). The effects on mitochondrial nucleoids of modulating POLG&#x003b2; expression could have been indirect, as the protein forms a heterotrimer with POLG&#x003b1;; i.e. a shortage of POLG&#x003b2; might destabilize POLG&#x003b1;. However, POLG&#x003b1; levels were unaffected by POLG&#x003b2; siRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5A</ext-link>), indicating that the changes in mtDNA documented above were not related to the abundance of POLG&#x003b1;.</p><p>Over-expression of POLG&#x003b2; was investigated in HEK and U2OS cells. Doxycyclin induced expression of HA tagged POLG&#x003b2; in HEK cells caused a loss of Picogreen signal, indistinguishable from POLG&#x003b2; siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) and moreover this was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the steady-state level of 7S DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). To test whether these results reflected aggregation of the transgene product and endogenous POLG&#x003b2;, i.e. a situation where over-expression was tantamount to gene-silencing, mitochondrial lysates were fractionated on iodixanol gradients. HA-tagged POLG&#x003b2; was found to co-fractionate with mtDNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 6</ext-link>), indicating that the transgene product was binding to mtDNA. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry of U2OS cells expressing of POLG&#x003b2;.HA revealed good co-localization of the protein and mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5</ext-link>). Based on visual inspection, the mitochondrial nucleoids appeared larger and less numerous in U2OS cells over-expressing POLG&#x003b2; and this impression was confirmed by quantitative analysis: the maximum number of foci (nucleoids) labelled with anti-DNA antibody in one airy plane, was 244 &#x000b1; 47 per cell in controls, with a mean nucleoid size of 0.350 &#x000b1; 0.056 &#x000b5;m (full width half maximum), whereas the same cell type overexpressing POLG&#x003b2; had 145 &#x000b1; 87 nucleoids per cell, sized 0.569 &#x000b1; 0.133 &#x000b5;m.

The increase in POLG&#x003b2; expression was not accompanied by a concomitant increase in POLG&#x003b1; expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5B</ext-link>) and nor could the increase in nucleoid size be explained by enhanced replication, as the mtDNA copy number was unchanged after induction of POLG&#x003b2;, based on quantitative PCR analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5C</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>POLG&#x003b2; preferentially binds to plasmids bearing a D-loop</title><p>The similar effects on mtDNA of POLG&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>B and C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A) and ATAD3 siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) was consistent with the proteins contributing to two steps in a pathway: POLG&#x003b2; being required for D-loop synthesis and the D-loops serving to recruit ATAD3p to mtDNA. Accordingly, the decrease in mtDNA multimers observed after POLG&#x003b2; siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) could be explained by a lack of ATAD3p in mitochondrial nucleoids. Alternatively the D-loop could act as a recruitment centre for both POLG&#x003b2; and ATAD3p, in which case both proteins would be capable of interacting directly with D-loops. To test the latter hypothesis, recombinant POLG&#x003b2; tagged with 10 histidine residues at the carboxy terminus was produced and incubated with synthetic D-loops and the products resolved on native agarose gels. POLG&#x003b2; bound to all the available plasmid with a D-loop at concentrations of protein that had no effect on free oligonucleotide, whereas both POLG&#x003b1; and SSB bound to free oligonucleotide as well as to D-loop bearing molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). This bias did not merely reflect an ability to bind dsDNA and not ssDNA as the protein preferred D-loops to plasmid DNA when cold competitor was present in considerable excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Thus, POLG&#x003b2; bound to the vast majority of D-loop bearing molecules when synthetic D-loops were mixed with a &#x0223c;250-fold excess (50 ng) of &#x02018;cold&#x02019; plasmid, <italic>prior</italic> to incubation with the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).

(<bold>D</bold>) A short piece of dsDNA (37 nt pairs) or a 33-mer ss oligonucleotide were titrated against 0, 24, 47.5, 95, 190 and 380 nM of POLG1 or 0, 22.5, 45, 90, 180 and 360 nM of POLG&#x003b2; and separated by 6% non-denaturing PAGE. (<bold>E</bold>) In some experiments the D-loop resolved as two bands: a slow (s) and a fast (f) migrating form (lane 1). Both forms of synthetic D-loop showed a mobility shift when incubated with 190 mM POLG&#x003b2; (lane 2). Unlabelled plasmid, mixed with the synthetic D-loops prior to incubation with POLG&#x003b2; (lanes 3&#x02013;7), was a considerably more effective competitor of fast migrating D-loops than slow migrating D-loops. POLG&#x003b2; bound equally well to linear and supercoiled DNA without a D-loop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 8</ext-link>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp614f5"/></fig></p><p>There was some cold plasmid in every D-loop EMSA, as some of the D-loops dissociated to plasmid and free oligonucleotide during isolation. Presumably this was less of a problem in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, as it gave the lowest <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for POLG&#x003b2; binding to D-loops (1.5 nM), although even here free oligonucleotide (ss oligo) was clearly detectable at the bottom of the gel. Moreover plasmid with and without a D-loop had similar mobility and so a variable amount of contaminating &#x02018;cold&#x02019; plasmid was extracted together with the synthetic D-loops. Therefore it was critical to compare POLG&#x003b2; and POLG&#x003b1; with the same D-loop preparation in order to determine the relative affinity of binding. In a series of experiments, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of binding to radio-labelled D-loops was of the order of 50-fold higher for POLG&#x003b1; than POLG&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), despite the fact that our preparation of POLG&#x003b1; had greater affinity for dsDNA than POLG&#x003b2;, and POLG&#x003b1; but not POLG&#x003b2; bound to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). The <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for POLG&#x003b2; binding to ssDNA was incalculably high, whilst that of POLG&#x003b1; was 92 nM; and with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 124 nM, POLG&#x003b1;'s affinity for dsDNA was 4-fold greater than POLG&#x003b2; (490 nM). Taken together these results suggest that POLG&#x003b2; is a specific D-loop-binding protein.</p><p>Synthetic D-loops were of two types: slow (s) and fast (f) migrating forms; and when POLG&#x003b2; was incubated with synthetic D-loops, in the presence of increasing amounts of cold competitor plasmid, it preferentially bound to the slow migrating species&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E), whereas ATAD3B preferentially bound to the faster migrating D-loops [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 7A</ext-link>]. Tightly supercoiled plasmids with a D-loop are refractory to restriction digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>); here <italic>Xho</italic>I proved capable of cleaving the slow-migrating D-loop, but not the fast migrating form (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Figure 7B</ext-link>), and so the fast migrating D-loop is inferred to be the more tightly supercoiled of the two.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>POLG&#x003b2; has been recognized as a processivity factor and accessory subunit of mtDNA polymerase &#x003b3; for several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>); the new data reported here indicate that this is not the protein's only role. Human POLG&#x003b2; is now implicated in mtDNA organization. The concept of bifunctional mitochondrial nucleoid proteins has several precedents. There is evidence that the mammalian mitochondrial protein Tfam has roles in DNA maintenance and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>), and in yeast bifunctional mitochondrial nucleoid proteins are common currency: they include Ilv5, &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase 2, Aconitase and Hsp60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><sec><title>POLG&#x003b2; and nucleoid maintenance</title><p>POLG&#x003b2;'s DNA-binding properties are superfluous to its function as a processivity factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and most processivity factors do not bind to DNA. Therefore the dsDNA-binding properties of POLG&#x003b2; fully support the idea of one or more additional functions for POLG&#x003b2;. The effects of modulating POLG&#x003b2; expression suggest that POLG&#x003b2; is a key determinant of mtDNA copy number per nucleoid. Several cultured human cell lines, including HOS cells have been estimated to contain on average five mtDNA molecules per nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>). Therefore, this is predicted to rise to eight mtDNAs per nucleoid in cells overexpressing POLG&#x003b2; and to fall to between one and two in cells where POLG&#x003b2; expression has been repressed by RNA interference, when the decrease in mtDNA copy number is taken into consideration. The long-term effect of altering the mtDNA copy number of nucleoids is not known, although it would be expected to affect the mathematics of mtDNA segregation and therefore the maintenance of heteroplasmy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), as found in mitochondrial diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>Accounting for the changes in 7S DNA levels is less straightforward, given that both increased and decreased expression of POLG&#x003b2; caused a precipitous fall in the steady-state level of 7S DNA. However, a protein in excess having the converse effect to normal has many precedents; Tfam, for example, is essential for maintaining mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and can in moderation increase mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), yet a large excess of Tfam causes mtDNA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Thus, POLG&#x003b2;'s propensity for binding D-loop structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) suggests it is ordinarily recruited to mtDNA via the mitochondrial D-loop, whereas in great excess, the dsDNA-binding properties of POLG&#x003b2; may be sufficient to ensure its recruitment to mtDNA in the absence of D-loop structures. Moreover, the fact that 7S DNA (D-loop) levels fell when POLG&#x003b2; was over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D), implies that cells cannot sustain normal levels of D-loops and abundant POLG&#x003b2;, perhaps because this would inhibit nucleoid division to such an extent that they would grow ever larger and the cell would be unable to partition mtDNA at cell division. Thus, the decrease in 7S DNA may be designed to avoid such an eventuality; it might reflect an active process involving another nucleoid protein, such as Twinkle DNA helicase, alternatively POLG&#x003b2; loading onto mtDNA may be self-limiting, i.e. high occupancy of mtDNA by POLG&#x003b2; may occlude D-loop synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>POLG&#x003b2; is not a universal mitochondrial nucleoid protein</title><p>The role of POLG&#x003b2; in mitochondrial nucleoid maintenance may well be restricted to mammals and vertebrates, as Drosophila POLG&#x003b2; is shorter than its mammalian homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), and the section missing from insect POLG&#x003b2; has been shown to be important for dimerization and DNA binding of mouse POLG&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Based on the sequence differences between mouse and fly POLG&#x003b2;, it was suggested that mammalian POLG&#x003b2; would have an additional function not found in the insect protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>); in light of the new findings we conclude that mtDNA organization is one such function. If this is true, Drosophila POLG&#x003b2; will not display the same affinity for D-loops as mammalian POLG&#x003b2;, although this has yet to be tested.</p></sec><sec><title>POLG&#x003b2;'s DNA-binding properties distinguish it from both SSB and POLG&#x003b1;</title><p>Given that both POLG&#x003b2; and ATAD3p readily bind to D-loops [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and this report], it was conceivable that we had identified a general property of many nucleic-acid-binding proteins. However the fact that neither SSB nor POLG&#x003b1; behave similarly suggests otherwise. SSB bound to synthetic D-loops and ssDNA equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 8), whereas POLG&#x003b2;, at best, binds to ssDNA only weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and D). Indeed, the binding of POLG&#x003b2; to ssDNA may be entirely dependent on secondary structure. Unlike POLG&#x003b2;, POLG&#x003b1; bound to ssDNA and dsDNA equally well, to a first approximation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). The affinity of binding of recombinant POLG&#x003b1; to dsDNA and ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D) was similar to that reported for a 21/45 nt primer&#x02013;template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). POLG&#x003b2;'s affinity for dsDNA was greater than we observed in one report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), but similar to another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Although POLG&#x003b1; did bind to synthetic D-loops, its preference for D-loops was considerably less than POLG&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>B and C). Thus, there were marked differences between POLG&#x003b2;, POLG&#x003b1; and SSB in respect of their preferences for binding to different forms of DNA. Alone among the three proteins tested here, POLG&#x003b2; bound to D-loop structures in preference to dsDNA or ssDNA, and so we infer that the mitochondrial D-loop is likely to be a physiologically relevant substrate of POLG&#x003b2;, especially as altered expression of POLG&#x003b2; had a pronounced effect on mitochondrial D-loop stability. Ultimately it will be necessary to generate cells with mutant forms of POLG&#x003b2; that are incapable of binding DNA, or D-loops, in order to determine the precise contribution of these features of the protein to mtDNA organization.</p><p>Notwithstanding the remarks about SSB above, mtSSB may also be recruited to mtDNA via the D-loop. Historically, SSB was thought to be plentiful in animal mitochondria because it was believed to coat long stretches of ssDNA that formed during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>); however, recent work has suggested that there is no greater requirement for ssDNA in mtDNA replication than nuclear DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Certainly mtSSB is abundant in mature <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), where mtDNA replication is dormant, supporting the idea that it is, like POLG&#x003b2;, a nucleoid maintenance factor, as well as being essential for DNA replication.</p></sec><sec><title>POLG&#x003b2;'s and ATAD3p's contribution to mitochondrial nucleoid status</title><p>ATAD3p's assignment as a mitochondrial nucleoid protein that directly binds to mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). However, the striking parallels between the behaviour of ATAD3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and POLG&#x003b2; (this report) both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cultured cells lend additional support to the idea that ATAD3p is a <italic>bona fide</italic> mitochondrial nucleoid protein. POLG&#x003b2; and ATAD3p share a marked preference for DNA molecules with a D-loop; and silencing of either gene destabilizes detergent-resistant mtDNA multimers and alters the structure of mitochondrial nucleoids. The findings to date can be reconciled with a &#x02018;nucleoid cycle&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Namely, in conjunction with POLG&#x003b1;, POLG&#x003b2; is needed for D-loop synthesis, but it also stabilizes D-loop structures, unless it is present in excess. Both ATAD3p and POLG&#x003b2; are required to form a detergent-resistant nucleoid, and nucleoid size will naturally increase with time owing to DNA replication. Although nucleoid expansion could in theory be augmented by nucleoid fusion, this appears to be a rare event based on a recent study in human cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Nucleoid division is imperative for transmission of mtDNA and so the apparatus for partitioning mitochondrial nucleoids must be recruited at some stage. This could involve additional copies of ATAD3p, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), or as yet unknown factors. If the recruitment of the mtDNA segregation apparatus is D-loop dependent, then the D-loop is needed for different purposes at different stages of the nucleoid cycle, and this could explain how the loss of 7S DNA was associated with both increasing and decreasing nucleoid size. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>A model for POLG&#x003b2; and ATAD3p involvement in mitochondrial nucleoid formation, enlargement and division. The changes in mitochondrial nucleoids effected by modulating the expression of POLG&#x003b2; (this report) and ATAD3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) suggest that each contributes to nucleoid homeostasis. The synthesis of a short triple-stranded region creates a D-loop, which is mediated by mtDNA polymerase &#x003b3; holoenzyme (POLG&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;). The D-loop structures are the preferred substrate of ATAD3p [a putative nucleoid protein, see ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and POLG&#x003b2; (this report)], hence D-loop synthesis is followed by POLG&#x003b2; and ATAD3p recruitment. Additional factors may be required for nucleoid division, which are inhibited by an excess of POLG&#x003b2; (see text for further details).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp614f6"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp614/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp614_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp614_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>UK Medical Research Council, the Academy of Finland [Grants 110689, 103213 and CoE funding]; Juselius Foundation; Tampere University Hospital Medical Research Fund; University of Tampere; European Union FP6 Mitocombat Integrated Programme (to I.J.H., M.D.R., A.R., S.G. and J.N.S.); UK Muscular Dystrophy Campaign (to T.Y.); Academy of Finland grants 110463 and 108380 (to P.M.); European Union FP6 Proteomage (to A.R.F. and T.S.W.).
