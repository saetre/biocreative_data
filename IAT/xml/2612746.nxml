We note that the macaques used in this study were obtained from three different breeding facilities, and that available pedigree information indicates animals obtained from the same colony are unrelated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004156.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>In order to further address the concern of linkage disequilibrium, we performed a retrospective analysis of the behavioral data using additional genotype information. We included analysis of four different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the gene encoding tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and of a repeat sequence in the upstream regulatory region of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004156.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Like 5-HTTLPR, both TPH-2 and MAOA influence serotonergic function. In each case, either there was no genetic variation in our population or individual differences in social reward and punishment in our tasks did not vary with genotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004156.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Finally, we also genotyped our colony for three SNPs located within the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of the serotonin transporter gene. These SNPs had either no explanatory power for the results of our experiments, or lacked sufficient variation to test their effects on the experimental outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004156.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These control analyses give us more confidence that variation in the 5-HTTLPR gene contributes to social reward and punishment in rhesus macaques, although this conclusion clearly merits further study with larger populations of rhesus macaques.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results endorse the notion that the short 5-HTTLPR allele confers enhanced aversion to social threats. We found that rhesus monkeys carrying the short allele (S/L) were less likely than monkeys homozygous for the long allele (L/L) to gaze directly at the faces and eyes of conspecifics, and that they exhibit a larger sympathetic response, as measured by pupil dilation, to images of high status individuals. Furthermore, we found that 5-HTTLPR genotype was differentially associated with socially primed risk-taking behavior: compared to L/L animals, S allele carriers were significantly less likely to take a gamble after seeing a high status face, whereas risk preferences did not differ between the two groups when gambles were preceded by non-threatening stimuli such as low status faces or reproductive images. Third, in a direct economic measure of how much animals with the two genotypes value various types of social images, we found that S/L monkeys will not give up juice in order to see an image of a high status male face. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004156.s004">Figure S4</xref> for a comparison of current results with a prior study using the same task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Deaner2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>). Importantly, the results from these three experiments suggest that 5-HTTLPR genotype influences both social appraisal and nonsocial decision making when it occurs in a social context.</p><p>For both human and non-human primates, faces and eyes are a rich source of social information, and allow the observer to gauge the identity, affect, and intention of another individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Rosenfeld1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Mendelson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It is well established that both humans and in rhesus macaques tend to preferentially direct visual attention towards the faces of others, especially the eye region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Ghazanfar1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Guo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. This visual bias emerges at around 2 months of age in the typically developing human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Maurer1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is known to be attenuated or absent in individuals with autism and social phobia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Spezio1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Horley1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

The reluctance of S/L macaques to gaze directly at the eyes and faces of conspecifics, as well as their enhanced sympathetic response to the images of high-status males, suggest that S/L macaques experience greater anxiety than L/L macaques when viewing potential social threats.</p><p>Given that the S/L monkeys found images of high status male faces more arousing, as measured by pupil diameter, in the free-viewing task, we expected that image-primed gambling would also vary as a function of 5-HTTLPR genotype. In humans, it is well established that mood or disposition can influence risk preferences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Tversky1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as influence subjective estimates of the frequency of similarly valenced events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Johnson1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. According to the &#x0201c;appraisal tendency framework,&#x0201d; these behavioral inconsistencies result from the tendency for subjective emotional influences to bias reward-processing and decision-making, even when those emotions are irrelevant to the decision at hand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Lerner1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Lerner2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. These biases are not strictly limited by the valence of emotion. For example, fear-evoking stimuli induce risk aversion whereas anger-eliciting stimuli induce risk seeking in human subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Lerner2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In our experiment, preference for a risky outcome over a safe outcome was diminished in S/L monkeys when the decision was preceded by presentation of a potentially threatening image, consistent with the idea that faces of high status males elicit greater fear in S/L monkeys than L/L monkeys.</p><p>In the third experiment, we demonstrated that rhesus monkeys heterozygous for the long and short allele (S/L) were less likely than monkeys homozygous for the long allele (L/L) to give up juice in order to see an image of a dominant male face. In the case of the S/L animals, the avoidance of dominant male faces likely results from heightened anxiety associated with this particular category of images. This interpretation is consistent with neuroimaging studies that show that human S carriers have greater activation of the amygdala than L/L homozygotes when looking at angry faces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Hariri1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Hariri2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as our finding of increased pupil diameter in rhesus S carriers in response to dominant male faces. Within the context of rhesus macaque social structure, this makes adaptive sense: high ranking male macaques are potent social threats, and direct eye contact is a social challenge that is likely to invite retaliation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-vanHoof1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Hauser1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Differential behavior of S/L and L/L monkeys associated with viewing male faces, particularly those of high status individuals, may reflect heightened anxiety in S allele carriers. This interpretation is motivated by neuroimaging studies showing that S carriers have greater activation of the amygdala, a brain nucleus associated with fear and anxiety, than L/L homozygotes when viewing angry faces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Hariri1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Hariri2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Such results are consistent with the idea that variation in 5-HTTLPR exerts particular influence during early postnatal development to result in long lasting behavioral changes.

Serotonergic polymorphisms have an additive effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Murphy1">&#x0005b;see 37 for review&#x0005d;</xref>, and 5-HTTLPR variation may be one of several genotypic factors that contribute to complex disorders such as autism. 5-HTTLPR may also influence the risk for affective and other behavioral disorders through gene-environment interactions.</p><p>The commonality of the S allele in both human and rhesus macaque populations, in conjunction with its relative absence in other non-human primate species, suggests that it confers some sort of adaptive advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004156-Suomi1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the S allele is associated with increased stress and a predisposition to pathological behavior, the fitness advantages associated with heightened social vigilance may well offset these costs. We contend that heightened sensitivity to social threats conferred by the S allele may prove to be adaptive in many contexts, since success in a social group depends on seizing opportunities while simultaneously avoiding potentially harmful antagonistic interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects and housing</title><p>Subjects were 9 adult male rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) ranging in weight from 7 to 15 kg (mean weight 10.6 kg) and ranging in age from 4 to 10 years (mean age 5.7 years).
