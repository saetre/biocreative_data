AtTRP1 is encoded by a single copy gene in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, and is related to TCC1, a human protein that competes with Raf-1 for Ras binding, and distantly related to the immunophilin-like FK-binding proteins TWD1 and PAS1. The former is involved in auxin transport and the latter is translocated to the nucleus in response to auxin. AtTRP1 interacted preferentially with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ethylene receptor ERS1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. This association was confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> co-immunoprecipitation. AtTRP1 promoter&#x02013;GUS was highly expressed in vascular tissue, mature anthers, the abscission zone, and was induced by ACC. Overexpression of AtTRP1 in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulted in dwarf plants with reduced fertility, altered leaf/silique morphology, and enhanced expression of the ethylene responsive gene <italic>AtChitB</italic>. Exogenous GA did not reverse the dwarf habit. Etiolated transgenic seedlings overexpressing AtTRP1 displayed enhanced sensitivity to low ACC and this was correlated with the transgene expression. Seedlings overexpressing AtTRP1 at high levels exhibited shortened and swollen hypocotyls, inhibited root growth, and an altered apical hook. Plants overexpressing AtTRP1 also showed a reduced response to exogenous IAA and altered expression of a subset of auxin early responsive genes. These results indicated that overexpression of AtTRP1 affects cross-talk between ethylene and auxin signalling and enhances some ethylene responses and alters some auxin responses. A model for AtTRP1 action is proposed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic>AtTRP1</kwd><kwd>auxin response</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>ethylene signalling</kwd><kwd>tetratricopeptide repeat protein</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, including flower development and sex determination, fruit ripening, abscission, senescence, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeles <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>).

Ethylene biosynthesis occurs via the Yang pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang and Hoffmann, 1984</xref>) involving two key biosynthetic enzymes, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO), encoded by differentially expressed multigene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holdsworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kende, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zarembinski and Theologis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsuchisaka and Theologis, 2004</xref>). The amount of ethylene produced by plant cells varies with cell type and developmental stage, and is regulated by controlling both mRNA synthesis and enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamilton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; Llop-Tous <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamagami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Both <italic>ACS</italic> and <italic>ACO</italic> genes appear to be transcriptionally controlled by homeotic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>). The activity of ethylene biosynthetic enzymes is also regulated by phytohormones and ubiquitin/26S proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chae and Kieber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christians <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ethylene is perceived by a family of five receptors (ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2, and EIN4) that possess sequence similarity with bacterial two-component His kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleecker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang and Shockey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Two subfamilies of receptors are recognized with ETR1 and ERS1 in subfamily 1 and ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 in subfamily 2. The receptors form homo- or heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and have been located in several membranes including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the plasma membrane, the nuclear envelope, and the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). Ethylene binding to the membrane-bound N-terminal region of the receptors involves a copper ion and results in the inactivation of receptor signalling to CTR1, a negative regulator with similarity to Raf-like protein kinases that interacts with the receptors in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kieber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The receptors appear to act as redundant negative regulators of ethylene signalling to suppress ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall and Bleecker, 2003</xref>). A single loss-of-function receptor mutant does not produce phenotypic alteration, but multiple receptor loss-of-function mutants show enhanced ethylene responses, grow slowly, have small organ size, and are infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that null mutations in either ETR1 or ERS1 result in increased sensitivity to ethylene and double null mutations show strong constitutive ethylene-response phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), suggesting that subfamily 1 receptors are absolutely required to suppress ethylene responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and their functions cannot be replaced by subfamily 2 receptors. In tomato, the ERS1 type ethylene receptor NR is highly expressed in flowers at anthesis and during tomato ripening and the melon CmERS1 is important throughout fruit development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Payton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lashbrook <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In addition, reduction in the levels of the subfamily 2 ethylene receptors LeETR4 and LeETR6 causes an early-ripening phenotype and it therefore appears that different receptors are important at different stages of development. Furthermore, exposure of immature fruits to ethylene causes a reduction in the amount of receptor protein leading to earlier ripening, suggesting that ethylene receptor degradation controls the timing of tomato ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kevany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This indicates that receptor inactivation and degradation may also play important roles in ethylene signalling.</p><p>Ethylene receptors are individually regulated by different proteins. The ETR1 receptor is positively regulated by the membrane protein REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY1 (RTE1), and the function of RTE1 is primarily dependent on ETR1 and can be independent of the other receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Resnick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). ETR1 and RTE1 are co-localized in the ER and the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Recently, a TPR protein SlTPR1 has been shown to interact with the tomato ethylene receptors LeETR1 and NR in a yeast two-hybrid system and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and transgenic plants that overexpressed SlTPR1 displayed pleiotropic phenotypes related to ethylene and auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). The characterization of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> orthologue of SlTPR1, AtTRP1 (<underline>T</underline>etratricopeptide <underline>R</underline>epeat <underline>P</underline>rotein1) is reported here. AtTRP1 interacts preferentially with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ethylene receptor ERS1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. The interaction of AtTRP1 with ERS1 was confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> immunoprecipitation pull-down assays. Overexpression of the full-length AtTRP1 in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulted in dwarfed plants with reduced fertility and altered leaf/silique morphology, and enhanced expression of <italic>AtChiB</italic>. Expression of the same construct in the dominant ethylene insensitive receptor ETR1 mutant <italic>etr1-1</italic> altered aspects of the mutant phenotypes, such as stature and leaf/silique morphology, but did not affect the dominant ethylene insensitivity of the <italic>etr1-1</italic> mutants. The results suggested that AtTRP1 affects some ethylene responses, possibly via its association with the ethylene receptor ERS1, and that overexpression of AtTRP1 may affect cross-talk between ethylene and auxin signalling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Seeds of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (ecotype <italic>Columbia</italic> and the <italic>etr1-1</italic> mutant) were grown from homozygous lines.

A phylogenetic tree analysis using the full-length protein sequences of 91 TPR genes from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome as entry indicated AtTRP1 is distantly related to a group of immunophilin FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), such as TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1), PASTICCINO1 (PAS1), ROF1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyczynski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online, boxed). In addition to the C-terminal TPRs, FKBPs have N-terminal FKBP domains that are absent in the AtTRP1 protein. FKBPs belong to the superfamily of peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerases (PPIases) and catalyse the <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerization of <italic>cis</italic>-prolyl bonds. Mammalian FKBPs have been identified as targets of immunosuppressant drugs and are therefore classified as immunophilins. AtTRP1 has most similarity to TWD1 and PAS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). TWD1 contains one FKBP domain in its N-terminus, three TPRs from aa 170&#x02013;288, and a transmembrane domain in the C-terminal, which is absent in the AtTRP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). AtTRP1 shares 48% identity with TWD1 at the DNA level (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online) and 47% similarity at the amino acid level over the C-terminus that contains the TPR motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). TWD1 is plasma membrane-anchored and has been shown to interact physically with the multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters PGP1 and PGP19, and to control PGP-mediated auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Mutation in this gene resulted in twisted dwarf plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). PAS1 contains triple FKBP domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>) and is involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation during plant development. Mutations in the C-terminal region of PAS1 result in severe developmental defects.

The designation of <italic>AtTRP1</italic> is proposed for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene because <italic>AtTPR1</italic> is already in use. AtTRP1, like SlTPR1, is closely related to TTC1, a human TPR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) which links G-proteins and Ras signalling in mammalian cells and competes with Raf-1 for Ras-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). AtTRP1 shares overall 72% similarity to SlTPR1 and 52% to TTC1 at the protein sequence level. This sequence similarity between AtTRP1/SlTPR1 and TTC1 suggests that they may possess similar functions. Although no Ras-like proteins are found in plants, the interaction of AtTRP1 with the ethylene receptor may compete for receptor binding with CTR1, a Raf-like protein, and modulate ethylene signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Fig. 11.</label><caption><p>A model of AtTRP1 action.

These results were consistent with the Northern results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), but revealed more detail. The high level expression of AtTRP1 in those tissues and organs is consistent with this gene playing a role in a range of developmental processes.

The severity of the phenotypes was related to the level of the transgene expression: the stronger the expression, the greater the severity of the phenotypic effects. Line 2, with strongest transgene expression, was tiny, senesced early, and produced only a few seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Line 3, also with strong transgene expression, was unable to produce homozygous progeny, and other lines with lower transgene expression gave intermediate phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

Whether or not GA signalling was affected by overexpression of AtTRP1 in plants, however, requires further investigation. Etiolated transgenic seedlings overexpressing the full-length AtTRP1 were either smaller or displayed enhanced sensitivity to 0.5 &#x003bc;M ACC compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), and this was correlated with transgene expression. In the absence of ACC, etiolated seedlings of lines 2 and 3 displayed an enhanced ethylene response, with shortened and swollen hypocotyls and inhibited root growth, whereas lines 5 and 6, with intermediate transgene expression, were of normal size without ACC but produced shortened hypocotyls and roots in response to a low concentration of ACC. Light-grown seedlings overexpressing AtTRP1 also exhibited enhanced responses to 0.5 &#x003bc;M ACC compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). These results indicated that overexpression of AtTRP1 in plants resulted in enhanced ethylene sensitivity, although the transgenic seedlings did not always show swollen hypocotyls or exaggerated apical hooks.</p><p>Etiolated transgenic seedlings overexpressing AtTRP1 sometimes failed to form a typically exaggerated apical hook in response to ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). A possible explanation is that AtTRP1 also affects auxin responses. Apical hook formation is known to be regulated by both ethylene and auxin. Wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings grown in the presence of auxin or the auxin transport inhibitor 1-naphthylphthalamic acid display no hook and the auxin transport mutant <italic>aux1</italic> also disrupts hook formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). The &#x02018;<italic>hookless</italic>&#x02019; mutant is caused by mutation in <italic>HOOKLESS1</italic> (<italic>HLS1</italic>), and the expression of this gene was increased by ethylene treatment, and decreased in the ethylene-insensitive mutant <italic>ein2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lehman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Other phenotypes caused by overexpression of AtTRP1, including altered morphology of leaves and siliques, were also consistent with altered auxin signalling and responses. Indeed, the AtTRP1 overexpressors displayed less sensitivity to 0.3 &#x003bc;M IAA treatment and the expression of a subset of early auxin responsive genes was also altered (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S7</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Microarray experiments confirmed changes to several ethylene- and auxin-related mRNAs, including <italic>AtChitB</italic>, <italic>IAA5</italic>, <italic>SAUR-AC1</italic> (data not shown). This could result from altered auxin transport, sensitivity, or signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitelaw <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref> has shown that auxin movement in tomato plants is affected by the reduction in <italic>LeETR1</italic> transcript levels, indicating that cross-talk between ethylene signalling and auxin transport involves ethylene receptors.</p><p>The e<italic>tr1-1</italic> mutation, which changes Cys<sup>65</sup> to Tyr, abolishes ethylene binding to the receptor and causes dominant ethylene insensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleecker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>).

In contrast to overexpression of the same construct in the wild-type background, overexpression of AtTRP1 in <italic>etr1-1</italic> did not cause dwarfed phenotypes, nor change the ethylene insensitivity of the <italic>etr1-1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8E</xref>), suggesting that the mutant etr1-1 receptor may mask AtTRP1 function related to ethylene sensitivity.</p><p>Protein&#x02013;protein interaction analysis of AtTRP1 with ETR1 and ERS1 demonstrated that AtTRP1 was preferentially associated with ERS1 not ETR1 in yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). The association of AtTRP1 with the ERS1 receptor <italic>in vivo</italic> was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of the AtTRP1-GFP-ERS1 complex from cell membrane proteins with anti-GFP antibody and anti-NR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9E</xref>). This is consistent with the suggestion that AtTRP1 affects ethylene signalling through interaction with ERS1. However, specific antibodies against ERS1 and the other <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ethylene receptors are required in order to test the specificity of the interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although the NR antibody recognized the ERS1 monomer and dimer, only the dimer was co-immunoprecipitated with AtTRP1&#x02013;GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9E</xref>). These results suggest that the ERS1 receptor may function as a homodimer <italic>in vivo</italic> in terms of its association with AtTRP1, although at present the possibility of ERS1&#x02013;ETR1 heterodimer formation can not be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This association may also bring AtTRP1 to cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>), since there is no recognized membrane localization sequence in the AtTRP1 protein.</p><p>The physical association of AtTRP1 with ERS1, and phenotypic alterations caused by overexpression of AtTRP1, including growth retardation, reduced fertility, early senescence of line 2, enhanced responses to ACC, and increased accumulation of <italic>AtChitB</italic> mRNA, are all consistent with altered ethylene signalling. In addition, plants overexpressing AtTRP1 also show some auxin-related responses. It is proposed that overexpression of AtTRP1 <italic>in vivo</italic> results in inactivation or degradation of ERS1, or its disassociation from downstream interacting partners such as CTR1. This, in turn, would, either partially or completely, depending on the expression level, release the suppression of the ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>). It is known that the null mutation in ERS1 results in increased sensitivity to ethylene and that subfamily I receptors (ERS1 and ETR1) are absolutely required to suppress ethylene responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The degradation of ethylene receptors by the 26S proteasome/ubiquitin system, caused by ethylene binding, has been reported in tomato and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kevany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). AtTRP1/SlTPR1 could function as adaptors causing receptor degradation, resulting in enhanced ethylene responses, as proposed previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin <italic>et al.</italic> (2008<italic>b</italic>)</xref>. It is also possible that this has downstream effects on auxin and GA signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>). Ethylene is known to affect the stability of DELLA proteins and to reduce bioactive GA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Achard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003, 2007</xref>), and reduced ethylene receptor mRNA can alter auxin movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitelaw <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Any model for AtTRP1 action should take into account the binding to ERS1 and modulation of some, but not all ethylene, auxin, and GA-related responses. The fact that AtTRP1 binds only ERS1 may explain some of the results, since it is now becoming clear that different ethylene receptors may have different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Resnick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kevany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). AtTRP1 might also interact directly with auxin signalling components or transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>). This possibility is suggested by the similarity of AtTRP1 with TWD1 and PAS1, which are involved in auxin transport or trafficking in responses to auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyczynski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, it is not clear whether AtTRP1 acts solely through ERS1 or in concert with other proteins, and the exact function of SlTPR1/AtTRP1 remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Subcellular studies of AtTRP1&#x02013;GFP fusion protein by confocal microscopy and immunodetection indicated that the protein was localized in the plasma and nuclear membranes, and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>), a similar localization to that found for the tomato orthologue SlTPR1. This is intriguing since various subcellular localizations of ethylene receptors have been reported, including the ER, the Golgi apparatus, and the plasma and nuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This may suggest that the ethylene receptors are involved in movement or trafficking in response to diverse developmental and environmental cues. Although our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the ERS1 receptor was pulled-down with AtTRP1 in the membrane fraction, this does not exclude the possibility that protein interactions may occur in the cytosol, since the melon CmERS1 ethylene receptor is topologically anchored at the ER membrane via its N-terminal transmembrane domains, but its C-terminal domains face the cytosol, and could interact with proteins located in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Further studies are required to unveil the mechanisms whereby AtTRP1/SlTPR1 binds to specific ethylene receptors and perhaps other proteins, and modulates hormone effects and signalling, as a step towards understanding the complexity of hormone interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Table S1.</ext-link></bold> Putative <italic>cis</italic>-elements present in the AtTRP1 promoter sequence.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Table S2.</ext-link></bold> Responses of light-grown seedlings to exogenous IAA.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1.</ext-link></bold> Phylogenetic tree analysis to determine the relationship between AtTRP1 and other TPR proteins.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2.</ext-link></bold> DNA sequence alignment of AtTRP1 and TWD1.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp209/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3.</ext-link></bold> (A) Construct to overexpress the N-terminal region of AtTRP1 used for this study.
