Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), a cytokine required for the differentiation of monocyte lineage cells, promotes the formation of high-density vessel networks in tumors and therefore possesses therapeutic potential as an M-CSF inhibitor. However, the physiological role of M-CSF in vascular and lymphatic development, as well as the precise mechanisms underlying the antiangiogenic effects of M-CSF inhibition, remains unclear. Moreover, therapeutic potential of M-CSF inhibition in other neovascular diseases has not yet been evaluated. We used <italic>osteopetrotic</italic> (<italic>op/op</italic>) mice to demonstrate that M-CSF deficiency reduces the abundance of LYVE-1<sup>+</sup> and LYVE1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, resulting in defects in vascular and lymphatic development. In ischemic retinopathy, M-CSF was required for pathological neovascularization but was not required for the recovery of normal vasculature. In mouse osteosarcoma, M-CSF inhibition effectively suppressed tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and it disorganized extracellular matrices. In contrast to VEGF blockade, interruption of M-CSF inhibition did not promote rapid vascular regrowth. Continuous M-CSF inhibition did not affect healthy vascular and lymphatic systems outside tumors. These results suggest that M-CSF&#x02013;targeted therapy is an ideal strategy for treating ocular neovascular diseases and cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Pathological angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer and various inflammatory conditions including ocular neovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Recent studies have led to the discovery of a growing number of antiangiogenic molecules, some of which are already being evaluated in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The most established approach for limiting pathological angiogenesis involves blockade of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>); however, several studies have shown that VEGF blockade damages healthy vessels and results in toxic side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and that interrupting the VEGF blockade induces rapid vascular regrowth in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Clinical trials involving patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration have shown that VEGF blockade has limited effectiveness in some patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Therefore, several groups have explored other targets that could potentially be combined with VEGF blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In particular, tumor-associated hematopoietic cells are thought to be a promising therapeutic target, especially neutralizing Bv8, which promotes both tissue-specific angiogenesis and hematopoietic cell mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>Macrophage CSF (M-CSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) is a cytokine required for the differentiation of monocyte lineage cells (e.g., tissue macrophages, osteoclasts, and microglia) during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Although greatly reduced numbers of monocyte lineage cells are present in <italic>osteopetrotic</italic> (<italic>op/op</italic>) mutant mice (i.e., mice that possess a mutant <italic>csf-1</italic> gene encoding M-CSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), the potential effects on angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis have not been evaluated. Recent studies suggest that M-CSF plays a key role in the formation of high-density vessel networks and acts as an &#x0201c;angiogenic switch&#x0201d; in a mouse model of mammary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). The inhibition of M-CSF by antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, or blocking antibodies suppresses the growth of human mammary tumor xenografts in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Clodronate liposome, a reagent for depleting macrophages, also inhibits tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the role of M-CSF in tumor progression, particularly with regards to tumor lymphangiogenesis and tumor selectivity, have not been fully dissected.</p><p>Osteosarcoma, the most common primary bone tumor, is defined as a malignant tumor derived from mesenchymal or stromal cells with highly metastatic capacities, particularly in the lung and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Multimodal treatment, often consisting of aggressive chemotherapy combined with radical surgical resection (e.g., limb amputation), has traditionally been the mainstay of osteosarcoma management; however, the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients has not improved significantly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Lack of an appropriate animal model for human osteosarcoma has hampered the development of an effective antiosteosarcoma therapy.</p><p>In this study, we used <italic>op/op</italic> mice to demonstrate that M-CSF contributes to both vascular and lymphatic development. Furthermore, our data show that M-CSF is required for retinal pathological neovascularization but not for the maintenance of stable adult vasculature or lymphatics. Using a newly established mouse model of osteosarcoma, we show that M-CSF inhibition selectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. In contrast to VEGF blockade, the interruption of M-CSF inhibition does not promote rapid tumor regrowth. These findings indicate that M-CSF&#x02013;targeted therapy is an ideal strategy for the treatment of ocular neovascular diseases and cancer.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>M-CSF contributes to developmental vascular remodeling but not to maintenance of adult vasculature</title><p>Postnatal retinal vascular development, a widely used model for studying sprouting angiogenesis, can be used to study pathological angiogenesis (e.g., the formation of blood vessels in tumors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). We first characterized macrophages in a retinal angiogenesis model. Macrophages stained with Mac-1 were found in avascular and vascularized areas and were readily distinguished from desmin-stained pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Active vascular remodeling takes place in capillary areas during the pruning of vascular capillary components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Macrophages in these areas had large expanded cytoplasms and contained vesicles positive for PECAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) in contrast to the lean bodies observed in arterial areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Immunostaining of laminin revealed the presence of basal lamina between macrophages and pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We then examined several angiogenic factors and were unable to detect VEGF in macrophages via in situ hybridization (ISH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Furthermore, abundant matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) and MMP-2 (not depicted) expression was detected on the cell surfaces of macrophages. Both of these MMPs are macrophage-derived proteases that work with modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as fibronectin, to remodel vascular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Macrophages contribute to programmed cell death in temporary hyaloid vessels via Wnt7b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>); however, their role in the formation of retinal vascular plexus has not yet been clarified. Therefore, we examined the role of M-CSF in developmental angiogenesis by examining the retinal vascular structures of <italic>op/op</italic> mice, which lack macrophages stained with Mac-1, F4/80, CD45, or isolectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). By postnatal day (P) 2, branching was reduced in the vascular plexus of the <italic>op/op</italic> retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A, B, and K</xref>), but the numbers of endothelial tip cells and filopodia (which are regulated by VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>]) were comparable to those in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>). Vascular defects in the <italic>op/op</italic> retina were also detected on P4, as shown by significantly reduced branching and insufficient arterial-venous patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C, D, and K</xref>). The reduced branching observed in <italic>op/op</italic> mice recovered as development progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 K</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081605/DC1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). 3 mo after birth, the vasculature of <italic>op/op</italic> retinas was comparable to that in +/+ retinas (Fig. S1, C and D). We then investigated the mechanisms underlying vascular impairment in the <italic>op/op</italic> retina. Although VEGF expression remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>), the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>) was decreased in the <italic>op/op</italic> retina. Presumably because of this decreased proteinase activity, <italic>op/op</italic> retina showed disordered fibronectin architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>). To examine the function of M-CSF in the postnatal developing retina, wild-type mice were systemically treated with a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor specific for c-fms (Ki20227) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>) or intraocularly injected with anti&#x02013;c-fms neutralizing antibodies (AFS98) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) during the postnatal stage. Both treatments significantly reduced branching by P4, but the number of endothelial tip cells was comparable to that in control mice (i.e., mice treated with vehicle alone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, L&#x02013;P</xref>). The reduction rate for branching points was greater in response to M-CSF inhibition than in response to M-CSF deficiency, suggesting that some form of compensation occurs in the postnatal <italic>op/op</italic> retina. When retinas were treated with Ki20227/anti&#x02013;c-fms antibodies, macrophages decreased in number and exhibited insufficient stellate morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, L&#x02013;P</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that M-CSF contributes to developmental vascular remodeling independently of VEGF but does not contribute to the maintenance of adult vasculature.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of macrophages in the developing retina.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Triple immunohistochemistry (IHC) of Mac-1 (green), desmin (red), and PECAM-1 (blue) within the P4 retina (representative images of three independent experiments).

The OIR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) is a widely used system to examine ocular neovascularization, a condition which resembles proliferative diabetic retinopathy in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In this model, the central area of established vasculature is obliterated by hyperoxic insult, creating an ischemic area. After mice are returned to room air, revascularization occurs and the normal vasculature is recovered, although some vessels (i.e., neovascular tufts [NVTs]) proliferate abnormally toward the vitreous body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Increased expression of <italic>csf-1</italic>,<italic> vegf-a</italic>, and the c-fms receptor (<italic>csfr-1</italic>) was observed during neovascularization in the OIR model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B&#x02013;D</xref>). In addition, <italic>csfr-1</italic> expression was higher in FACS-sorted Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells than in Mac1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>), suggesting that <italic>csfr-1</italic> is specific to macrophages. These data also indicate that <italic>csfr-1</italic> expression in tissues largely reflects the number of macrophages. There was no significant difference in the vaso-obliterated areas of wild-type and <italic>op/op</italic> retina on P11 in the OIR model (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081605/DC1">Fig. S2, A, B, E, F, and I</ext-link>), suggesting that vascular resistance to hyper oxygen insult was not altered in <italic>op/op</italic> retina. Similarly, Ki20227 treatment did not alter vascular resistance to hyper oxygen insult (Fig. S2, C, D, G, H, and J). On P16, the <italic>op/op</italic> retina exhibited a dramatic decrease in NVTs but an increase in physiological revascularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, F&#x02013;I and V</xref>). To confirm the role of M-CSF in neovascularization, wild-type mice were systemically treated with Ki20227 or intraocularly injected with anti&#x02013;c-fms neutralizing antibodies during neovascularization. Both avascular and NVT areas dramatically decreased in response to these treatments, relative to mice treated with vehicle or control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, J&#x02013;O and V</xref>). The number of macrophages surrounding NVT areas dramatically decreased in mice treated with Ki20227/anti&#x02013;c-fms antibodies, as well as in <italic>op/op</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, R&#x02013;U</xref> [quantification not depicted]).

Furthermore, we show that M-CSF is required for pathological neovascularization but not for the recovery of normal vasculature in OIR. Deficiency in M-CSF does not affect the maintenance of stable adult vasculature and lymphatics. In mice with osteosarcoma, M-CSF inhibition selectively suppressed tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and decreased tumor regrowth after the interruption of treatment.</p><p>Our data showing the highly specific effects of M-CSF inhibition on pathological angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are supported by the observation that no detectable abnormalities in adult vascular and lymphatic systems were found in <italic>op/op</italic> mice. In contrast to the effects of VEGF blockade, interruption of M-CSF inhibition did not promote rapid tumor regrowth but rather improved the prognosis relative to treatment with a vehicle. This difference might be a result of the effects of M-CSF inhibition on the &#x0201c;sleeves&#x0201d; of the basement membrane. These so-called sleeves are conserved during VEGF blockade and assist with rapid vascular regrowth in primary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The physiological role of retinal macrophages in developmental vascular remodeling, but not in angiogenic sprouting, suggests that M-CSF inhibition and VEGF blockade target different factors. Indeed, the tumor-suppressive effects of M-CSF inhibition are independent of VEGF signaling. Furthermore, a recent study showed that tumor refractoriness to anti-VEGF treatment is mediated by Mac-1<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), suggesting that M-CSF&#x02013;targeted therapy may serve as a useful secondary therapy in patients who are resistant to VEGF blockade.</p><p>We showed that retinal macrophages express high levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 but not VEGF. These expression patterns are thought to reflect the vascular defects in <italic>op/op</italic> mice, which are characterized by normal sprouting angiogenesis and impaired vascular remodeling. Although VEGF plays a critical role in angiogenic sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), MMP-2 and MMP-9 are gelatinase proteinases with overlapping substrates (e.g., fibronectin) that function together in some situations such as aortic aneurysms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). One of the major questions in our study is whether disordered fibronectin architecture, which is presumably caused by the absence of macrophage MMP-2 and MMP-9, is the primary cause of vascular defects in <italic>op/op</italic> mice. However, the precise function of specific proteinases is generally difficult to discern because of the considerable redundancy of these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). In fact, MMP-9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit normal vascular development and normal ECM structures in their developing retina (unpublished data), which is in contrast to the dramatically decreased NVTs observed in the OIR model. Clinical observations of diabetic microvessels in humans have revealed that disordered fibronectin structures are the earliest events preceding various capillary defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). These observations also support the idea that disordered fibronectin architecture accounts for defects associated with impaired vascular remodeling in the <italic>op/op</italic> retina.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that M-CSF/c-fms signaling promotes the differentiation of circulating monocytes into macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). However, abundant c-fms expression by LYVE-1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and defective postnatal lymphangiogenesis in <italic>op/op</italic> mice suggests that M-CSF also acts on LYVE-1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and lymphangiogenesis. The link between the absence of LYVE1<sup>+</sup> cells and reduced lymphangiogenesis may be explained by reductions in the secretion of VEGF-C, VEGF&#x02013;D, or other inflammatory cytokines by LYVE1<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). The significant contribution of BM-derived lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells to lymphangiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) may be responsible for this link.</p><p>Other than M-CSF/c-fms signaling, VEGF/Flt1 signaling significantly contributes to the recruitment of macrophages and tumor progression in various cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). In our osteosarcoma model (in which tumor cells expressed high levels of M-CSF, just as in human osteosarcoma), deficiency in Flt1 tyrosine kinase did not significantly affect tumor progression. These data suggest that tumor progression depends primarily on M-CSF/c-fms signaling rather than on VEGF/Flt1 signaling. In addition, the <italic>Vegfr1 tk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in the OIR model did not experience a significant reduction in the amount of NVT or in the number of recruited macrophages (unpublished data). However, decreases in the number of tumor-associated macrophages observed in <italic>Vegfr1 tk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in other cancer models suggest that VEGF/Flt1 signaling plays an important role in the recruitment of macrophages and that Flt1-targeted therapy also holds potential as a tumor-selective strategy. It would be interesting to determine the extent to which M-CSF/c-fms or VEGF/Flt1 signaling affects macrophage recruitment in various other cancer models.</p><p>Overall, our data show that M-CSF inhibition efficiently suppresses pathological angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in mice with ischemic retinopathy and osteosarcoma.

Metastatic lesions were enumerated by counting detectable GFP<sup>+</sup> masses under a fluorescent microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Intraocular injections.</title><p>Injections into the vitreous body were performed using 33-gauge needles, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Approximately 1 mg/ml AFS98 or an isotype-matched irrelevant rat IgG dissolved in &#x0223c;50 nl of sterile PBS was injected on P1 or P12 (OIR).</p></sec><sec><title>Lymphangiography.</title><p>Functional lymphatic vessels were visualized by injecting 20 &#x000b5;l of Evans blue dye (5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) into the hindlimb footpad or the ear, and lymphatic vessels were analyzed via light microscopy. In preparation for the tumor dye efflux experiment, we injected 50 &#x000b5;l of Evans blue dye into tumors and sacrificed animals 2 h later. Approximately 100 mg of tumors were dissected and incubated in 1 ml formamide (to extract the Evans blue dye), and the absorbency was measured at OD600 using a spectrophotometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis.</title><p>Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells and reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system using the TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and a TaqMan Gene Expression Assay mixture containing <italic>csf-1</italic> (Mm00432688_m1), <italic>csfr-1</italic> (Mm00432689_m1), or <italic>vegf-a</italic> (Mm00437304_m1). A mouse &#x003b2;-actin (Mm00607939_s1) mixture served as an endogenous control. Data were analyzed using 7500 Fast System SDS Software 1.3.1. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate and a mean was obtained for each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>FACS analysis.</title><p>Dissected tracheas were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min in DMEM containing 1% collagenase <sc>d</sc> (from <italic>Clostridium histolyticum</italic>; Roche) before dissociation by gentle trituration. Harvested cells were immunostained, followed by purification and analysis using the FACSVantage (BD).</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal microscopy.</title><p>Fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV1000; Olympus). Scanning was performed in sequential laser emission mode to avoid scanning at other wavelengths. Cells or substances of interest were quantified in eight (200 &#x000b5;m &#x000d7; 200 &#x000b5;m) fields of view per sample in each scanned image, and the mean of eight fields was determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Results were expressed as means &#x000b1; SD. The means of two groups were compared using a two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test. P-values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material.</title><p>Fig. S1 shows normal vascular structure in <italic>op/op</italic> mice at P8 and P90. Fig. S2 shows that M-CSF deficiency or M-CSF inhibition does not affect vaso-obliteration in OIR model. Fig. S3 shows that various embryonic tissues in <italic>op/op</italic> mice exhibit normal lymphangiogenesis but lacked LYVE-1<sup>+</sup> macrophages.
