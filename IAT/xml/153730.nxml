This is accomplished by the ability of the TFIIIB subunit, TFII<underline>B</underline>-<underline>r</underline>elated <underline>f</underline>actor (Brf1), to make stable protein&#x02013;protein interactions with TATA-binding protein (TBP) and place it on the promoter-less upstream DNA. Unlike traditional model organisms, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> tRNA and 5S rRNA genes contain upstream TATA promoters that are required to program functional pol III initiation complexes. In this study we demonstrate that <italic>S.pombe</italic> (Sp)Brf does not form stable interactions with TBP in the absence of DNA using approaches that do reveal stable association of TBP and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (Sc)Brf1. Gel mobility analyses demonstrate that a TBP&#x02013;TATA DNA complex can recruit SpBrf to a Pol III promoter. Consistent with this, overproduction of SpBrf in <italic>S.pombe</italic> increases the expression of a TATA-dependent, but not a TATA-less, suppressor tRNA gene. Since previous whole genome analysis also revealed TATA elements upstream of tRNA genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, this pathway may be more widespread than appreciated previously.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotes, Pol I synthesizes large ribosomal rRNA (35S-45S depending on the species), Pol II synthesizes mRNAs and some small nuclear (sn)RNAs (e.g. U1, U2), and Pol III synthesizes mostly tRNAs and 5S rRNA, as well as U6 snRNA and few other non-protein coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c1">1</xref>). Pols I, II and III all require TATA-binding protein (TBP) or a closely related protein for initiation even though some of the target genes do not contain the sequence-specific TBP-binding site, TATAAA (or closely related sequences, referred to as a TATA box or element) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c3">3</xref>). In the absence of a TATA element, other factors bring TBP to the promoter via protein&#x02013;protein interactions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c5">5</xref>). A second highly conserved initiation factor, TFIIB, exhibits very weak interactions with TBP in the absence of DNA, but recognizes the TBP&#x02013;TATA DNA complex with substantially higher affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c7">7</xref>). TFIIB and TFII<underline>B</underline>-<underline>r</underline>elated <underline>f</underline>actors (e.g. Brf1) are multifunctional proteins of central importance that interact with several other factors, help determine the start site of transcription, participate in promoter melting and select the appropriate Pol for transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c13">13</xref>). TFIIB is used by Pol II, Brf1 is used by Pol III for tRNA and 5S rRNA (TATA-less) genes, and a distinct protein, Brf2, is used by Pol III for human U6 and related type 3 genes that contain TATA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c16">16</xref>).</p><p>The classical Pol III promoters that characterize the hundreds-to-thousands of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes in the traditionally studied eukaryotes use internal (i.e. downstream of transcription start site) promoter elements to initiate the process of transcription complex assembly. The assembly factor TFIIIC binds to the tRNA internal control elements and initiates protein&#x02013;protein interactions that result in the deposition of TBP onto the TATA-less upstream DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c20">20</xref>). Thus, direct association with Brf1 allows TBP to bind the upstream TATA-less DNA, even if it is comprised of only G and C residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c21">21</xref>). In addition to the TATA-less pathway of TBP recruitment, this TBP&#x02013;Brf1 arrangement can also support TFIIIC-independent transcription by Pol III, <italic>in vitro</italic>, via direct recruitment of TBP by the TATA elements of the single U6 gene and the four TATA-containing tRNA genes (of a total of 274 tRNA genes) that can be found in the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Characterization of the Pol III transcription system in the fission yeast <italic>S.pombe</italic> has revealed, among other things, that all of its Pol III-dependent genes appear to contain upstream TATA sequences as one element of their multipartite promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c28">28</xref>). Upstream TATAs were shown to be required for functional tRNA expression in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and for 5S rRNA synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>). It is important to note for the purposes of this discussion that although a small number of TATA-containing tRNA genes from traditional organisms are known to exist, those that have been studied in great detail represent rare exceptions which in most cases characterize highly specialized tRNA genes (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>). In contrast to this, all tRNA and 5S genes appear to contain upstream TATA elements in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>). In the present study we examine the TBP-binding characteristics of SpBrf that are associated with the requirement for TATA elements in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p><p>Although a prior study demonstrated that SpBrf co-purified with SpPol III and SpTFIIIC, while SpTBP did not, it did not assess the potential for interaction between TBP and Brf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>). Because this potential would appear to be an issue of central importance to the requirement for upstream TATA elements, it was examined in detail. Here we show that SpBrf and SpTBP do not stably associate <italic>in vitro</italic> nor are they found associated in extracts, as monitored by co-immunoprecipitation (IP), but that they can form a complex with TATA-containing DNA. The results indicate an innate insufficiency of SpBrf to bring TBP to the upstream DNA and that this represents a novel characteristic of the Pol III system in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. While similar insufficiency would be detrimental in organisms with TATA-less Pol III genes, in <italic>S.pombe</italic> this is balanced by the ubiquitous TATA elements that are precisely positioned upstream of the Pol III-transcribed genes in this yeast. Since a whole genome survey of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> also revealed TATA elements upstream of its tRNA genes, the Pol III transcription complex assembly pathway described here may be more widespread in nature than appreciated previously, and also suggests that it may represent an ancient eukaryotic Pol III transcription system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>The yeast strains used are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg301tb1">1</xref>.

Moreover, the SpPol III complex also contained SpBdp1 (formerly known as spB&#x0201d;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c32">32</xref>), suggesting that SpTBP might not form stable association with SpBrf even if the other known component of TFIIIB, Bdp1, was also present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>). As one approach to more closely examine the potential for interaction between SpTBP and SpBrf, we modified the <italic>S.pombe brf1</italic> gene to encode a SpBrf fusion protein with a C-terminal tag containing three HA epitopes, in a haploid strain designated yMW2. The structure of the integrated construct was confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting (data not shown), which indicated that the single copy of <italic>brf1</italic> was replaced by <italic>brf1-HA</italic> as summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f1">1</xref>A. This <italic>brf1</italic> gene modification caused no appreciable difference in growth rate of yMW2 at 32 or 37&#x000b0;C as compared with the control strain, yAS50, in the appropriate growth conditions (not shown).</p><p>Extracts prepared from yMW2 and yAS50 were subjected to IP by anti-HA followed by western blotting using anti-HA, anti-SpBrf and anti-SpTBP for detection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f1">1</xref>B&#x02013;D). The inputs (lanes 1 and 3) and IPs (lanes 2 and 4) were examined. Anti-HA detected a protein of the expected size in yMW2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f1">1</xref>B, lane 3) but not yAS50 (lane 1), as expected. Anti-SpBrf recognized endogenous SpBrf in yAS50 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f1">1</xref>C, lane 1) and the slower migrating SpBrf-HA in yMW2 (lane 3). Most significantly, although SpTBP was readily detectable in yAS50 and yMW2, it was not co-immunoprecipitated with SpBrf-HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f1">1</xref>D, lane 4).</p><p>It was possible that although SpBrf-HA supported normal growth, the HA tag might interfere with interaction with SpTBP. To address this, we performed co-IP using anti-SpBrf antibodies (Abs) and examined them for the presence of SpTBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>A and B). Anti-SpBrf specifically immunoprecipitated SpBrf and SpBrf-HA from yAS50 and yMW2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>A, lanes 3 and 6) while pre-immune serum did not (lanes 2 and 5). Again, while SpTBP was readily detectable in the extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>B, lanes 1 and 4), it was not co-immunoprecipitated with either SpBrf or SpBrf-HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>B, lanes 3 and 6).</p><p>In a reciprocal approach, we examined anti-SpTBP IPs for the presence of SpBrf and SpBrf-HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>C and D). Anti-SpTBP Abs immunoprecipitated SpTBP while pre-immune Abs did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>C, lanes 3 and 6). While SpBrf and SpBrf-HA were readily detectable in the input (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>D, lanes 1 and 4, respectively), neither was co-immunoprecipitated with SpTBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>D, lanes 3 and 6). Two previously characterized TAF<sub>II</sub>s referred to as pTR6 and TAF130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c34">34</xref>), were readily detectable in the anti-SpTBP co-IP as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>E and F). This indicated that the deficiencies of SpBrf and SpBrf-HA to associate with SpTBP were not due to a general failure of the co-IP protocol. Moreover, since TAF<sub>II</sub>s are less abundant than Brf1 in some yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c35">35</xref>), the lack of detectable SpBrf in the TBP co-IP would appear to be significant. These data demonstrate that TBP and Brf1 are not stably associated in extracts of <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p><p>We also asked if TBP and Bdp1 are associated in <italic>S.pombe</italic> by reciprocal IP and western blotting. While the corresponding antisera efficiently precipitated the cognate polypeptide, in both cases the other protein was not detected in the IP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>G and H). This suggested that TBP and Bdp1 are not stably associated in extracts of <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Insufficiency to stably associate with SpTBP in the absence of DNA is inherent to SpBrf</title><p>Because the data suggested the possibility that Brf1 might be innately deficient in recognition of free TBP, we examined the potential for purified recombinant TBP and Brf1 proteins to interact <italic>in vitro</italic>. Protein mixtures were subjected to anti-TBP co-IP, and the inputs (In) and immunoprecipited material were examined by western blotting. We included ScTBP and ScBrf1 with each other as positive controls and with the reciprocal <italic>S.pombe</italic> proteins, to provide additional information. The experiments in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A and B differed only with regard to whether SpTBP or ScTBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A and B, respectively) and the corresponding affinity-purified Abs for IP were used.</p><p>The most relevant finding in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A and B is that while ScBrf1 was co-immunoprecipited with TBP (lanes 9), SpBrf was not (lanes 6). To confirm this and exclude the possibility that our SpBrf preparation might contain an inhibitor that would generally block TBP&#x02013;Brf1 interaction, co-IP experiments were performed with SpBrf, ScBrf1 and TBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A and B, lanes 10 and 11). ScBrf1 but not SpBrf could be co-immunoprecipitated with either SpTBP or ScTBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A and B, lanes 11). This indicated that SpBrf competes poorly if at all for TBP binding and suggests that it is innately limited in the ability to stably associate with TBP. Consistent with the above results, we noted that a small amount of ScBrf1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-SpTBP in the absence of exogenous TBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A, lane 8, upper panel). Upon close examination, this appeared to be due to the presence of TBP, as a contaminant, in the anti-SpTBP Ab preparation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A, lower panel, lane 8) that probably leeched from the TBP-matrix during affinity purification of our anti-SpTBP Abs. However, it should be noted that while similar low level TBP was also present in lane 5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A, lower panel), in this case, SpBrf was not co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref>A, lane 5, upper panel). The cumulative data suggest that either ScTBP or SpTBP could associate with ScBrf1 but that neither could stably associate with SpBrf. Interaction between SpTBP and ScBrf1 was not unexpected since SpTBP could fully complement the null mutation in the ScTBP gene, <italic>SPT15</italic>, in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c36">36</xref>). The data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f3">3</xref> supported the results obtained in <italic>S.pombe</italic> extract (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f2">2</xref>). We conclude that the inability to detect association between SpTBP and SpBrf reflects an innate insufficiency of Brf1 to stably interact with TBP in the absence of DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Recognition of TBP&#x02013;TATA DNA by SpBrf</title><p>To test the ability of SpBrf to associate with a TBP&#x02013;TATA DNA complex, we performed EMSA with both ScTBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f4">4</xref>A) and SpTBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f4">4</xref>B). TBP formed a complex with the TATA-containing probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f4">4</xref>, filled arrowheads, lanes 2) that was competed by an excess of unlabeled TATA-containing DNA but not with DNA that contained mutations of the TATA sequence, demonstrating that the interaction was specific (not shown). Addition of either ScBrf1 or SpBrf led to complexes of slower mobility (open arrowheads, lanes 3&#x02013;12), similar to what has been reported for ScBrf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c38">38</xref>). We note that the DNA&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;Brf complex can be further super-shifted by recombinant B&#x0201d; (data not shown), suggesting that the low mobility band contains TBP and Brf. In contrast to the ability of full length SpBrf to associate with the TBP&#x02013;TATA complex, a purified recombinant fragment (SpBrf amino acids 1&#x02013;383) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c20">20</xref>) that corresponds to the TFIIB-homologous region of SpBrf plus the Brf-homologous region 1, but lacks Brf homologous regions 2 and 3, failed to associate to any notable degree (data not shown).</p><p>We noted that in some experiments, ScBrf1 led to a more distinct TBP&#x02013;DNA&#x02013;Brf1 complex than did SpBrf, the latter of which produced more of a smear (e.g. compare lanes 6 and 12). This suggested that SpBrf may form a less stable complex with TBP&#x02013;DNA as compared with ScBrf1, although this was not examined exhaustively. In any case, the positive EMSA results revealed that SpBrf is capable of specific recognition of a TBP&#x02013;TATA DNA complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Overproduction of SpBrf increases expression from a TATA-dependent tRNA gene in <italic>S.pombe</italic></title><p>We characterized previously a system to examine tRNA expression in <italic>S.pombe</italic> in which Pol III-mediated expression of the opal suppressor tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M gene can be monitored by suppression of <italic>ade6-704</italic> and a resulting decrease in red pigment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c25">25</xref>). In this system, increased levels of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M transcripts lead to increased suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c25">25</xref>), dependent on the TATA element located upstream of the tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>). For the present study, we developed a modified version of this suppression system to serve as a reporter for SpBrf function. We developed strain yAS78, which harbors the TATA-dependent allele, tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M-7T, and produces an attenuated suppressor that results in partial suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c25">25</xref>). In this system, overproduction of SpBrf might lead to increased transcription of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M-7T and suppression of yAS78. For this purpose, SpBrf DNA was cloned into the <italic>S.pombe</italic> expression vector, pRep93X, whose promoter is repressed by the addition of exogenous thiamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c39">39</xref>).</p><p>Transformation of yAS78 with pRep93X-SpBrf led to strain yTM2a (yYH1), which exhibited increased suppression in the absence of thiamin but not in the presence of thiamin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f5">5</xref>A). Concordant with this, western blotting demonstrated overproduction of SpBrfp in the absence of thiamin and repression in the presence of thiamin as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f5">5</xref>B). As a control for loading, we also probed the western blot for spLa protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f5">5</xref>C). The results established that thiamin-sensitive overproduction of SpBrf was specific and that it could stimulate tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub> M-mediated suppression. Attempts to activate suppression by overproduction of SpBrfp in strains carrying a tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub> gene with a mutated TATA sequence (GGATCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>) were unsuccessful (not shown). The results indicate that SpBrf stimulates tRNA expression from TATA-containing but not TATA-less tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M genes. In addition to demonstrating its Pol III-related activity, the results also indicate that the <italic>in vivo</italic> level of SpBrfp may be a critical determinant of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M expression in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A conclusion of this work is that SpBrf is innately insufficient to associate with TBP in the absence of DNA. Nonetheless SpBrf can be recruited to a TBP&#x02013;TATA complex and function in TATA-dependent transcription by Pol III. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of Pol III transcription in <italic>S.pombe</italic> as it can account for the need for the TATA sequences that appear upstream of all tRNA and 5S rRNA genes in this yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>). These results reflect a concerted diversion of two components of a bipartite transcription control mechanism in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, the <italic>cis</italic>-acting element (TATA) and the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that recognize it (TBP), that distinguish it from other model systems. That the upstream TATA elements appear to functionally compensate for the inability of SpBrf to associate with TBP in <italic>S.pombe</italic> provides a natural species-wide illustration of the compensatory function of <italic>cis</italic> elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors in Pol III transcription initiation. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the vast majority of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes do not contain TATA elements, and an important function of Brf1 in this organism, that is lacking in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, is to bring TBP to the upstream DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c16">16</xref>). From these observations it seems reasonable to infer that differences in the ability to associate with TBP in the absence of DNA is a species-specific characteristic of Brf1 that primarily reflects a compensatory mechanism to accommodate the Pol III promoters in these yeasts.</p><p>It is interesting to note that historically, TATA elements were first found upstream of mRNA genes and considered as hallmarks of Pol II transcription. Recognition that U6 snRNA transcription required an upstream promoter established a role for TATA elements in Pol III transcription and led to the realization that all three eukaryotic Pols require TBP for initiation. Since an upstream TATA was shown to function in rRNA synthesis by Pol I in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>), it would since appear that all Pol I and Pol III-transcribed genes are TATA-containing in this yeast, as are most Pol II-transcribed genes. Therefore, it is noteworthy that the only known TATA-less promoters in fission yeast are those encoding (a subset of) mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c40">40</xref>).</p><sec><title>The expression level of SpBrf is a critical determinant of TATA-dependent tRNASerUGAM transcription in <italic>S.pombe</italic></title><p>Overproduction of plasmid-encoded SpBrf led to increased suppression of <italic>ade6-704</italic> by the suppressor gene, tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg301f5">5</xref>). Overproduction of SpBrf could not stimulate suppression from a tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M gene whose upstream TATA element had been altered by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition to providing evidence that our SpBrf construct is active, the results also indicate that the <italic>in vivo</italic> level of SpBrfp may be a critical determinant of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>UGA</sub>M transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. We note that in this regard SpBrf may be similar to ScBrf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c41">41</xref>).</p><p>We wish to emphasize that while our results fail to show SpBrf&#x02013;TBP interaction <italic>in vitro</italic>, and in dilute extracts, the possibility that these proteins may interact in the absence of DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> cannot be excluded. However, in this regard we note that the SpBrf overexpression studies indicate that although the intranuclear concentration of SpBrf is increased sufficiently to stimulate the TATA-containing tRNA suppressor gene, the TATA-less tRNA gene remains inactive. These results suggest that SpBrf cannot recruit TBP to the TATA-less promoter even when overexpressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Species-specificity and evolutionary divergence of SpBrf</title><p>The Brf1 proteins of human, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> are most homologous in their TFIIB-related N-terminal domains, and are less conserved in their C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c28">28</xref>). The N-terminal domain of Brf1 is homologous to the TFIIB core region, containing a predicted zinc-ribbon and two TFIIB repeats, while the C-terminal half is Brf1-specific, containing three conserved tracts referred to as Brf-homologous regions 1&#x02013;3 that are not present in TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c46">46</xref>). While both halves of ScBrf1 interact with TBP&#x02013;DNA, the C-terminal domain, especially Brf-homologous region 2, constitutes principal ScTBP interaction sites and is important for TFIIIB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c46">46</xref>). The C-terminal one-third of SpBrf is shorter than it is in ScBrf1 and HsBrf1, by 96 and 175 amino acids, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c29">29</xref>). The previously noted sequence tracts adjacent to the Brf-homology regions that are lacking in SpBrf relative to ScBrf1 and HsBrf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c29">29</xref>) are likely to contribute to the species-specific interactions of Brf1 with TBP in the absence of DNA.</p><p>It has been noted that TFIIB forms a complex with TBP&#x02013;DNA even though it only weakly associates with TBP in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c48">48</xref>). Multiple variables, including sequences surrounding the TATA sequence as well as species-specific regions of TBP, can determine the nature of the TFIIB&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;TATA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c51">51</xref>). As noted in the Results section above, the Brf-specific region of SpBrf is important for stable association with a TBP&#x02013;TATA DNA complex since truncation of SpBrf beyond amino acids 383 abrogates the association. More detailed future analyses may reveal specific regions of SpBrf that are important for the recognition of TBP&#x02013;TATA DNA.</p><p>It is noteworthy that although ScBrf1 can interact with SpTBP, data not shown indicate that its overproduction does not lead to increased tRNA expression in our suppression assay. Rather, ScBrf1 produced a dominant negative effect on suppression (not shown), perhaps because it squelches SpTBP. The results suggest that although ScBrf1 can interact with SpTBP, it cannot function with the Pol III machinery in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and suggests that the species-specific activities of Brf1 extend beyond its ability to interact with TBP.</p><p>It should be emphasized that this work focused primarily on one function of Brf1, its potential for TBP recruitment, and not other functions in Pol III transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c16">16</xref>). In this regard we note that since SpBrf is found associated with TFIIIC in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, it probably also functions to bridge TBP and TFIIIC, similar to <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, to provide direction to Pol III initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Compensatory divergence of Pol III promoters and their <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors</title><p>As alluded to above, the variety of Pol III promoters in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> appears more complex than in <italic>S.pombe</italic> since the former contains both TATA-less (most) and TATA-containing (i.e. U6 and four tRNA) Pol III-dependent genes. While in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, both TATA-less and TATA-containing promoters are accommodated by a single TFIIIB entity, the situation is more complex in higher eukaryotes. Most tRNA genes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> are TATA-less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c52">52</xref>) and TBP-related factor (TRF), rather than TBP, directs transcription of TATA-less tRNA genes by Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c53">53</xref>). In this case, TRF stably associates with Brf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c53">53</xref>). TBP-dependent tRNA transcription has also been observed in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c55">55</xref>), but for an unusual, TATA-containing tRNA gene (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c27">27</xref>). In the human Pol III system Brf1 and Brf2 are differentially used at the TATA-less and TATA-containing promoters represented by tRNA and U6 promoters, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg301c15">15</xref>). Thus, different mechanisms of compensation balance the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements with the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors to accommodate TATA-less Pol III transcription in various eukaryotes.
