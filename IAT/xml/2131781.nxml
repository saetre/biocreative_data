The molecular basis of this regulation is poorly understood, but the genes are particularly rich in CpG islands. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides; mutations in this protein also cause the neurodevelopmental disease called Rett syndrome. Because MHC class I molecules play a role in neuronal connectivity, we hypothesised that MeCP2 might repress MHC class I expression in the CNS and that this might play a role in the pathology of Rett syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>We show here that transiently transfected cells expressing high levels of MeCP2 specifically downregulate cell-surface expression of MHC class I molecules in the neuronal cell line N2A and they prevent the induction of MHC class I expression in response to interferon in these cells, supporting our first hypothesis. Surprisingly, however, overexpression of the mutated forms of MeCP2 that cause Rett syndrome had a similar effect on MHC class I expression as the wild-type protein. Immunohistological analyses of brain slices from <italic>MECP2</italic> knockout mice (the MeCP2<sup>tm1.1Bird</sup> strain) demonstrated a small but reproducible increase in MHC class I when compared to their wild type littermates, but we found no difference in MHC class I expression in primary cultures of mixed glial cells (mainly neurons and astrocytes) from the knockout and wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data suggest that high levels of MeCP2, such as those found in mature neurons, may contribute to the repression of MHC expression, but we find no evidence that MeCP2 regulation of MHC class I is important for the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in the X-linked gene <italic>MECP2</italic> cause Rett syndrome (RTT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Amir1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Bienvenu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that affects around 1 in 10,000 female births <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Percy1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Two studies have demonstrated that expression of MHC class I is dynamically regulated during the post-natal development of the CNS and that MHC class I expression is necessary for the activity-dependent synaptic rearrangements that occur during normal brain development and for normal synaptic plasticity in the mature hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Corriveau1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Huh1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is believed to protect nervous tissue, which regenerates poorly, from cytotoxic attack by the immune system. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that MHC class I is expressed in specific areas of the mature brain, as well as during brain development, and they evoke a function for MHC class I molecules in neuronal signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Huh1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Syken1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-LeindersZufall1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that, rather than being simply shut down, MHC class I genes must be very finely regulated throughout the CNS by activators and inhibitors that, on the one hand, allow their function during development and, on the other hand, ensure their silencing in the majority of neurons in which their expression could be detrimental.</p><p>We reasoned that misregulated expression of MHC class I in the brain due to mutations in MeCP2 might disturb the establishment and maintenance of neuronal connections and remodelling in the hippocampus during early child development and thus account for the neurodevelopmental disorders of RTT. We therefore investigated whether MHC class I gene expression is under the control of MeCP2 in neuronal cell lines in culture and whether MHC class I gene expression is affected in <italic>MECP2</italic> knockout mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overexpression of MeCP2 downregulates basal MHC class I</title><p>To investigate whether MeCP2 represses MHC class I expression, we transfected the murine neuronal cell line N2A with pCMX plasmids that transiently express either human or murine MeCP2<italic>A</italic>. Forty-eight hours after transfection, we evaluated by flow cytometry the cell surface levels of K<sup>k</sup>, L<sup>d</sup> and D<sup>d</sup> (the three &#x02018;classical&#x02019; MHC class I molecule heavy chains expressed by N2A), <italic>&#x003b2;-</italic>2-microglobulin (the light chain subunit of MHC class I) and, as control, the transferrin receptor, a cell surface glycoprotein of similar size and half-life to MHC molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001354-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The expression of MeCP2 in transfected cells was detected by a rabbit anti-MeCP2 polyclonal antibody on cells fixed and permeabilised after they had been stained for MHC class I cell surface expression. Dot plot representative examples of these analyses are shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001354-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, where each dot represents an individual cell, and an decrease in MHC staining results in a shift to the left, and an increase in MeCP2 in an upward shift. Because these are transient transfections, MeCP2 overexpression is detected in only a certain percentage (typically 20&#x02013;30&#x00025;) of the cells. As can be seen for all MHC class I molecules ( K<sup>k</sup>, L<sup>d</sup>, D<sup>d</sup> ) and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-2-microglobulin, in the cloud of cells overexpressing MeCP2, we detected a clear shift to the left compared to the lower cloud of untransfected cells and to mock-transfected cells, indicating a reduction of the cell surface expression of all these molecules in the cells that overexpress MeCP2. This effect appears to be specific for these molecules since the level of transferrin receptor was basically unaffected by MeCP2 overexpression. The reproducibility and statistical significance of these observations was ascertained by repeating this experiment many times, which also allowed us to conclude that MeCP2 overexpression results in a similar 40&#x00025; decrease of all three MHC class I molecules and of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-2-microglobulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001354-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In the experiment shown, the mock-transfected cells were simply treated with the transfection reagent, but similar results were obtained when the negative control consisted of empty plasmids, or plasmids expressing other proteins such as GFP (not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0001354-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001354.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>MeCP2 overexpression diminishes MHC class I expression.</title><p>N2A cells transfected with pCMX vectors expressing either murine or human MeCP2 were immunostained for one of the three MHC class I molecules (K<sup>k</sup>, L<sup>d</sup> or D<sup>d</sup>), &#x003b2;2-microglobulin or the transferrin receptor on the cell surface as well as for intracellular MeCP2. The level of staining was then analysed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

The histograms represent the mean (&#x000b1;SEM) of the cell surface level variation from 4 independent transfections with each of the vectors.

Statistical significance of difference between groups was analysed by using an unpaired t-test (&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 ; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001354.g001"/></fig><p>No functional difference has been described between the two isoforms of MeCP2, MeCP2<italic>A</italic> and MeCP2<italic>B</italic>. We therefore explored whether these two isoforms had the same effect on MHC class I molecules and whether their effects might differ according to the cell type in which they are expressed. We transfected vectors encoding the Myc-tagged version of human MeCP2<italic>A</italic> or MeCP2<italic>B</italic> into either N2A or the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3. In this experiment, we detected MeCP2 expression by using an anti-Myc9E10 monoclonal antibody because it produced a much stronger signal than the anti-MeCP2 antibody. The level of MHC class I was evaluated at the same time by using a rat anti-pan-MHC antibody, M1/42. The double staining in mock-transfected and transfected cells was analysed by flow cytometry. MeCP2 overexpression induced a similar extent of repression of MHC class I irrespective of the isoform or cell type in which it was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001354-g001">Figure 1C</xref>): the cell surface level of MHC class I decreased by approximately 35&#x00025; when compared to the basal level (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 in N2A; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 in NIH 3T3) when either MeCP2<italic>A</italic> or MeCP2<italic>B</italic> were overexpressed in N2A or in NIH 3T3 cells.</p><p>We noted a correlation in these experiments between the repressive effect exerted by MeCP2 on MHC class I and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-2-microglobulin and the quantity of MeCP2 expressed by the transfected cells: cells expressing high levels of MeCP2 (dotted circle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001354-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) had less MHC class I on their surface than cells expressing MeCP2 at lower levels (continuous circle), which expressed levels of MHC class I similar to those in cells in which no MeCP2 staining was detected and to those in mock-transfected cells. Repression of MHC class I expression by MeCP2 therefore appears to require very high levels of MeCP2. We generated stably transfected lines of N2A expressing either MeCP2<italic>A</italic> or MeCP2<italic>B</italic> but the levels of protein expressed by these cells was relatively low (at best comparable to those in the continuous circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001354-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). It is therefore of little surprise that the levels of MHC class I expressed by those cells was not discernibly different from that of untransfected cells (not shown). Evaluation by quantitative western blot of the levels of MeCP2 protein expressed in these various transfected cells revealed bands of comparable intensities in stable transfectants and in brain extracts, and bands that were two to five fold more intense in transiently transfected populations (not shown). Since mature neurons represent approximately 15&#x00025; of all cells in the brain parenchyma, we can further estimate that our stable transfectants express levels of MeCP2 which are roughly one sixth of those found in mature neurons. Conversely, since the efficiency of the transient transfections in this experiment was approximately 10&#x00025;, we estimate that the levels of MeCP2 attained in high expressors after transient transfections are 20 to 50 fold higher than the levels in stable transfectants (and therefore three to eight fold higher than in intra-cerebral neurons).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Overexpression of MeCP2 markedly reduces MHC class I upregulation by IFN-&#x003b3;</title><p>The cytokine IFN-&#x003b3; transactivates MHC class I expression predominantly by binding to IFN regulatory factor-1, which binds, in turn, to the interferon-stimulated response element, ISRE, a GC-rich region and therefore a potential binding site also for MeCP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Gobin1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Since MeCP2 appeared to act as a repressor of MHC class I expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001354-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we wanted to test whether it would interfere with transactivation of MHC class I expression by IFN-&#x003b3;. To do so, we transfected N2A cells with pCMX vectors driving the expression of either murine or human forms of MeCP2<italic>A</italic>. The following day, these transiently transfected cells were divided into two flasks that were either treated or not with IFN-&#x003b3; for 48 hrs.

We reasoned that the transcriptional repressor MeCP2 might be involved in regulating MHC class I expression in the CNS for three main reasons. Firstly, expression of MeCP2 is strictly regulated during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Jung1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Mullaney1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> and specifically in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Shahbazian3">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> and is highest in mature neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Kishi1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-LaSalle1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, which do not express MHC class I. Secondly, MeCP2 binds to methylated cytidine residues on CpG dinucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Nan2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and the genes for MHC class I are particularly rich in C/G residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Tykocinski1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thirdly, mutations in the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene are responsible for the neurodevelopmental disorder RTT. We hypothesised that MeCP2 represses expression of MHC class I and that mutations responsible for RTT might cause the loss of this activity.</p><p>In support of the first part of this hypothesis, we showed clearly that overexpression of either of the two isoforms of MeCP2 by transient transfection of neuronal and fibroblastic cell lines results in reduced levels of MHC class I and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2-microglobulin at the cell surface. Furthermore, overexpression of MeCP2 blocked induction of MHC class I in these cells in response to IFN-&#x003b3;. We could not determine whether this decreased expression of MHC class I and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2-microglobulin in response to MeCP2 overexpression was due to reduced transcription, translation or transport to the cell surface because the cells were transiently transfected; only cells that expressed high levels of MeCP2 showed reduced levels of MHC class I on their surface, so we could not quantify the levels of mRNA by RT-PCR or northern blot.</p><p>The fact that we observed very similar extents of repression of all three MHC class I forms (K<sup>k</sup>, L<sup>d</sup> and D<sup>d</sup>) as well as of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2-microglobulin suggests that MeCP2 probably does not act directly on the promoters of the various loci encoding MHC class I, which are not identical. These considerations lead us to think that the effect of MeCP2 may be a more &#x02018;global&#x02019;, indirect mechanism than transcriptional repression by binding to methyl cytosine in the promoters.</p><p>The global decrease in cell surface MHC class I in MeCP2-expressing cells might be due to an effect on chromatin architecture encompassing the whole MHC region, which includes, in addition to the MHC class I loci, other genes involved in the assembly and transport of MHC molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-Ritz1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001354-York1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref> that might contribute to a global effect.
