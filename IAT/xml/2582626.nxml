An interesting but poorly understood domain of the mammalian Dicer protein is the N-terminal helicase-like domain that possesses a signature DExH motif. Cummins <italic>et al.</italic> created a human Dicer mutant cell line by inserting an AAV targeting cassette into the helicase domain of both Dicer alleles in HCT116 cells generating an in-frame 43-amino-acid insertion immediately adjacent to the DExH box. This insertion creates a Dicer mutant protein with defects in the processing of most, but not all, endogenous pre-miRNAs into mature miRNA. Using both biochemical and computational approaches, we provide evidence that the Dicer helicase mutant is sensitive to the thermodynamic properties of the stems in microRNAs and short-hairpin RNAs, with thermodynamically unstable stems resulting in poor processing and a reduction in the levels of functional mi/siRNAs. Paradoxically, this mutant exhibits enhanced processing efficiency and concomitant RNA interference when thermodynamically stable, long-hairpin RNAs are used. These results suggest an important function for the Dicer helicase domain in the processing of thermodynamically unstable hairpin structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic ribonuclease III (RNase III) enzymes exhibit specificity for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and are divided into three structural classes. The first class of RNase III enzymes are the simplest, consisting of a single catalytic domain (RIII), and are represented by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III that promotes ribosomal RNA (rRNA), tRNA and mRNA maturation through cleavage of hairpin-like stem&#x02013;loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Members of the second RNase III class, which include Drosha and its homologs, contain two catalytic RIII domains, a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD), and an N-terminal region that mediates interactions with protein partners such as DGCR8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The third class of RNase III enzymes comprised of Dicer and Dicer-like proteins that play essential roles in several developmental processes through the processing of endogenous dsRNA substrates. For the most part, Dicer enzymes contain an N-terminal DExH-box RNA helicase-like domain, a domain of unknown function (DUF283), a PAZ domain, two RIII domains (RIIIa and RIIIb), and a dsRBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The PAZ domain is highly conserved and is also found in proteins from the Argonaute superfamily that are important mediators of RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian genomes harbor one Dicer gene encoding a &#x0223c;220-KDa protein that has the multidomain structure typical of class 3 RNase III enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments using wild-type and various mutant versions of the human Dicer enzyme (hDicer) reveal that hDicer can process various forms of dsRNA, including long linear dsRNA molecules that contain 5&#x02032; PO<sub>4</sub> and 3&#x02032; OH groups, as well as short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) that mimic Drosha-produced pre-miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). For long dsRNA, cleavage by hDicer into 21-mer siRNAs can occur from both ends of the open, linear substrate in an ATP-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>). In contrast, processing of pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs occurs through recognition of the 2-nt 3&#x02032; overhang at one end of the hairpin duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Analysis of dsRNA processing by hDicer enzymes engineered with specific RIII domain mutations reveal that human Dicer contains a single dsRNA processing center formed through intramolecular dimerization of the two RIII domains that function independently to cleave phosphodiester bonds on opposite strands of the dsRNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Biochemical analysis of hDicer, along with crystal structure data of the hDicer C-terminus, indicates that divalent cations (e.g. Mg<sup>2+</sup>) are present at the active site and are required for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). At present, the crystal structure of the hDicer N-terminus has not been reported.</p><p>Biochemical fractionation of human cells indicates that hDicer does not exist alone, but rather associates <italic>in vivo</italic> with other dsRNA-binding partners such as members of the Ago family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and a related protein, protein activator of PKR (PACT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), RNA helicase A (RHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and possibly others. RNAi depletion of PACT or TRBP has a detrimental effect on miRNA-mediated and siRNA-mediated gene silencing, respectively, with loss of PACT expression resulting in a decrease in mature miRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Dicer is also found in a complex with Ago 2, the slicer component of RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), suggesting that Dicer is involved in the hand-off of processed trigger molecules for use by RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Therefore, the processing of hairpin RNAs by hDicer is likely to occur in multiple steps that involve different domains of the enzyme. The contributions of other proteins such as Ago 2 and TRBP, which have been identified in a putative miRNA loading complex are likely to also be important for efficient hairpin processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Despite biochemical and crystallographic investigation of the hDicer C-terminal domain, the role of the N-terminal helicase domain in hDicer activity is still poorly understood. Recently a Dicer mutant cell line was created via AAV insertional mutagenesis of the hDicer helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This cell line has reduced levels of many, but not all, miRNAs relative to its wild-type parental cell line. We have further characterized the nature of the insertion, which is a homozygous in-frame 43-amino-acid insertion close to the helicase DExH motif. Our findings demonstrate that this mutation has detrimental effects on the processing of most pre-miRNAs, but paradoxically has enhanced processing relative to wild-type hDicer of long-hairpin transcripts. These studies suggest an important role for the helicase domain in the recognition and processing of imperfect Watson&#x02013;Crick helices, and the absence of a functional helicase domain results in enhanced processivity in the cleavage of long hairpins. Our studies lead to a model in which the hDicer helicase domain is required for efficient processing of hairpin RNAs with thermodynamically unstable stem regions. Most likely this characteristic of hDicer reflects upon the requirement that Dicer processes a variety of stem&#x02013;loop substrates, pointing to an important role for the helicase domain in expanding the function of human Dicer beyond pre-miRNA processing. Interestingly, perturbation of this domain results in enhanced processivity by the enzyme on long, thermodynamically stable hairpin RNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The plasmids expressing sh- and lhRNA that target the HIV genome are driven by the human U6 promoter and are described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).

PCR amplification and sequence analysis of genomic DNA from wild-type and Dicer helicase mutant cells using primers that flank exon 5 of the human Dicer gene indicate that the Dicer helicase mutant cells contain a 129-bp insertion of an ectopic sequence derived from the targeting vector that is in-frame with the predicted amino acid sequence of Dicer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1A</ext-link>). The insertion mutation resides two amino acids from the DExH motif DECH, an important motif in RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Whereas the insertion mutation had no apparent effect on the level of hDicer mRNA in Dicer mHelicase cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1C</ext-link>), the level of hDicer protein is reduced in Dicer mHelicase cells compared with wild-type HCT116 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1D</ext-link>). Because of the absence of structural data for the hDicer N-terminus, we cannot accurately determine the structural perturbations in the helicase induced by the 43-amino-acid insertion, nor can we rule out the possibility that other Dicer domains are affected by the insertion mutation. Based on empirical evidence presented below, showing the efficient processing of some endogenous pre-miRNAs and ectopic shRNAs in the mHelicase cells, we anticipate that the insertion into the helicase domain does not affect other functional domains of hDicer, such as the PAZ and C-terminal cleavage domains. By homology modeling, using the crystal structure of the Hef helicase from <italic>P. furiosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) that has sequence similarity with the Dicer helicase domain, we predict that the 43-amino-acid insertion disrupts the Hef DECH box and other motifs involved in ATP hydrolysis by the Hef helicase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1E</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Processing and efficacy of miRNAs in wild-type and the Dicer helicase mutant cells</title><p>While the expression of many miRNAs is reduced in mHelicase cells, as shown by the marked reduction in mature miR-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), a closer examination of the miRNA expression data generated by Cummins <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) indicate that &#x0223c;25% of the 100 most highly expressed miRNAs in the wild-type and mHelicase cells did not exhibit significant changes in miRNA expression (data not shown). Our own northern blot analyses for two of these unaffected miRNAs (miR-23a and miR-27a) confirm that the processing and expression of these miRNA is the same in both wild-type and mHelicase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In addition, transient expression of ectopic perfectly complementary shRNA (SII-c21) or lhRNA (SII-c50) targeting the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulatory gene, <italic>rev</italic> (site II or SII) in wild-type and mHelicase cells had no effect on the expression of miR-23a and miR-27a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The observation that multiple miRNAs escape downregulation in the mHelicase background suggests that the reduced level of Dicer is not limiting for pre-miRNA cleavage in these cells. Moreover, the fact that the expression of miR-23a and miR-27a remains unchanged in both cell lines that express ectopic shRNA or lhRNA indicates that transient transfection does not have a major impact on miRNA expression or the viability of the mHelicase cells. The expression of miR-21, whose steady-state level is reduced in mHelicase cells, also shows reduced expression following transient transfection of different shRNA or lhRNA vectors (SII-21 and SII-50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). To determine whether the reduced production of some miRNAs in mutant cells has a detrimental effect on miRNA target knockdown, we cloned a polycistronic miRNA (miR-106b-93-25) from the MCM7 gene downstream of the CMV promoter and constructed a separate reporter vector that contains a target site perfectly complementary to miR-93 in the 3&#x02032; UTR of the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). All three miRNAs that originate from this MCM7 cluster are reduced in the Dicer mHelicase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In wild-type cells, the MCM7 vector reduced miR-93 target gene expression by almost 70% compared with an irrelevant control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast, the efficacy of target knockdown was reduced &#x0223c;2-fold in the Dicer helicase mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Upon co-transfection of Dicer helicase mutant cells with a plasmid expressing wild-type Dicer cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), target knockdown was restored to near wild-type levels, showing that the mutation is not dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Expression and efficacy of shRNA or lhRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>. <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of short and long hairpin constructs.

The SII-21 hairpin produces a single siRNA, whereas the SII-50 and SII-80 hairpins are capable of generating two and three individual siRNAs, respectively. These hairpin sequences contain G:U and U:G wobble pairings but do not alter the antisense guide strand of the processed siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The wobble pairing slightly distorts the stem helix of the hairpin RNA but was shown to facilitate cloning of these long hairpins in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). To determine the extent of shRNA or lhRNA processing into &#x0223c;21-mer siRNAs, sh- and lhRNA expression plasmids were transfected into wild-type and Dicer helicase mutant cells followed by northern blot analyses using 5&#x02032;-end labeled 21-nt oligonucleotides complementary to the antisense guide strand of each siRNA that is predicted to derive from Dicer-processing of the hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B). Reduced accumulation of siRNAs was observed for the SII-21 shRNA containing G:U wobble base-pairing in Dicer helicase mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), a result that was consistently observed upon repeated transfections, but which did not correlate with the apparent shRNA processing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, Probe 1). Northern analyses of the siRNAs produced from the SII-50 and SII-80 vectors showed somewhat increased amounts of the first siRNA processed from the lhRNAs in Dicer helicase mutant cells compared to lhRNA processing in the wild type Dicer background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C, Probe 1). However, the processing efficiency of the second and third siRNAs from these lhRNA vectors was 3&#x02013;5-fold greater in Dicer helicase mutant cells compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C, Probes 2 and 3). Throughout our experiments we repeatedly observed the inverse accumulation of mature siRNA in wild-type (high-shRNA/low-lhRNA) and Dicer helicase mutant cells (low-shRNA/high-lhRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>Using two different luciferase-based reporter systems, we measured a &#x0223c;2-fold increase in the efficacy of target knockdown for the lhRNA vectors in mHelicase cells compared with target knockdown in wild-type cells. In contrast, target knockdown in response to the SII-21 shRNA vector was reduced by about 2-fold in the mHelicase Dicer background, consistent with the reduced steady-state level of processed siRNA determined by northern analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). The enhanced processing and greater target knockdown in the mHelicase Dicer background is not specific to the site II HIV lhRNA, as different lhRNA vectors targeting the HIV <italic>tat/rev</italic> common exon (site I or SI), yielded more siRNA and greater efficacy for each lhRNA in the Dicer helicase mutant cells compared to wild-type cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>). In addition to the increased steady-state levels of the siRNA guide strand from lhRNA vectors in Dicer mHelicase cells, northern analysis revealed stronger sense strand signals for the lhRNA-derived siRNAs in the mHelicase Dicer background relative to wild-type cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4</ext-link>). Target knockdown by the lhRNA-derived sense strand was also greater in the Dicer mHelicase cells indicating that lhRNA passenger strand siRNAs are also incorporated into RISC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4</ext-link>). No significant differences in sense-strand accumulation or target knockdown from the SII-21 shRNA were observed between wild-type and Dicer mHelicase cells.

These results are in contrast with the significant reduction in knockdown efficacy by the G:U wobble containing SII-21 shRNA in the Dicer mHelicase background, suggesting that shRNAs with thermodynamically stable stem regions are largely unaffected by the mHelicase insertion into hDicer.</p><p>These results suggest that the thermodynamic stability of helical stem region of hairpin RNAs is an important feature for the Dicer helicase mutant phenotype and affects the processing efficiency and siRNA accumulation in the Dicer mHelicase cells. Supporting this hypothesis is our observation that miRNAs with unpaired nucleotides at the end of the stem (positions 1&#x02013;3) or around the Dicer processing site (positions 18&#x02013;22) were cloned less frequently in the Dicer helicase mutant cells compared with wild-type cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 7 and Figure 1A</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In light of these observations, we sought to carry out a systematic approach to delineate the role of the hDicer helicase domain in processing shRNAs. To do this, we constructed several additional shRNA variants by inserting G:U wobble pairings or creating bulges within the stem of the Sh-c21 shRNA vector and performed northern blot analysis for processed siRNA. Since each shRNA contains different G:U wobble pairs and/or bulges within the stem, the resultant shRNAs have different calculated thermodynamic stabilities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 8A</ext-link>). In both cell lines, the processing of SII-21 shRNA variants with lower thermodynamic stabilities was reduced compared with the parental SII-c21 vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In particular, the processing efficiency of SII-G26, which has a similar predicted thermodynamic stability to the pre-miR-21 hairpin (&#x00394;G = &#x02013;24.9 kcal/mol), was most affected by the Dicer helicase mutation. The steady-state ratios of the endogenous pre-miR21/mature miR-21 are also increased in the Dicer mHelicase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Even though the processing efficiency of most SII-21 shRNA variants did not differ significantly between wild-type and Dicer mHelicase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), the efficacy of target knockdown was significantly reduced in the mHelicase Dicer background for most shRNAs with lower internal stabilities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 8B</ext-link>), consistent with the impaired production of siRNAs and suggestive of a defect in guide strand handoff to RISC by the Dicer mHelicase mutant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Human Dicer possesses several domains that are required for functional processing of pre-miRNAs as well as longer double-stranded RNAs. Prior to this study and a recent publication by Ma <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) the role of the N-terminal helicase domain in Dicer function was unstudied. We have taken advantage of a human cell line that expresses a mutant form of hDicer that has an in-frame, 43-amino-acid insertion immediately adjacent to the DExH motif in the N-terminal helicase domain. This mutant Dicer enzyme exhibits poor processing of pre-miRNAs and shRNA with thermodynamically unstable stem regions, particularly when normal Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair interactions are disrupted at the base of the stem (positions 1&#x02013;3) and close to the Dicer cleavage site (i.e. base-paired between nucleotides 18&#x02013;22) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 7</ext-link>). By restoring Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing in the stem region of an shRNA, the processing efficiency and target knockdown in the mHelicase Dicer background could be restored to levels achieved in wild-type cells. A somewhat surprising characteristic of the Dicer mHelicase is the enhanced processing of lhRNA with stem regions &#x02265; 50-nt. The processing of endogenous lhRNAs by Dicer in mammals has gained importance with the discovery of long RNAs in mouse oocytes that appear to regulate gene expression through Dicer- and Ago 2-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that the helicase domain is required for efficient processing and possibly handoff of the guide strand to RISC when the substrates are thermodynamically unstable duplexes.</p><p>Eukaryotes possessing only one Dicer gene that lack the helicase domain, such as <italic>Giardia</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces Pombe</italic>, encounter only perfectly matched duplex or hairpin RNAs and do not encode known miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Given the varied sequence and secondary structures of human endogenous pre-miRNAs and the newly discovered oocyte-restricted lhRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), it is possible that the N-terminal domain of human Dicer evolved to broaden the array of structured hairpin RNAs that this enzyme can efficiently cleave. Biochemical and crystallographic data for Dicer and other RNAse III enzymes that lack a helicase domain have produced models using linear dsRNA molecules that do not take into account the unidirectional entry of Dicer on substrates containing a loop at one end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35 B36">33&#x02013;36</xref>). What is clear from these earlier reports, however, is that significant conformational changes in the protein and RNA occur during cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Therefore, hairpins with slightly different structures due to their sequence composition and thermodynamic stability are likely to require different conformational changes in order for processing to be completed. Our own results, as well as those of other labs, have shown a polarity in the processing of long hairpins in cells resulting in reduced amounts and efficacies of distally produced siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Our current analysis of long hairpin processing in cells harboring either wild-type or mutant helicase Dicer enzymes provide some insight into these previous results and show the Dicer helicase domain restricts the processivity of the enzyme, thereby limiting the effectiveness of long hairpins for intracellular applications in which multiple siRNAs are desired.</p><p>Steric hindrance of helicase domain function by the inserted residues could provide the mutant helicase Dicer its&#x02019; unique sh/lhRNA processing properties. It is possible that the inserted amino acid residues disrupt required conformational changes that take place after cleavage to bring together the hDicer C-terminal domain, which mediates dsRNA binding and cleavage, with the helicase-containing N-terminus of hDicer. Such an interaction could promote the release of the newly cleaved siRNA duplex. This interaction between the C- and N-termini of wild-type hDicer is expected to prevent the Dicer C-terminal domain from immediately initiating another round of cleavage resulting in poor processing of lhRNA substrates which require more than one Dicer cleavage event. In the absence of a functional Dicer helicase domain, however, the C-terminus of the mutant Dicer enzyme is capable of multiple rounds of hairpin cleavage on long hairpin substrates. In support of this possible mechanism, the recent studies of Ma <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) demonstrate that the major consequence of eliminating the helicase domain from human dicer is a substantial increase in the <italic>k</italic><sub>ca</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> for cleavage of a perfectly matched 37-nt linear duplex RNA. They suggest that the helicase domain is involved in a rearrangement of the enzyme following catalysis, which restricts the enzyme's ability to reinitiate cleavage on the long substrates. In the absence of a functional helicase domain this rearrangement does not occur, thereby allowing the enzyme to rapidly reinitiate cleavage on a long substrate.</p><p>In contrast to the enhanced cleavage processivity of the mHelicase on long hairpins, short hairpin and pre-miRNA substrates that harbor mismatches in the stem region are cleaved poorly in our system. It is possible that that the complete processing of pre-miRNAs with poor thermodynamic stability properties by Dicer may require interaction with an accessory protein, such as TRBP or PACT. This seems unlikely though since human Dicer can effectively recognize and cleave pre-miRNAs and other hairpin RNA substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of accessory proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5</ext-link>). Perhaps a more reasonable explanation for our observations, as well as those of Ma <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), is that once cleavage of an imperfect stem region takes place, the helicase domain helps mediate a conformational rearrangement of the hDicer enzyme to release the guide strand for hand-off to RISC. In contrast, perfectly matched helices in shRNAs are directly handed off to Ago 2 wherein the passenger strand is cleaved to create an active RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Thus, a plausible model for the role of the helicase domain in the human Dicer enzyme is to facilitate product release from substrates with imperfect helices. This may take place via interactions with accessory proteins such as TRBP or PACT or through interactions between N- and C-terminal domains of the same Dicer molecule. Further structural analyses of the Dicer helicase domain should facilitate a better understanding of why the helicase domain is required for unstable substrate processing and hand-off but is not required for thermodynamically stable duplex processing and handoff.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn687/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>HL07470</grant-num>, <grant-num>AI29329</grant-num> to J.J.R.); a Beckman Fellowship from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation (to H.S.S.).
