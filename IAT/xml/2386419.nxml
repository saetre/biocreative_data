We studied the effects of over-expression of Nur77 on the apoptosis of murine peripheral T cells, including thymic-derived Foxp3&#x0002b; regulatory (Treg) cells. Overexpression of Nur77 in the T cell lineage decreased numbers of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells by &#x0223c;80&#x00025; compared to wild-type (WT) mice. However, the proportions of Treg cells were markedly increased in the thymus (61&#x00025; of CD4&#x0002b;Foxp3&#x0002b; singly positive thymocytes vs. 8&#x00025; in WT) and secondary lymphoid organs (40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of CD4&#x0002b;Foxp3&#x0002b; T cells vs. 7&#x02013;8&#x00025; in WT) of Nur77 transgenic (Nur77Tg) mice, and immunoprecipitation studies showed Nur77 was associated with a recently identified HDAC7/Foxp3 transcriptional complex. Upon activation through the T cell receptor in vitro or in vivo, Nur77Tg T cells showed only marginally decreased proliferation but significantly increased apoptosis. Fully allogeneic cardiac grafts transplanted to Nur77Tg mice survived long-term with well-preserved structure, and recipient splenocytes showed markedly enhanced apoptosis and greatly reduced anti-donor recall responses. Allografts in Nur77Tg recipients had significantly increased expression of multiple Treg-associated genes, including Foxp3, Foxp1, Tip60 and HDAC9. Allograft rejection was restored by CD25 monoclonal antibody therapy, indicating that allograft acceptance was dependent upon Treg function in Nur77Tg recipients. These data show that compared to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells, Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs are relatively resistant to Nur77-mediated apoptosis, and that tipping the balance between the numbers of Tregs and responder T cells in the early period post-transplantation can determine the fate of the allograft. Hence, induced expression of Nur77 might be a novel means to achieve long-term allograft survival.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nur77 (also known as NR4A1, TR3, NGFI-B or NAK1) is an inducible orphan nuclear receptor comprised of an N-terminal AF1 transactivation domain, a DNA binding domain containing two zinc fingers, and a C-terminal ligand binding domain.

T cell receptor (TCR) activation induces HDAC7 phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase PKD1, and phosphorylated HDAC7 binds to 14-3-3 protein and is exported from the nucleus, leading to depression of Nur77 and other gene targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002321-Dequiedt1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002321-Parra1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Nur77 downstream target genes responsible for regulating T cell apoptosis remain to be identified. Although expression levels of FasL and CD30 are elevated in Nur77 transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002321-Weih1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, Nur77-mediated apoptosis is still intact in gld/gld (FasL mutant mice) or CD30&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, precluding FasL and CD30 as the major downstream effectors of Nur77-related apoptosis in thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002321-Zhang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, negative selection of CD4&#x0002b;CD8&#x0002b; doubly-positive thymocytes is intact in Fas- or CD30-deficient mice, and constitutive expression of Nur77 in gld/gld mice rescues the lymphoproliferative phenotype of the FasL mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002321-Singer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002321-DeYoung1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Indeed, recent microarray studies showed Nur77 induces known apoptotic genes such as FasL and TRAIL, but also novel genes such as NDG1 and NDG2 that promote apoptosis in a Bcl-2-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002321-Rajpal1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to promoting cell apoptosis through the mechanisms outlined above, Nur77 can also function as an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002321-Kim1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The C-terminal ligand-binding domain of Nur77 can specifically interact with the highly conserved glycine-rich loop of PKC-theta that is required for its catalytic activity, preventing the phosphorylation of substrate by PKC-theta. Hence, inhibition of catalytic activity by Nur77 can repress PKC-mediated activation of AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B, with multiple downstream effects including preventing induction of anti-apoptotic genes.</p><p>All these findings suggest an essential role of Nur77 in apoptotic death accompanying negative selection in thymocyte development. However, the role of Nur77 in induction of apoptosis in mature T cells, and in the induction and/or maintenance of peripheral tolerance is only poorly understood. Likewise, there are no data as to the effects of Nur77 on the apoptosis of thymic-derived Foxp3&#x0002b; regulatory T (Treg) Treg vs. non-Treg cells. In the current study, we evaluated the role of Nur77 on peripheral T cell apoptosis by taking advantage of transgenic mice in which Nur77 was overexpressed in thymocytes and T cells using the Lck promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effect of Nur77 over-expression on peripheral T cell populations</title><p>We found by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), that expression of the inducible immediate early gene, Nur77, was upregulated within 4 h of <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation by PMA/ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002321-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) or CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002321-g001">Figure 1b</xref>), and returned to basal levels by 24 h in both non-Tregs and Tregs (p&#x0003e;0.05).
