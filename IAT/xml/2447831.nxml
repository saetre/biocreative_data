They arise early in the development of the CNS, from the neuroepithelial cells lining the ventricles, around the time neurons start to appear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Radial glial cells extend a long radial process to the pial surface while having their cell bodies in the ventricular zone (VZ), and thus allowing the migration of neurons from the VZ to the postmitotic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the finding that these cells can also give birth to the migratory neurons via their asymmetric division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] further highlighted the significance of these cells in brain development. Interestingly, radial glial cells disappear or transform into astrocytes in most regions of the mammalian brain after neuronal generation and migration are completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Brain lipid binding protein (BLBP) is a nervous system-specific member of the large family of hydrophobic ligand binding proteins and is exclusively expressed in radial glia and astrocytes during development throughout the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A recent elegant study using Cre/loxP fate mapping, showed that all neuronal population in the mouse brain are derived from radial glial cells expressing BLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Recently, BLBP expression in cortical radial glia as well as its role in radial process extension was found to be dependent on Reelin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein, which has been shown to be an important signal for neuronal migration and proper positioning of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Reelin signal is transmitted into the cells by Disabled-1 (Dab-1), a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that binds the internalization (NPXY) motif of the Reelin receptors, apolipoprotein receptor2 (ApoER2) and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), via its phospho-tyrosine binding (PTB) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab-1 is initiated after Reelin binding to its receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], forming new binding sites for Src kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mice deficient in, VLDLR and ApoER2, Dab-1 or Dab-1 that cannot be tyrosine phosphorylated generates a reeler-like phenotype, which is characterized by inversion of the cortical layers and abnormalities in the laminated brain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Reelin effect on BLBP expression requires Dab-1 as well, as it failed to occur in Dab-1-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Reeler and Dab-1 mutant mice were shown to exhibit abnormal development of the radial glia scaffold in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, components of the Reelin signaling pathway, including VLDLR, ApoER2, and Dab1 were shown to be expressed in both the hippocampul and cortical radial glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, Reelin addition <italic>in-vitro </italic>has been shown not only to promote the process extension of the radial glial cells but also to rescue the defects in the length of these processes in the reeler mutant radial glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>A recent study showed that Notch-1 signaling could also regulate the molecular and the morphological differentiation of radial glia through the transcriptional activation of brain lipid binding protein (BLBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Notch is a single-pass transmembrane protein that was initially identified in Drosophila and has been shown to mediate many developmental signaling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Notch-1 activation, upon binding its ligand, will initiate its cleavage by &#x003b3;-secretase to generate Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds C-promoter Binding Factor 1 (CBF1), converting it from transcriptional repressor to transcriptional activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, BLBP expression was found to be dependent on this pathway as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], where a binding site for the Notch-1 effectors' CBF1 was found in the promoter region of BLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Since Notch-1 activation can induce both the radial glial phenotype and their transformation into astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we hypothesized that Reelin signaling may act to fine-tune Notch-1 activation favoring the induction of the radial glial phenotype prenataly. This in turn can explain how the degeneration of the cells that produces Reelin in the cortex coincides with transformation of the radial glial cells into astrocytes postnataly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In our study, <italic>in vitro </italic>addition of Reelin to human neural progenitor cells (HNPCs), isolated from the cortex of 14 weeks old fetus, induced BLBP expression and a radial glial phenotype similar to that induced by Notch-1 activation. The inhibition of Notch-1 activation by inhibiting the activity of &#x003b3;-secretase abolished Reelin's effect, suggesting the dependency of Reelin signaling on Notch-1 activation. Furthermore, Reelin treatment increased the level of NICD, indicating that Reelin can directly activate Notch-1. Finally, Dab-1 was observed to bind to Notch-1, thus providing an evidence of the physical interaction between these two pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Reelin treatment <italic>in vitro </italic>induces a radial glial phenotype similar to Notch-1 activation</title><p>Reelin addition <italic>in vitro </italic>has been recently shown to promote the process extension of the radial glial cells and to rescue the defects in the length of these processes in the reeler mutant radial glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Notch-1 activation has been known for its role in promoting both phenotypes, the formation of the radial glial cells and their transformation into astrocytes. Interestingly, Notch-1 activation has been shown to induce radial glial cells differentiation prenataly and to induce astrocytic differentiation postnataly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of other signaling pathways that act to induce the radial glial phenotype prenataly but are deactivated or downregulated postnataly seems to be an attractive model to explain how Notch-1 activation leads to different cellular fates at different developmental stages.</p><p>Reelin signaling has been recently shown to induce the radial glial phenotype <italic>in vitro </italic>and to rescue the defects in the reeler mutant radial glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interestingly, Cajal-Retzius cells, the cells that produce Reelin in the cortical marginal zone, are thought to either degenerate postnatally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or undergo developmental dilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Here, we propose that Reelin signaling promotes Notch-1 activation to favor the radial glial phenotype prenataly. To test our hypothesis, we used human neural progenitor cells that were isolated form the cortex of 14 weeks fetus. We show that these cells responded to Reelin treatment by inducing a bipolar morphology in the GFAP positive cell indicating the formation of radial glia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Since this Reelin-induced phenotype was dependent on &#x003b3;-secretase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>), and since Reelin treatment increased the level of NICD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), then we concluded that Reelin signaling promote the radial glial phenotype by activating Notch-1.</p><p>Reelin signaling might regulate Notch-1 activation via Dab-1 binding to Notch-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). It's possible that Reelin signaling mediated by Dab-1, increases the NICD level by either increasing Notch-1 processing by &#x003b3;-secretase or by stabilizing the released NICD. Since Dab-1 has been recently shown to act as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], Dab-1 may in turn mediate the translocation of NICD into the nucleus to activate downstream genes such as BLBP. However, the exact mechanism needs further elucidation.</p><p>Taken together, this study offers a new insight of how Reelin and Notch-1 signaling are determining that fate of the neural progenitor cells and maintaining the radial glial phenotype in the developing brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>We used ReNcell CX (Chemicon), an immortalized human neural progenitor cell line (HNPCs) with the ability to readily differentiate into neurons and glial cells.

Reelin was partially purified using columns with filters &#x0003e;100 kDa (Chemicon) and Reelin level was confirmed by western blotting using anti-Reelin clone G10 (Chemicon) that detected the three characteristic bands of Reelin (400 KDa, 300 KDa, and 180 KDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>HNPCs were treated with either partially purified control or Reelin at a final concentration of 1:40 diluted in ReNcell CX maintenance media for 24 hours. The concentration of partially purified Reelin in the conditioned media was determined by finding the lowest concentration of Reelin that can induce Dab-1 phosphorylation as early as 15 minutes (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis</title><p>HNPCs were lysed in ice-cold RIPA (Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay) lysis buffer (Sigma Aldrich) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with 1% Triton-X and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C and the supernatants were saved for analysis. Forty micrograms of protein was loaded per well, and proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE (NuPage 4%&#x02013;12% Bis-Tris, Invitrogen) and then blotted onto polyvinyldiene difluride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-rad) for 120 min at 30 V. For the detection of full-length Notch-1, activated Notch-1, Reelin, BLBP, &#x003b2;-actin, Dab-1 and p198Dab-1, membranes were incubated overnight with following primary antibodies, respectively: mouse anti-Notch-1 (1:1,000; Sigma Aldrich), rabbit anti-activated Notch-1 (1:500; Abcam), mouse anti-Reelin clone G10 (1:1000; Chemicon), rabbit anti-BLBP (1:500; Abcam), rabbit anti-&#x003b2;-actin (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit anti-Dab-1 (1:1000;Sigma Aldrich) and rabbit anti-Dab-1 phospho tyrosine 198 (1:1000; Chemicon). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at concentration of 1:5000 (anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 1&#x02013;2 h. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences Corp) on a Kodak Imaging Station IS2000 MM. The optical density of each specific band relative to &#x003b2;-actin was analyzed by the public domain National Institutes of Health Image J software.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>700 &#x003bc;g of protein was incubated for 3 hours at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody anti-Notch-1 (1:100; Sigma Aldrich), or anti-Flag (1:200; Sigma Aldrich), or anti-NICD (1:500; Abcam), Protein G- or A-Sepharose beads were added for 1 hr at 4&#x000b0;C, and then immunoprecipitates were washed 5&#x000d7; with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized in 1% SDS solution and resolved on a 4&#x02013;12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescent Immunocytochemistry</title><p>HNPCs were fixed with 4% Paraformylaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The next day, the cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS- Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature and blocked with 3% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) in phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% Triton-X (PBST- Sigma Aldrich) for 1 hour at room temperature. For analyzing the radial glial phenotypes, HNPCs were incubated with rabbit anti-BLBP (1:50; Abcam) and mouse anti- GFAP (1:500; Sigma Aldrich) for 24 hrs at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing the cells with PBS for three times the cells were incubated with rhodamine TRTIC-conjugated anti-rabbit and fluorescein FITC-conjugated anti-mouse (1: 500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) for 2 hrs at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed again and mounted with vectasheild with DAPI (vector laboratories) and cover slipped for microscopic observations.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy and analysis of the radial glial phenotype</title><p>The induced radial glial phenotype was calculated by finding the percentage of the GFAP positive cells that had an induced BLBP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and a bipolar morphology, with at least one thin process longer than 50 &#x003bc;m. This criterion was based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Adobe Photoshop CS3 software was used to count the number of cells. Microscopic images were taken with an Axiocam digital camera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) mounted on the DMRB and processed using the QI imaging with Q capture software (Q Imaging, Burnaby, Canada). A total of three separate trials were performed. In each trial three random fields were selected for each condition. A total of ~600 cells were counted in each field (10&#x000d7; magnification).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Each data point represents triplicated experiments and displayed as the mean &#x000b1; standard error. A one-way Analysis of Variance was performed to test the hypothesis that the average mean values across categories of GROUP were equal. In the presence of significance for the omnibus ANOVA test, Tukey multiple comparison test is used to perform pairwise comparisons. Statistics were performed using WINKS SDA Software (Texasoft, Cedar Hill, TX.). For immunocytochemistry and cell count: The average values across categories of GROUP were found to be different. F (5, 12) = 103.22, p &#x0003c; .001. For Western: The average values across categories of GROUP were found to be different. F (4, 10) = 29.84, p &#x0003c; .001. A Tukey multiple comparison procedure was performed at p = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant AG 23472.
