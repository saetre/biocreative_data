Both PTP have been implicated as negative-regulators of early signal transduction through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), acting to dephosphorylate the TCR&#x003b6; chain, a component of the TCR complex. Previously, we reported upon the production and characterization of PTPN3-deficient mice which show normal TCR signal transduction and T cell function. To address if the lack of a T cell phenotype in PTPN3-deficient mice can be explained by functional redundancy of PTPN3 with PTPN4, we generated PTPN4-deficient and PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice. As in PTPN3 mutants, T cell development and homeostasis and TCR-induced cytokine synthesis and proliferation were found to be normal in PTPN4-deficient and PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice. PTPN13 is another FERM and PDZ domain-containing non-receptor PTP that is distantly-related to PTPN3 and PTPN4 and which has been shown to function as a negative-regulator of T helper-1 (Th1) and Th2 differentiation. Therefore, to determine if PTPN13 might compensate for the loss of PTPN3 and PTPN4 in T cells, we generated mice that lack functional forms of all three PTP. T cells from triple-mutant mice developed normally and showed normal cytokine secretion and proliferative responses to TCR stimulation. Furthermore, T cell differentiation along the Th1, Th2 and Th17 lineages was largely unaffected in triple-mutants. We conclude that PTPN3 and PTPN4 are dispensable for TCR signal transduction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A common event in cellular signal transduction is the phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues which results in diverse cellular outcomes. This phosphorylation is mediated by protein tyrosine kinases (PTK). By contrast, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) remove phosphate groups from protein tyrosyl residues and thus oppose the actions of PTK. The mammalian genome encodes 38 classical PTP that can be subdivided into receptor-like and non-transmembrane PTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Tonks1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Hendriks1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The non-transmembrane PTP family consists of 17 members, of which 14 are expressed in T lymphocytes of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Mustelin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>T cells become activated subsequent to MHC-peptide recognition mediated by the clonally distributed, cell surface expressed T cell antigen receptor (TCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Kenneth1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the first events in the now well-established TCR signaling cascade is the phosphorylation and activation of the Src-family PTK, LCK and FYN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Palacios1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These PTK phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) present within the cytoplasmic tails of invariant CD3 and TCR&#x003b6; proteins that form part of the TCR complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Pitcher1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequently, the Syk-family kinase, ZAP-70, is recruited to the complex by the recognition of phosphorylated ITAMs, and, in turn, is activated via Src-family PTK-mediated phosphorylation. Activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates the transmembrane adapter protein, linker for activation of T cells (LAT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Chu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. LAT further propagates the signal, leading to membrane recruitment of additional signaling intermediates that ultimately result in the nuclear mobilization of the transcription factors NFAT, NF-&#x003ba;B, and AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Sommers1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These transcription factors drive the expression of new genes that result in cytokine secretion, cytokine receptor expression, cell division, and effector cell differentiation.</p><p>While the role of PTK in TCR signal transduction has been extensively studied, the identity of PTP that negatively-regulate this pathway is less clear. PTP that are established physiological negative-regulators of proximal TCR signaling are SHP-1 and PEP. These PTP dephosphorylate and inactivate LCK, FYN, and ZAP-70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Pao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Lorenz1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Other PTP that have been implicated in negative regulation of TCR signal transduction are PTPN3 and PTPN4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Gu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In mice, these PTP are 50&#x00025; identical and 67&#x00025; homologous at the amino acid level. They consist of an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal FERM (Band 4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin) domain, a central PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) domain, and a COOH-terminal PTP domain. FERM and PDZ domains bind the cytosolic domain of transmembrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Algrain1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Sato1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Both domains have also been shown to bind directly to the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5 biphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Zimmermann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Bompard1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

A screen in the Jurkat T cell leukemia line seeking to identify candidate negative regulators of TCR signal transduction revealed that over-expression of PTPN3 and PTPN4 resulted in an approximate 75&#x00025; and 40&#x00025; reduction, respectively, of TCR-induced activation of the promoter for the T cell growth-promoting cytokine, IL-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Han1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue or deletion of the FERM domain from these PTP abrogated this inhibitory effect, illustrating the importance of these domains for negative regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-GjorloffWingren1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Han1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, PTPN4 has also been shown to dephosphorylate TCR&#x003b6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Young1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The third member of the FERM and PDZ domain-containing PTP family is PTPN13, also known as PTP-Bas, PTP-BL, and FAP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Erdmann1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. PTPN13 is a large protein that in addition to a PTP domain contains one FERM domain, five PDZ domains and a non-catalytic C-lobe domain. Mice that express a PTP domain-deleted form of PTPN13 exhibit impaired motor nerve repair and axon branching, and retinal ganglion cell neurite initiation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Wansink1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Lorber1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests a role for PTPN13 in neural cell growth and survival, especially following injury. Additionally, <italic>in vitro</italic>, T cells from PTPN13-deficient mice demonstrated increased differentiation into T helper-1 (Th1) and T helper-2 (Th2) subsets that synthesize the cytokines interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) and IL-4 respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Nakahira1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Ostensibly, this is associated with increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins which mediate cytokine signal transduction.</p><p>We have previously shown that mice lacking PTPN3 exhibit normal T cell development and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Bauler1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesized that the lack of apparent function of PTPN3 in T cells can be explained on the grounds that PTPN4 can substitute for the function of PTPN3 in this cell type. To address this we have generated PTPN4-deficient mice and PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice. Furthermore, to address the possibility that PTPN13 can substitute for the function of both PTPN4 and PTPN3 in T cells, we have additionally generated PTPN4/PTPN3/PTPN13 triple-mutant mice. The function of T cells in these different mice has been examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p>The embryonic stem (ES) cell line, OST146128 (of 129 Sv/Ev origin), which contains a gene trap cassette within intron 2 of the <italic>ptpn4</italic> locus, was purchased from Lexicon Genetics (The Woodlands, TX).

Although the degree of homology between PTPN13 and PTPN4 or PTPN3 is much less than that between PTPN4 and PTPN3, the possibility that PTPN13 might compensate functionally for the loss of PTPN4 and PTPN3 in T cells existed. Moreover, recent studies of PTPN13-deficient mice indicated that this PTP regulates T helper cell differentiation through function as a negative-regulator of the phosphorylation of STAT-4 and STAT-6. Therefore, we asked if a role for PTPN4 and PTPN3 in T cells might be revealed in mice that do not express functional PTPN13. To examine this, PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice were crossed with mice that express a PTP domain-deleted PTPN13 protein (PTPN13 &#x00394;PTP) to generate PTPN4/PTPN3-double-deficient PTPN13 &#x00394;PTP/&#x00394;PTP mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Wansink1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Results of these analyses showed that T cells from PTPN3/PTPN4-double-deficient mice were able to differentiate along the Th1, Th2 and Th17 lineages to an extent comparable to that observed with T cells from wild-type mice. Similarly, T cells from PTPN13 &#x00394;PTP/&#x00394;PTP mice showed the same extent of differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells as T cells from wild-type mice, although showed increased differentiation along the Th2 cell lineage. These last results, therefore, differ from previous findings where increased Th1 differentiation as well as increased Th2 differentiation was reported in PTPN13-deficient mice.

In this regard, there has been considerable interest in two closely related PTP, PTPN3 and PTPN4, as potential novel negative-regulators of TCR signal transduction. Both PTP are able to dephosphorylate the TCR&#x003b6; chain <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Sozio1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Young1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, no abnormalities in T cell development or function were apparent in these mice. We hypothesized that the lack of a T cell phenotype could be explained by a functional redundancy of PTPN3 with PTPN4, since both PTP are expressed in T cells. Hence, in the current study, we generated PTPN4-deficient and PTPN3/PTPN4 double-deficient mice. Consistent with a recent report, T cell development and function was found to be normal in PTPN4-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Young1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, there was no apparent T cell phenotype in PTPN3/PTPN4 double-deficient mice either. Thus, PTPN4 does not compensate for the loss of PTPN3 in T cells and vice versa.</p><p>We further asked if the absence of a T cell phenotype in PTPN3/PTPN4 double-deficient mice could be explained by functional redundancy with PTPN13, which also contains FERM and PDZ domains, albeit that this PTP shows a low degree of homology to PTPN3 and PTPN4. Therefore, we generated PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient PTPN13 &#x00394;PTP/&#x00394;PTP mice that lack functional forms of all three PTP. Once again, T cell development and TCR-induced cytokine secretion and proliferation were found to be normal in these mice. In addition, since PTPN13 has previously been shown to inhibit Th1 and Th2 differentiation through dephosphorylation of STAT proteins, we examined T helper cell polarization in triple-mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Nakahira1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In comparison to T cells from control mice, T cells from triple-mutant mice showed normal differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells. An increased (not statistically significant) propensity of T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells was observed in triple-mutants. However, this increased Th2 differentiation was no greater in magnitude than that observed with PTPN13 &#x00394;PTP/&#x00394;PTP T cells. Thus, in conclusion, we have found no evidence for the notion that PTPN3 and PTPN4 function as negative-regulators of TCR signal transduction.</p><p>Functions for PTPN3 and PTPN4 outside of the immune system have been proposed. PTPN3 has been shown to dephosphorylate the growth hormone receptor (GHR) and one other group reported an increased weight gain amongst male PTPN3-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Pasquali1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Pilecka1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings suggest a role for PTPN3 as a negative-regulator of GHR signal transduction and body mass. However, counter to this, in our colony, we have not observed any increased growth of male or female PTPN3-deficient mice up to 18 months of age. Similarly, we have not observed any increased body mass of PTPN4-deficient or PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice in comparison with littermate controls (not shown). It is possible that this discrepancy can be explained in terms of differences in genetic background or the precise nature of genetic disruptions in PTPN3 mutant strains. With regards strain differences, PTPN3 mutant mice that we have studied include PTPN3 gene-trapped mice on a 129P2/Ola Hsd background and PTPN3 gene-targeted mice on a C57BL/6 background (neither show growth abnormalities) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Bauler1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, in the study in which an increased weight gain was reported for PTPN3-deficient males, mice were on a mixed 129 SvEv&#x000d7;C57BL/6 genetic background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Pilecka1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Concerning differences in the precise nature of disruptions, of the two PTPN3 mutant mice that were generated in our laboratory, we established by Western blotting that expression of PTPN3 protein was extinguished. By contrast, in the third PTPN3 mutant strain, although the nature of the genetic mutation precludes expression of catalytically-active PTPN3 protein, whether or not these mice express truncated forms of PTPN3 that contain only modular binding domains remains to be established.</p><p>Aside from growth, PTPN3 and PTPN4 have both been ascribed functions within the central nervous system. PTPN4 interacts with glutamate receptor subunits, which are required for neural development and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Hironaka1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with a neural role, PTPN4-deficient mice were shown to have impaired cerebellar function, including defective motor learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Kina1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In a recent report, PTPN3-deficient mice were also shown to have impaired memory function and motor learning, albeit that significant differences compared to controls were detected only in females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Patrignani1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, loss of expression of PTPMEG (the single homologue of PTPN3 and PTPN4 in this species) results in defective axon growth associated with impaired development of mushroom bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Whited1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, given these reports, we examined motor learning function in our own PTPN4 and PTPN3 single-deficient mice and in PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice. In an accelerated rotarod test, no difference in motor learning was noted in comparison with controls (not shown). For PTPN3, discrepancies might again be explained by differences in background strain or the precise nature of genetic disruptions. For PTPN4, only strain differences could be invoked to account for the discrepant findings. Thus, the PTPN4-deficient mice reported here are on a mixed 129 SvEv&#x000d7;C57BL/6 background whereas the PTPN4-deficient mice that were reported to exhibit motor learning defects are on a 129SvJ background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Kina1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In both types of PTPN4 mutant, although the precise nature of the genetic mutation differs, PTPN4 gene expression was shown to be extinguished.</p><p>In summary, we have thus far been unable to observe any phenotypic abnormalities in PTPN4-deficient, PTPN3-deficient or PTPN4/PTPN3 double-deficient mice either within or without the immune system. Thus, a physiological function for these PTP, that can be consistently demonstrated, awaits discovery. In considering potential other roles, it is of interest that human papillomaviruses specifically target FERM and PDZ domain-containing PTP for degradation during infection and transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Jing1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004014-Topffer1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. One possible explanation for this finding is that FERM and PDZ domain-containing PTP play a role in defense against this type of virus. Notwithstanding the fact that human papillomaviruses do not infect murine cells, discovery of the function of these PTP in papillomavirus infection could provide important clues as to their role in normal cellular physiology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank M.
