The <italic>accA</italic> and <italic>accD</italic> genes that code for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits, respectively, are not in an operon, yet yield an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> carboxyltransferase. Here, we report that carboxyltransferase regulates its own translation by binding the mRNA encoding its subunits. This interaction is mediated by a zinc finger on the &#x003b2;-subunit; mutation of the four cysteines to alanine diminished nucleic acid binding and catalytic activity. Carboxyltransferase binds the coding regions of both subunit mRNAs and inhibits translation, an inhibition that is relieved by the substrate acetyl-CoA. mRNA binding reciprocally inhibits catalytic activity. Preferential binding of carboxyltransferase to RNA <italic>in situ</italic> was shown using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We propose an unusual regulatory mechanism by which carboxyltransferase acts as a &#x02018;dimmer switch&#x02019; to regulate protein production and catalytic activity, while sensing the metabolic state of the cell through acetyl-CoA concentration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase, EC 6.4.1.2) catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis in all organisms. The overall reaction is the biotin-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA and it takes place in two separate half-reactions.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkp1079i2.jpg"/></p><p>The first half-reaction is catalyzed by biotin carboxylase, where ATP is used to activate bicarbonate for carboxylation of biotin. The natural substrate is the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (designated as Enzyme-biotin in the above scheme). The second half-reaction, catalyzed by carboxyltransferase, transfers the activated carboxyl group from carboxybiotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. In eukaryotes, each of the three different proteins, biotin carboxylase, biotin carboxyl carrier protein and carboxyltransferase form individual domains in a single polypeptide chain. In contrast, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> encodes separate polypeptides generating a homodimeric biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) and an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> heterotetrameric carboxyltransferase (CT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Because the reaction involves two separate half-reactions, coordinated expression of the genes coding for the various subunits of bacterial ACCase is essential in order to achieve efficient conversion of substrate to product. This is readily accomplished for the first half-reaction because the genes coding for biotin carboxylase (<italic>accC</italic>) and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (<italic>accB</italic>) are in a single operon that is transcriptionally controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, the genes encoding the CT &#x003b1; (<italic>accA</italic>) and CT &#x003b2; (<italic>accD</italic>) subunits are not in an operon, but are found on nearly opposite poles of the chromosome (4.5&#x02032; and 52.4&#x02032;, respectively) in opposing directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Yet, the expression of <italic>accA</italic> and <italic>accD</italic> should yield stoichiometric amounts of the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits to form the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> heterotetramer of CT. Sequence analyses reveal no obvious clues to a mechanism of concerted expression of <italic>accA</italic> and <italic>accD</italic>, however, an alternative to transcriptional control for modulating expression of <italic>accA</italic> and <italic>accD</italic> has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structures of both <italic>E. coli</italic> (PDB: 2f9y) and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (PDB: 2f9i) CT reveal a Cys<sub>4</sub>-type zinc ribbon motif on the &#x003b2;-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The zinc domain forms part of a saddle-like structure with a net electropositive surface potential, whereas the rest of the protein has a net electronegative surface potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Zinc-finger domains are commonly associated with nucleic acid-binding proteins and previous studies have shown that CT does bind DNA, albeit non-specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Notably, DNA binding inhibited catalysis while the substrates inhibited DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In other words, DNA binding and catalysis are reciprocally related, implying a physiological role for nucleic acid binding. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The Cys<sub>4</sub>-type Zn ribbon of <italic>E. coli</italic> carboxyltransferase with the Zn atom shown in gray coordinated by four cysteine residues (PDBID: 2f9y).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp1079f1"/></fig></p><p>In this report, we show that an unusual regulatory mechanism exists by which CT autoregulates activity in response to metabolic needs. Specifically, we show that the zinc domain of CT is not only required for catalysis, but that it also mediates binding to the mRNA coding for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits of carboxyltransferase so that CT can act as a &#x02018;dimmer switch&#x02019; to regulate translation. These properties of the zinc domain, which is unique to bacterial CT, provide a mechanism for regulating enzymatic activity and for coordinating expression of the genes coding for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits of carboxyltransferase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs.

Complementary oligonucleotides containing specific alterations in the nucleotide sequence (e.g. C30A5 and C30A3) were used to generate two DNA fragments having overlapping ends.

The resultant mRNA was purified according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions with the MEGAclear Kit (Ambion) and eluted in 100 &#x000b5;l, to which was added 20 &#x000b5;l of 80% glycerol and 20 &#x000b5;l of 10 &#x000d7; EMSA buffer (200 mM Tris&#x02013;Cl at pH 8.0, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Seven microliter of this solution was added to each 10 &#x000b5;l reaction, with CT titrated from 0 to 1 &#x000b5;M in the remaining 3 &#x000b5;l. For the inhibition of RNA binding, acetyl-CoA was titrated from 0 to 4.0 mM. Reactions were incubated on ice for 0.5 h. Samples were loaded with the power on onto prerun 5.0% (w/v) native polyacrylamide gels (39: 1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and electrophoresed at room temperature in TBE buffer (45 mM Tris borate at pH 8.3, 1.25 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA). After 3&#x02013;6 h of electrophoresis, the gels were dried and complexes were visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software. The protein&#x02013;RNA complex was defined as the slowest migrating band on the gel, while free RNA was the lower band. For calculating percent complex formation, the region on the gel from the slowest migrating complex to the free nucleic acid was considered as complex. The percent complex was calculated as complex intensity divided by total intensity (complex plus free RNA).

The EasyXpress Protein Synthesis System (Qiagen) was used following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol with 1 &#x000b5;g (&#x0223c;10 nM) plasmid or unlabeled mRNA as templates. To examine the effect of CT on the expression of both genes simultaneously, pCZB5 was used as a template. The plasmid pCZB5 is an expression vector of similar construction to pGDM9 and contains the <italic>accA</italic> and <italic>accD</italic> genes in tandem with high levels of overexpression from those genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The ability of CT to attenuate translation of only the mRNA for the &#x003b2;-subunit utilized the vector pGLW39, which contains only the <italic>accD</italic> gene cloned into pET28.

The gene for eYFP was amplified with primers eYFP5 and eYFP3, digested with XhoI and PacI, and cloned into equivalently digested pGDM9 and pGDM18 to generate pGDM24 and pGDM25, respectively. The use of XhoI and PacI restriction sites eliminates the vector-encoded His<sub>6</sub>-tag and stop codon, while placing the stop codon following the coding region for the CT &#x003b2;-eYFP fusion protein. Plasmid pGDM24 contains wild-type CT-eYFP fusion and pGDM25 contains the quadruple cysteine variant of CT-eYFP fusion. <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmids pGDM24 and pGDM25 were grown at 37&#x000b0;C until the A<sub>600</sub> reached 0.7, at which point lactose was added to 28 mM. Samples of 100 &#x000b5;l were collected just prior to induction with lactose, and every 0.5 h afterward for 3 h and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Each sample was then thawed and divided equally into thirds. The divided samples were either left as is, subjected to 0.3 &#x000b5;g/&#x000b5;l RNase A (Qiagen), or 1.0 U/&#x000b5;l DNase I for 0.5 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Sytox Orange is a high-affinity nucleic acid stain that readily enters cells with compromised membranes. The dye was added to control and nuclease treated cells to a final concentration of 250 nM. There is considerable overlap of YFP emission and Sytox Orange absorption spectra; the F&#x000f6;erster distance (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>) is 5.6 nm. Spectra were collected using a Jasco FP-6300 spectrofluorometer equipped to hold a 3 &#x000d7; 3 mm quartz cuvette. A 500 nm incident light was used to achieve sufficient FRET with minimal direct excitation of the acceptor. Emission spectra were measured perpendicular to the incident light at 540&#x02013;600 nm to avoid the peak due to refracted light and to sufficiently span the absorption maximum of 573 nm when the stain is bound to nucleic acid. Each assay was done in triplicate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>The Zn domain is required for catalysis and nucleic acid binding</title><p>The Zn finger of CT is a member of the Cys<sub>4</sub>-type family, with the divalent metal coordinated in a tetrahedral fashion by four cysteine sulfhydryl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Reaction of NEM with the most active single-site variants (C27A, C46A and C49A) showed less susceptibility to NEM when normalized and compared to wild-type (data not shown), which is consistent with NEM modifying these cysteine residues in the zinc domain and in turn affecting enzymatic activity.

The effects of the mutations on catalysis and nucleic acid binding are likely due to loss of the zinc atom and alteration in secondary structure and they clearly demonstrate that the zinc domain is the structural feature of CT that links nucleic acid binding with catalysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Carboxyltransferase binds preferentially to the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunit mRNA</title><p>Earlier DNA binding studies showed that DNA binding was non-specific and cooperative with half-maximal saturation of about 1 &#x000b5;M for a variety of DNA sequences, indicating that DNA binding was not likely to be the physiological role of the zinc domain of carboxyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, considering that the closest structural homolog of the carboxyltransferase Zn-domain is the zinc domain from the 50S ribosomal protein L37Ae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), the ability of carboxyltransferase to bind RNA was investigated. Four different types of RNA were tested for their ability to inhibit formation of the CT&#x02013;DNA complex. The RNA molecules considered included mRNA coding for the &#x003b1;-subunit, mRNA coding for the &#x003b2;-subunit, a total RNA extract from <italic>E. coli</italic>, and tRNA from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. All four types of RNA were found to inhibit formation of the CT&#x02013;DNA complex (data not shown). Notably, a qualitative comparison of the data showed that mRNA coding for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits inhibited complex formation more effectively. A transcript including the &#x003b1;-subunit mRNA starting 213 nt upstream of the AUG through the end of the structural gene was therefore used in an EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to the sigmoidal binding isotherm obtained for carboxyltransferase binding to DNA, fractional carboxyltransferase&#x02013;RNA complex formation is best fit to a hyperbolic curve, yielding a half-maximal binding constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of 145 &#x000b1; 9 nM, which is about 7-fold lower than the half-maximal saturation for DNA binding. When the data were fitted to the Hill equation a Hill coefficient of &#x0223c;1 was calculated, indicating a lack of cooperativity (not shown). Moreover, the data were also analyzed according to Hensley <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), which uses various linear transformations to detect a low degree of positive cooperativity. These analyses also indicate that the degree of cooperativity for subunit mRNA binding to carboxyltransferase is either very small or nonexistent.

Two additional templates were constructed consisting of only the regions from each gene representing this symmetry box to determine whether these regions are not only necessary, but sufficient for CT binding. Neither transcript had any affinity for CT, indicating that regions upstream of the symmetry box are also necessary for CT binding.

The decrease in expression in the presence of unlabeled CT is not due to an inhibition of transcription because CT also inhibited translation when an mRNA transcript was used to initiate expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4). The inhibition of translation was partially reversed by the addition of the substrate acetyl-CoA, indicating a reversible competition between mRNA and substrate and consistent with the notion that nucleic acid binding and catalysis are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 11&#x02013;15). To ensure that CT binding to &#x003b1; mRNA does not affect translation of the &#x003b2;-subunit, the ability of CT to inhibit translation of the &#x003b2;-subunit mRNA was examined.

To address this issue, a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) assay was used. The assay is based on the work of Lorenz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and utilized eYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) fused to wildtype or the quadruple variant of CT &#x003b2; as the donor and the nucleic acid stain Sytox Orange as the acceptor.

After 0&#x02013;3 h, samples were freeze-thawed followed by various nuclease digestions. Sytox Orange was added to the treated cells and fluorescence was measured to determine proximity of CT &#x003b2;-eYFP to nucleic acid-bound stain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> a FRET signal was observed only after induction of protein expression (blue trace). The maximal signal occurred 1 h after induction with no change up to 3 h post-induction. Little to no signal was detected prior to induction (purple trace). Since Sytox Orange can also bind to DNA, cells were treated with DNase or RNase in order to confirm the signal is a result of RNA interaction. Treatment with DNase I had little effect on the fluorescence signal (red trace); however, digestion with RNase A attenuated the signal to near pre-induction levels (green trace). The quadruple variant-eYFP fusion protein showed no FRET signal consistent with its inability to bind nucleic acids (orange trace).

The coupling of nucleic acid binding to catalysis implies a selective pressure to maintain the zinc domain on the &#x003b2;-subunit and that the ability to bind nucleic acids has a specific purpose; consistent with this inference, we find that CT binds RNA <italic>in situ</italic>. Notably, <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses demonstrate that CT preferentially binds the mRNA encoding its own &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits, implying the existence of an uncommon regulatory mechanism.</p><p>The binding of CT to the mRNA coding for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits inhibited translation in a dose-dependent manner, while the substrate acetyl-CoA inhibited RNA binding and relieved the inhibition of translation also in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with the coupled nature of nucleic acid binding and catalysis by CT, the mRNA also inhibited catalysis. These findings indicate a physiological role for the zinc domain in regulating not only production of the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits of CT, but also its enzymatic activity. The basic premise of the model of regulation illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> is that in bacteria, fatty acids are only used for membrane biogenesis, hence carboxyltransferase is only needed when nutrients are abundant. In contrast, during the stationary phase of <italic>E. coli</italic> growth where nutrients are limited, carboxyltransferase would act as a &#x02018;dimmer switch&#x02019; on the expression of the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits by binding to the mRNA and inhibiting translation. Reciprocally, RNA binding by CT renders it catalytically inactive, limiting unneeded and wasteful conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. During the growth phase when nutrients are abundant, the level of acetyl-CoA would increase dramatically and compete with the mRNA for binding to carboxyltransferase. This alleviates both the inhibition of catalytic activity and the repression of translation characteristic of stationary phase, leading to increased levels of CT and ultimately fatty acids. The levels of acetyl-CoA in <italic>E. coli</italic> during the log phase (600 &#x000b5;M) and stationary phase (20 &#x000b5;M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) are in accord with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, because relief of translational repression was observed at 350 &#x000b5;M acetyl-CoA, whereas very little protein production was observed at 88 &#x000b5;M acetyl-CoA. This model of regulation is also consistent with reports that levels of the mRNA coding for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits do not change appreciably between the log and stationary phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism for autoregulation of CT enzymatic activity and mRNA translation. The RNA-binding and catalytic functions of CT are sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell. During stationary phase when <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis is unneeded, glucose and thus acetyl-CoA levels are low, allowing CT to bind the mRNA for its subunits, attenuating expression of the enzyme as well as enzymatic activity on remaining acetyl-CoA stores. During log phase growth membrane biogenesis is needed. Glucose is abundant, increasing the availability of acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. Acetyl-CoA binds to CT permitting translation of the mRNA for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits. This &#x02018;dimmer switch&#x02019; model gives the cell a means of rapid response to changes in cellular metabolic state.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp1079f8"/></fig></p><p>The model of regulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> also provides a plausible explanation for how the cell maintains stoichiometric amounts of the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits. Instead of transcriptional control of gene expression of the genes for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits, bacteria appear to utilize translational repression where CT binds to the mRNA for both of its subunits.</p><p>The mechanism of gene regulation proposed here is not without precedent. For example, thymidylate synthase from both <italic>E. coli</italic> and humans contains a Cys<sub>4</sub>-type zinc-binding motif and binds its own mRNA within the protein-coding region, repressing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Also, it is important to note that this type of regulation is not found in eukaryotic carboxyltransferase because the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits are fused to one another as well as to the BC and BCCP components to form one polypeptide chain and because the zinc domain is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The one exception to the multidomain homomeric ACCase found in eukaryotes is the heteromeric ACCase found in plastids. The chloroplast ACCase of all plants except for the grasses (<italic>Graminae</italic>) consists of the same four subunits as <italic>E. coli</italic> ACCase, but their genetic origins are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The BC, BCCP and CT &#x003b1; peptides originate from nuclear-encoded genes and are shuttled to the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). The CT &#x003b2; protein, however, is expressed from a chloroplast-encoded gene, and like the <italic>E. coli accD</italic> gene, encodes a Cys<sub>4</sub>-type zinc-binding domain, which is consistent with the theory that chloroplasts evolved from bacterial symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Perhaps the zinc domain in chloroplast CT &#x003b2; binds to the ;&#x003b2; mRNA to regulate translation in a manner similar to the model presented here for <italic>E. coli</italic> CT.</p></sec><sec><title>A symmetry-based model</title><p>The fundamental tenet of the gene regulation model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> rests on the ability of CT to bind the mRNA encoding both &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits. The molecular basis of how it does so is rooted in the symmetry of the chemical mechanism and 3D structure of CT. Transfer of the carboxyl group from carboxybiotin to acetyl-CoA involves formation of enolate or enolate-like anions in both carboxybiotin and acetyl-CoA. To this end, both the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits have evolved tertiary folds that stabilize oxyanions. Acetyl-CoA binds to the &#x003b2;-subunit, while carboxybiotin binds to the &#x003b1;-subunit and the tertiary structure of both the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits contain a similar &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; spiral core of two &#x003b2;-sheets surrounded by &#x003b1;-helices suggesting a gene duplication event. This type of fold places carboxyltransferase in the crotonase superfamily of enzymes whose members all catalyze reactions that generate enolate anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Within the spiral core of both the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits of CT are oxyanion holes formed by main chain amides from glycine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The regions of the mRNA for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits that bind to CT also reveal a symmetrical pattern. CT binds only to the coding region of the mRNA of the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits, a region that included the symmetry box, which corresponds to the spiral core of the tertiary structure containing the oxyanion holes. While the symmetry box is required for CT binding, it is not sufficient. The mRNA upstream of the symmetry box is also needed for binding, probably to achieve the proper 3D fold of mRNA to interact with CT. This observation is consistent with the notion that mRNA sequences close to the start site are more likely to be involved in regulatory events. Thus, while there are numerous examples of how the chemistry of a reaction drives the evolution of enzyme structure, the results presented here for carboxyltransferase not only suggest a physiological role for the zinc domain but also extend the concept of chemistry directing enzyme evolution to also include directing the mechanism of gene regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1079/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: National Science Foundation (MCB-0841134 to G.L.W.).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
