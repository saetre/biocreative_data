DA neuron induction can be achieved by co-culturing ESC with the mouse stromal cell lines PA6 or MS5. The molecular nature of this effect, which has been termed &#x0201c;SDIA&#x0201d; is so far unknown. Recently, we found that factors secreted by PA6 cells provided lineage-specific instructions to induce DA differentiation of human ESC (hESC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In the present study, we compared PA6 cells to various cell lines lacking the SDIA effect, and employed genome expression analysis to identify differentially-expressed signaling molecules. Among the factors highly expressed by PA6 cells, and known to be associated with CNS development, were stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), pleiotrophin (PTN), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), and ephrin B1 (EFNB1). When these four factors, the combination of which was termed SPIE, were applied to hESC, they induced differentiation to TH-positive neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. RT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed the expression of midbrain specific markers, including engrailed 1, Nurr1, Pitx3, and dopamine transporter (DAT) in cultures influenced by these four molecules. Electrophysiological recordings showed that treatment of hESC with SPIE induced differentiation of neurons that were capable of generating action potentials and forming functional synaptic connections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The combination of SDF-1, PTN, IGF2, and EFNB1 mimics the DA phenotype-inducing property of SDIA and was sufficient to promote differentiation of hESC to functional midbrain DA neurons. These findings provide a method for differentiating hESC to form DA neurons, without a requirement for the use of animal-derived cell lines or products.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is a great interest in the possibility of using human embryonic stem cells (hESC) to produce specific cell types which might be used either in cellular therapy or as <italic>in vitro</italic> models of human cells. Among the most interesting cell types that can be derived from hESC are DA neurons, both because of their potential use as a therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), and as <italic>in vitro</italic> models for testing drugs relevant to neurodegenerative disorders, drug abuse, and addiction.</p><p>A number of groups have reported on directing hESC to differentiate into dopamine (DA) neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Schulz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Schulz2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The most commonly-used technique for producing DA neurons from ESC requires a co-culture step, most often using stromal cells such as the mouse PA6 cell line, but in some cases human astrocytes or other cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Kawasaki1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Chiba1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Often, patterning factors including SHH and FGF8 are employed, but these factors are effective only following an early induction step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Lee1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Lau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. A second method involves the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), in which case internal factors, produced by hESC, are presumably responsible for the early induction phase. This approach involves a complex series of procedures including enzymatic digestion and various isolation techniques followed by SHH and FGF8 exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Yan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Cho1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The biochemical nature of the initial stage of differentiation is unknown, and whether this activity is related to the SHH-FGF8 signaling system or the organizing stimulus remains to be elucidated. Upon discovery of SDIA, it was suggested that this activity accumulates on the surface of PA6 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Kawasaki1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Other studies have suggested a role of PA6 cell-secreted factors in the DA differentiation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Yamazoe1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In a recent study, we analyzed the effects of PA6 cell surface activity and secreted factors separately, and concluded that secreted factors are primarily responsible for the DA-inducing effect, whereas cell surface activity enhanced cell survival and overall neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Vazin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In view of these findings, we carried out gene expression profiling of PA6 cells to identify genes coding for soluble factors with a potential role in the DA induction of hESC. In order to select the most relevant set of molecules, we conducted comparisons between the potent PA6 cell line and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), a mouse kidney cell line MM55K, and subtypes of PA6 and MS5 lines that lack DA-inducing activity.</p><p>For clarity, we will refer to the potent PA6 cell line as PA6-DA, and PA6 subtypes as PA6-X1 and PA6-X for the remainder of this paper. The transformation of the PA6-DA cells to the PA6-X cell phenotype was an unpredictable event and unrelated to the number of passages in culture. Once transformed to the PA6-X phenotype, reversion to the PA6-DA morphological phenotype did not occur. On the basis of the gene expression analysis, we selected a set of candidate genes, including SDF-1, PTN, IGF2, Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), and EFNB1, and examined the role of molecules encoded by these genes in DA induction of hESC <italic>in vitro</italic>. The four factors SDF-1, PTN, IGF2, and EFNB1 were sufficient to induce hESC to differentiate to DA neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Mitotically-inactivated MEF feeder layers (Millipore, Billerica, U.

The majority of these genes were also significantly up-regulated in PA6-DA cells as compared to the transformed stromal cell lines, PA6-X1, MS5, and the MM55K and MEF cells. Biological processes were available for 159 of the 288 genes analyzed using the FatiGO web tool. The functions of these genes included 50 different categories at the most basic level.</p><p>In order to identify genes involved in biological processes and pathways related to CNS development among the 288 up-regulated genes, we performed a more advanced gene ontology analysis using the FatiGO web tool at specificity level six, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006606-t001">Table 1</xref>. By focusing on soluble secretory molecules and gene products with a possible role in CNS development and regulation of neurogenesis, we identified stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), pleiotrophin (PTN), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), and ephrin B1 (EFNB1) as factors potentially responsible for DA inducing activity. This combination of factors was termed &#x0201c;SPIE&#x0201d;, as it was eventually determined that IGFBP4 was unnecessary (see below). These genes were among the most up-regulated in PA6-DA cells as compared to PA6-X or MM55K cells, each having a seven-fold or greater Z-ratio.

We selected a combination of five transcripts that were highly expressed in the PA6-DA cells, including SDF-1, PTN IGF2, IGFBP4, and EFNB1, as potential DA-promoting elements. In the presence of these molecules, the majority of hESC-derived EBs differentiated into Msx1&#x0002b; mesencephalic neural progenitor cells and TH&#x0002b; neurons after 10&#x02013;14 days, clearly mimicking the SDIA effect.</p><p>Application of the selected molecules to EBs derived from two karyotypically normal hESC lines, BG02 and BG03, provided further evidence that these compounds were indeed capable of initiating the process of DA differentiation. Although the three hESC lines tested with the selected factors, BG01V2, BG02, and BG03, showed substantial differences in their baseline degree of differentiation in the absence of the molecules, TH expression was consistently increased by SPIE treatment in all three lines. Importantly, the cellular morphology of the TH&#x0002b; cells generated by SPIE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006606-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>) was similar to that of TH&#x0002b; cells derived by the SDIA method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Vazin2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The survival of the BG02 hESC line under these conditions was very limited as compared to that of the BG01V2 and BG03 cell lines, and treatment of BG02-derived EBs with SPIE did not result in expression of Msx1. We believe that there are differences in the nature of various hESC lines, and that BG02 might require different culture conditions, concentrations of factors, or additional extrinsic signaling to differentiate to midbrain specific DA neurons. Indeed, other studies have also reported a striking difference between neural and DA induction of various hESC on mouse stromal cell lines including PA6 and MS5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Park1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Sonntag1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also observed (unpublished data) that differences between BG01V2, BG02, and BG03 cells in DA differentiation capacity are similar to those seen in the present study when differentiated using SDIA or the method of Yan and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Yan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We also assessed the individual contributions of each of the five factors and found that inclusion of IGFBP4 decreased the survival of differentiating midbrain NPC, and that IGFBP4 was not necessary for DA induction of hESC. IGF2 and PTN increased the number of surviving colonies and TH&#x0002b; neurons, respectively, while SDF-1 and EFNB1 appeared to be required for specification of DA neurons. Thus, the combination of the four factors SDF-1, PTN, IGF2, and EFNB-1 termed &#x0201c;SPIE&#x0201d;, can to some degree mimic SDIA and produce a high yield of TH<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons from hESC in the presence of heparin.</p><p>Previously published Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) analyses of hESC gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Freed1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Brimble1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> were examined to determine whether the SPIE receptors are expressed in hESC.

Expression of ephrin B1 receptors EPHB2 and EPHB4 was also detected in undifferentiated hESC. Differentiation increased expression of EPHB2 and EPHB3.

The varying levels of expression of these receptors suggests the possibility that the various components of SPIE may be required at different stages of differentiation, a possibility that we have not yet tested.</p><p>Induction of a midbrain DA phenotype by SPIE was confirmed by the expression of midbrain specific markers including Lmx1b, which is present during early specification of DA precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Smidt1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, Pitx3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Nunes1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and En1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Simon1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, neurons differentiated from hESC by SPIE exhibited electrical excitability, generated action potentials, and spontaneous, miniature postsynaptic currents which reflects establishment of functional synaptic networks.</p><p>It is interesting that there are two apparently unrelated procedures for differentiating mesencephalic DA neurons from hESC; techniques involving SDIA or SPIE, and the method of Yan and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Yan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Although both SPIE and the Yan et. al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Yan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> techniques employ an EB formation phase, the treatment protocols and growth factors which are employed are quite different.

Cells produced by the two methods are also similar in that they express markers of mesencephalic DA neurons.

SERPINE2 protein is highly expressed in a variety of brain regions including the striatum during nervous system development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Mansuy1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. SERPINE2 was up-regulated, by a Z-ratio of more than three, in PA6-DA cells in comparison with the transformed PA6, MS5, and MM55K cells. However, PA6-DA and MEF cells showed nearly equal expression of SERPINE2. This gene product was not tested for neural or DA induction of hESC.</p><p>Another heparin binding factor, differentially expressed by PA6 cells was FGF-10, which is not considered to have a role in CNS development. Nonetheless the introduction of FGF10 to chick embryos up-regulated FGF8 expression in the ectoderm through Wnt3a signaling and stimulated SHH expression in the posterior mesoderm followed by outgrowth initiation of chick limb structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Ohuchi1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Kawakami1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. These interactions of FGF10 with well-known midbrain patterning cues suggests that this factor may be involved in FGF8 and SHH signaling to enhance DA neurogenesis. Effects of FGF10 on DA induction were also not tested.</p><p>The chemokine SDF-1 was originally identified in the immune system and induces leukocyte chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Bleul1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

Up-regulation of SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 was also observed during differentiation of neural stem cells into more restricted precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Luo2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, a very recent study by Edman and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Klein1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated expression of two other &#x003b1;-chemokines, CXCL1 and CXCL6, in developing rodent ventral midbrain and suggested that these factors have a regulatory role in the development of the midbrain DA cell population.</p><p>IGFs and their carriers, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) are widely expressed throughout the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Edman1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Bondy1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

An indication of the involvement of IGF2 in differentiation of mesencephalic neural progenitor cells from hESC was recently obtained by our previous MPSS analysis of gene expression in PSA-NCAM&#x0002b; neuronal precursors derived by SDIA. The IGF2 and H19 transcripts were most abundant of the 11,912 distinct sequences detected. IGF2 expression was also found in laser-captured dopamine neurons from human postmortem brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Freed1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Transport and bioactivity of IGFs are regulated by six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Jones1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to IGF2, we found elevated expression of IGFBP4 in PA6-DA cells. Although there are reports of elevation of IGFBP4 expression in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Brar1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref> and neural precursors enriched from the human fetus during brain development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Yu1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, the physiological role and signaling pathways of IGFBP4 in neuronal differentiation are unknown. Co-localization of IGF2 and IGFBP4 mRNAs as revealed by in situ hybridization studies suggests a correlation between these two proteins in the developing embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Pintar1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. We believe that involvement of IGFBP4 in the SDIA effect may be linked to regulation of IGF2 activity, and in our study, IGFBP4 seemed to decrease the survival of differentiating NPC.</p><p>Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands are essential for migration and cell interactions of many cell types during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Palmer1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Davy1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. B-class ephrins are transmembrane proteins which bind EphB receptors. Ephrin B1 acts both as a ligand and as a receptor in a tissue-specific manner during embryogenesis and is critically important in many biological processes including axon guidance, neural crest migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Davy1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Santiago1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of ephrin B1 in directing neuronal patterning in neural stem cells has not been tested. However, another member of the ephrin family, ephrin B2, and its receptor EphB1, have been found in midbrain DA neuronal cells, where ephrin B2 induced cell loss of substantia nigra, but not ventral tegmental DA neurons, suggesting a role of this ligand-receptor pair in specification of the nigrostriatal pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Yue2">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. In our previous study where the contributions of cell surface and soluble factors to the SDIA effect was examined, we found that PA6 cell surface factors promoted cell survival and enhanced overall neurogenesis of hESC, rather than providing lineage-specific instructions. Nevertheless, the presence of cell surface factors enhanced the survival of hESC during differentiation, which led to an increase in the overall yield of DA neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Vazin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, DA differentiation in cultures of hESC treated with factors secreted from PA6 cells plus heparin was relatively less effective as compared to co-cultures with intact PA6 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Vazin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This discrepancy may be due to a progressive loss of activity of the secreted signaling factors. Also, when PA6 cell surfaces were tested for SDIA, paraformaldehyde was used to kill the PA6 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Vazin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The fixation may have damaged membrane bound factors or the extracellular domain of transmembrane proteins such as ephrin B1, masking the potential role of these molecules in DA differentiation. Thus, although ephrin B1 is not a soluble secreted factor, we chose to examine its role in DA neurogenesis.</p><p>The combination of four factors, currently termed SPIE, was able to reproduce the effect of SDIA, however, the possibility that additional signaling molecules would further enhance DA induction from hESC cannot be excluded. Several other factors were up-regulated, but to a significantly lesser degree. These included members of the TGF-&#x003b2; family and factors involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. It has been suggested that these factors play a critical role in controlling neuronal fate and the establishment of the DA phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-Farkas1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-CasteloBranco1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. It also may be that additional factors would need to be added to SPIE to avoid the requirement for the use of an EB induction phase, as was employed in the current protocol.</p><p>It should also be noted that we detected significantly higher levels of the soluble Wnt inhibitor secreted Frizzled-related protein 1(sFRP-1) in PA6-DA cells, which is suggested to have an inhibitory effect on ventral midbrain neuronal development (Z-ratio&#x0003e;14) than sFRP-2, which promotes DA neurogenesis and maturation (Z-ratio&#x0003e;3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006606-KeleOlovsson1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, these soluble factors might modulate the Wnt signaling pathway in a different way during earlier stages of development, and thus could also play a role in SDIA.</p><p>In summary, our findings constitute a simple system for the induction and differentiation of hESC into DA neurons in a culture system free of xenogenic cells or material. Future investigations of the biological effect and mechanism of action of these factors is likely to increase our understanding of the molecular signaling that controls DA neuron differentiation from hESC, ultimately contributing to the advancement of cellular replacement strategies for treatment of PD. It should also be mentioned that the risk of tumor formation arising from an undifferentiated population of transplanted cells would need to be assessed, and methods enhancing post-implantation cell survival would need to be developed, before SPIE could be employed as a transplantation strategy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006606.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>PCR primer sets.</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006606.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006606.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Genes differentially expressed in PA6-DA cells.
