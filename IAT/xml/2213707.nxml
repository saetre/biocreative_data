The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> divides using an actomyosin-based contractile ring and is an attractive model for the study of the links between mitosis and cytokinesis. In fission yeast, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and the septation initiation network (SIN), a spindle pole body (SPB)&#x02013;associated GTPase-driven signaling cascade, function sequentially to ensure proper coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis. Here, we find a novel interplay between the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain&#x02013;containing subunit of the APC/C, Nuc2p, and the SIN, that appears to not involve other subunits of the APC/C. Overproduction of Nuc2p led to an increase in the presence of multinucleated cells, which correlated with a defect in actomyosin ring maintenance and localization of the SIN component protein kinases Cdc7p and Sid1p to the SPBs, indicative of defective SIN signaling. Conversely, loss of Nuc2p function led to increased SIN signaling, characterized by the persistent localization of Cdc7p and Sid1p on SPBs and assembly of multiple actomyosin rings and division septa. Nuc2p appears to function independently of the checkpoint with FHA and ring finger (CHFR)&#x02013;related protein Dma1p, a known inhibitor of the SIN in fission yeast. Genetic and biochemical analyses established that Nuc2p might influence the nucleotide state of Spg1p GTPase, a key regulator of the SIN. We propose that Nuc2p, by inhibiting the SIN after cell division, prevents further deleterious cytokinetic events, thereby contributing to genome stability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cytokinesis is the process by which a mother cell is physically partitioned into two daughter cells. Cytokinesis is well coordinated with segregation of the genetic material to ensure that the genome is not damaged by the cell division apparatus. How untimely cytokinesis is prevented is not fully understood, and is a topic of current interest. Studies of the mechanisms of segregation of the genetic material and cytokinesis have benefited extensively from the use of the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe.</italic> In this study, we make the discovery that fission yeast Nuc2p, a protein previously known to form part of a multi-protein machine that regulates genome segregation, has a second function in regulating cytokinesis. Nuc2p appears to dampen the septation initiation network, which is an important signaling pathway that is essential for cytokinesis. Thus, Nuc2p prevents the occurrence of cytokinetic events prior to segregation of the genetic material and thereby contributes to genome stability. Since the multi-component machinery that Nuc2p forms part of, as well as Nuc2p itself, has relatives in essentially all eukaryotic cells, a similar mechanism might operate in other cells as well.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Chew TG, Balasubramanian MK (2008) Nuc2p, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex, inhibits septation initiation network following cytokinesis in fission yeast.

Since cyclin proteolysis as well as CDK inactivation is sufficient for completion of cytokinesis, it was possible that the multiseptated phenotype we observed was purely due to partial proteolysis of cyclin B and/or re-entry into a subsequent round of mitosis. To address if Nuc2p played a role in the regulation of cytokinesis after execution of its function in mitotic exit, we inactivated Nuc2p function after passage through anaphase. To this end, we generated a <italic>nuc2</italic>-663 <italic>nda3</italic>-KM311 strain so as to allow for the inactivation of Nuc2p function following anaphase.

Under these conditions, at least 50&#x00025; of cells arrested at metaphase due to the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Subsequently, these cells were shifted to 32 &#x000b0;C to inactivate Nuc2p function and to reactivate Nda3p function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040017-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Since reactivation of Nda3p function (based on the immediate assembly of the mitotic spindle and 40&#x00025; of total cells formed an elongated anaphase spindle after 45 min at 32 &#x000b0;C) occurred more rapidly than the inactivation of Nuc2p, <italic>nuc2-</italic>663 <italic>nda3-</italic>KM311 (and the control <italic>nda3-</italic>KM311) underwent anaphase and septation. Interestingly, maintenance of <italic>nuc2-</italic>663 <italic>nda3-</italic>KM311 at 32 &#x000b0;C led to the accumulation of cells that either formed multiple septa, or deposited excessive septum material in the vicinity of the first septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040017-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040017-g002">2</xref>C, cells i&#x02013;iii).

Interestingly, overproduction of Nuc2p has been shown to cause defects in cytokinesis (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040017-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; and this study). Furthermore, overproduction of Nuc2p leads to defects in actomyosin ring maintenance and localization of Cdc7p, Sid1p, and Sid2p to the SPB, suggestive of defective SIN signaling. Thus, while <italic>nuc2</italic> mutants phenocopy <italic>cdc16</italic> mutants (in which SIN is constitutively active), overproduction of Nuc2p leads to a phenotype indistinguishable from that displayed by SIN-defective mutants. These results imply that Nuc2p might be a bona fide inhibitor of the SIN. Interestingly, whereas activation of SIN, by loss of Cdc16p function, promotes events of cytokinesis (actomyosin ring and division septum assembly) in premitotic interphase arrested cells, the loss of Nuc2p function in premitotic interphase does not lead to actomyosin ring and septum assembly. Thus, although Nuc2p appears to be an inhibitor of the SIN, Nuc2p might inhibit SIN specifically after cell division.</p><p>How does Nuc2p inhibit the SIN? Cells overexpressing Nuc2p phenocopy mutants defective in SIN function, which is a Spg1p GTPase driven signaling cascade. Interestingly, the localization of the upstream components of SIN, Cdc11p, Sid4p and Spg1p are not altered upon overproduction of Nuc2p. The increased level of Nuc2p, however, specifically affects the localization of downstream kinases: Cdc7p, Sid1p and Sid2p. Since Spg1p, but not its effectors Cdc7p and Sid1p, remains at the SPB, after Nuc2p overexpression, it can be speculated that the Spg1p in cells overexpressing Nuc2p is GDP-bound. Consistent with this, we have found that the physical interaction between Cdc7p and Spg1p is dramatically reduced in cells overproducing Nuc2p. Two possibilities can be envisaged for the mechanisms that maintain Spg1p in GDP-bound form. First, it is possible that overexpression of Nuc2p inhibits a putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Spg1p, thereby preventing the loading of GTP onto Spg1p and the activation of SIN signaling. The second possibility is that Nuc2p promotes the activation of the two-component GTPase activating protein (GAP), Cdc16p-Byr4p, leading to the conversion of GTP-Spg1p into GDP-Spg1p. We do not favour the first possibility since no guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Spg1p has been identified to date. Our genetic analysis (restoration of Cdc7p localization and septum assembly in <italic>cdc16</italic>-116 cells overproducing Nuc2p) points to the second possibility that Nuc2p might function as an activator of Cdc16p-Byr4p. However, it also remains possible that Nuc2p might prevent the conversion of GDP-Spg1p to GTP-Spg1p by acting as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). Future studies should test these possibilities.</p><p>What is the physiological function of the inhibition of SIN by Nuc2p? Both cell division and cell growth utilize actin cytoskeleton and its modulators. Persistent SIN signaling might sequester actin cytoskeleton at the division site and thereby block actin remodeling at the growth sites. Thus, prevention of cytokinesis after cell division might ensure proper growth polarity establishment. Several mechanisms have been uncovered in fission yeast that prevent cytokinesis by inhibiting SIN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040017-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. During metaphase, the human CHFR protein homolog in fission yeast, Dma1p, inhibits SIN signaling to prevent precocious cytokinesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040017-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040017-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Prior to mitotic exit (in metaphase and anaphase A), the inhibition of SIN function by high CDK activity ensures the coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040017-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Our studies show that Nuc2p inhibits SIN function after completion of cytokinesis. Genetic analysis suggests that Nuc2p and Dma1p, both inhibitors of SIN, might function independently of each other. Our study also points to an additional function for Dma1p after cell division in the prevention of SIN activation. Thus, it appears that high CDK activity and Dma1p inhibit SIN during metaphase, while Nuc2p and Dma1p are required to prevent SIN activation and inappropriate cytokinesis after completion of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040017-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-0040017-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model Summarizing the Temporal Regulation of Cytokinesis in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content></title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0040017.g008"/></fig><p>The current study shows that Nuc2p inhibits SIN signaling. However, it remains unclear whether Nuc2p acts independently or requires a specific set of APC/C components in order to inhibit septation. We have not been able to detect a multiseptate phenotype upon inactivation of function of two additional subunits of the APC/C, namely Cut9p and Lid1p, after passage through anaphase. These observations might suggest that Nuc2p, rather than the entire APC/C, is required for the inhibition of SIN following cell division. In addition, hyperactivation of APC/C by overexpression of Slp1p (this study) and Ste9p &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040017-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040017-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d; does not lead to septation defects, suggesting that activation of APC/C does not lead directly to abnormal septation. In contrast, we have found that overproduction of Cut23p gives weak cytokinesis defects (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040017-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d; and our unpublished observation), suggesting a role for the entire APC/C in prevention of inappropriate cytokinesis. Collectively, our present studies lean toward a specific role for Nuc2p (rather than the entire APC/C) in the inhibition of cytokinesis. However, additional studies with stronger alleles of other APC/C components, which inactivate faster than the currently available alleles, might be required to firmly conclude if Nuc2p inhibition of the SIN requires the entire APC/C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> strains, media, and reagents.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040017-t001">Table 1</xref>.
