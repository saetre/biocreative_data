It has been found at similar level as testosterone in human biological fluids. This steroid has thus been used as a natural internal standard for assessing testosterone abuse in sports. EpiT has been also shown to accumulate in mammary cyst fluid and in human prostate. It was found to possess antiandrogenic activity as well as neuroprotective effects. So far, the exact pathway leading to the formation of epiT has not been elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of the enzyme 17&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The name is given according to its most potent activity. Using cells stably expressing the enzyme, we show that 17&#x003b1;-HSD catalyzes efficienty the transformation of 4-androstenedione (4-dione), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 5&#x003b1;-androstane-3,17-dione (5&#x003b1;-dione) and androsterone (ADT) into their corresponding 17&#x003b1;-hydroxy-steroids : epiT, 5-androstene-3&#x003b2;,17&#x003b1;-diol (epi5diol), 5&#x003b1;-androstane-17&#x003b1;-ol-3-one (epiDHT) and 5&#x003b1;-androstane-3&#x003b1;,17&#x003b1;-diol (epi3&#x003b1;-diol), respectively. Similar to other members of the aldo-keto reductase family that possess the ability to reduce the keto-group into hydroxyl-group at different position on the steroid nucleus, 17&#x003b1;-HSD could also catalyze the transformation of DHT, 5&#x003b1;-dione, and 5&#x003b1;-pregnane-3,20-dione (DHP) into 3&#x003b1;-diol, ADT and 5&#x003b1;-pregnane-3&#x003b1;-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) through its less potent 3&#x003b1;-HSD activity. We also have over-expressed the 17&#x003b1;-HSD in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and have purified it by affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme exhibits the same catalytic properties that have been observed with cultured HEK-293 stably transfected cells. Using quantitative Realtime-PCR to study tissue distribution of this enzyme in the mouse, we observed that it is expressed at very high levels in the kidney.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study permits to clarify the biosynthesis pathway of epiT. It also offers the opportunity to study gene regulation and function of this enzyme. Further study in human will allow a better comprehension about the use of epiT in drug abuse testing; it will also help to clarify the importance of its accumulation in breast cyst fluid and prostate, as well as its potential role as natural antiandrogen.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Epitestosterone (17&#x003b1;-hydroxy-4-androstene-3-one) is an epimer of testosterone (T). Its concentration in the urine is used as reference substance in the control of T abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. EpiT was identified for the first time as an androgen metabolite produced by rabbit liver slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has been also observed that slices of rabbit, guinea pig and dog liver, mare's ovary, ox and sheep blood as well as guinea pig kidney, ovary and testis possess the ability to produce epiT from T and 4-dione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the mouse, the kidney is a major site of epiT formation, while the production in the liver is negligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In castrated male bovine, it has been observed that blood and liver both possess a high ability to convert T into epiT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. No interconversion of T and epiT has been observed in testes of bulls, rabbits or rats, even though it has been found that testes is a source of endogenous epiT in these species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In young boys, the concentration of epiT is higher than T, however it declines in adulthood to a epiT/T ratio of approximately 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In hyperplasic prostate, epiT concentration is comparable to that of 4-dione, which represents about twice the amount of T and half the concentration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The excretion of epiT in urine is slightly lower than that of T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Plasma concentrations of epiT decline with age and were established at approximately 2.5 nmol/l in adult men and 1.2 nmol/l in women. Since epiT does not originate from endogenous T, and because the ratio of urinary T to epiT in adults is almost constant, this ratio has been used as a basis for the detection of exogenously administered T : the median ratio in normal healthy men is about 1, while being significantly elevated in case of testosterone abuse. Urinary T/epiT ratio from 1 to 6 is considered normal by the International Olympic Committee, while one displaying a ratio greater than 6 is suspected of anabolic steroid use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In order to apply this assay, it is important to assume that the biosynthesis of epitestosterone does not originate from testosterone, and that both epimers undergo similar clearance. It is also important to assume that racial or individual variations do not affect this ratio. Because of these important assumptions, parameters that may influence this ratio and possibly lead to false positive results have been intensively debated since the introduction of the T/epiT ratio in doping analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The lack of knowledge about the gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the formation of epiT has made the identification of appropriate parameters difficult.</p><p>In humans, the interconversion of T and epiT is negligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Using labeled-T, it has been shown that epiT does not originate from T. Studying the 16-ene-synthetase reaction in human testicular homogenates, Weusten et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] hypothesized that 5-androstene-3&#x003b2;,17&#x003b1;-diol (epi5-diol) and 5,16-androstadien-3&#x003b2;-ol are synthesized from pregnenolone in a single step through a 16-ene-synthase, and then that epi5-diol is further converted to epiT by 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3&#x003b2;-HSD). On the other hand, a recent study showed that administration of 4-dione to healthy male subjects increases the urinary excretion rates of epiT, thus suggesting that epiT could be biosynthesized from 4-dione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The authors suggested that a likely candidate to convert 4-dione to epiT would be 17&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17&#x003b1;-HSD). This enzyme has been purified from liver and kidney tissue from rabbits and hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Accordingly, in this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding an enzyme exhibiting a strong 17&#x003b1;-HSD acivity, efficiently catalyzing the conversion of 4-dione into epiT.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of mouse 17&#x003b1;-HSD cDNA and gene</title><p>The mouse genome project has made available the sequence of a cluster containing eight members of the aldo-keto reductase family located in the chromosome 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Using specific primers, we have cloned a cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region of the gene identified as AKR1C21 without notification of any activity. Sequence analysis of the cDNA fragment shows that it encodes a putative protein of 323 amino acids having a calculated MW of 36745 Daltons. We have deposited the sequence in GenBank under the accession number AY742217. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with that of other aldo-keto reductase members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) shows that mouse 17&#x003b1;-HSD shares 77, 70 and 72 % amino acid sequence identity with mouse type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD, 3&#x003b1;-HSD and 20&#x003b1;-HSD respectively.

We have shown that this enzyme converts mainly 17-ketosteroids into 17&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroids : 4-dione to epiT, ADT to epi3&#x003b1;-diol, 5&#x003b1;-dione to epiDHT and DHEA to epi5-diol. Since the enzyme is able to catalyze 4 distincts 17-ketosteroids into its 17&#x003b1;-hydroxy-compounds, and because all the four products have shown identitical profile on HPLC and TLC with commercial products, the results, thus, represent a strong evidence that the activity catalyzed by this specific enzyme is a 17-ketoreductase activity producing 17&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroids.</p><p>17&#x003b1;-HSD belongs to the aldo-keto reductase family and shares 77 % amino acid with the mouse type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD, an enzyme catalyzing the transformation of 4-dione into T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first example of two highly homologous enzymes belonging to the same gene family, and catalyzing the formation of two distinct epimers from a same substrate. This will represent an interesting model to study the mechanism of the 17&#x003b1;- and 17&#x003b2;- stereospecificity. In addition to the difference in substrate specificity, mouse 17&#x003b1;-HSD and 17&#x003b2;-HSD5 show distinct and specific mRNA tissue distribution : 17&#x003b1;-HSD is highly expressed in kidney while 17&#x003b2;-HSD5 is abundant in the liver. This is in agreement with previous reports showing that mouse liver does not produce epiT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that mouse type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD is specifically expressed in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], while human type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD is more widely expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is noteworthy that 17&#x003b1;-HSD and type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD belongs to aldo-keto reductase family. Members of this family share very high homology although they catalyze different activities and are expressed in different tissues; for example, mouse type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD shares 77, 88 and 86 % identity with mouse 17&#x003b1;-HSD, 3&#x003b1;-HSD and 20&#x003b1;-HSD respectively. Therefore, previous studies based on hybridation experiments such as northern blot analysis could not distinguish different members of the aldo-keto-reductase family. Using Realtime-PCR with specific primers, as described in the present manuscript, mouse type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD could be specifically identified, distinctly from 17&#x003b1;-HSD.</p><p>Our results show that 17&#x003b1;-HSD is able to convert 4-dione to epiT as well as DHEA to epi5&#x003b1;-diol, and thus suggest that epiT could be produced through two different pathways involving 17&#x003b1;-HSD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, the catalytic efficiency of 3&#x003b2;-HSD and 17&#x003b1;-HSD for DHEA and 4-dione respectively, strongly suggest that the main pathway leading to the formation of epiT is the conversion of DHEA by 3&#x003b2;-HSD and the 4-dione product being further converted into epiT. In a previous study described by Weusten et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], it was shown that a non-negligible quantity of epi5-diol is produced by 16-ene-synthase activity, the reaction catalyzing the transformation of pregnenolone into 5,16-androstadien-3&#x003b2;-ol. The authors thus suggested that epi5-diol could be produced directly from pregnenolone, and epiT being produced by the subsequent conversion of epi5-diol by 3&#x003b2;-HSD. In contrast, our data strongly suggests that the epi5-diol originates from the transformation of pregnenolone to DHEA by P450c17, followed by the conversion of DHEA into epi5-diol by the enzyme 17&#x003b1;-HSD. Previously, we have shown that P450c17 possesses two activities, 17&#x003b1;-hydroxylase/17-20 lyase and 16-ene synthase, that are able to convert pregnenolone into DHEA and 5,16-androstadien-3&#x003b2;-ol, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; however, no epi5-diol has been detected.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Diagram illustrating the 2 putative pathways for the conversion of DHEA to epiT via 17&#x003b1;-HSD and 3&#x003b2;-HSD. </bold>The thickness of the arrows indicates the relative importance of each pathway</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-6-12-5"></graphic></fig><p>The present first report of 17&#x003b1;-HSD will help to better understand the physiological role of epiT.

The resulting cDNA fragments were subcloned into a pCMVneo expression vector (pCMVneo-m17&#x003b1;-HSD) which was subsequently used to produce a stably transfected HEK-293 cell line. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen Mega Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA).

The fusion protein was isolated using a Glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, as described by the manufacturer. The purified 17&#x003b1;-HSD enzyme was separated from GST by digestion with thrombin. 17&#x003b1;-HSD is not adsorbed on the DEAE column and is recuperated in the flow-through fraction, while GST and fusion protein remain on the column. With this method we obtain about 10 mg of a purified enzyme preparation per 100 ml of cell culture. Analysis of samples obtained during the purification process was performed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

Briefly, 3 &#x003bc;g of purified 17&#x003b1;-HSD were incubated with 10 mM NADPH, 0.1 &#x003bc;M of 4-dione in phosphate saline buffer, 50 mM, pH 7.3, for 20 minutes. For the intact cells, 0.1 &#x003bc;M of the [<sup>14</sup>C]-labeled steroid (PerkinElmer, Boston, Massachussetts, USA) was added to freshly changed culture medium in a 6-well culture plate. Non-transfected HEK-293 cells were used as control of the background. After incubation, the steroids were extracted with 2 ml of ether. The organic phases were pooled and evaporated to dryness. The steroids were then solubilized in 50 &#x003bc;l of dichloromethane, applied to Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Merck, Darmstad, Germany). To obtain a better separation and identification of metabolites, different solvent systems were used. Metabolites of substrates 4-dione, DHEA and 5&#x003b1;-dione were separated in chloroform : ether (9:1), while DHP, DHT and ADT products were separated in the toluene : acetone (4:1) solvent system. Substrates and metabolites were identified by comparison with reference steroids, revealed by autoradiography and quantified using the PhosphorImager System (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, California, USA). The enzymatic reaction was carried out using the condition in which the activity varies linearly with the enzyme concentration and incubation time, indicating that the cofactor concentration produced by the cells is in excess; the reverse reaction was consequently prevented. In our conditions, this linearity was observed at even more than 60% transformation. Determination of the kinetic parameters was done by Lineweaver-Burk graph analysis using Enzfitter software.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of epitestosterone by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)</title><p><sup>14</sup>C-Labeled steroids were analyzed using Waters NovaPak reverse-phase C18 HPLC column (3.9 &#x000d7; 150 mm, 4 &#x003bc;m).
