The kinase is required for root hair development and basal defence against the oomycete pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora parasitica</italic>, two separate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated processes. In this study, the role of OXI1 during pathogenesis was characterized further. Null <italic>oxi1</italic> mutants are more susceptible to both virulent and avirulent strains of the biotrophic bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> compared with the wild type, indicating that OXI1 positively regulates both basal resistance triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, as well as effector-triggered immunity. The level of <italic>OXI1</italic> expression appears to be critical in mounting an appropriate defence response since <italic>OXI1</italic> overexpressor lines also display increased susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens. The induction of <italic>OXI1</italic> after <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection spatially and temporally correlates with the oxidative burst. Furthermore, induction is reduced in <italic>atrbohD</italic> mutants and after application of DPI (an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases) suggesting that reactive oxygen species produced through NADPH oxidases drives <italic>OXI1</italic> expression during this plant&#x02013;pathogen interaction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Hyaloperonospora parasitica</italic></kwd><kwd>plant defence</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic></kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant immunity to the wide variety of potential pathogens involves a complicated web of components ranging from preformed defence barriers to signalling molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein kinases, and hormones to elicit appropriate end responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thomma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ingle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Torres <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The current viewpoint is that there are two major branches of plant immunity as reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Dangl (2006)</xref>. The first encompasses a general immune response triggered by the recognition of evolutionary conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), for example, bacterial flagellin, lipopolysaccharides, and fungal chitin. This PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) activates a series of inducible basal defence mechanisms such as callose deposition and defence gene expression and is successful against non-host pathogens. Virulent pathogens suppress PTI via pathogen effector molecules which can target components of the basal defence mechanism and induce effector triggered susceptibility (ETS). This enables virulent pathogens to cause disease on susceptible host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). The second layer of immunity occurs when the host plant harbours a resistance protein to detect either the presence and/or activity of one or more effectors resulting in the rapid activation of plant defence responses and disease resistance known as effector triggered immunity (ETI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mackey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). Although ETI responds faster to pathogen infection, PTI and ETI share many regulatory components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ingle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Central to plant immunity against biotrophic pathogens is the accumulation of ROS, which apart from direct functions in toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keppler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>) and oxidative cross-linking of plant cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) serve a signalling role in mounting the defence response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant and Loake, 2000</xref>). A key feature of ROS signalling is regulation of the hypersensitive response (HR) characterized by rapid localized cell death at the infection site as well as the induction of defence-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levine <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lamb and Dixon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant and Loake, 2000</xref>). Chemical inhibition of ROS accumulation following pathogen challenge in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> led to a reduction in the HR and inhibited expression of the defence gene <italic>glutathione-S-transferase1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Conversely, elevation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels either through suppression of antioxidant enzyme activity, such as in transgenic tobacco plants deficient in peroxisomal catalase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamnongpol <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), or expression of enzymes required for ROS production, such as in transgenic potato plants expressing glucose oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), resulted in a primed immune response with accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), expression of defence-related genes, and enhanced resistance to a broad range of pathogens. More recently, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ascorbate-deficient mutants were found to exhibit microlesions, constitutive <italic>Pathogenesis Related (PR)</italic> gene expression, and increased resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) providing further evidence for the role of ROS accumulation in disease-resistance responses.</p><p>Genetic evidence points to a role for the respiratory burst NADPH oxidase as the principal source of ROS production during pathogen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Torres <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants lacking either or both of the respiratory burst oxidase genes, <italic>AtrbohD</italic> and <italic>AtrbohF</italic>, which encode catalytic subunits of the NADPH oxidase, displayed a reduction in H<italic><sub>2</sub></italic>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and the HR in response to avirulent <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 <italic>avrRpm1</italic> infection compared to wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Torres <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, following challenge with a virulent <italic>Hyaloperonospora parasitica</italic> strain (formerly known as <italic>Peronospora parasitica</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Constantinescu and Fatehi, 2002</xref>), the <italic>atrbohF</italic> mutant displayed an enhanced HR and increased resistance to this pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Torres <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) indicating that the HR is differentially regulated by ROS accumulation depending on the invading pathogen. Alternative mechanisms for ROS production during pathogen attack have been demonstrated, for example, pharmacological inhibition of peroxidase activity during pathogen treatment resulted in a significant decrease in <italic>GST1</italic> expression, a marker of ROS accumulation, compared to pathogen treatment alone (Grant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000). More recently, overexpression of the pepper extracellular peroxidase <italic>CaPO<sub>2</sub></italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> conferred enhanced disease resistance against <italic>P. syringae</italic> and increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels following infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was sensitive to chemical inhibition of peroxidase activity but unaffected by inhibition of NADPH oxidase.</p><p>Despite the strong correlation between ROS accumulation and disease resistance, current understanding of the discriminators of ROS signalling is sorely limiting. The OXIDATIVE SIGNAL-INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1) protein kinase has emerged as a potential player linking ROS accumulation to disease resistance in response to virulent <italic>H. parasitica</italic> attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rentel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <italic>OXI1</italic> is not only induced by the exogenous application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and challenge with virulent <italic>H. parasitica</italic> Emco5 but the <italic>oxi1</italic> null mutant also displayed increased susceptibility compared to wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> following infection with Emco5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rentel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, OXI1 is required for the partial activation of MPK3 and MPK6 in response to treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and cellulase, mimicking pathogen attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rentel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Both MPK3 and MPK6 are involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade activated following recognition of bacterial flagellin by the receptor-like kinase FLS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) which initializes the induction of defence genes such as <italic>WRKY22/29</italic> and <italic>GST</italic> and is effective in defence responses against both bacterial and fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomez-Gomez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinchilla <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In this report, a role for <italic>OXI1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is further extended to plant immunity against the bacterial pathogen <italic>P. syringae</italic> and NADPH-produced ROS is shown to drive expression of <italic>OXI1</italic> during this plant&#x02013;pathogen interaction. Interestingly, regulation of <italic>OXI1</italic> expression levels appears important in mediating an appropriate defence response, since both down-regulation and overexpression of <italic>OXI1</italic> results in enhanced susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants were grown on a 1:1 (v/v) soil mix composed of peat (Jiffy Products, International AS, Norway) and vermiculite in a controlled environment under a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 21&#x000b0;C, 55% relative humidity, and fluorescent light of 80&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;mol photon m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Plant lines</title><p>Wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds were acquired from Lehle Seeds (Lehle, Texas, USA).

It is thought that the regulation of PTI and ETI resistance responses overlaps considerably, with ETI being an accelerated and amplified PTI response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). Large-scale expression profiling provided evidence that ETI is qualitatively similar to PTI as the expression profiles, as well as the level of induction of genes, during the early stages of infection with <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>maculicola</italic> (<italic>Psm</italic>) harbouring the avirulence <italic>avrRpt2</italic> gene were similar to those produced during the late stages of infection with virulent <italic>Psm</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant analysis has identified many molecular components in the defence signalling network involved in both PTI and ETI. For example, a mutation in the <italic>ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1</italic> (<italic>EDS1</italic>) gene results in <italic>eds1</italic> mutants being more susceptible to both virulent and avirulent isolates of <italic>H. parasitica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants <italic>eds5, npr1</italic>, <italic>sid2</italic>, and <italic>pad4</italic> are compromised in their resistance responses to both virulent and avirulent isolates of <italic>H. parasitica</italic> and/or <italic>P. syringae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nawrath and M&#x000e9;traux, 1999</xref>). Silencing of MPK6, a component of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MAPK cascade induced by flagellin during PTI, also leads to enhanced susceptibility to virulent and avirulent isolates of <italic>P. syringae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Our data indicate that OXI1 represents another shared component between PTI and ETI since the <italic>oxi1</italic> mutant exhibits enhanced bacterial titres compared to the wild type following infection with both virulent and avirulent <italic>P. syringae.</italic> OXI1 is likely to trigger phosphorylation events that result in the activation of defence responses that serve to restrict or slow the process of pathogen growth.</p><p>In contrast to infection by <italic>P. syringae</italic>, a role for OXI1 could only be discerned in the defence against a virulent <italic>H. parasitica</italic> isolate and not the avirulent isolate Emoy2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rentel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Only one avirulent isolate of <italic>H. parasitica</italic> has been tested and it is possible that OXI1 may play a role in ETI against isolates with different effector complements. Given that effectors themselves target different components of the defence system (which are then unavailable for signalling), it is unlikely that ETI signalling will be identical in response to all effectors.</p><p>While infection with the necrotrophic pathogen <italic>B. cinerea</italic> resulted in increased expression of <italic>OXI1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), lack of OXI1 did not increase susceptiblity compared with the wild type (data not shown). Induction of <italic>OXI1</italic> in response to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> appears to be a consequence of ROS accumulation during this interaction, without an active role in defence. Hence our results currently limit the role of OXI1 to disease resistance against biotrophic pathogens.</p><p>A surprising feature of OXI1 is that reduced expression and overexpression of <italic>OXI1</italic> both led to enhanced susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). It is unlikely that a single kinase plays both a positive and a negative role during the same defence response. Hence it is proposed that the level of OXI1 protein is crucial for the appropriate signalling, and modulation of these levels (either higher or lower) disrupts OXI1 function. As transcript levels do not necessarily correlate with protein levels, it is possible that the OXI1 overexpression lines either have lower or higher OXI1 protein levels compared to wild type since these lines mirror the loss of function mutant. In the first instance, if the protein levels are actually reduced in the overexpression lines relative to the wild type, it could be that prolonged expression of OXI1 protein from a constitutive promoter (35S) might lead to enhanced activation of pathways naturally present to regulate the OXI1 protein negatively, i.e. by protein degradation. Alternatively, it would be more orthodox and parsimonious to assume that protein levels are higher in the overexpression lines than in the wild type. It is not uncommon for plants overexpressing proteins to show the same phenotypes as loss of function mutants, for example, FIP1 and EBS, also in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pineiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In these cases the perceived wisdom is that these proteins operate in complexes in which the stoichiometry is crucial and regulated by the levels of protein expression. Therefore, both under- or over-expression would lead to suboptimal complex formation, leading to reduced function. Therefore the absolute level of abundance of such components is crucial and OXI1 may be one such component. Furthermore, OXI1 levels appear to be tightly controlled <italic>in planta</italic>; <italic>35S::OXI1-YFP</italic> lines show low levels of YFP protein compared with lines expressing YFP-aequorin protein in single root cell types, and treatment of seedlings with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 1 h results in dramatically increased protein levels indicating a short half-life (data not shown). This rapid turnover of OXI1 protein together with the importance of timing in pathogen responses presents another scenario whereby the key factor could also be one of appropriate timing. For example, having either OXI1 protein or transcript already present when plants are challenged with pathogen may be detrimental to establishing an optimal defence response.</p><p>Despite the demonstration of MPK6 as a downstream component of OXI1 in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and cellulase treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rentel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and the fact that the defence phenotype of <italic>mpk6</italic> silenced <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants resembles that of <italic>oxi1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), MPK6-dependent expression of <italic>VSP1</italic> during PTI appears to be independent of OXI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Similarly, despite the importance of SA signalling to disease resistance against biotrophic pathogens, OXI1 was not required for expression of the SA marker gene <italic>PR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>) or development of systemic acquired resistance (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S6</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). OXI1 interacts directly with, and can phosphorylate, the Ser/Thr protein kinase PTI1-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anthony <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). PTI1-2 is activated in response to various stress treatments and is dependent on OXI1 for its activation in response to flagellin and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anthony <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Given the homology between PTI1-2 and the tomato Pto kinase, which confers resistance to avirulent <italic>P. syringae</italic> carrying the <italic>avrPto</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that OXI1 promotes defence against <italic>P. syringae</italic> through the activation of PTI1-2. However, no targets of PTI1-2 have been identified and, unlike Pto, OXI1 is likely to function downstream of ROS. Hence, the identification of additional direct targets of OXI1 will be vital in elucidating the function of this ROS-responsive kinase during <italic>Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas/Hyaloperonospora</italic> interactions and in addressing how specificity of ROS signalling is achieved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>.</bold> The <italic>oxi1</italic> null mutant is more susceptible to both virulent and avirulent <italic>P. syringae</italic> (A, C) and this phenotype of the null mutant is rescued in the complemented line which exhibits wild-type bacterial titres when challenged with <italic>P. syringae</italic> (B, C).</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>.</bold><italic>OXI1</italic> expression is induced following infection of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves with the necrotrophic pathogen <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>.</bold> The <italic>oxi1</italic> null mutant is more susceptible than the wild type to the avirulent strain <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 <italic>avrRpt2</italic>.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link>.</bold> Expression of <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>VSP1</italic> is unaffected in the <italic>oxi1</italic> null mutant in response to pathogen challenge.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link>.</bold> DPI treatment alone has no effect on <italic>OXI1::GUS</italic> expression.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp219/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S6</ext-link>.</bold> The <italic>oxi1</italic> mutation does not affect the development of systemic acquired resistance.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="erp219_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="erp219_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF), South Africa, and the University of Cape Town Research Council.
