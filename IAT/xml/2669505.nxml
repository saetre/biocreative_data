Although many hyperglycemia-induced metabolic abnormalities are implicated in its pathogenesis, the exact mechanism of the development of retinopathy remains elusive. Our previous studies have suggested a role for the small molecular weight G-protein, H-Ras, in the development of retinopathy in diabetes. We have shown that functional activation of H-Ras is one of the signaling steps involved in glucose-induced capillary cell apoptosis. Inhibitors of H-Ras function reduce glucose-induced increased apoptosis of retinal capillary cells, and the therapy that inhibits apoptosis of retinal vascular cells and retinopathy in diabetes, inhibits diabetes-induced increase in Ras expression and mRNA levels in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>].</p><p>Small molecular weight G-proteins act as one of the key regulators of the signaling cascade triggered by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>], and Ras is considered to be a common signaling target of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular redox stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. In addition, Ras-expressing cells produce high levels of superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], and superoxide production determines the sensitivity to intercellular induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress is elevated in the retina and its capillary cells and remains elevated when the histopathology can be seen in the vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Oxidative stress is closely linked to apoptosis in a variety of cell types, and could escalate apoptosis via increased membrane lipid peroxidation, injury to other macromolecules, or alterations in signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Increased superoxide is considered to act as a causal link between elevated glucose and the major biochemical pathways postulated to be involved in the development of vascular complications in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. We have recently shown that inhibition of superoxide accumulation or overexpression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) inhibits diabetes-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the retina and its capillary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. The purpose of this study was to examine the putative mechanism(s) by which oxidative stress could result in the activation of H-Ras in retinal capillary cells. Using isolated retinal endothelial cells, we compared the effect of high glucose as well as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the activation of H-Ras, and determined the effect of overexpression of MnSOD on glucose-induced activation of H-Ras and apoptosis. In vivo experiments were performed using the retina from the mice overexpressing MnSOD (MnSOD-Tg) to investigate the role of mitochondrial superoxide in the activation of retinal H-Ras in diabetes. The results presented demonstrate that superoxide regulate the activation of retinal H-Ras in diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Retinal endothelial cells</title><p>Retinal endothelial cells, prepared from cow eyes (obtained fresh from a local slaughterhouse), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 15% fetal calf serum (heat inactivated), 5% Nu-serum, heparin (50 &#x003bc;g/ml), endothelial growth supplement (25 &#x003bc;g/ml) and antibiotic/antimycotic in 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Confluent cells from third to sixth passage were incubated under normoglycemic (5 mM glucose) or hyperglycemic (20 mM glucose) conditions for 96 h in the presence or absence of 200 &#x003bc;M MnTBAP (a cell-permeable SOD mimetic, obtained from Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. This duration was selected because our previous experiments have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis can be seen in retinal endothelial cells incubated in 20 mM glucose for over three days, and increasing the duration to 10 days does not increase the apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Control incubations containing 20 mM mannitol were always run simultaneously to rule out the effect of increased osmolarity.

In order to investigate the effect of increased hydrogen peroxide on H-Ras, its signaling pathway and apoptosis, we incubated endothelial cells from fourth to fifth passage with 250 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 h. The cells were quickly washed with DMEM and incubated in 5 mM glucose and 20 mM glucose media for 96 h.

In brief, 60-80% confluent endothelial cells from fourth passage were incubated with a transfection-complex comprising of MnSOD expression plasmid DNA and superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen,Valencia, CA) for 8 h. The transfected cells were then incubated in a fresh medium containing 2.5% fetal calf serum (heat inactivated), 10% Nu-serum, heparin (50 &#x003bc;g/ml), endothelial growth supplement (2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) and antibiotic/antimycotic supplemented with 5 mM or 20 mM glucose for 96 h.

The litters were genotyped by Southern blot analysis. A group of wild-type mice (WT) and MnSOD-Tg mice (body weight 18-22 g; male) were made diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg/body weight) for five consecutive days. We have shown that MnSOD Tg mice can be made diabetic successfully by giving similar doses of streptozotocin as their wild-type counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Body weight was determined once per week and blood glucose once every 10 days. Insulin (0.1-0.2 IU) was injected 2-5 times a week to prevent weight loss and ketonuria. Both diabetic and non-diabetic mice had free access to their food (standard laboratory Purina chow) and water. Their glycated hemoglobin (GHb) was measured at about eight weeks of diabetes, employing the affinity columns used by us previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Mice were sacrificed 3-4 months after induction of diabetes, and their retinas were isolated under a dissecting microscope.

This assay takes advantage of the high affinity of Ras-GTP for the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1. The cell extract was added to Raf-1RBD, and the Raf-RBD/GTP-Ras complex was pulled down by glutathione affinity beads. The beads were re-suspended in Laemmli reducing sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The amount of activated Ras was determined by Western blot using Ras-Pan-specific antibody that was supplied in the Raf-1 binding assay kit.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein expression of H-Ras and Raf-1</title><p>Protein (30-50 &#x003bc;g) was separated on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.

After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the membranes were developed using ECL-Plus Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Kaleidoscope pre-stained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad Laboratories) were run simultaneously on each gel. To ensure equal loading among the lanes, we also determined the expression of the housekeeping protein, &#x003b2;-actin.

Incubation of endothelial cells with H2O2 has been shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and cell permeability, the parameters associated with diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>].</p><p>Diabetes-induced ROS act as a causal link between elevated glucose and the other metabolic abnormalities implicated in the development of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. We have shown that MnSOD plays a protective role in retinal capillary cell death, and ultimately, in the pathogenesis of retinopathy by protecting the retina from increased oxidative damage experienced in diabetic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. We have observed similar superoxide levels in the retinal mitochondria obtained from diabetic and non diabetic MnSOD-Tg mice (unpublished data), suggesting protection by MnSOD. Furthermore, our recent studies have documented that the overexpression of the inactive mutant of H-Ras inhibits glucose-mediated increase in the apoptosis of retinal endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Here we provide evidence that inhibition of mitochondrial superoxide accumulation by either MnSOD mimetic or overexpression of MnSOD, results in the failure of high glucose to activate H-Ras in retinal endothelial cells. This suggests that the activation of H-Ras in diabetes could be under the control of mitochondrial superoxide. Our results are supported by others, showing that superoxide could modulate the downstream effects of Ras protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], and overexpression of SOD in Ras-transformed cells inhibits Ras-mediated transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. In contrast, overexpression of MnSOD has been shown to have no effect on Ras activation in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]; the reason for such discrepancy is not clear.</p><p>Our exciting in vivo data demonstrate that in MnSOD-Tg mice the retina is protected from diabetes-induced activation of H-Ras. These results were obtained without ameliorating the severity of hyperglycemia in WT and MnSOD-Tg mice that were made diabetic with streptozotocin. This strongly supports our in vitro data obtained from the endothelial cells. Mitochondria dysfunction in the retina is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy; the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and Bax into the mitochondria is increased in the retina in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Bax immunostaining is seen in the retinal cells (vascular and ganglion) that are known to undergo accelerated apoptosis in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Further, superoxide levels are elevated in the retina and in its endothelial cells in diabetes [8, and our unpublished data], and mRNA of superoxide dismutase is down regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Overexpression of MnSOD in the retina protects it from diabetes-induced increase in oxidative stress and nitrative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], and in the retinal endothelial cells prevents high glucose-induced increase in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. ROS affect the interactions between Ras and several of its ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>], and ROS produced by advanced glycation-end products are shown to stimulate the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. How Ras could be regulated by increased superoxide in diabetes is not clear. Other researchers have shown that the terminal cysteines of Ras are surface-exposed making them targets of oxidative or nitrosative processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], and oxidative stress and nitrative stress are elevated in the retina and its capillary cells in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Moreover, Ras acts as a common signaling target of ROS and cellular redox stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], and Ras is considered to be one of the key regulators of the signaling cascade triggered by oxidative stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. The targets for oxidizing agents are located both upstream and downstream of Ras, and ROS can affect the interactions between Ras and several of its ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Thus, protection of diabetes-induced H-Ras activation in the retina by MnSOD strongly suggests that in diabetes H-Ras is regulated by mitochondrial superoxide.</p><p>Raf-1 is a key downstream effector protein of Ras function that in its inactive state is localized in the cytosol. We have shown that in diabetes, Raf-1 is increased in the retina. The therapies that inhibited the development of retinopathy in diabetic rats also inhibited Raf-1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Here we provide exciting in vitro and in vivo data, showing that inhibition of superoxide, either by superoxide mimetic or by overexpression of MnSOD inhibits diabetes-induced activation of Raf-1 in the retina. This clearly suggests that the Ras-mediated detrimental effects on retinal capillary cells in diabetes are via Ras-Raf-1 pathway.</p><p>Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1 can activate MAP kinase, and the MAP kinase family is considered to be an effector of the Ras-Raf pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase is implicated in diabetes-induced increased apoptosis of retinal neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], and the mRNA expression of MAP kinase is increased in the retina as early as three days after induction of diabetes in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Results presented in this manuscript clearly show that when H-Ras and Raf-1 activations are inhibited by inhibiting superoxide levels, p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation is also inhibited. This is confirmed by both our in vivo data from MnSOD-Tg mice and from the retinal endothelial cells overexpressing MnSOD. Activation of MAP kinase is dependent on the production of ROS, and phosphorylation of p38 as an important component of ROS-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. In diabetes, regulation of retinal vascular permeability by hepatocyte growth factor is considered to be mediated via MAP kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], and glucose has been shown to accelerate apoptosis of retinal endothelial cells via activation of MAP kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Inhibition of diabetes-induced activation of H-Ras, Raf-1, and phosphorylation of p-p38 MAP kinase suggests that H-Ras activation in the retina could contribute to the development of diabetic retinopathy via activating Ras/Raf/MAP kinase signaling pathway.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first report showing that the activation of H-Ras and its downstream signaling pathway in the retina and its vascular cells is under the control of superoxide. Our conclusion is supported by both in vivo (retina from MnSOD-Tg mice) and in vitro (retinal endothelial cells transfected with MnSOD) models. The results clearly demonstrate that H-Ras activation in diabetes can be prevented by overexpression of MnSOD, suggesting a complex cross-talk. The regulation of H-Ras-mediated signaling should help us identify novel pharmaco-therapeutic strategies for inhibition of retinopathy in diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Mamta Kanwar and Holly Birk for technical assistance.
