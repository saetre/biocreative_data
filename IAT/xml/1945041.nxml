To address this question, we analyzed the spatial dynamics of a key actin regulator&#x02014;the Scar/WAVE complex&#x02014;which plays an important role in regulating cell shape in both metazoans and plants. We have recently discovered that the Hem-1/Nap1 component of the Scar/WAVE complex localizes to propagating waves that appear to organize the leading edge of a motile immune cell, the human neutrophil. Actin is both an output and input to the Scar/WAVE complex: the complex stimulates actin assembly, and actin polymer is also required to remove the complex from the membrane. These reciprocal interactions appear to generate propagated waves of actin nucleation that exhibit many of the properties of morphogenesis in motile cells, such as the ability of cells to flow around barriers and the intricate spatial organization of protrusion at the leading edge. We propose that cell motility results from the collective behavior of multiple self-organizing waves.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Many cells guide their movement in response to external cues. This ability is required for single-celled organisms to hunt and mate, enables innate immune cells to seek and destroy pathogens, and is also essential for the development of multicellular organisms. Misregulation of cell migration is intimately involved in atherosclerosis and in cancer metastasis. Although many of the regulators of cell migration are known, we do not understand how these components act together to organize cell shape and movement. We used advanced light microscopy to follow the distribution of a key regulator of cell migration in living cells. We focus on a protein called Hem-1, which is part of a large multimolecular protein complex that regulates cell shape in animals and plants. We found that Hem-1 exhibits complex cycles of activation and inhibition to generate waves of propagating Hem-1 and actin assembly that are similar in mechanism to grass fires or the action potentials used in neuronal signaling. These waves potentially explain many of the complex behaviors of motile cells such as the ability of cells to flow around barriers and the intricate spatial organization of protrusion at the front of moving cells.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Reciprocal interactions between actin and the Scar/WAVE complex appear to generate propagated waves of actin nucleation that embody many of the properties of morphogenesis in motile cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Weiner OD, Marganski WA, Wu LF, Altschuler SJ, Kirschner MW (2007) An actin-based wave generator organizes cell motility.

Spatial and dynamic information will be key to understanding their overall function. We show here that the leading edge of neutrophils contains moving waves of Hem-1 (including complexes which contain WAVE2), whose collective behavior corresponds to the morphology of the leading edge. These waves are not formed by lateral movement of individual proteins but, like action potentials, are the result of propagated cycles of activation and inhibition. These waves reveal a far more complex and dynamic interaction between inducers of actin nucleation and the cytoskeleton than is represented in current models of cell motility.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Hem-1/Nap1 Component of the WAVE2 Complex Localizes to Propagating Waves</title><p>To analyze spatial and temporal dynamics of signaling and morphogenesis, we and others have used confocal or wide-field microscopy of fluorescently tagged proteins.

To visualize the spatial dynamics of Rac activation (Rac-GTP) in motile cells, two basic approaches have been used in the past.

Because Rac is untagged, it is not possible to visualize activation of endogenous Rac with this approach.

In contrast, the photobleached Hem-1 gap very rapidly recovers before there is appreciable forward progress of the wave, suggesting that the recruited Hem-1 protein dynamically equilibrates with the cytosolic pool and that the bulk of wave movement is generated by recruiting more Hem-1 from the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g003">3</xref>C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050221-sv011">Video S11</xref>).

Collectively, these data make two important points.

In contrast, jasplakinolide, which stabilizes actin polymers against depolymerization, produces a phenotype that is consistent with an enlarged field of inhibition between waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g004">4</xref>D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050221-sv017">Video S17</xref>).

We never observe the Hem-1 waves to stall for more than a few seconds except when actin is depolymerized. We believe this is because a standing wave of Hem-1 on the membrane would be destabilized by locally generated actin polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g004">4</xref>). However, stalling can be forced to occur when a cell encounters a physical barrier that prevents further membrane protrusion. In such a condition, the Hem-1 waves stall and are extinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050221-sv018">Video S18</xref>). When this happens, other regions of the cell that are not in contact with the external barrier continue to propagate Hem-1 waves and expand in size. The effect of this behavior is that the cell has effectively restricted actin polymerization and leading edge organization to domains compatible with productive movement, potentially accounting for contact inhibition of movement. As a result, rather than be stymied by physical barriers, cells tend to flow around them. The integration of signaling and actin polymerization in Hem-1 waves ensures that the cytoskeleton is not simply a passive readout of the cell polarity but rather has local dynamic properties of its own that contribute to the overall behavior and give it some of its most life-like properties.</p><fig id="pbio-0050221-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Hem-1 Waves Extinguish at Mechanical Barriers</title><p>Hem-1 waves that collide with boundary (cell outlined in red) are extinguished, whereas those that do not continue to propagate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050221-sv018">Video S18</xref>).

Consistent with this idea, Hem-1 recruitment is observed with high probability adjacent to existing Hem-1 membrane distributions. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the actin polymerization generated downstream of Hem-1 complexes is required to remove Hem-1 from the membrane (potentially forming the autoinhibitory portion of the cycle). First, Hem-1 waves normally have characteristic lifetime and intensity, and actin depolymerization increases both more than an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g004">4</xref>C).

Fourth, stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton decreases the velocity, intensity, and lifetime of Hem-1 waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050221-g004">4</xref>C).</p><fig id="pbio-0050221-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Simulations of Hem-1 Wave Generator</title><p>(A) Outline of biological model and mathematical simulations.

These activities exhibit different organization from the Hem-1 waves, although they may be related to them. Conceptually, however, there is a strong distinction between actin and the Arp2/3 complex, which are incorporated into the cytoskeleton and represent the physical substrate that generates protrusion, and the Hem-1 waves that represent a moving inductive field that patterns this substrate. When actin is depolymerized, it and the Arp2/3 complex dissociate from the cortex, whereas Hem-1 continues to accumulate at the membrane. Yet the behavior of the Hem-1 waves is closely tied to the actin substrate, and this, in turn, produces a moving front of actin nucleation. These data suggest a different view of cell motility as neither a global process at the level of whole cell organization nor a biasing of local actin polymerization events organized at the molecular level.

Second, the displacement of each particle between consecutive image frames was computed using a correlation-based approach &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050221-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. The displacement measurements were refined by quadratic interpolation to achieve subpixel resolution (accuracy &#x0223c; 0.01 &#x003bc;m). Third, the displacements were used to follow the trajectory of each particle and to determine particle lifetime. Fourth, because the particle trajectory varied linearly with time, the average velocity of each particle during its lifetime was measured with curve fitting. Fifth, the position of the cell's leading edge in each image frame was manually determined, and the distance between the leading edge and each particle was computed.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Assessment of Hem-1 mobility.</title><p>The mobility of Hem-1 was investigated using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The Hem-1 fluorescence in a small region (&#x0223c;1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;m in radius or a diffraction-limited spot for some experiments) at the leading edge of a chemoattractant-stimulated cell was photobleached and allowed to recover for up to 60 s. The dependence of Hem-1 mobility on actin dynamics was also investigated by photobleaching Hem-1 expressing cells that were first activated with 20 nM fMLP and then treated with 10 &#x003bc;M latrunculin B. The halftime of Hem-1 recovery (i.e., the time from the bleach to the time where the fluorescence intensity reaches half of the final recovered intensity) was determined by plotting the recovery of relative fluorescence within the bleached region as a function of time and fitting the data with an exponential function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050221-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Modeling and simulations.</title><p>Simulations of the Hem-1/actin circuit were performed using the Ordinary Differential Equations stochastic simulator in Matlab.
