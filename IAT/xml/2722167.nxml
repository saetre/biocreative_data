A key GBS virulence factor is its capsular polysaccharide (CPS), displaying terminal sialic acid (Sia) residues which block deposition and activation of complement on the bacterial surface. We recently demonstrated that GBS Sia can bind human CD33-related Sia-recognizing immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily lectins (hCD33rSiglecs), a family of inhibitory receptors expressed on the surface of leukocytes. We report the unexpected discovery that certain GBS strains may bind one such receptor, hSiglec-5, in a Sia-independent manner, via the cell wall&#x02013;anchored &#x003b2; protein, resulting in recruitment of SHP protein tyrosine phosphatases. Using a panel of WT and mutant GBS strains together with Siglec-expressing cells and soluble Siglec-Fc chimeras, we show that GBS &#x003b2; protein binding to Siglec-5 functions to impair human leukocyte phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and extracellular trap production, promoting bacterial survival. We conclude that protein-mediated functional engagement of an inhibitory host lectin receptor promotes bacterial innate immune evasion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS) is a common cause of sepsis and meningitis in human newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dermer et al., 2004</xref>). The GBS capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is a critical virulence factor containing a terminal &#x003b1;2-3&#x02013;linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid, identical to the most common sialic acid (Sia) capping many surface glycans on all human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Varki, 2007</xref>). To date, structures of nine antigenically distinct GBS CPS have been described (serotypes Ia, Ib, and II-VIII), each composed of unique arrangements of galactose, glucose, and/or <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine but invariantly possessing Sia on the branching terminus of the repeating unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Paoletti and Kasper, 2003</xref>). By increasing affinity of serum factor H for C3b and accelerating intrinsic decay of the C3 convertase, host Sia counterregulates complement activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pangburn, 2000</xref>). Likewise, by decorating its own surface with Sia, GBS creates a nonactivating environment restricting alternative complement deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marques et al., 1992</xref>), impairing opsonophagocytic clearance and promoting disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wessels et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>The Sia-recognizing Ig superfamily lectins (Siglecs) are a type-I transmembrane protein family, consisting of an N-terminal Sia-binding V-set domain and a variable number of extracellular C2-set domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Varki and Angata, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crocker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Varki, 2007</xref>). Human CD33-related Siglecs (hCD33rSiglecs), comprising Siglecs 3, 5&#x02013;11, XII, 14, and 16, are a rapidly evolving subgroup of Siglecs predominantly expressed on leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crocker et al., 2007</xref>). The most prominent Siglecs on human monocyte/macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are Siglec-5 (hSiglec-5) and Siglec-9 (hSiglec-9), each of which contains two intracellular tyrosine-based signaling motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crocker et al., 2007</xref>). The membrane-proximal motif (LHYASL) conforms to the canonical immunoreceptor tyrosine&#x02013;based inhibitory motif (I/L/V)xYxx(L/V), whereas the distal motif (TEYSEI) resembles the immunoreceptor tyrosine&#x02013;based switch motif (TXYXX[V/I]) found in the CD150/SLAM subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ravetch and Lanier, 2000</xref>). The immunoreceptor tyrosine&#x02013;based inhibitory motif is present in various inhibitory receptors that antagonize kinase-dependent activation cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>) and function by recruiting Src homology 2 domain&#x02013;containing tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>) and SHP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gergely et al., 1999</xref>). Both hSiglec-5 and hSiglec-9 can recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 and function as inhibitory receptors of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avril et al., 2006a</xref>).</p><p>We recently demonstrated that GBS of different serotypes bind hCD33rSiglecs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlin et al., 2007</xref>) and that GBS serotype III engages Siglec-9 on the surface of cells, including human neutrophils, in a Sia- and Siglec-specific manner to down-regulate their immune responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlin et al., 2009</xref>). In this paper, we report the unexpected discovery that certain GBS strains bind hSiglec-5 in a Sia-independent manner, via a specific protein anchored to the bacterial cell wall. Using a combination of bacterial and immunological reagents, we characterize the protein-mediated interaction of GBS with Siglec-5 on the surface of human leukocytes and present functional evidence that it represents a novel bacterial immune evasion mechanism.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>GBS interacts with hSiglec-5-Fc through a trypsin-sensitive bacterial protein</title><p>We tested WT GBS isolates expressing sialylated CPS of serotypes Ia (strain A909) and III (strain COH1), isogenic Sia-negative mutants of each strain generated by allelic replacement of the CMP-Neu5Ac-synthase gene (&#x00394;NeuA), and GBS pretreated with trypsin to remove cell surface proteins, for binding to chimeras of hSiglec5 (hSiglec-5-Fc) and hSiglec-9 (hSiglec-9-Fc) by flow cytometry. Corroborating our previous ELISA-based findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlin et al., 2007</xref>), serotype III GBS bound to hSiglec-9-Fc and serotype Ia bound to hSiglec-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). The GBS serotype III strain bound to hSiglec-9-Fc in a Sia-specific manner because this interaction was lost for the isogenic Sia-negative &#x00394;NeuA mutant but unaltered by trypsin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, attachment of the GBS serotype Ia strain to hSiglec-5-Fc was maintained in the Sia-deficient mutant and eliminated by trypsin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), linking binding to a trypsin-sensitive protein rather than the anticipated sugar&#x02013;lectin interaction.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The GBS &#x003b2; protein mediates attachment to hSiglec-5-Fc in a Sia-independent manner.</bold> (A and B) WT GBS serotype III (A) and Ia (B) and their isogenic Sia-deficient &#x00394;NeuA mutants were incubated with hSiglec-9-Fc and hSiglec-5-Fc, respectively, followed by PE-conjugated secondary antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry for Sia-dependent binding of hSiglecs.

To avoid hSiglec-Fc Sia-specific interactions, isogenic &#x00394;NeuA mutants that were virtually devoid of detectable cell surface Sia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090691/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>) were used. Proteins were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF filter, and probed with hSiglec-Fc chimeras and secondary anti&#x02013;human HRP-conjugated antibodies. The hSiglec-5-Fc chimera interacted with a GBS protein of an apparent molecular mass of 125 kD found in lysates of the GBS serotype Ia strain but not in the serotype III control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The hSiglec-9-Fc chimera did not interact with this protein or any others, excluding nonspecific interactions with the human IgG-Fc portion of the chimeras. Based on size, surface location, sensitivity to trypsin, presence in the GBS serotype Ia strain, and absence in the GBS serotype III strain, we hypothesized that the protein mediating GBS interaction with hSiglec-5-Fc was the surface-expressed &#x003b2; protein (also known as Bac or &#x003b2;C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lindahl et al., 2005</xref>). To produce a partially purified GBS &#x003b2; protein extract, we incubated the GBS serotype Ia and serotype III (negative control) &#x00394;NeuA mutants at pH 9.7 for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C, selectively releasing &#x003b2; protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lindahl et al., 1990</xref>), concentrated and separated supernatants by SDS-PAGE, and then blotted and probed with hSiglec-5-Fc. This sample was highly enriched for the 125-kD protein interacting with hSiglec-5-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Treatment of the protein extract with active or heat-inactivated (control) <italic>Arthrobacter ureafaciens</italic> sialidase (AUS) did not change hSiglec-5-Fc binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). To determine the identity of the 125-kD GBS protein, the band reacting with hSiglec-5-Fc was excised, digested, and analyzed using MALDI-TOF MS peptide fingerprinting (Fig. S1 B). The monoisotopic masses of the peptide fragments listed were analyzed using the online database at Rockefeller University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prowl.rockefeller.edu">http://prowl.rockefeller.edu</ext-link>) and the GBS &#x003b2; protein was identified with 100% certainty. Confirming the significance of the observed interaction, an isogenic &#x003b2; protein&#x02013;deficient mutant (&#x00394;Bac) of our parent GBS Ia strain lost the ability to bind hSiglec-5-Fc, but when it was complemented with the <italic>bac</italic> gene expressed on a plasmid vector (pBac), WT levels of hSiglec-5-Fc binding were restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b2; protein is required for GBS interactions with hSiglec-5 via its N-terminal domain</title><p>The GBS &#x003b2; protein N-terminal (cell wall distal) domain is known to bind human IgA-Fc, whereas its C-terminal domain can interact with human factor H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Areschoug et al., 2002</xref>).

However, when CHO(hSiglec-5) cells were exposed to WT GBS, SHP-2 was recruited to hSiglec-5 beginning at &#x0223c;5 min and reached a maximum at 15&#x02013;20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In contrast, no recruitment of SHP-2 to hSiglec-5 on CHO(hSiglec-5) was detected after exposure to the GBS &#x00394;Bac mutant. Similarly, U937 monocytes, which had no detectable SHP-2 associated with hSiglec-5 at baseline, showed recruitment of SHP-2 in response to WT GBS but not the &#x00394;Bac mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Recruitment of SHP-1 to Siglec 5 in U937 monocytes did not differ appreciably after exposure to the WT and &#x00394;Bac strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>); however, when &#x003b2; protein was expressed heterologously in a Sia-deficient acapsular strain of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, a contribution of the protein to recruitment of both SHP-2 and SHP-1 to hSiglec-5 could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

In this study, we performed additional neutrophil studies to ascertain how the newly discovered GBS &#x003b2; protein&#x02013;mediated engagement of hSiglec-5 would affect these phagocyte functions. Compared with the isogenic &#x00394;Bac mutant, the WT GBS strain elicited a weaker oxidative burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>), triggered the release of fewer NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>), and stimulated less transcription of IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>) upon coincubation with human neutrophils.

Previously, GBS and two other human pathogens, <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> and <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, were shown to interact with hCD33r-Siglecs through cell surface&#x02013;expressed Sia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jones et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avril et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlin et al., 2007</xref>) and, in the case of GBS, these Sia-dependent interactions served to down-regulate neutrophil activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlin et al., 2007</xref>). GBS association with hSiglec-5 in a protein-dependent manner reveals a novel mechanism by which pathogens may co-opt hCD33rSiglecs to their advantage. &#x003b2; protein&#x02013;mediated engagement causes an accumulation of Siglec-5 at the sight of GBS contact and increases the recruitment of SHP protein tyrosine phosphatases to the receptor's cytosolic tail. Association of SHP family phosphatases with surface receptors can negatively regulate receptor-mediated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Oldenborg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kant et al., 2002</xref>). Likewise, the antiphagocytic effect described in this paper is mediated by &#x003b2; protein&#x02013;expressing GBS only when Siglec-5 is present on the leukocyte surface and, thus, likely depends on SHP recruitment to the surface receptor.</p><p>The GBS &#x003b2; protein is a large antigenic surface-anchored protein expressed in almost all GBS serotype Ib strains and some serotype Ia, II, and V strains but almost never in serotype III strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lindahl et al., 2005</xref>). Recently, it was shown that high levels of &#x003b2; protein expression are associated with increased virulence of GBS clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nagano et al., 2002</xref>). &#x003b2; protein is known to interact with two components of the human immune system, the Fc portion of serum IgA and factor H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Areschoug et al., 2002</xref>), and our present finding that &#x003b2; protein binds to hSiglec-5 identifies a third such interaction. Through nonimmune binding of IgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pleass et al., 2001</xref>), engagement of factor H (a major regulator of complement; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pangburn, 2000</xref>), and, now, attachment to hSiglec5, which is proposed to play an important role in regulating phagocyte function and the link to cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crocker et al., 2007</xref>), &#x003b2; protein appears to be a multifunctional virulence factor capable of interfering with several aspects of host defense to bacterial infection.</p><p>We have shown that GBS is able to engage different CD33rSiglecs using its sialylated CPS or the &#x003b2; protein. The Sia-binding sites of hCD33rSiglecs are rapidly evolving, a process that is hypothesized to be likely to facilitate continual host Sia self-recognition in the face of rapid changes in host Sia expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Varki and Angata, 2006</xref>). In this scenario, rapid evolution of the host sialome, driven by Sia-binding pathogens such as malaria and influenza, requires that the CD33rSiglecs also evolve rapidly to keep up with recognizing self. If GBS CPS Sias have evolved to engage inhibitory CD33rSiglecs, then these Sias would need to coevolve with the rapidly changing Sia-binding specificities of CD33rSiglecs to maintain functional interactions. The parallel evolution by GBS of a protein ligand that allows functional engagement of hSiglec-5 may have facilitated continued success of CPS serotypes (e.g., type Ia) that had lost their original binding affinity to host Siglec-5.</p><p>In sum, we demonstrate the presence of a microbial protein ligand that engages a member of the hCD33rSiglecs and find that this interaction increases bacterial resistance to phagocytosis and killing by human leukocytes. Recent studies suggest that Sia-expressing pathogenic microorganisms may use cell surface Sias to bind hCD33rSiglecs to dampen innate immune responses. Our present findings indicate that this pathogenic mechanism may not be limited to Sia-expressing microorganisms and, thus, may represent a more widespread strategy of microbial immune evasion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Bacteria, growth conditions, and labeling.</title><p>GBS WT strains of serotypes Ia (A909) and III (COH1) are well-characterized isolates from human neonates with invasive infections.
