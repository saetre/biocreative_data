The ability to quantify the strength with which two binding partners interact is desirable but the accurate determination of equilibrium binding constants is a difficult process. The use of Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (LRET) provides a homogeneous binding assay that can be used for the detection of protein-protein interactions. Previously, we developed an LRET assay to screen for small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of &#x003c3;70 with the&#x003b2;' coiled-coil fragment (amino acids 100&#x02013;309). Here we describe an LRET binding assay used to monitor the interaction of <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003c3;70 and &#x003c3;32 with core RNA polymerase along with the controls to verify the system. This approach generates fluorescently labeled proteins through the random labeling of lysine residues which enables the use of the LRET assay for proteins for which the creation of single cysteine mutants is not feasible. With the LRET binding assay, we are able to show that the interaction of &#x003c3;70 with core RNAP is much more sensitive to NaCl than to potassium glutamate (KGlu), whereas the &#x003c3;32 interaction with core RNAP is insensitive to both salts even at concentrations &#x0003e;500 mM. We also find that the interaction of &#x003c3;32 with core RNAP is stronger than &#x003c3;70 with core RNAP, under all conditions tested. This work establishes a consistent set of conditions for the comparison of the binding affinities of the <italic>E.coli</italic> sigma factors with core RNA polymerase. The examination of the importance of salt conditions in the binding of these proteins could have implications in both in vitro assay conditions and in vivo function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The study of protein-protein interactions can often provide great insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cellular pathways. It is desirable to know the strength of the protein-protein interactions, but gathering such information accurately can often be difficult. With the knowledge of the strengths of protein-protein interactions, it is possible to gain insights into competition for binding when multiple proteins interact with the same partner and how the competition could be regulated. There are many ways in which protein-protein interactions can be measured. Non-homogeneous techniques such as surface plasmon resonance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Ferguson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, pull-down assays (ex. co-immunoprecipitation), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Andr1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, size exclusion chromatography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Maeda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Joo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> all utilize separation steps that can result in the inaccurate measurements of protein-protein interactions when the transient interactions or weak interactions have half-lives shorter than the time needed for separation to occur. Homogeneous assays such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), fluorescence quenching assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Gill1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Wu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, luminescence resonance energy transfer/time resolved FRET (LRET/TR-FRET), or fluorescence polarization (FP) all allow for the measurement of protein-protein interactions without the use of a separation step. These assays allow for minimal perturbation of the environment permitting binding to be measured under equilibrium conditions. With either type of binding assay it is important to consider the conditions in which the measurement is made.</p><p>FRET and LRET are both assays that measure the energy transfer from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore. When the emission spectrum of the donor overlaps with the excitation spectrum of the acceptor resonance energy transfer occurs with a non-radiative energy transfer through dipole-dipole interactions. The magnitude of the resonance energy transfer is distance-dependent, in that the efficiency of energy transfer decreases with the inverse sixth power of the distance between the dyes according to F&#x000f6;rster's theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Frster1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that the resonance energy transfer is distance dependent makes FRET and LRET highly suitable for the detection and quantification of protein-protein interactions. The key difference between FRET and LRET is that LRET utilizes a lanthanide chelate as the donor instead of a typical organic fluorophore. The lanthanide chelate's emission is technically not fluorescence (i.e. arising from a singlet to singlet transition) and has a very long fluorescent half-live (&#x0223c;ms) compared to the short half-life (&#x0223c;ns) of most organic fluorophores. The longer half-life of the lanthanide chelates provides the opportunity to time-gate or delay a measurement after excitation, allowing for reduction of background fluorescence. For a more detailed explanation of LRET, see the following publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Heyduk1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Selvin5">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> transcription machinery is a system in which the protein-protein interactions play a direct role in function. Core RNA polymerase (core RNAP) is a large multisubunit enzyme (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;&#x003b2;'&#x003c9;) that is capable of RNA synthesis but is not able to recognize specific promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Burgess1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. There are seven <italic>E. coli</italic> sigma factors, which have no enzymatic activity, but when bound to core RNAP provide the ability for the newly formed holoenzyme to recognize a unique set of gene promoters and initiate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Helmann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Gross1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore it is the interaction between core RNAP and a sigma factor that provides the bacteria the ability to respond to certain stresses by changing the transcription activity of the polymerase.</p><p>Studying these interactions and what regulates them can provide insights into global transcription regulation. This work focuses on the interaction of &#x003c3;70 and &#x003c3;32 with core RNAP. &#x003c3;70 (RpoD) was the first discovered sigma factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Burgess1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and is the most abundant sigma factor in <italic>E. coli</italic>, responsible for the transcription of genes needed for normal growth. &#x003c3;32 (RpoH) is the sigma factor that directs the transcripts needed to respond to heat shock and other stress conditions. It has been reported that core RNAP interacts with &#x003c3;70 with a binding strength of 0.25&#x02013;0.5 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Maeda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Gill1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Wu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> as well as 190 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Ferguson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and &#x003c3;32 with a binding strength of 1&#x02013;1.25 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Maeda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Joo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Unfortunately, the conditions in which these interactions have been measured were different making it difficult to directly compare the values. We have used our LRET assay to study the strength of binding of &#x003c3;70 and &#x003c3;32 with core RNAP and compare the results to those previously published results. In order to measure strong binding constants (K<sub>D</sub>'s in the low nM range) it is important to work in the correct &#x0201c;window of the assay&#x0201d;. It can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006490-g001">Figure 1</xref> that our assay must use concentrations of core RNAP around 5&#x02013;10 nM and the concentration of sigma is varied (0.1&#x02013;500 nM) to be able to distinguish tight binding interactions (K<sub>D</sub>&#x0223c;1 nM). If higher concentrations of core RNAP are used, it will be difficult to distinguish a K<sub>D</sub> of 1 nM from 10 nM. With the LRET assay we were able to show differential salt sensitivities to NaCl and potassium glutamate (KGlu) for the interaction of &#x003c3;70 and &#x003c3;32 with core RNAP. We also show that &#x003c3;32 interacts more strongly than &#x003c3;70 with core RNAP in all conditions tested.</p><fig id="pone-0006490-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006490.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Theoretical binding curves for a sigma factor to core RNAP.</title><p>Shown is the theoretical modeling of the binding of Tb-core to increasing concentrations of a fluorescein-labeled sigma factor.

A nonlinear least squares fitting of the data using Levenberg-Marquardt iterations was used to analyze the data. The program was allowed to determine the best values for K<sub>D</sub>. To achieve optimum fitting as determined by Chi-squared and R<sup>2</sup> values, the value for &#x0005b;core&#x0005d;<sub>0</sub> was set at 5 nM instead of 10 nM. The lowering of the concentration of Tb-core was supported by the lowered binding activity (&#x0223c;50&#x00025; active) observed in the gel shift assay. The maximum binding (A/D ratio) was set at the value where saturation was reached (1.2 for &#x003c3;70 and 1.6 for &#x003c3;32). The saturation levels for &#x003c3;70 and &#x003c3;32 were different due to the different amount of fluorescein-labels on each protein. The setting of this value was done under the assumption that if all samples contain the same amount of core, they should saturate binding at the same level. The assumption was necessary to fit the data that did not reach saturation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Protein labeling, purification, and characterization</title><p>The preparation of the labeled proteins used in the LRET assay is very important for the accuracy of the future experiments. In most cases the addition of a fluorescent dye results in the addition of a small hydrophobic patch on the protein of interest. This addition of hydrophobicity could theoretically alter the binding properties of the protein and appropriate controls need to be carried out. The proteins (1 mg/mL concentration) were labeled for 30 minutes at 22&#x000b0;C with a 5-fold molar ratio of dye to protein at pH 9.5. These conditions minimize over-labeling of the protein, typically yielding 1&#x02013;2 molecules of dye per protein molecule depending on the protein used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006490-Bergendahl1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. There are 34 lysine residues (5.5&#x00025;) in &#x003c3;70, 16 lysine residues in &#x003c3;32 (5.6&#x00025;), and 202 lysine residues in core RNAP (5.8&#x00025;). Once the protein has been labeled, it is critical to remove any free label and/or multimerized protein that may have resulted. Free label can cause an increase in background signal due to diffusion-limited LRET and multimers can decrease the activity of the protein population. Diffusion-limited LRET is observed when the concentration of either the free dye or the labeled proteins increase to a level where a false-positive signal occurs when the donor and acceptor are in close proximity while passing by diffusion and not through binding. Two purification steps are used to clean up the protein sample. First the sample is diluted 10-fold with TGE and purified by gravity anion-exchange chromatography using DE52 DEAE cellulose resin to concentrate the sample while also removing the majority of the free dye. The concentrated protein is then loaded onto a size-exclusion chromatography column to remove the remainder of the free dye. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006490-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the removal of the free dye from the sample as well as the separation of multimer forms of the protein from monomer as visualized with a fluorescent scan of the SDS-PAGE using a Typhoon imager.

This assay can determine if all of the labeled sigma factor is able to bind to core RNAP and if terbium-labeled core is able to bind to sigma as well as unlabeled core. The assay shows that both F-&#x003c3;70 and F-&#x003c3;32 are able to be shifted completely to holo by the addition of core RNAP and therefore are 100&#x00025; active in binding. The assay also shows that the terbium-labeled core is slightly less active in its ability to shift both F-&#x003c3;70 and F-&#x003c3;32 as compared to unlabeled core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006490-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This inactive labeled core could be caused by the labeling of the core RNAP if some of the dye derivatized lysines prevent the interaction with sigma. It appears that the Tb-labeled core contains a population (35&#x02013;50&#x00025;) that is inactive in binding sigma. Similar results have been obtained with many other batches of proteins utilizing a variety of fluorescent labels (data not shown for proteins labeled with Alexa Fluor546, Alexa Fluor 555, or Alexa Fluor647 (Invitrogen)). The activity can vary from batch to batch even with unlabeled proteins, due to steps in the production such as protein refolding. The decreased activity was accounted for when the data were fit as described above. It can also be seen that some of the labeled core RNAP tends to run at a faster mobility than the unlabeled core RNAP during non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the unlabeled core RNAP has a somewhat greater tendency to form higher multimers. The F-&#x003c3;32 also contained two species that were both able to interact with core RNAP to form holoenzyme.

In the previous assay, site-specific labeling at cysteine residues was used to create the LRET pair. In this work we have used random labeling of lysine residues to label core RNAP and sigma factors. This approach is different from the past assay because the random labeling allows the use of proteins for which the creation of single cysteine mutants is not feasible.</p><p>Before using the assay to monitor the interactions of the sigma factors with core RNAP, it was important to fully characterize the assay components and understand the assumptions that are made when using the assay. The first important consideration is the properties of the labeled proteins. We make the assumption that the labeling process does not change the binding activity of the proteins. The first control for this assumption is the production and purification of the labeled proteins. The proteins are labeled in a manner that attached 1-2 labels per molecule of protein. Often the dyes being attached are hydrophobic and if too many are attached it is reasonable that the binding properties of the protein could be altered. By limiting the number of labels per protein, the chance of altering the activity is minimized. The purification scheme is also designed to remove all excess non-reacted label that may cause background in the assay as well as any protein multimers formed because of the labeling process. It is extremely important to test all labeled proteins to determine if the activity has been altered. The native electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to determine if the label has changed the ability of sigma and core RNAP to interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006490-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Analysis of this binding shows that both F-&#x003c3;70 and F-&#x003c3;32 are shifted 100&#x00025; to the holoenzyme when core RNAP is added in excess. The analysis also shows that the Tb-core may be slightly less active in binding sigma than the unlabeled core. The labeled proteins could also be tested for activity in assays such as <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and promoter binding, but for the context of these experiments it was most important to understand the effect of labeling on the protein binding properties. Ultimately, the activity that will be measured for any labeled protein should be compared to the activity of the unlabeled protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Site-specific versus random labeling of proteins</title><p>Site-specific mutations are often used in LRET or FRET to direct the addition of one label to a certain site in a structure by moving the location of one cysteine.

Unfortunately, not all proteins can be created with a single cysteine. Sometimes the large number of cysteines that need to be removed or the importance of specific cysteines for the structure or activity of the protein makes site-specific labeling of the protein impossible. We used random labeling of lysine residues to avoid these specific problems when using core RNA polymerase which contains 36 cysteine residues. By controlling the labeling conditions to yield 1&#x02013;2 molecules of label per protein we can create a population of labeled protein that should contain at least one dye within the F&#x000f6;rster radius (&#x0223c;65 &#x000c5; for this dye pair) allowing for efficient energy transfer.

The effect of temperature on K<sub>D</sub> was tested (1 hour incubation at 22&#x000b0;C, 37&#x000b0;C, and 45&#x000b0;C), but no difference was measured (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>The window of the assay</title><p>It is important to also consider that binding assays have a particular range in which it is possible to measure binding strengths accurately. This &#x0201c;window of the assay&#x0201d; must be considered when an experiment is being designed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006490-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows theoretical binding curves that would be generated if a sigma factor interacted with 5 nM core RNAP with a K<sub>D</sub> of 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 nM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006490-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows the same binding strengths modeled with 50 nM core RNAP. When using the increased core concentration, it is almost impossible to distinguish the 0.1 nM curve from the 1 nM curve. If too much core is used to perform the assay, it will be difficult to distinguish strong interactions. The lower limit (&#x0223c;1 nM donor) that can be measured with the assay is determined by the signal strength of the LRET pair. The upper boundary of the assay (&#x0223c;250&#x02013;500 nM acceptor) is determined by the concentrations at which diffusion-limited LRET begins to create a false-positive for binding. The lower limit of the assay is low nM depending on the number of labels per protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>The effect of salt on the interaction of &#x003c3;70 and &#x003c3;32 with core RNAP</title><p>The LRET assay was used to determine the optimal salt type and concentration to use when studying the interaction of 20 nM F-&#x003c3;70 or 20 nM F-&#x003c3;32 with 10 nM Tb-core RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006490-g005">Figure 5</xref>). It was observed that the binding of F-&#x003c3;70 to Tb-core RNAP was much more sensitive to NaCl than was &#x003c3;32. NaCl caused the weakening of the F-&#x003c3;70-core interaction whereas F-&#x003c3;32 was able to remain fully bound at concentrations up to 1 M. It was also found that F-&#x003c3;70 was much more resistant to KGlu, whereas F-&#x003c3;32 again did not have any decrease in binding. This differential salt effect suggests that F-&#x003c3;70 and F-&#x003c3;32 have somewhat different binding mechanisms with core RNAP. When comparing binding data it is important to consider the buffer conditions in which the interactions were measured because conditions such as salt type and concentration can significantly alter the interaction.</p><p>The LRET assay was used to determine equilibrium binding constants for the interaction of F-&#x003c3;70 and F-&#x003c3;32 with core RNAP. It was found that the binding of F-&#x003c3;70 to Tb-core RNAP was variable depending on salt concentration and type. The binding affinity significantly weakened as the concentration of NaCl was increased. It should be noted that the determination of binding constant is less accurate at the higher NaCl because saturation could not be achieved in the assay, but it is clear that binding is significantly weakened. The prediction that KGlu would not affect the interaction of F-&#x003c3;70 with Tb-core was also confirmed. The binding in the presence of KGlu was generally stronger for &#x003c3;70 and did not decrease as much at the higher concentrations. The affect of salt on the binding of F-&#x003c3;32 to Tb-core RNAP was confirmed; the binding was very similar with NaCl or KGlu and the binding strength was not greatly weakened, even at 500 mM.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Comparison of binding data</title><p>The values for the binding of &#x003c3;70 and &#x003c3;32 to core RNA polymerase are similar to many of the values obtained in previous studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006490-t001">Table 1</xref>). Unlike the previous values, our set of data can be directly compared because of the consistent set of conditions used. These same conditions could be repeated with the remaining sigma factors to allow for a more detailed comparison of binding strengths. It is difficult to directly analyze the previous results because the effect of salt and other buffer components, as well as the high concentrations of proteins used, can directly change or decrease the accuracy of the measured binding affinity. In particular, we question whether K<sub>D</sub>'s of around 1 nM could possibly be measured using concentrations greater than 100 nM core RNAP, given the theoretical curves presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006490-g001">Figure 1b</xref>. Our results provided extra value because the experiments and controls were carefully performed with concentrations of proteins that can accurately generate K<sub>D</sub> values in the range we described. We acknowledge that uncertainties in protein concentration, activity, and the fit of the model can also change the affinity measured but the relative order of magnitude of the binding affinities is clear. It is not apparent if the difference between a 1 nM and 2 nM binding strength is significant due to all of the uncertainties mentioned. It is important to recognize that these same problems and uncertainties are present for all binding assays.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0006490-t001" position="float"><object-id
