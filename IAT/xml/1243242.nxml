A striking feature of HCV disease is the high rate of progression to chronicity, with over 80% of acutely infected individuals developing chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This inflammation has been associated with liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and autoimmune dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Treatment for HCV is toxic and of limited efficacy, and the majority of infected individuals do not receive the antiviral therapies available.</p><p>Recently, HCV infection has been repeatedly linked to progressive declines in pulmonary function in patients with underlying lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In patients who already had a diagnosis of COPD, chronic HCV infection led to a more rapid decline in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), findings that were abrogated in those treated with interferon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In a recent 6-year prospective trial, asthmatic patients with chronic HCV who did not respond to interferon had greater impaired reversibility to bronchodilators when compared to either HCV-negative controls or to HCV-positive individuals who responded to interferon. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] Some data suggests that HCV infection may alter acetylcholine-mediated airway tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Other smaller studies also suggest a role for HCV infection in various pulmonary diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>While the pathogenesis of the progressive liver disease that occurs with HCV infection involves fibrosis of hepatic tissue in the setting of chronic inflammation, there are few data available that address the inflammatory aspects of HCV infection that lead to declines in lung function. Studies in chronically infected individuals have however demonstrated increased levels of both serum and intrahepatic cytokines, in particular interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine well-known to mediate inflammatory pulmonary processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. IL-8 is involved in host inflammatory responses and is synthesized by many different cell types, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Expression of IL-8 may inhibit the antiviral activity of interferon &#x003b3; (IFN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and correlates with the degree of hepatic fibrosis and portal inflammation during HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While IL-8 plays a significant role in pulmonary pathology in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], its role in pulmonary disease specifically associated with HCV has not been addressed.</p><p>IL-8 signaling is characterized by the integration of at least three different signaling pathways that coordinate induction of mRNA synthesis or that suppress mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Current models suggest that maximal IL-8 can be generated upon de-repression of the gene promoter, activation of NF&#x003ba;B and JNK pathways, and stabilization of the resulting mRNA by p38 MAPK signaling. ERK signaling also contributes to IL-8 induction, although it does not appear to be a potent inducer. TNF&#x003b1; likely activates all of these pathways and has served as a model for robust IL-8 signaling.</p><p>Interestingly, we and other investigators have found that the nucleocapsid core protein of HCV may modulate immune signaling pathways, including those mediated by receptors such as gC1qR, TNFR1, and Fas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This protein has been found in serum in naked form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and soluble core protein can bind and signal extracellularly via the complement receptor, gC1q, on lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. HCV core appears to be the most potent signal inducer of the IL-8 promoter in hepatocytes transfected with viral protein-reporter expression vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>We would like to better understand the mechanisms by which chronic HCV infection leads to a more progressive pulmonary decline in individuals with chronic lung disease. Because HCV core antigen can modulate immune signaling pathways that affect IL-8 transcription, we examined the role of soluble HCV core protein in IL-8 signaling in pulmonary fibroblasts. We document an HCV core-induced increase in IL-8 mRNA and protein expression in fibroblasts that is both dose- and time-dependent. We demonstrate that this increase is associated with activation of p38 MAPK that this activation is necessary. We show that co-signaling with TNF&#x003b1; and HCV core leads to augmentation of IL-8 gene and protein expression. Finally, we document that HCV core-mediated IL-8 up-regulation can be inhibited using antibodies that block gC1qR, a known receptor for soluble HCV core antigen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Tissue Culture</title><p>Normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) (Clonetics-BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) were grown in fibroblast basal medium (Clonetics-BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) at 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C.

Time course experiments were done in the same manner for 12, 24, and 48 hours. Tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) was added at 1 U/mL with and without HCV core antigen and incubated for 24 hours. Inhibition of p38 MAPK studies were done using the specific inhibitor, SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. NHLF were pretreated with SB203580 (10 &#x003bc;M) for two hours prior to addition of HCV core antigen or control proteins.

RNA was extracted by a RNAzol technique from cultured cells. Briefly, total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cells (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells) by the addition of 1.1 mL of RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, Texas). The suspension was shaken for 1 minute and centrifuged at 12,000 &#x000d7; g for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The aqueous phase was washed twice with 0.8 ml phenol:chloroform (1:1, v/v), and once with 0.8 mL of chloroform. Each time, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 &#x000d7; g for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. An equal volume of isopropanol was added to the aqueous phase, and the preparation refrigerated at -20&#x000b0;C overnight. After centrifugation at 12,000 &#x000d7; g for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, the RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol. The RNA pellet was air dried and suspended in 20 &#x003bc;l of DEPC-treated water. RNA was quantitated by optical density readings at 260 nm, and the integrity of the 28S and 18S RNA bands determined by electrophoresis in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. First strand cDNA was synthesized in the presence of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (2.5 U/&#x003bc;L), 1 mM each of the nucleotides dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP; RNase inhibitor (1 U/&#x003bc;L), 10&#x000d7; PCR buffer (500 mM KCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3), and MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(5 mM), using oligo(dT)<sub>16 </sub>(2.5 mM) as a primer. The preparation was incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes in a DNA thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT) for reverse transcription. PCR amplification was done on aliquots of the cDNA in the presence of MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(1.8 mM), dNTPs (0.2 mM), and AmpliTaq polymerase (1 U/50 &#x003bc;L), and paired cytokine-specific primers (0.2 nM of each primer) to a total volume of 50 &#x003bc;l. Paired primers for the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were employed as a control for gene expression. PCR consisted of 1 cycle of 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 45 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 45 sec, 60&#x000b0;C for 45 sec, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min 30 sec, and lastly, 1 cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Fourteen microliters of the amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. IL-8 gene products were confirmed by fragment size.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescent Staining</title><p>NHLF were cultured on sterile coverslips overnight and subsequently treated with &#x003b2;-gal or core (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 30 minutes to three hours.

Expression of gC1qR on pulmonary fibroblasts was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibody to gC1qR (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

Our study represents a first attempt to examine the pathogenesis of this process. In this study, we demonstrate that the core nucleocapsid protein of hepatitis C virus induces the up-regulation of a key inflammatory cytokine, IL-8, in pulmonary fibroblasts. Treatment with soluble HCV core antigen led to increases in both IL-8 message and protein that augmented TNF&#x003b1;-induced IL-8 expression. This core-induced up-regulation was associated with p38 activation, which was required for core-induced signaling. IL-8 up-regulation was also dependent upon gC1qR, a known receptor for soluble HCV core.</p><p>It is important to note that our studies involved direct extracellular delivery of HCV core protein. The vast majority of studies involving HCV core have employed transfection techniques to deliver HCV proteins intracellularly, with the assumption that this would mimic viral infection of the given cell being studied. Using these techniques, we and other investigators have noted intracellular interactions with various immunomodulatory receptors, including Fas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], TNFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and LT&#x003b2;R[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], mediated in general through the cytoplasmic domains of those receptors.</p><p>Several studies however have now reported that nanomolar amounts of core protein are detected in the circulating blood of HCV-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and that core protein is secreted from transfected cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This has raised the possibility that HCV core can function extracellularly as a signaling antigen as a means of modulating immune responses. Recent studies focusing on the interaction of soluble core antigen with gC1qR have provided exciting and novel mechanisms by which HCV core might be exerting its immunomodulatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As noted by other investigators, the amounts secreted from transfected cell lines are similar to those employed in our and other investigators' studies of soluble core protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Our findings that HCV core antigen activates MAPK pathways involved in cytokine signaling is supported by multiple previous investigations. In a tetracycline-regulated system used to express HCV core in HepG2 cells, core expression led to activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways and to an increase in cellular proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Similarly, studies have shown that stable transfection of HCV core results in activation of JNK and AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Upon co-tranfection of HCV proteins and an IL-8 reporter plasmid into mammalian cells, HCV core exhibited the strongest effect on intracellular signaling pathways and activated the IL-8 promoter via NF&#x003ba;B and AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These studies, however, focused primarily on signaling pathways and promoter activity rather than gene expression <italic>per se</italic>. Our data demonstrate that activation of at least some of these pathways does ultimately result in detectable gene and protein expression in pulmonary fibroblasts.</p><p>It is notable that multiple other HCV gene products have been associated with IL-8 upregulation, including HCV E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], NS4A and 4B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and NS5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These studies were performed primarily in hepatocytyes or HeLa cells, but the effect of these gene products on pulmonary fibroblast signaling is yet to be examined. It is certainly feasible that multiple HCV proteins contribute to chemokine upregulation and inflammation in pulmonary fibroblasts, and this possibility should be the focus of future studies.</p><p>Our experiments suggest that the ability of HCV core to up-regulate IL-8 expression may be dependent upon p38 phosphorylation. This is perhaps not surprising given the putative role for p38 in stabilizing mRNA following activation of IL-8 at the transcriptional level. In current models of IL-8 signaling, p38 activation is necessary for maximal IL-8 production following stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our studies would suggest that HCV core provides activation of p38 signaling, which is associated with robust IL-8 up-regulation in multiple cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We cannot at this point rule out that other MAPKs, such as JNK and perhaps ERK, are not also involved in the HCV core-mediated up-regulation of IL-8. These studies are ongoing in our laboratory.</p><p>Soluble core antigen has been shown to inhibit human T cell responses via the complement receptor, gC1qR, which interestingly involved an inhibition of the ERK/MEK MAPK signaling pathway in these T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. HCV core can directly and extracellularly bind gC1qR, a phenomenon which is saturable at core concentrations of 3 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. gC1qR is expressed on pulmonary fibroblasts, and our data suggest that IL-8 up-regulation by soluble HCV core in NHLF is at least partially dependent upon this receptor. It is notable that a similar induction of IL-8 expression via gC1qR was observed in HUVEC endothelial cells and was also mediated through MAPK-dependent processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Ongoing studies are examining the effect of blocking gC1qR on NF&#x003ba;B signaling and on MAPK signals such as p38, JNK, and ERK.</p><p>Notably, IL-8 has been found to be a key mediator of pulmonary inflammation and reactive airway disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Patients with persistent asthma have an influx of neutrophils and increased local pulmonary IL-8 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Because IL-8 has been shown to directly provoke bronchoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], it presumably contributes to the establishment of chronic reactive airway disease directly and indirectly by stimulating neutrophil recruitment and activation. Activation of transcription factors or kinase pathways leading to up-regulation of IL-8 expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple other viral infections, including adenovirus (ERK), CMV (NF&#x003ba;B), and KSHV (p38, JNK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The pro-inflammatory characteristics of HCV core protein described in our studies may be of key importance to clinical infection. Individuals with chronic HCV infection have evidence of upregulated IL-8 responses, including increased levels of IL-8 mRNA in liver biopsies from infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and increased IL-8 protein detectable in serum compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>](unpublished observations, JPM.) Notably, intrahepatic IL-8 mRNA levels have correlated with both hepatic fibrosis and inflammatory indices and were associated with resistance to interferon therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that a similar phenomenon is occurring in pulmonary tissue in response to HCV core and contributes to the declines in pulmonary function associated with active HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In such a model, circulating core antigen would bind to gC1qR displayed on the surface of pulmonary fibroblasts and trigger the phosphorylation/activation of p38, NF&#x003ba;B, and possibly other MAPK mediators. This would lead to enhanced IL-8 gene transcription and protein expression, increased neutrophil recruitment at the local level, and ultimately the deterioration in pulmonary function observed in HCV-infected patients with lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is noteworthy that patients with HCV infection even in the absence of pulmonary symptoms have been found to have increased numbers of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar fluid samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our studies point to a role for HCV core protein in up-regulating IL-8 mRNA and protein expression in a p38- and gC1qR-dependent manner and support much of the growing body of literature that suggests that HCV core is pro-inflammatory in specific cells. Further dissection of the pathways involved in HCV core-mediated signaling may provide a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of pulmonary and hepatic disease in HCV-infected individuals and provide targets for modulating its effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>HCV: hepatitis C virus</p><p>NHLF: normal human lung fibroblasts</p><p>IL-8: interleukin 8</p><p>MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase</p><p>BALF: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid</p><p>EBV, Epstein-Barr virus</p><p>IFN, interferon</p><p>LPS, lipopolysaccharide</p><p>CMV: cytomegalovirus</p><p>KSHV: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus</p><p>ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p><p>DLCO: diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide</p><p>FEV1: forced expiratory volume at one second</p><p>COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p><p>JNK: jun-kinase</p><p>NF&#x003ba;B: nuclear factor kappa B</p><p>TNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor</p><p>HPRT: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase</p><p>PMSF: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride</p><p>PAGE: polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p><bold>JPM </bold>conceived the study, participated in its design, coordinated all experiments and drafted the manuscript. <bold>SMF </bold>carried out the IL-8 immunoassays and RT-PCR reactions and helped draft the manuscript. <bold>DCP </bold>completed all immunofluorescence studies. <bold>SAL </bold>carried out experiments involving TNF&#x003b1; including immunoassays. <bold>DSC </bold>participated in study design and data interpretation and provided critical manuscript review. <bold>GK </bold>participated in the study design, coordinated experiments, and drafted the manuscript in coordination with JPM.
