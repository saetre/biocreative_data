HD is caused by an abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract located in the N-terminus of a ubiquitously expressed protein called huntingtin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> Huntingtin polyglutamine tracts in the normal population have up to 35 CAG repeats while those of HD patients are expanded to 36 or more CAG repeats.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> Genetic data in humans and transgenic animal models suggest that polyglutamine expansions confer a deleterious gain-of-function on the target proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> However, this does not preclude the possibility that the severity of HD may be modified by loss-of-function effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Huntingtin is present in the nucleus, suggesting it may play a role in nuclear events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> Single candidate gene and unbiased microarray approaches have clearly demonstrated that transcription of numerous genes is dysregulated in human HD brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and in transgenic mouse and cell models of HD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> The promoter motifs of genes downregulated in HD cell models suggested defects in transcription mediated through cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein, retinoic acid receptor (RAR), and specificity protein-1 (Sp1).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></p><p>Both wild-type and mutant huntingtin bind to a number of transcription factors, including Sp1 and CREB protein. In some cases, this interaction can be strengthened by expanded polyglutamine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Mechanistically, huntingtin appears to regulate transcription both as a normal function and as a deleterious gain-of-function upon expansion of its polyglutamine tract. Although transcription factors can be localised to nuclear inclusions formed by mutant huntingtin,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> it is unclear whether mutant huntingtin perturbs transcription by simply sequestering transcription factors in aggregates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> Soluble mutant huntingtin may act to disrupt transcription factor binding to DNA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> Important work has revealed a role for wild-type huntingtin in HD where loss of function of huntingtin contributes to the severity of the disease by disrupting transcription of neuronal genes. Wild-type but not mutant huntingtin stimulated transcription of the gene encoding brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> This effect occurs through cytoplasmic sequestering of repressor element-1 transcription factor/neuron restrictive factor (REST/NRSF) that can bind to the promoter of the BDNF gene to repress its transcription. Mutant huntingtin binds less avidly to REST/NRSF allowing it to enter the nucleus and repress BDNF gene expression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> Polyglutamine expansion may result in both a loss and a gain of specific functions of a protein, as has been elegantly demonstrated for ATX1, where expansion of the CAG repeat differentially affects its function in the context of different endogenous protein complexes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></p><p>To elucidate new transcriptional pathways regulated by huntingtin, we tested several nuclear receptors (NRs), normally expressed in the brain, for their ability to interact with the N-terminal fragment of huntingtin (amino acids 1&#x02013;588) with a normal (17Q) or expanded (138Q) polyglutamine repeat. Nuclear receptors are of particular interest since they control a wide range of physiological processes and are highly expressed in the brain; 94% of all nuclear receptors are found endogenously in neurons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> In this study, we found wild-type huntingtin could bind to a number of nuclear receptors including: LXR&#x003b1;, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and thyroid hormone receptor-&#x003b1;1 (TR&#x003b1;1). Recent work describes the disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in HD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> The two LXRs, LXR&#x003b1; and LXR&#x003b2;, are recognised to be central regulators of cholesterol metabolism in mammals. Both LXRs activate target genes by binding to response elements located in their promoter regions as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Oxysterols and intermediates of the biosynthetic cholesterol pathway have been identified as the natural ligands for LXR (reviewed by Wojcicka <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). We found LXR bound to wild-type huntingtin via its ligand binding domain (LBD). Over-expression of huntingtin activates LXR mediated transcription and knockout of huntingtin decreases LXR mediated transcription. Furthermore, knockout of huntingtin decreases expression of ABCA1, a key downstream target gene regulated by LXR. An agonist of LXR partially rescues the phenotype observed in huntingtin deficient zebrafish. These data suggest that huntingtin can regulate LXR mediated transcription and may play a general role as a co-factor of nuclear receptors. LXR transcriptional deficiency may contribute to the phenotypes of huntingtin defects in vivo.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression constructs</title><p>cDNAs encoding human LXR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b3;, VDR, TR&#x003b1;1 and RXR&#x003b1; were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloned into the pcDNA3.1Myc-His vector using the following restriction sites respectively; BamHI/XhoI, KpnI/XhoI, BamHI/XhoI, BamHI/NotI and EcoRI/XhoI.

LXR was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody and any associated huntingtin was detected by western blot probed with anti-FLAG antibody. Htt588 bound strongly to LXR while Htt190 and Htt315 bound more weakly.

LXR is highly expressed in the liver, but unfortunately huntingtin is poorly expressed in the liver (supplemental fig S1A). Thus, detection of an endogenous interaction between LXR and huntingtin has not proved to be possible, as even a 10% interaction would be far below the limits of detection in our system. It is important to note that we are unaware of successful endogenous LXR immunoprecipitation to detect interacting proteins in the literature, presumably due to its low abundance. Furthermore, the entire literature examining the effect of LXR interacting proteins on its transcriptional activity have relied on LXR over-expression experiments to dissect the interactions and transcriptional effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The huntingtin-LXR interaction is not mediated by pentapeptide LxxLL motifs present in huntingtin</title><p>The LBD of NRs contains a shallow hydrophobic groove that crystallographic studies have shown to bind a pentapeptide motif (LxxLL) found in a number of co-activator proteins (NR binding motif).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> Huntingtin 588 contains five of these motifs, two of which share a common leucine.

These data suggest that huntingtin can regulate the expression of LXR target genes in vivo. LXR agonist rescue of FASN and ACC mRNA expression in huntingtin knockdown zebrafish suggests that huntingtin may regulate these genes through LXR dependent pathways. However, huntingtin may regulate ABCG1 and CYP7A1 expression through LXR independent pathways since treatment with LXR agonist could not rescue their expression in huntingtin knockdown zebrafish.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Huntingtin plays a functional role in regulation of transcription both in its wild-type and mutant form. Microarray studies in cell and mouse models of HD and in human HD brains have revealed widespread dysregulation of transcriptional pathways. In addition, studies of specific transcription factors have catalogued a number of transcription factors able to bind to huntingtin with both dependency and independency on poly-Q length. These include CA150, CREB, COOH terminal binding protein, nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR), p53, RNA polymerase associated protein 30 (RAP30) and Sp1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> A key function of wild-type huntingtin in the modulation of REST/NRSF transcription has also been described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref></p><p>In this study, we have identified several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that are able to interact with huntingtin. The nuclear receptor superfamily can be divided into six subfamilies based on the evolution of the two well conserved domains of NRs, the DBD and LBD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Huntingtin interactors&#x02014;LXR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b3;, VDR and TR&#x003b1;1&#x02014;are all members of subfamily 1 and function as heterodimers with a common binding partner, RXR. Interestingly, we found RXR&#x003b1; does not bind to huntingtin. We narrowed down the region of LXR that binds to huntingtin to be the LBD. Addition of LXR agonist, however, has no obvious effect on the binding of huntingtin to LXR as assessed by immunoprecipitation (unpublished data). The LBD is well conserved between LXR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b3;, VDR and TR&#x003b1;1, the amino acid identity being 30&#x02013;38%. The amino acid identity between LXR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1; is less well conserved being &#x0003c;25%. We also found the LBD of PPAR&#x003b3; was able to bind to huntingtin (data not shown). Based on this finding and the sequence homology, it is possible that all four nuclear receptors found to bind to huntingtin interact via their LBDs.</p><p>Huntingtin has a multitude of binding partners which cluster into several different functional groups including cytoskeletal organisation and biogenesis, signal transduction, synaptic transmission, proteolysis and regulation of transcription or translation. Huntingtin&#x02019;s ability to bind to nuclear receptors and other transcription factors to regulate transcription of an even greater number of proteins adds another level of regulation to huntingtin&#x02019;s functional capabilities. We find that expansion of the polyglutamine tract in mutant huntingtin inhibits its binding to nuclear receptors and its ability to activate LXR transcription. The mutant protein misfolds resulting in a conformational change which could block its interaction with LXR and in turn affect its function. Given huntingtin&#x02019;s multiplicity of binding partners with diverse functions, disruption of its normal function by expansion of the polyglutamine repeat is likely to have an effect on many cellular processes and it will be important to understand the relative contributions of these different processes to the progression of HD.</p><p>The LBD of nuclear receptors is required for ligand binding and receptor dimerisation. LXR/RXR heterodimers bind to LXREs in the promoter region of target genes to regulate transcription. In the absence of agonist, the LXR/RXR heterodimer actively inhibits transcription by recruiting co-repressors. Ligand binding induces dissociation of the co-repressors, leading to moderate stimulation of transcription, and then allows recruitment of co-activators causing maximal stimulation of transcription. We show over-expression of wild-type huntingtin increases, while knockout of huntingtin reduces LXR mediated transcription of an LXRE-luciferase reporter. Furthermore, transcription of the LXR target gene ABCA1 is reduced by huntingtin knockout. Therefore, we suggest wild-type huntingtin acts as a co-factor of LXR mediated transcription. Mutant huntingtin is unable to activate LXR mediated transcription, suggesting that expansion of the polyglutamine tract interferes with normal huntingtin co-factor function.</p><p>Recently, huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) was shown to modulate transcriptional activity of NRs. HIP1 significantly repressed transcription when knocked down using a silencing RNA (siRNA) approach and activated transcription when overexpressed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> Therefore, huntingtin&#x02019;s co-factor function could be mediated by HIP1. We tested this hypothesis using a silencing RNA approach to knockdown HIP1 in HEK cells transiently expressing LXRE-luciferase reporter, LXR and huntingtin. HIP1 knockdown had no effect on the huntingtin activation of LXR mediated transcription, indicating that HIP1 does not mediate huntingtin&#x02019;s co-factor function (see supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMG-46-07-0438-f02">fig 2</xref>).</p><p>Many transcriptional co-activators contain multiple, short LxxLL motifs that adopt a helical structure to bind to a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the LBD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> Huntingtin 588 contains five of these nuclear receptor interaction motifs; however, mutational analysis demonstrated that they were not necessary for the huntingtin-LXR interaction, indicating huntingtin binds to the LBD via a novel mechanism. LxxLL motif independent binding has been observed previously for constitutive coactivator of PPAR&#x003b3; which has four LxxLL motifs, none of which are important for its binding to PPAR&#x003b3;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> A number of transcriptional regulators contain glutamine-rich activating domains that serve as protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> Huntingtin also interacts with several transcription factors such as p53, RAP30, RAP74 and Sp1 via its amino terminal proline rich domain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Deletion of either of these domains, however, had no effect on the binding of huntingtin to LXR (data not shown) suggesting huntingtin binds to LXR via a novel mechanism. Our data demonstrates in vitro binding of LXR to huntingtin, shows deletion of different protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains of huntingtin (LxxLL motifs, polyglutamine and polyproline domains) has no effect on co-factor function, and shows polyglutamine expansion has an effect on co-factor function, suggesting that huntingtin&#x02019;s regulation of transcription is a direct rather than an indirect effect of huntingtin.</p><p>The physiological role of huntingtin&#x02019;s co-activation of LXR is unknown. LXR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; play a central role in the transcriptional regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> LXRs act as sensors, modifying expression of genes in pathways that govern transport, catabolism and elimination of cholesterol. Knockout of both LXR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; led to impaired cholesterol homeostasis and neuronal degeneration in the brain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> Mouse models of HD have impaired cholesterol biosynthesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> Interestingly, mice overexpressing wild-type huntingtin with 18 glutamines have a reversal of this phenotype with a higher activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that wild-type huntingtin normally plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis. This phenomenon is entirely compatible with our data where we show a role for wild-type huntingtin in the modulation of LXR activity. Since alterations in LXR activity regulate the transcription of cholesterol excretory genes, wild-type huntingtin could be involved in regulation of cholesterol homeostasis both at the biosynthetic and the catabolic level.</p><p>Huntingtin is essential for development in mice. Embryos of huntingtin homozygous knockout mice die by day 8.5.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> During development the demand for cholesterol in the brain is particularly high. In adult brain, a large proportion of the cholesterol content derives from its accumulation during the early phases of life. In developing zebrafish, we observed a severe phenotype, with reduction of cartilage in the lower jaw, when we knocked down huntingtin. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the expression of LXR target genes in huntingtin knocked down fish. The cartilage phenotype and reduced LXR target gene expression can be partially rescued by an LXR agonist, suggesting that huntingtin&#x02019;s function as a transcriptional co-factor at LXR target genes is important in a physiological context. It would be interesting to conduct studies in conditional huntingtin knock-out mice to elucidate further the in vivo role of huntingtin-LXR interaction and its biological relevance. Huntingtin interactions with other transcription factors, including other nuclear receptors, are also likely to be important during development since treatment with LXR agonist only partially rescued the cartilage phenotype and did not rescue expression of all the LXR target genes affected by huntingtin knockdown. Thus, we believe that the rescue of the FASN and ACC expression in the huntingtin deficient zebrafish by the LXR agonist suggests that huntingtin may control the transcription of these genes mainly via LXR. Conversely, huntingtin may regulate expression of ABCG1 and CYP7A1 via multiple targets and this may explain why they were not rescued by the LXR agonist in the huntingtin knockdown zebrafish. In adults, loss of wild-type huntingtin function in HD and potential disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in the brain may be important for the progression of HD since cholesterol is important for synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth and neurotransmitter release, processes which are seen to be impaired in HD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Marcy E MacDonald for providing the huntingtin wild-type and knockout ES cells.
