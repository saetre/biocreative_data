Although type IV collagen is the main component of thickened GBM in diabetic nephropathy, cellular metabolism of each &#x003b1; chains of type IV collagen has not been well studied. To investigate the regulation of &#x003b1;(IV) chains in diabetic conditions, we examined whether glucose and advanced glycosylation endproduct (AGE) regulate the metabolism of each &#x003b1;(IV) chains in the diabetic tissue and glomerular epithelial cells (GEpC). Glomerular collagen &#x003b1;3(IV) and &#x003b1;5(IV) chains protein were higher and more intense in immunofluorescence staining according to diabetic durations compared to controls. In vitro, mainly high glucose and partly AGE usually increased total collagen protein of GEpC by [<sup>3</sup>H]-proline incorporation assay and each &#x003b1;(IV) chain proteins including &#x003b1;1(IV), &#x003b1;3(IV), and &#x003b1;5(IV) in time-dependent and subchain-specific manners. However, the changes of each &#x003b1;(IV) chains mRNA expression was not well correlated to the those of each chain proteins. The present findings suggest that the metabolism of individual &#x003b1;(IV) chains of GBM is differentially regulated in diabetic conditions and those changes might be induced not only by transcriptional level but also by post-translational modifications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Glycosylation End Products, Advanced</kwd><kwd>Diabetic Nephropathies</kwd><kwd>Collagen Type IV</kwd><kwd>Glucose</kwd><kwd>Podocytes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Diabetic nephropathy and vascular changes remain major complications of diabetes, accounting for up to 40% of cases with end-stage renal disease and 75% of cases with cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Many studies suggest a key role for hyperglycemia in the pathogenesis of these complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Indeed, elevated glucose is known to activate a variety of cells to stimulate extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis including collagen mediated by stimulating transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Pathologic changes in the glomerular ECM lead to abnormal protein excretion as well as to impairment of glomerular filtration in diabetic nephropathy. Alterations in the diabetic glomerular basement membrane (GBM) include increase in its thickness and decrease in the density of anionic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The former corresponds to increase in GBM content of collagen forming mesh-like barrier structure which regulates the size-selective aspects of glomerular permselectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>GBM are assembled through an interweaving of type IV collagen (collagen IV) with laminins, nidogen, and sulfated proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Collagen IV belongs to a family of collagenous proteins that has at least 25 distinct members. The <italic>COL4A1</italic>, <italic>COL4A2</italic>, <italic>COL4A3</italic>, <italic>COL4A4</italic>, <italic>COL4A5</italic>, and <italic>COL4A6</italic> genes encode the six chains of collagen IV, &#x003b1;1(IV) through &#x003b1;6(IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Type IV collagen chains have a highly regulated distribution in the glomerulus; &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 chains are localized to the mesangium, whereas &#x003b1;3 through &#x003b1;6 chains are found mainly in the GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Type IV collagen of GBM is produced by and attached to podocytes, therefore, type IV collagen of GBM is closely related to podocytes. Dysregulation of GBM collagen chains produces proteinuria and hematuria as seen in Alport's syndrome and Goodpasture syndrome clinically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, the dysregulation of cellular metabolism of individual chains of type IV collagen in podocytes (glomerular epithelial cells; GEpC) has not been well studied in diabetic nephropathy. Our aim in this study was to investigate the regulation of &#x003b1; chains of type IV collagen of podocytes that is responsible for the synthesis of GBM in diabetic condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Diabetic animals</title><p>Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) at 45 mg/kg body weight, freshly dissolved in 0.1 M sterile sodium citrate, pH 4.5, in 6-week-old (180-220 g) male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were considered diabetic if blood glucose levels were above 200 mg/dL at 48 hr after STZ injection. The rats remained hyperglycemic throughout experiment were sacrificed at 48 hr, 4 weeks and 10 weeks after the induction of diabetes. The right kidney was removed, weighed, cut into portions, and sectioned at 5 &#x000b5;m for the assessment of immunofluorescence (IF).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Rat GEpCs, cloned from primary rat glomerular cultures, were characterized and provided by Kreisberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).

Rat GEpCs were incubated in culture media containing either 5 mM glucose with 66 unit/mL insulin or 30 mM glucose (high glucose, HG) without insulin in order to mimic the metabolic environment of type I diabetes mellitus. Advanced glycosylation endproducts (AGE) was produced by the technique previously described by Ha et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). To imitate the long-term diabetic condition, AGE was added (5 &#x000b5;g/mL) and controls were established using unmodified bovine serum albumin (BSA) (5 &#x000b5;g/mL). To exclude the effect of additionally produced glycated proteins in culture conditions, no longer than 48 hr of incubation was used. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was reduced to 0.5% on the last media change to reduce background before protein and RNA extraction. For identification purposes, coating with AGE or BSA was denoted as 'A' or 'B', and addition of glucose at 5 or 30 mM by '5' or '30', respectively.

After incubation, the media was removed and the cells were washed with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 30 min at 4&#x02103;. After two rinses with cold 10% TCA, the acid-precipitable material was solubilized overnight in 1N NaOH at 37&#x02103; and neutralized with 1N HCl per well.

An early feature of diabetic nephropathy is the alteration of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), which may result in microalbuminuria, subsequent overt proteinuria, and eventual renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). As for the GBM, its conspicuous thickening in diabetes, perhaps due to accumulation of collagen IV and alterations in its architecture and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), would seem to constitute a more effective barrier to the filtration of proteins but is in fact more porous to proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The glomerular visceral epithelial cell, called podocyte is also affected by the early pathologic changes in diabetic glomerulopathy, including overproduction of cytokines such as VEGF and TGF&#x003b2;, widened foot processes width (hypertrophy), podocytopenia, and the dysregulation of GBM components, all of which contribute to the initiation of proteinuria and progression of renal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Because the onset and progression of diabetic glomerulosclerosis are delayed in patients who achieve an adequate level of glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), hyperglycemia is thought to be an important regulator of glomerular lesion development.</p><p>GBM is composed of several macromolecules, including type IV collagen, laminin, proteoglycan, and entactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Type IV collagen, which includes six genetically distinct isoforms named &#x003b1;1(IV) through &#x003b1;6(IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), is the most abundant constituent of the GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These isoforms organize themselves into a unique network, which provides GBM structural stability and unique functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Different isoforms of type IV collagen are specific for each glomerular compartment. The novel &#x003b1;3(IV), &#x003b1;4(IV), and &#x003b1;5(IV) chains are predominantly associated with the GBM, while classical &#x003b1;1(IV) and &#x003b1;2(IV) chains are present in the mesangial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>At all developmental stages of kidney morphogenesis, &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2(IV) chains were seen in basement membranes. Collagen &#x003b1;3-5(IV) chains, on the other hand, were not found in fetal nephron at the primary vesicle, S-shaped body and capillary loop stages but emerged during later development of the nephron. This is in line with earlier studies on rat tissues suggesting that in the rat, &#x003b1;3-5(IV) chains are first expressed and start replacing &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2(IV) chains in glomerulus at the capillary loop stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In the human kidney, however, this switch seems to appear at a distinctly later stage of development, reflecting species-specific differences in kidney development. Human kidney also shows expression of &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2(IV) chains in GBM, which is not seen in developing rat kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>)</p><p>Dysregulation of GBM collagen chains produces proteinuria and hematuria genetically or acquired as seen in Alport's syndrome and Goodpasture syndrome, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, the dysregulation of cellular metabolism of individual chains of type IV collagen has not been well studied in diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>In STZ-induced diabetic rats, the mRNA levels for the &#x003b1;1(IV) collagen chain increased significantly with age even before morphological thickening of basement membrane occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Treating the diabetic rats with insulin for 4 weeks ameliorated the abnormally regulated ECM gene expression in the glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). These data suggest that hyperglycemia may play a role in the abnormal ECM gene expression in vivo. The mRNA levels for the &#x003b1;5(IV) collagen chain also increased significantly in STZ-induced diabetic rats at month 1 but not at month 4, whereas collagen &#x003b1;5(IV) protein was higher at both 1 and 4 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We also found that both novel collagen chains, &#x003b1;3(IV) and &#x003b1;5(IV) chains, increased in the GBM of experimental overt diabetic tissues as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>.

In human diabetic kidney tissue, there was intense staining for &#x003b1;3(IV) NC and &#x003b1;4(IV) NC domain in the GBM but not in the mesangial matrix of type I and type II diabetic patient tissue with overt diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In contrast, staining with antibodies to &#x003b1;1(IV) NC and &#x003b1;2(IV) NC domain reacted with mesangial matrix but appeared to diminish significantly in the GBM in the patients with overt diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>In vitro study, Kang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) reported that collagen &#x003b1;5(IV)/GAPDH mRNA ratio and protein of cultured mouse podocytes were higher in high glucose for 10 days incubation than in low (normal) glucose. These results are similar to our results on the change of &#x003b1;5 chain mRNA levels at early stages although not significant later, as cultured cells might not be identical. On the other hand, Bai et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) demonstrated using cultured mouse podocytes that high glucose decreased the protein levels of &#x003b1;5(IV) chain significantly during 3-4 days incubation, whereas, increased MMP-9 activity and mRNA levels, suggesting that the change of GBM collagen would be caused by an imbalance in ECM synthesis and degradation. We also found that high glucose induced the increased amount of &#x003b1;1(IV), &#x003b1;3(IV), and &#x003b1;5(IV) chains protein at late stage. On the other hand, high glucose induced the mRNA expression of &#x003b1;5(IV) and partly &#x003b1;1(IV) at early stage but not at late stage. The incoordination between &#x003b1;(IV) chains protein and their mRNA expression at each stage suggest that the increased amount of &#x003b1;5(IV) chains protein in high glucoseadded conditions may be induced by transcriptional metabolic imbalance at early stage but much more by post-translational modification including structural changes by glycosylation mostly at late stage. On the other hand, the other &#x003b1;(IV) chains might be regulated much more by post-translational modification including structural changes by glycosylation and/or metabolic imbalance in time-dependent and isoform-specific manners. Similarly, AGE also induced the increased amount of &#x003b1;1(IV), &#x003b1;3(IV), and &#x003b1;5(IV) chains protein at late stage and the mRNA expression of &#x003b1;5(IV) at early stage and &#x003b1;1(IV) at late stage. These changes induced by AGE also suggest that &#x003b1;(IV) chains might be regulated not only by transcriptional level but also by post-translational modification including structural changes by glycosylation and/or metabolic imbalance in time-dependent and subchain-specific manners. Additive effects by AGE were not evident.</p><p>Although the mechanisms of increased each &#x003b1; chains of type IV collagen would not be clearly elucidated because of their different expressions, many researchers suggested the roles of angiotensin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), TGF-&#x003b2;, PKC-p38 MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), decreased matrix degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), etc. as the initiator and modulator of type IV collagen dysregulation in diabetic environments. According to the our present and previous studies, diabetic conditions induced the dysregulation of glomerular &#x003b1;(IV) chains by transcriptional and post-translational modification with a discrepancy in the species-, strains-, time-, cell-, and/or subchain-dependent manners. The mechanisms of the changes of type IV collagen &#x003b1; chains would be further elucidated for the regulation of type IV collagen biosynthesis.</p><p>In conclusion, we suggest that the metabolism of individual &#x003b1;(IV) chains of GBM is differentially regulated in diabetic conditions and the change of each &#x003b1; chains would be induced by transcriptional level and post-translational modification including structural changes by glycosylation and/or metabolic imbalance in time-dependent and isoform-specific manners.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Dr. K-D Han for his preparation for STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy and BS Kasinath for study idea.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by grants from from <funding-source>Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF</funding-source>, <award-id>R01-2007-000-20856-0</award-id>) and <funding-source>Korea Research Foundation</funding-source> Grant funded by the Republic of Korea Government (<funding-source>MOEHRD</funding-source>, Basic Research Promotion Fund) (<award-id>KRF-2007-E00269</award-id>).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sowers</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Epstein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Frohlich</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease: an update</article-title><source>Hypertension</source><year>2001</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>1053</fpage><lpage>1059</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11304502</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Ziyadeh</surname><given-names>FN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hyperglycemia and diabetic kidney disease.
