Exogenous Oct4 improves adult ATSCs cell proliferation and differentiation potencies through epigenetic reprogramming of stemness genes such as Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Rex1. Oct4 directly or indirectly induces ATSCs reprogramming along with the activation of JAK/STAT3 and ERK1/2. Exogenic Oct4 introduced a transdifferentiation priority into the neural lineage than mesodermal lineage. Global gene expression analysis results showed that Oct4 regulated target genes which could be characterized as differentially regulated genes such as pluripotency markers NANOG, SOX2, and KLF4 and markers of undifferentiated stem cells FOXD1, CDC2, and EPHB1. The negatively regulated genes included FAS, TNFR, COL6A1, JAM2, FOXQ1, FOXO1, NESTIN, SMAD3, SLIT3, DKK1, WNT5A, BMP1, and GLIS3 which are implicated in differentiation processes as well as a number of novel genes. Finally we have demonstrated the therapeutic utility of Oct4/ATSCs were introduced into the mouse traumatic brain, engrafted cells was more effectively induces regeneration activity with high therapeutic modality than that of control ATSCs. Engrafted Oct4/ATSCs efficiently migrated and transdifferentiated into action potential carrying, functionally neurons in the hippocampus and promoting the amelioration of lesion cavities.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A critical regulator of stem cell pluripotency, Oct4 (POU domain transcription factor, Pou5f1) is highly expressed in the early stage of mammalian embryo and in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. Downregulation of Oct4 expression during trophoblast differentiation, the generation of mutant embryos, and conversion into exclusively trophoblast-like cells after Oct4 knockout revealed that the transcription factor, Oct4 was required to either establish or maintain pluripotency in the developmental embryo. For embryonic stem (ES) cell culture, even though the mechanisms of Oct4 involving cell fate regulation have been widely investigated, the postnatal role is still unclear.</p><p>Recent studies have shown Oct4 to be associated with the undifferentiated pluripotent state of stem cell populations derived from various adult tissues. To clarify the role of Oct4 in adult cells, we investigated the regulation of Oct4 expression and other embryonic genes in fully differentiated cells, while identifying that it was also expressed at the gene and protein levels in ATSCs. Along with Oct4, Sox2 also have been identified to be crucial for maintenance of the pluripotent state of ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Nichols1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Avilion1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. ES cells lose the capacity to maintain pluripotency upon knockdown of expression of these transcription factors by RNA interference. It has been demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation studies that Oct4 and Sox2 bind to a few thousand regulatory sites in the ES cell genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Boyer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Loh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and likely that many of these target genes play a modulating role in ES cell differentiation. In ES cells, Oct4 and Sox2 were shown to reciprocally regulate Pou5f1 and Sox2 transcription via the Oct4, Sox2 complex in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Ying1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, Oct4 and Sox2 positively regulate Nanog expression, revealing that the transcriptional regulation network was working to maintain the pluripotency of ES cells. Finally, Oct4's early function as a pluripotency maintaining transcription factor really acts as a gatekeeper, preventing differentiation along the trophoblast lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Avilion2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Niwa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent study about somatic cells reprogramming with specific genes showed that Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 played essential roles in stem cell pluripotency. These factors can induce reprogramming in somatic, mouse embryonic, and adult fibroblast cells to a pluripotent state. These four factors also have been seen to induce reprogramming in human dermal fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Park1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, another group showed that Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28 were sufficient to establish pluripotent cells from human somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Yu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, several studies reported that Oct4 was detected in a variety of somatic tissue-derived cells, including bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and subpopulation of the other adult cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Stefano1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Christopher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Several research groups have shown Oct4 to be dispensable for somatic stem cell function and their expression by several biochemical experiments. The majority of these studies concentrated on the identification and characterization of putative &#x02018;pluripotent&#x02019; subpopulations of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).</p><p>Cell plasticity in stem cell biology specifies the ability of stem cells to differentiate into a variety of cell lineages; the term is also currently applied to the ability of a given cell type to reciprocally dedifferentiate, re-differentiate, and/or trans-differentiate in response to specific stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Freberg1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Goodell1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Cell reprogramming signifies the withdrawal of cells from a given differentiated state into a stem cell-like state, a process that precedes re-entry into the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Christopher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we utilized the stemness gene Oct4 to directly induce reprogramming of adipose tissue stromal cells (ATSC) into more primitive stem cells overexpressing stemness genes including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Additionally, demethylation of the regulatory regions of stemness genes finally resulted in improved stem cell behavior of de-differentiated ATSC. Proliferation activity of reprogrammed ATSCs was induced by REX1, Oct4, and JAK/STAT3 directly or indirectly. Oct4/ATSCs showed increased migration activity that mediated by P38/JUNK and ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, the regenerative efficacy of Oct4/ATSC after engraftment into the traumatic injured brain was significantly restored their functions. Finally, our stem cell remodeling system may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ATSC proliferation and transdifferentiation. Also, these multipotent stem cells can potentially be harvested to provide a reservoir of primitive and autologous stem cells for use in a broad spectrum of regenerative cell-based disease therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Exogeneous Oct4 prominently improves ATSCs cell proliferation and differentiation potencies</title><p>To determine the expression of several stemness genes in tissue specific stem cells such as fetus-derived adult stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells, we performed western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry on cultured stem cells.

Representative ES cells growth activating signal mediators, JAK/STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was clearly upregulated at 12 hours (P&#x0003c;0.05) after exogenic Oct4 expression.

Several factor mediated molecular pathways also engage in cross-talk with one another in order to maintain or obtain stem cell pluripotency.

According to several recent studies, the pluripotency factor genes are subjected to epigenetic regulation, cell growth and differentiation behaviors via epigenetic reprogramming.

Recently, it has been reported that Oct4 activates fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), osteopontin adhesion molecule, transcription coactivator Utf1, and transcription factor Rex1. An enhancer element of the FGF4 gene is activated by Oct4 in cooperation with the high mobility group box transcription factor Sox2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Lee1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Nishimoto1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanisms involved in the Oct4 regulation in ES have been widely investigated, but the adult stage (including postnatal and fetus stages) of Oct4 function has not been identified even though it had recently been associated with the undifferentiated pluripotent state of stem cell populations derived from various adult human tissues or organs such as bone marrow-derived multipotent adult progenitor cells. Additionally, CD133-positive pluripotent progenitors isolated from cord blood have also been found to be an Oct4 positive population, with a significant reduction in expression following endothelial cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Baal1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recently, RNAi-mediated gene knockdown was used to extend the analysis of Oct4 function to human ATSCs. It was found that Oct4 knockdown in ATSCs led to a decrease in stem cell identity and increased differentiation into a mesodermal lineage, but that also led to a decrease in neural differentiation ability of ATSC cells at the morphological and molecular levels. Additionally, Oct4 knockdown dramatically led to apoptotic cell death of cultured ATSC cells along with inducing the activation of apoptotic genes such as Caspase 3 and 9 and Bax and c-PARP expressions. When Oct4 expression was recovered by exogenic Oct4 gene overexpression in damaged cells, ATSCs recovered to normal and viable cell with cell survival related signal pathway molecule such as Akt/PI3K, Bcl2, and ERK1/2. This demonstrates that Oct4 is essential for ATSC self renewal and survival, and establishes a conserved role in maintaining pluripotency in mammals. Several previous studies have shown that even tissue specific somatic cells can de-differentiate into progenitor cells capable of acquiring different functions such as pluripotency. In our study, Oct4/ATSCs overexpress not only Oct4, Sox-2, Nanog, and Rex1, but also c-Myc to obtain active self-renewal activity with pluripotency after exogenic Oct4 transfection. On the other hand, Oct4/ATSC exhibited prominent p21 and p53 gene downregulation. Our results showed that Oct4/ATSC can increase developmental potential following reprogramming via the overexpression of the embryonic transcription factors, Rex1, Oct4, and Oct4-dependent Nanog and Sox2. Most notably, Oct4/ATSC reprogrammed somatic nuclei to express the POU family member Rex1 via DNA demethylation. Thus, the components of pluripotent ATSCs have the potential to elicit reprogramming events in a somatic genome. The proliferation of Oct4/ATSCs is promoted significantly by supplementation of exogenic Oct4 with highly improved transdifferentiation activity. The results of these studies indicate that ATSCs possess their own multipotency to reprogram into more primitive stem cells, with the exception of chromosomal abnormalities and point mutations (data not showed). Thus, the exposure of Oct4/ATSCs may provide a good <italic>in vitro</italic> model to demonstrate the mechanisms of re-differentiation from Oct4/ATSC, which would provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of ATSC proliferation. Although the ERK MAPKs generally regulate cell growth and differentiation, and the JNK and p38 family MAPKs preferentially mediate stress, there is now an increasing amount of evidence to suggest that the activation of the ERK/MAPKs can also be stimulated by a variety of stress stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Freberg1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Lennmyr1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007166-Du1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Our recent study indicated that exogenic Oct4 can activate MEK and ERK1/2 following the induction of de-differentiation. Such a change was also detected with Akt activation. This study showed for the first time that transcription factor Oct4 could induce a reversible change of ATSCs to a more immature reprogrammed state, via the PI3K/Akt-mediated pathway and JAK/STAT3-mediated signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007166.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The proliferation-associated signal pathway with a high level of TERT activity and conserved telomere length occurring in Oct4/ATSCs and their gene expression revealed a reversion toward a more immature phenotype. These results provided some insight into the manner in which human ATSC gene expression responds to exogenic Oct4 treatment.</p><p>In our study, the introduction of exogenic Oct4 to autologous ATSCs provides a simple method for the production of primitive stem cells via enhanced growth activity and multipotency, and may also be utilized in the investigation of the mechanisms underlying differentiation and cell reprogramming.

The reproducibility of paired experiments was evaluated on the basis of the coefficient of variation (CV; SD/mean) for fold change (FC). The CV of FC must be &#x02264;1.0. Finally, genes with a FC&#x0003e;2.0 were considered to be significant. These cut-off values represented a conservative estimate of the numbers of genes whose expression levels differed between samples. Gene categorization was based on a literature review. All microarray data in this study was described in accordance with MIAME guidelines. And the resulting data from DNA sequencing has been deposited in GeneBank and include the accession numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>miRNA analysis</title><p>The miRNA assay probes correspond to 470 well annotated human miRNA sequences (miRBase: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/">http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link>, version 9.1, February 2007 Release) and 265 miRNAs identified recently. To maximize assay specificity, candidate probes were examined collectively to minimize sequence similarity between probes, particularlyat their 3&#x02032;-ends. Briefly, 15 ul of the cDNA synthesis reaction was added to 5 ul of the multiplexed MSO pool (MAP, Illumina) and 30 ul of a reagent containing streptavidin paramagnetic particles (OB1, Illumina), heated to 70&#x000b0;C, and allowed to anneal to 40&#x000b0;C. All 735 human miRNAs were assayed simultaneously. After binding and washing, the annealed MSOs were extended through the cDNA primer, forming an amplifiable product. The extended oligos were eluted from the streptavidin beads and added to a PCR reaction, in which one of the universal primers was fluorescently labelled and the other universal primer was biotinylated. The PCR products were captured on streptavidin paramagnetic beads, washed and denatured to yield single stranded fluorescent molecules to hybridize to the arrays. The universal arrays used for fluorescent reporting consist of capture oligos immobilized on beads and randomly assembled into wells etched in sentrix universal bead chip (1536 bead array). The identity of each bead is determined before hybridization to the miRNA assay product, and the same arrays are used to report the results of similar assays employing the address sequence technique (GoldenGate_ Genotyping Assay, DASL Gene Expression Assay, GoldenGate Methylation Assay). Arrays were scanned on the BeadArray Reader, and automatic image registration and intensity extraction software was used to derive intensity data per bead type corresponding to each miRNA. All microarray data in this study was described in accordance with MIAME guidelines. And the resulting data from DNA sequencing has been deposited in GeneBank and include the accession numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All data were expressed as the means&#x000b1;SEM from five or more independent experiments.
