Using truncated DNA fragments carrying these variant promoters and purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme, in vitro mixed transcription assays were performed to determine two parameters governing promoter strength: i.e., the binding affinity to RNA polymerase (parameter I) and the rate of open complex formation (parameter II). The following conclusions were drawn from the data presented: (1) Alteration in the promoter strength of variant promoters is dependent on both the position and base species of substitutions; (2) the consensus sequence (TTGACA) exhibits the highest values for both parameters; (3) base substitutions at nucleotide position -34 cause marked effect on both parameters; (4) cytosine at nucleotide position -32 can not be replaced with other nucleotides without significant reduction of the promoter strength; and (5) base substitution at nucleotide position -31 exerts only a little effect on parameter I. All these findings were confirmed by abortive initiation assays.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0159-a" xlink:role="7369"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0160-a" xlink:role="7370"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7367"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7368"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7369"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7370"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7371"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7372"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
