We have previously shown that rat peritoneal MC (PMC) express mRNA for protease activated receptor 2 (PAR-2), a G-coupled receptor activated by trypsin-like proteases. Recent evidence also suggests that MC-induced inflammation can be mediated through PAR. Therefore, we hypothesized that specific PAR-2 agonist peptides (PAR-2ap) induce protease release from PMC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Western blot analysis of PMC supernatants revealed that a PAR-2ap, tc-LIGRLO (10 &#x003bc;M), stimulated the release of rat MC protease (RMCP)-1, RMCP-5 and carboxypeptidase-A. The release was evident by 20 min but further increased up to 8 h. To study the biological effects of protease release we tested supernatants from tc-LIGRLO, tc-OLRGIL (inactive control peptide) and antigen-activated PMC for proteolytic activity by seeding with TNF (150 pg/ml), incubating for 8 h at 37&#x000b0;C, and measuring TNF remaining in the supernatants. Supernatants from tc-LIGRLO-stimulated PMC degraded 44 % of seeded TNF (n = 5). Moreover, this TNF proteolysis was dependent on the concentration of tc-LIGRLO used to stimulate PMC, and was significantly inhibited (94 %) by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Antigen and tc-OLRGIL induced no significant release of such proteolytic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data indicate that a PAR-2ap induces the release of proteases from mast cells, which may degrade extracellular cytokines and other substrates thus modulating the inflammatory response.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) has been identified on a variety of cell types including eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], neurons and smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It can be activated by a variety of serine proteases including MC tryptase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], pancreatic trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and coagulation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] to induce inflammatory, mitogenic and chemotactic functions. Serine proteases cleave PAR-2 at a specific site in the extracellular NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus unmasking a new NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus (tethered ligand) and changing the conformation of the receptor to allow the tethered ligand to interact with the activation site on the 2<sup>nd </sup>extracellular loop of the receptor. Peptides that are similar in sequence to the tethered ligand domains of PAR-2, such as SLIGRL-NH<sub>2 </sub>(SLI) or tc-LIGRLO-NH<sub>2 </sub>(tc-LIG) are able to interact directly with the activation site and act as potent agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A growing number of studies have identified a role for PAR-2 in inflammation. There is a delayed onset of inflammation in PAR-2 knock out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and PAR-2-activating peptides (PAR-2ap) stimulate leukocyte rolling, adherence, and recruitment in rat mesenteric postcapillary venules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, PAR-2 activation of human airway epithelial cells mediates the release of the eosinophil survival-promoting factor GM-CSF and matrix metalloproteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The ability of serine proteases to activate MC and the observation that MC express PAR-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggest that PAR-2-induced proinflammatory functions <italic>in vivo </italic>could be MC-mediated. The administration of PAR-2ap or trypsin into the rat hind paw enhanced vascular permeability and caused edema formation, which can be abolished by repeated pre-treatment with compound 48/80, known to deplete the MC of its granular content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. By contrast, Vergnolle <italic>et al</italic>., 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] showed that edema induced by injection of PAR-2ap was only slightly reduced in rats pre-treated with compound 48/80, and the pre-treatment of rats with cromolyn, a MC stabilizer, had no effects on PAR-2ap induced inflammation of the paw. These studies showed that the administration of PAR-2ap induces an acute inflammatory response characterized by persistent edema and granulocyte infiltration, but the involvement of MC in these responses requires further investigation.</p><p>Activation of PAR-2 on the surface of mast cells could act as part of an autocrine and paracrine positive feedback loop through the release of serine proteases that could activate further PAR-2 on mast cells or other neighboring cells. Therefore, we investigated the direct effects of PAR-2ap on the release of serine proteases from purified PMC and the effects of these released proteases on extracellular protein degradation. In particular we studied the release of rat mast cell protease-1 (RMCP-1), RMCP-5 and carboxypeptidase A (CPA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The PAR-2ap, tc-LIG, induces release of RMCP-1, RMCP-5 and CPA from PMC</title><p>To identify proteases released by mast cells following PAR-2ap stimulation we activated PMC with tc-LIG (10 &#x003bc;M), and analyzed the supernatants for various mast cell proteases by western blotting, using antisera against the amino-terminal sequences of RMCP-5 and MC-CPA and an antiserum against RMCP-1 protein. In supernatants from tc-LIG-treated PMC one band for RMCP-1 (30 kDa), two bands for RMCP-5 (34 and 35 kDa), and three bands for CPA (40, 41 and 42 kDa) were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The PAR-2ap tc-LIG induced most of the protease release in the first 20 min. However, proteases accumulated in the conditioned media up to 8 hr (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The release of all three proteases was dose-dependent and was detectable in supernatants of PMC stimulated with tc-LIG at concentrations 0.1 &#x003bc;M and higher (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). PMC activation with 48/80 (0.5 mg/ml) induced the release of all three proteases in similar levels to 0.5 &#x003bc;M of tc-LIG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Release of RMCP-1, -5 and CPA from PMC following activation with tc-LIG (PAR-2ap), compound 48/80 and Ag.

One possible hypothesis to explain this effect was that TNF released by tc-LIG activated PMC was degraded by some of the proteases we showed to be released from mast cells at the same time.</p><p>Therefore, we examined the ability of supernatants of PAR-2ap-activated PMC to degrade extracellular proteins. We used a bioassay for released protease activity, employing TNF as the cytokine to be degraded. PMC were incubated with no activators (sham treatment), tc-LIG (10 &#x003bc;M), tc-OLR (10 &#x003bc;M) or compound 48/80 (0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 20 min or 8 hr at 37&#x000b0;C and the supernatants were collected. These supernatants or media were then seeded with 150 pg/ml of rat recombinant TNF and incubated for an additional 8 hr. At the end of the incubation TNF was measured by ELISA and the proteolytic activity was calculated as % degraded TNF (as discussed in the methods section). Proteolytic activity in the supernatants of sham-treated cells was subtracted from that in the supernatants of activated PMC. Supernatants from sham-treated PMC showed significant loss of seeded TNF (17 &#x000b1; 7 % at 20 min and 22 &#x000b1; 5 % at 8 hr) as compared to media. At both 20 min and 8 hr of treatment supernatants from tc-LIG-treated MC (10-0.1 &#x003bc;M) showed a greater loss of seeded TNF compared to supernatants of sham-treated MC (p &#x0003c; 0.05), suggesting tc-LIG-mediated activation induced the release of proteolytic activity. Proteolytic activity, following subtraction of spontaneous proteolytic activity released, was 44 &#x000b1; 5 % at 8 hr and 30 &#x000b1; 4 % at 20 min following PMC activation with 10 &#x003bc;M of tc-LIG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> respectively).

We have also shown that RMCP-1, RMCP-5 and CPA are stored in PMC and are the most prominent proteases produced by PMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present study we demonstrated that tc-LIG, a PAR-2ap, induces the release of RMCP-1, RMCP-5 and CPA from mast cells. Compound 48/80 induced comparable release of proteases form PMC, but Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated activation did not. We also showed that these, and possibly other proteases released at the same time from PMC, are capable of degrading TNF.</p><p>In this study, we provided the first direct evidence for serine protease release from PMC measured by Western blot analysis of the supernatants, in addition to proteolytic activity assays. The sizes of released RMCP-1 (~30 kDa), RMCP-5 (2 close bands, ~34 kDa) and CPA (3 close bands, ~41 kDa) are similar to the sizes of the stored forms of these proteases that we published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The different bands for RMCP-5 and CPA are likely due to differential glycosylation, as has been shown before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. PAR-2 ap have been shown to release proteases from gastric pepsinogen secreting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and from epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A recent report showed release of tryptase from human colon mast cells following PAR-2ap-mediated activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In that case the concentration of PAR-2ap needed was higher than in our experiments and the effect was similar with Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated activation, while in our experiments proteases were released by PAR-2ap but not with <italic>Nippo </italic>Ag.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that activation of MC to release protease activity may be induced by a variety of agents both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The release of RMCP-2 by rat mucosal mast cells has been reported to be induced by antigen challenge in parasitic infections, and during anaphylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The release of RMCP-2 mouse counterpart, MMCP-1, can be increased during parasitic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, rat CPA can be released by 48/80, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ionophore and antigen activation of PMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In our experiments Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated PMC stimulation did not release detectable levels of RMCP-1, RMCP-5 or CPA, or any proteolytic activity with the ability to degrade TNF. It is possible that Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated activation induces low levels of protease release which is undetectable by Western blotting. Furthermore, the lack of demonstrable proteolytic activity in the supernatants does not necessarily indicate that proteases are not released since it may be due to an Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated simultaneous release of protease inhibitors stored in the MC. Indeed, MC produce and release secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (a chymase inhibitor) and latexin (a CPA inhibitor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Finally, Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated activation may selectively release proteases different from the ones released by 48/80 or PAR-2ap.</p><p>Given that RMCP-1 and RMCP-5 are present in the supernatants of tc-LIG-stimulated MC, it is likely that these proteases are involved in the TNF degradation. However, antibodies to RMCP-1 inhibited TNF degradation by supernatants of sham treated cells but did not affect the additional degradation of supernatants from tc-LIG activated MC (unpublished observation). We cannot rule out that PAR-2ap activated PMC release other proteases, including the tryptases RMCP-6 and RMCP-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], which may contribute to TNF-degradation. It is also interesting that chymases and CPA, which are released in parallel, have synergistic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Other proteases from leukocytes are known to be able to degrade TNF. These include cathepsin G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], neutrophil elastase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and by proteases released from bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The same proteases can also degrade other cytokines, such as endothelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], lymphotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and IFN&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Our data further suggest that MC may regulate TNF function by releasing proteases that can directly degrade this cytokine. Given that both TNF and serine proteases are stored and released from MC, our present findings suggest an important mechanism by which MC may regulate TNF function <italic>in vivo</italic>. It may be that such proteolytic activity directed against TNF, and possibly other cytokines, is an important anti-inflammatory function for mast cell serine proteases.</p><p>The expression of PAR-2 by mast cells and the involvement of MC in PAR-2-mediated inflammation has been controversial. <italic>In vitro</italic>, MC tryptase can stimulate histamine release by human tonsillar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and guinea pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] MC, but not from foreskin mast cells. The tryptase inhibitor APC366 inhibits IgE-dependent MC activation, and also inhibits calcium ionophore-induced histamine release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Tryptase-mediated bronchoconstriction in sheep is histamine mediated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], indicating that tryptase induces lung MC activation. PAR-2 has been identified on human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] mast cells. MC have been implicated in rat paw oedema caused by PAR-2ap or trypsin administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but other reports failed to confirm this observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Taken together these reports strongly suggest a role for tryptase and possibly PAR-2 in MC activation.</p><p>In a previous study we have shown that only one of two PAR-2ap (tc-LIG) activates &#x003b2;-hex release from PMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The other peptide, SLI, although it is a potent and selective PAR-2 agonist, was unable to induce release of &#x003b2;-hex as had also been shown before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], although others showed that higher concentrations of SLI can induce the release of &#x003b2;-hex and to a greater extend histamine from rat PMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, our study was the only one to use tc-LIG. In this study again only tc-LIG induced the release of proteases from PMC. SLI induced slightly increased release of proteolytic activity compared to sham treated cells but this release was not significantly different than the release induced by the control peptide LSI. We have previously shown that SLI is sensitive to proteases and its effects on MC increases in the presence of amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast tc-LIG possesses a <italic>trans-cinnamoyl </italic>group, which acts to stabilize the peptide and prevent its degradation by aminopeptidases. It is unlikely that the different sensitivity to proteases can explain fully the difference between the effects of the two PAR-2ap peptides. It is also unlikely that the <italic>trans-cinnamoyl </italic>modification on tc-LIG is solely responsible for tc-LIG-mediated activation of MC, because it is also present on the reverse sequence peptide tc-OLR, but does not have the same effects with tc-LIG on protease release, as shown in this study, or in the release of &#x003b2;-hex, as we showed before.</p><p>Compound 48/80 along with other cationic compounds can activate MC by directly interacting with a pertussis toxin sensitive component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our previous work suggested that tc-LIG may activate MC through a 48/80-like mechanism, but appears to also possess a second mechanism of signalling that is distinct from that of 48/80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that tc-LIG-mediated release of proteolytic activity may be mediated in part through a 48/80-like mechanism. Indeed, 48/80 induced similar levels of proteolytic activity and protease release to tc-LIG.</p><p>Recently, a new receptor activated by the PAR-2 activating peptide tc-LIGRLO-NH<sub>2 </sub>has been identified pharmacologically in murine vascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In that case, tc-LIG induced vasoconstriction, while the other PAR-2 activating peptide, SLI, did not have similar effects. The structure or the exact function of this receptor is not known. In our case also tc-LIG had a significant effect on protease release from mast cells while SLI had a very small effect. These data suggest that mast cells may express the same receptor as the one identified pharmacologically in smooth muscle cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study provides evidence that a PAR-2ap, tc-LIG, activates MC to release proteases and proteolytic activity that could potentially have both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. We further showed that these proteases may degrade extracellular proteins and affect the inflammatory environment in areas of mast cell activation. Although the presence and function of PAR-2 on MC is still controversial, our findings indicate that PAR-2 may be part of an autocrine loop. PAR-2 activation leads to the release of serine proteases which in turn may further activate more PAR-2 receptors on mast cells and also on other cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Compound 48/80, 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-&#x003b2;-D-glucosaminide (&#x003b2;-hexosaminidase (&#x003b2;-hex) substrate) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). PAR-2ap and PAR-2 control peptides (PAR-2cp) were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary. These peptides were determined to be &#x02265; 95 % pure by mass spectrometry and HPLC. Polyclonal RMCP-5 and CPA antibodies were produced and characterized as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, RMCP-5 (15 amino acids) and CPA (12 amino acids) NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal sequences were synthesized at Zymogenetics Inc, Seattle, WA, and used to immunize rabbits to develop specific polyclonal anti-protease antibodies. Professor H. Miller, Edinburgh, Scotland, kindly provided rabbit antibody to RMCP-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal sensitization</title><p>Outbred male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 250&#x02013;500 g) were purchased from Charles River Canada Inc., (St. Constant, Quebec). Rats were maintained in an isolation room with filter-topped cages to minimize unwanted infections. For the experiments where MC were activated through their IgE receptor, rats were sensitized to <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>, by a single subcutaneous injection of 3000 third-stage larvae in 0.5 mL of saline as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred electrophoretically (25 V, 35 min) to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON) using the Semi-Dry Trans Blot System. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween, 5% w/vmilk (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and 5 % v/vgoat serum (Invitrogen) for 1 hr. The membranes were probed with 1/1000 dilution of anti-RMCP-1, 1/600 anti-CPA, 1/5000 anti-RMCP-5 and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated antibody (1:5000).
