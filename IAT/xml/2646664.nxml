Specific ER membrane proteins, flippases, are proposed to facilitate lipid flip-flop, but no ER flippase has been biochemically identified. The glycolipid Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol is the oligosaccharide donor for protein N-glycosylation reactions in the ER lumen. Synthesis of Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol is initiated on the cytoplasmic side of the ER and completed on the lumenal side, requiring flipping of the intermediate Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol (M5-DLO) across the ER. Here we report the reconstitution of M5-DLO flipping in proteoliposomes generated from Triton X-100-extracted <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> microsomal proteins. Flipping was assayed by using the lectin Concanavalin A to capture M5-DLOs that had been translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the vesicles. M5-DLO flipping in the reconstituted system was ATP-independent and trypsin-sensitive and required a membrane protein(s) that sedimented at &#x0223c;4 S. Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol, a higher-order lipid intermediate, was flipped &#x0003e;10-fold more slowly than M5-DLO at 25 &#x000b0;C. Chromatography on Cibacron Blue dye resin enriched M5-DLO flippase activity &#x0223c;5-fold and resolved it from both the ER glycerophospholipid flippase activity and the genetically identified flippase candidate Rft1 [Helenius, J., et al. (2002) <italic>Nature 415</italic>, 447&#x02212;450]. The latter result indicates that Rft1 is not the M5-DLO flippase. Our data (i) demonstrate that the ER has at least two distinct flippase proteins, each specifically capable of translocating a class of phospholipid, and (ii) provide, for the first time, a biochemical means of identifying the M5-DLO flippase.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor>National Institutes of Health, United States</contract-sponsor><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi800723n</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2008-00723n</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><p>Protein N-glycosylation is catalyzed by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST)<xref rid="fn2" ref-type="fn">1</xref> in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>).

The first seven biosynthetic reactions, i.e., conversion of dolichol-P to Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol (M5-DLO), occur on the cytoplasmic face of the ER, whereas the last seven reactions leading to the synthesis of Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol occur on the lumenal face. This implies that M5-DLO must be translocated from the cytoplasmic face to the lumenal face of the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The lumenally oriented, membrane-bound glycosyltransferases responsible for elaborating M5-DLO to Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol use dolichol-P-mannose and dolichol-P-glucose as sugar donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Since these glycolipids are synthesized from dolichol-P and the corresponding nucleotide sugar on the cytoplasmic face of the ER, they too must be translocated across the ER membrane.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Topology model for the dolichol pathway. The assembly of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide (DLO) precursor of protein <italic>N</italic>-glycans is initiated on the cytoplasmic face of the ER when GlcNAc-P is transferred from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol phosphate. Synthesis continues with the addition of another GlcNAc residue (from UDP-GlcNAc) to generate GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol and five mannose residues (from GDP-mannose) to generate the branched structure Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol (M5-DLO). M5-DLO is flipped to the lumenal face of the ER where it is extended by four mannose residues (from dolichol-P-mannose) and three glucose residues (from dolichol-P-glucose) to yield mature DLO (Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol). This lipid is the oligosaccharide donor for the protein N-glycosylation reaction catalyzed by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) in the ER lumen. Flipping of M5-DLO across the ER is depicted as bidirectional, consistent with data presented in this paper.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bi-2008-00723n_0001" id="gr2" position="float"/></fig><p>Translocation of glycerophospholipids, M5-DLO, dolichol-P-mannose, and dolichol-P-glucose across the ER is required for ER membrane biogenesis, protein N-, O-, and C-glycosylation, and GPI anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).

However, phosphatidylcholine and other glycerophospholipids flip-flop rapidly across the ER membrane with an equilibration half-time of tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), and dolichol-based glycolipids must similarly translocate rapidly to satisfy the requirement for glycoprotein biosynthesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). To account for this, it has been proposed that lipid flip-flop in the ER is facilitated by specific membrane proteins or flippases. ER lipid translocation events are typically ATP-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), indicating that ER flippases must be facilitators of transverse diffusion rather than pumps that translocate lipids in only one direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>).<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn">2</xref> This key feature distinguishes their activity from that of ABC transporters and P-type ATPases that have been proposed to translocate lipids at the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup>.

We reasoned that if M5-DLO-containing liposomes are incubated with Con A, DLOs located in the outer leaflet of the vesicles will interact with the lectin whereas those in the inner leaflet will not. Upon being exposed to organic solvent, the DLO&#x02212;lectin complexes formed on the outer leaflet will be precipitated whereas free M5-DLOs from the inner leaflet will be extracted (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, top panel); the same result is predicted for proteoliposomes reconstituted with irrelevant membrane proteins, i.e., those that lack flippase activity. Thus, in intact, flippase-deficient vesicles with M5-DLO molecules symmetrically distributed between the two leaflets of the bilayer, &#x0223c;50% of the M5-DLO should be captured by Con A. However, in flippase-equipped proteoliposomes, M5-DLOs will flip back and forth across the membrane. Incubation of such vesicles with Con A will result in &#x0223c;100% of the M5-DLOs being captured by the lectin (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, bottom panel; we note that since the binding reaction is essentially irreversible it is unlikely that M5-DLO molecules that are captured by Con A will return to the inner leaflet). For a mixed population of vesicles in which some vesicles contain a flippase and others do not, the percent capture will be intermediate between 50 and 100%, the exact value reflecting the proportion of flippase-containing vesicles in the ensemble. Thus, by exploiting the ability of Con A to capture M5-DLOs in the outer leaflet, the assay is able to distinguish between inactive vesicles and those that are equipped with DLO flippase.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Strategy for assaying DLO translocation in reconstituted vesicles. (A) Assay for assessing DLO flipping in reconstituted vesicles. Unilamellar vesicles with [<sup>3</sup>H]DLO symmetrically distributed across the membrane are incubated with Con A. Con A captures DLO species that are initially located in the outer leaflet, as well as those that gain access to the outer leaflet after being translocated from the inner leaflet through the action of a flippase. After Con A binding is allowed to go to completion, the sample is extracted with organic solvent. DLOs that are bound to Con A precipitate with the protein, while free DLOs are extracted. In liposomes or inactive proteoliposomes (vesicles containing membrane proteins but not a flippase), 50% of the [<sup>3</sup>H]DLOs are expected to be captured by Con A, corresponding to the pool of DLO in the outer leaflet. [<sup>3</sup>H]DLOs in the inner leaflet of these vesicles cannot access Con A and are extracted by the solvent (top panel). For proteoliposomes containing a flippase (bottom panel), Con A binds all [<sup>3</sup>H]DLOs since those originally in the inner leaflet are flipped to the outer leaflet and captured by the lectin; thus, &#x0223c;100% of the DLOs are expected to be precipitated with Con A in this situation. In mixtures of vesicles in which some possess a flippase while others do not, the percent of [<sup>3</sup>H]DLO captured by Con A is predicted to be intermediate between 50 and 100%, reflecting the proportion of flippase-containing vesicles in the population.

When protein-free liposomes were incubated with Con A for 30 min on ice [Con A binding to detergent-solubilized [<sup>3</sup>H]M5-DLO is complete in &#x0223c;5 min on ice (data not shown)], &#x0223c;50% of [<sup>3</sup>H]M5-DLO was captured. The percent of [<sup>3</sup>H]M5-DLO captured was not affected by increasing the ratio of Con A to vesicles, indicating that the reaction mixture contained sufficient Con A to capture all available [<sup>3</sup>H]M5-DLO (data not shown). Also, there was no increase in the amount captured when longer incubation times or higher incubation temperatures (25 &#x000b0;C) were used. Capture of M5-DLO was negligible if the blocking solution containing yeast mannan was added prior to the addition of Con A. These results indicate that 50% of the M5-DLO molecules are located in the outer leaflet of the liposomes where they are accessible to Con A; the remaining 50% are located in the inner leaflet and protected from the lectin.</p><p>Upon incubation of proteoliposomes with Con A, the percent of [<sup>3</sup>H]M5-DLO captured was greater than that seen with liposomes. Capture increased monoexponentially as a function of the protein:phospholipid ratio (PPR) of the preparation, reaching a plateau of &#x0223c;80% in vesicle populations with a PPR of &#x0223c;50 mg/mmol (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D); experimentally, we never observed 100% capture in intact vesicles as depicted in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A (bottom panel), possibly because of steric effects that could weaken the ability of Con A to bind all the available M5-DLOs at the vesicle surface. These results are consistent with the interpretation (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, bottom panel) that M5-DLO molecules located in the inner leaflet of flippase-equipped proteoliposomes are flipped to the outer leaflet where they are captured by Con A. The data imply that TE contains M5-DLO flippase activity that can be functionally reconstituted through the procedures we describe. ATP or other sources of metabolic energy were not included in the assay, nor did their inclusion have any effect. Thus, M5-DLO flippase activity, like other ER flippase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), does not require metabolic energy and likely functions to facilitate bidirectional transbilayer diffusion of M5-DLO.</p><p>It was not possible to measure the rate of M5-DLO flipping in proteoliposomes since transport was complete within the time frame required for Con A binding. This was the case for measurements carried out on ice, as well as at 25 &#x000b0;C. However, as shown below, flipping of the higher-order intermediate M7-DLO was found to be substantially slower, allowing the flipping rate in that case to be measured. The observation that M5-DLO flipping is relatively rapid on ice is not surprising since a previous report of the temperature dependence of glycerophospholipid flipping indicated a half-time for flip-flop on the order of 100 s at 6 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). On the basis of the limit imposed by the time required for Con A binding, we estimate the first-order rate constant for M5-DLO flipping on ice to be &#x0003e;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>Trypsinization of TE prior to reconstitution caused a substantial reduction (&#x0003e;75%) in M5-DLO flippase activity (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E), as expected for a protein-mediated process. Similar results were obtained when papain, a more promiscuous protease, was used instead of trypsin (data not shown). Interestingly, reduction in activity was seen only after lengthy trypsinization, well after the stage when silver-stained SDS&#x02212;PAGE analysis revealed that most (&#x0003e;80%) proteins in the TE had been digested. This suggests that the M5-DLO flippase may be a predominantly hydrophobic membrane protein with limited hydrophilicity and consequently few potential trypsin or papain cleavage sites. A similar relative resistance to proteolysis was previously reported for the flippase activities responsible for translocating glycerophospholipids and short chain analogues of dolichol-P-mannose and dolichol-P-glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Trypsinization of TE is expected to generate hydrophobic peptides corresponding to the transmembrane segments of membrane proteins. These peptides are likely to be incorporated into vesicles during the reconstitution process. However, it is clear from our demonstration of the trypsin sensitivity of flippase activity that the peptides themselves do not promote M5-DLO flipping. This result argues against proposals made elsewhere that hydrophobic membrane-spanning peptides alone, or the mere presence of membrane proteins in general, can mediate rapid translocation of phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that TE contains a trypsin-sensitive protein(s) that when reconstituted into proteoliposomes endows the vesicles with the ability to translocate M5-DLO molecules from the inner to the outer leaflet rapidly and in an ATP-independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>M5-DLO Flippase Represents &#x0223c;1% (w/w) of the Proteins in the TE</title><p>The percent of [<sup>3</sup>H]M5-DLO captured by Con A increases monoexponentially as a function of the PPR of the vesicle preparation (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D), reflecting the probability that a particular vesicle in the population is equipped with a M5-DLO flippase. The initial slope of the dose&#x02212;response plot (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D) is &#x0223c;5% per PPR unit. Thus, at a PPR of &#x0223c;20 mg/mmol, every vesicle in the population would be predicted to be equipped with a M5-DLO flippase. This information can be used to estimate the abundance of the flippase in the mix of proteins found in TE. Taking the average external diameter of the vesicles to be 175 nm (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C) and assuming that the thickness of the membrane bilayer is 4 nm, the cross-sectional area of a phospholipid molecule is 0.7 nm<sup>2</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup>, and the average molecular mass of ER membrane proteins is &#x0223c;50 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>), then at a PPR of 20 mg/mmol, each vesicle has &#x0223c;100 proteins, one of which is a M5-DLO flippase.

Although a precise comparison is difficult because of the time resolution imposed by Con A binding, M7-DLO flipping in the reconstituted system is likely to be more than 1 order of magnitude slower than that of M5-DLO. To verify that flipping of M7-DLO was mediated by the same protein that was responsible for the rapid transport of M5-DLO, we generated dose&#x02212;response plots similar to Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D.

These data indicate that the M5-DLO flippase is able to discriminate sharply between lipids that differ by only two mannose residues.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>M7-DLO is flipped more slowly than M5-DLO.

Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B shows clear differences in the protein profile of the fractions, indicating successful separation of TE proteins.

The majority of M5-DLO activity peaked in fraction 7 corresponding to the 4.2 S sedimentation standard, while glycerophospholipid flippase activity sedimented more slowly and was recovered mainly in fractions 4 and 5. These data indicate that M5-DLO flippase does not translocate glycerophospholipids and, conversely, that the glycerophospholipid flippase does not translocate M5-DLO. We note that a number of gradient fractions are replete with proteins but have no flippase activity; for example, the complex mixtures of rapidly sedimenting proteins recovered in fractions 9&#x02212;14 of the velocity gradient (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B,C) do not facilitate flipping of either M5-DLO or NBD-PC, while fractions 4 and 7 support the specific flipping of one lipid type or the other. This indicates that lipid flipping is not a general property of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>) and that specific transporters are required. We conclude that there are at least two distinct flippases in the ER, each responsible for transporting a specific class of lipid.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>Separation of M5-DLO Flippase, Glycerophospholipid Flippase, and the Flippase Candidate Rft1 by Dye Resin Chromatography</title><p>As an initial step toward purifying M5-DLO flippase, we fractionated TE on Cibacron blue dye resin. Preliminary experiments indicated that the majority of the M5-DLO flippase activity bound to the resin and could be eluted with salt. To refine this result, we prepared TE from Rft1*-containing YCF40 cells (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), incubated it with the dye resin, and eluted bound proteins in steps using progressively increasing salt concentrations. All fractions, including the load and nonbound material, were desalted to uniform ionic strength, before being subjected to protein determination, SDS&#x02212;PAGE analysis, and reconstitution into proteoliposomes. Coomassie-stained SDS&#x02212;PAGE gels showed that the nonbound material (0.05 M NaCl) and the different salt-eluted fractions had different protein compositions, indicating successful separation of TE proteins (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Immunoblotting indicated that Rft1* bound to the column and was eluted with &#x0003e;0.75 M NaCl (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, bottom panel). Proteoliposomes were assayed for NBD-PC and M5-DLO flippase activities, both of which bind quantitatively to the dye resin.

The ATP independence of M5-DLO flipping implies that transport occurs bidirectionally, by a facilitated diffusion mechanism. We enriched the activity by velocity gradient sedimentation and dye resin chromatography and resolved it from the ER glycerophospholipid flippase as well as the genetically identified flippase candidate Rft1. The ability to separately enrich the M5-DLO and glycerophospholipid flippase activities by completely distinct criteria (velocity gradient sedimentation and dye resin chromatography) eliminates previous proposals that a particular subset of membrane proteins, or the mere presence of transmembrane helices of proteins, is sufficient to promote lipid translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>).</p><p>The separation of M5-DLO flippase activity from Rft1* by dye resin chromatography (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) clearly indicates that Rft1 is not directly responsible for M5-DLO flipping as previously proposed on the basis of genetic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). This conclusion is reinforced by recent experiments in which Rft1-depleted TE was tested for M5-DLO flippase activity. In these experiments, Rft1 was immunodepleted from TE or TE was prepared from microsomes derived from Rft1-depleted cells; Rft1 depletion by either method had no effect on M5-DLO flippase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). The glycosylation phenotype of yeast and mammalian cells depleted of Rft1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) nevertheless indicates that Rft1 may play some role in N-glycosylation. We suggest that early steps of DLO synthesis are laterally segregated from the M5-DLO flippase in the ER membrane and that the role of Rft1 is to regulate DLO traffic between this &#x0201c;synthesis domain&#x0201d; and the flippase. Alternatively, Rft1 may be a DLO chaperone that controls the lateral distribution of DLOs in the ER and in so doing regulates their access to the flippase. In these roles, Rft1 would have a crucial in vivo function but would be unnecessary in the reconstituted system where lateral compartmentalization is lost and transbilayer translocation of DLOs is directly measured. Similar models have been proposed and discussed in detail for the enigmatic Lec35/MPDU1 protein that is suggested to be required in vivo, but not in vitro, for the translocation of dolichol-P-mannose and dolichol-P-glucose across the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>).</p><p>Translocation of M5-DLO in reconstituted proteoliposomes was rapid, even on ice, whereas translocation of M7-DLO was at least 1 order of magnitude slower. This result is consistent with the original report of Snider and Rogers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), who showed that M7-DLO is essentially inaccessible to Con A in microsomes that are incubated with the lectin for 30 min on ice; had the experiment been conducted for a similar time period at 25 &#x000b0;C, it is likely, on the basis of our results, that M7-DLO capture would have been similar to that seen for M5-DLO. Our data on flipping of M5-DLO and M7-DLO suggest that the flippase either specifically recognizes features of the oligosaccharide headgroup or gates translocation of the DLO class of molecules according to headgroup size. In the former case, rapid translocation would be predicted for M5-DLO alone, with rates falling off for smaller and larger DLOs. In the latter scenario, all DLOs from GlcNAc-PP-dolichol to M5-DLO in the biosynthetic pathway would be rapidly translocated, with slower translocation being observed for higher-order structures. Future work will distinguish between these possibilities. It will also be interesting to learn what core features of the DLO structure, such as the &#x003b1;-saturated isoprene residue and the pyrophosphate linkage, are recognized by the M5-DLO flippase.</p><p>The need for transbilayer movement of lipid intermediates during DLO synthesis in the ER has been recognized for more than 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). With the exception of a single previous report describing the reconstitution of protein-dependent transport of a water-soluble analogue of dolichol-P-mannose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), and the genetic identification of the Rft1 and Lec35/MPDU1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>) which may serve an accessory role in glycolipid flipping as we discuss above, there has been little progress toward identifying the lipid flippases required for DLO synthesis. The work described in this paper provides, for the first time, a biochemical means of identifying the M5-DLO flippase using a robust assay and a radiolabeled natural lipid as a transport reporter. We have recently successfully extended the reconstitution and fractionation studies described here to detergent-extracted ER membrane proteins from rat liver, enabling purification from a more abundant source of starting material.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank Patrick Barr&#x000e9; and the facilities at the New York Structural Biology Center for cryo-EM images of reconstituted vesicles, Christian Kranz, Bobby Ng, and Hudson Freeze for headgroup analysis of [<sup>3</sup>H]DLOs, Olga Boudker, Enrique Rodriguez-Boulan, Fred Maxfield, and Beate Schwer for the use of equipment, Jonne Helenius for plasmid pJH19, Andreas Conzelmann, Patty Kane, and Tom Rapoport for antibodies, and Markus Aebi for providing yeast strains as well as financial support for C.G.F.&#x002bc;s initial visits to the Menon laboratory.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><citation id="cit1" citation-type="journal"><name><surname>Hanover</surname><given-names>J.
