INTRODUCTION</title><p>IL-18 is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates production of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-1, IL-2, adhesion molecules and apoptosis factors, increasing T-lymphocyte proliferation, and enhancing the lytic activity of NK-cells. It participates in the cellular and humoral immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], both innate and adaptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has been shown that IL-18 is involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases including type-I diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], Crohn's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and liver cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Allelic variants of cytokine genes associated with promoter gene region polymorphisms do not influence the protein amino acid sequence but can result in changes in cytokine production. In consequence, they may alter the immune responses mediated by the cytokine in question and could be associated with various immunological diseases. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are found in the IL-18 gene promoter in positions &#x02212;656 G<italic>&#x02192;</italic>T, &#x02212;607 C<italic>&#x02192;</italic>A, and &#x02212;137 G<italic>&#x02192;</italic>C. Two of these, &#x02212;607 C<italic>&#x02192;</italic>A and &#x02212;137 G<italic>&#x02192;</italic>C, are located at the binding sites for CREB transcriptional factors (cAMP response-element binding proteins) and the H4TF-1 nuclear factor, respectively, therefore mutation at these two sites could influence IL-18 expression and change the production of the cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recent studies have investigated the relationship between IL-18 gene polymorphisms and predispositions to various diseases. It has been shown that individuals carrying the &#x02212;607C &#x02212;137C haplotype are prevalent in rheumatoid arthritis cases among the populations of Germany and Scotland. Women carrying the C-allele at &#x02212;137 have a heightened risk of developing ovarian carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The presence of such a genotype in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma of an undifferentiated type worsens the prognosis for the disease and is associated with earlier metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The G-allele at &#x02212;137 is associated with the development of bronchial asthma and dermal allergic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In patients with hepatitis B from the Chinese population, the &#x02212;137GG and &#x02212;607CA allele variants of the IL-18 gene promoter are consistently more frequent; conversely, hepatitis B is encountered consistently more rarely in persons with the C-allele at &#x02212;137 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, the impact of one or other IL-18 allele variant on the level of protein production has not been adequately studied.</p><p>The aim of our study was therefore as follows: to investigate the distribution of IL-18 allele variants at positions &#x02212;607C<italic>&#x02192;</italic>A and &#x02212;137G<italic>&#x02192;</italic>C within a population of healthy donors from Southwestern Siberia, and the influence of these allele variants on the level of IL-18 production by their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Definition of genotypes IL-18</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from PBMC by a set Test-NA (DNA-technology, Russia). Allele-specific amplification was assessed by fluorescent detection of the products of real-time PCR. Four primers were used for amplification, two specific for each polymorphism at positions &#x02212;607 and &#x02212;137. Amplification was controled by paired primers specific to the particular genomic site. Products were detected using the intercalating dye SYBR-green I. PCR was performed using an iQ4 Cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The reaction mixture (15 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l final volume) contained 0.3 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M specific and control primers; PCR buffer (16 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 2.4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 65 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>); 0.2 mM dNTP; 1&#x000d7; SYBR-green I; 1 unit Taq-polymerase; and 5 ng DNA. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation (95&#x000b0;C, 3 minutes) followed by 5 cycles of amplification at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, 57&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds; then 30 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 3 seconds, 59&#x000b0;C for 3 seconds, 72&#x000b0;C for 3 seconds, 78&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds (plate read), and 82&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds (plate read). A melting curve analysis was then performed: 60 cycles starting at 65&#x000b0;C with temperature increments of 0.5&#x000b0;C, the plate being read at each cycle. The data obtained were interpreted on the basis with the increase in fluorescence, and the melting curve was used to assess specificity.

DISCUSSION</title><p>Genetic factors are important in the pathogenesis of all major human diseases and it is known that human populations vary genetically because of polymorphisms, which can affect aspects of the immune response. Diverse polymorphic variants of cytokine genes may induce high or low levels of protein production. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-18 gene promoter at &#x02212;607 C<italic>&#x02192;</italic>A and &#x02212;137 G<italic>&#x02192;</italic>C affect functionally active parts of this promoter, that is, binding sites for CREB transcriptional factors and the H4TF-1 nuclear factor, respectively. Therefore, mutation at these two sites could influence IL-18 expression and alter the level of IL-18 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Considering the distributions of IL-18 gene alleles in healthy donors from different populations, we found various frequency rates. In the Japanese population, the genotypes GG, GC, and CC were found at the &#x02212;137 position of the promoter with frequencies of 75.4%, 23.1%, and 1.2%, respectively; the genotypes AA, AC, and CC at the &#x02212;607 position had the frequencies 43.9%, 39.2%, and 16.9%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Genotype frequencies in the Chinese population were &#x02212;137GG, 67.3%; &#x02212;137GC, 30%; &#x02212;137CC, 2.7%; &#x02212;607AA, 24.7%; &#x02212;607AC, 53.3%; and &#x02212;607CC, 22% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. For European populations from Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the characteristic frequencies of the genotypes &#x02212;137GG, &#x02212;137GC, and &#x02212;137CC were 54.1% and 48.3%, 38.7% and 43.8%, and 7.2% and 7.9%, respectively. IL-18 genotypes at the &#x02212;607 position of the promoter were found in the Italian population at the following rates: AA, 23.6%; AC, 47.2%; CC, 29.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>We found the following IL-18 genotype frequencies in healthy donors from Novosibirsk (Southwestern Siberia): GG, GC, and CC at the &#x02212;137 position of the promoter were found in 45.5%, 42.7%, and 11.8% of cases, respectively; AA, AC, and CC at the &#x02212;607 position were found in 16.1%, 44.7%, and 39.2%, respectively. Thus, the genotype frequencies within the population of Southwestern Siberia are similar to those of European countries (Italy and Switzerland). There are, however, some differences in genotype distribution between the inhabitants of Southwestern Siberia and the populations of China and Japan.</p><p>It is well known that gene promoter polymorphisms can affect the level of protein production. Our study demonstrated a relationship between two IL-18 gene promoter polymorphisms and the level of LPS-stimulated IL-18 production. PBMC from persons carrying the C allele at the &#x02212;137 position of the promoter show low LPS-stimulated production of the cytokine. Also, the level of IL-18 production by PBMC from donors with the &#x02212;607AC genotype is higher than that from donors with the &#x02212;607CC genotype. The A allele is likewise associated with greater LPS-stimulated IL-18 production. There appears little dose effect of the allele A of &#x02212;607 SNP and we could not detect any difference of IL-18 production when heterozygote for &#x02212;137 SNP was considered as a whole. However, after splitting heterozygote for one SNP according to their genotype at other SNP, we were able to demonstrate differential haplogenotypic IL-18 production. The &#x02212;607CN/&#x02212;137GN haplogenotype was associated with a higher spontaneous IL-18 production. Increased LPS-stimulated production of IL-18 was associated with a haplogenotype &#x02212;607CN/&#x02212;137GN in comparison with &#x02212;607CN/&#x02212;137CC. Thus alleles &#x02212;607C and &#x02212;137G are associated with increase of spontaneous production of IL-18, allele &#x02212;137G increases spontaneous and stimulated production. It is possible to assume that only in case of presence of both alleles conducts to increase production of IL-18 protein. The increased frequency of allele &#x02212;607A with high production IL-18 is connected with heterozygotes &#x02212;607CA (16 donors from 19).</p><p>Arimitsu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] showed that a polymorphic variant of the IL-18 gene influenced IL-18 production by monocytes. In particular, they showed that spontaneous and LPS-stimulated production of IL-18 in volunteers with the &#x02212;137GG genotype was higher than in those with the &#x02212;137GC genotype, which is in agreement with our results.</p><p>IL-18 is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that predominantly influences the differentiation of type 1 T-helper cells, thus participating in the establishment of the cellular immune response and inflammatory reactions. IL-18 has been shown to have antitumor activity. A study of the relationship between IL-18 gene promoter polymorphisms and the likelihood of developing oncological diseases showed that women carrying the C allele in the &#x02212;137 position of the promoter are at greater risk of developing ovarian carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. On the basis of our results and data from the literature, one could suppose that the presence of the C allele at the &#x02212;137 position in the IL-18 gene promoter in such patients results in a less efficient antitumor immune response because IL-18 production by immunocompetent cells is diminished.</p><p>The serum level of the proinflammatory factor IL-18 is known to be significantly elevated in patients with atopic asthma during the acute phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Studies of the association between IL-18 polymorphism and atopic asthma have revealed that the G allele at the &#x02212;137 position leads to an elevated risk of disease development; moreover, none of the 74 patients examined had the CC genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which according to our data is associated with reduced IL-18 production. Moreover, the linkage disequilibrium was observed between the &#x02212;137 and 105 polymorphisms of the IL-18 gene and the 105A allele of the IL-18 gene which may be associated with the pathogenesis of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Premature infants with reduced birth weight are at risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis and IL-18 that is also involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Analysis of the association between disease severity and genotype frequencies at the &#x02212;607 position of the IL-18 gene showed that the AA genotype frequency is significantly higher in patients with the third and most severe stage of necrotizing enterocolitis, when the intestinal wall is perforated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of present knowledge, one may assume that allelic variants of the IL-18 gene promoter at the &#x02212;607C<italic>&#x02192;</italic>A and &#x02212;137G<italic>&#x02192;</italic>C positions, which, according to our results, influence the level of protein production, could result in conditions of which the pathogenesis involves a significant role for IL-18.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that the IL-18 genotype frequencies among healthy donors from Novosibirsk city (Southwestern Siberia) are as follows: &#x02212;607CC, 39.2%; &#x02212;607AC, 44.7%; &#x02212;607AA, 16.1%; &#x02212;137GG, 45.5%; &#x02212;137GC, 42.7%; and &#x02212;137CC, 11.8%. This is consistent with the distributions within European populations (Italy and Switzerland). Allelic variants in the IL-18 gene promoter at the &#x02212;607C<italic>&#x02192;</italic>A and &#x02212;137G<italic>&#x02192;</italic>C positions influence the level of production of the mediator by immunocompetent cells. LPS-stimulated production of IL-18 in persons with the CC genotype is lower than that in donors with the GG genotype at the &#x02212;137 position of the promoter. The C allele frequency is significantly higher in the group with low LPS-stimulated IL-18 production. LPS-stimulated production of IL-18 by PBMC from healthy donors is significantly greater in those carrying CA genotype at the &#x02212;607 position. Thus alleles &#x02212;607C and &#x02212;137G are associated with the increase of spontaneous production of IL-18 and allele &#x02212;137G increases spontaneous and stimulated production. It is possible to assume that only in case of presence of both alleles conducts to increase production of IL-18 protein.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Project no. 05-04-48649-a).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nakanishi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Yoshimoto</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsutsui</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Interleukin-18 is a unique cytokine that stimulates both Th1 and Th2 responses depending on its cytokine milieu</article-title><source><italic>Cytokine &#x00026;
