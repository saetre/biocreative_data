Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a strong inhibitor of angiogenesis, is significantly elevated in the blood of diabetic patients, especially those with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

The scale was: no apparent diabetic retinopathy (NDR), mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (M-NPDR), severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (S-NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Patients with other ocular diseases such as uveitis, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, retinal degeneration, and retinal vascular thrombosis were excluded. However, diabetic patients with simple cataracts were included.</p></sec><sec><title>Pigment epithelium-derived factor levels in plasma</title><p>PEDF levels in plasma were measured with an ELISA Kit as per the manufacture's instructions (PEDF Sandwich ELISA Kit; Chemicon&#x000ae; International, Temecula, CA). Briefly, blood samples were collected in tubes containing EDTA, and platelet-poor plasma was prepared by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 20 min) and stored at -80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C before use. Before the assay, samples were thawed on ice and urea was added to a final concentration of 8 M. After incubation on ice for 1 h, samples were diluted in assay diluent, then immediately applied to the assay plates and measured according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory examination</title><p>The level of HbA1c was determined by automated glycohemoglobin analyzer (HLC-723G8; TOSHO Co., Tokyo, Japan), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were determined by blood autoanalyzer (AU540; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results are expressed as the mean&#x000b1;standard error of the mean (SEM), and the data were analyzed statistically by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher protected least-significant difference (PSLD) test when comparing groups.

The multiple sites may be the cause of the high levels of PEDF in the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>We recently reported that plasma PEDF level in diabetic patients was significantly higher than that in controls, and the level was especially high in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. The results of this study confirmed those findings.</p><p>Diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy are both microvascular complications associated with diabetes. The results of several studies that have examined the relationship between diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy are not consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. We clearly demonstrated that levels of BUN and creatinine increased significantly as the stage of diabetic retinopathy advanced. These results support previous studies that showed that these conditions are strongly associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. In addition, plasma PEDF levels were significantly correlated with the levels of both BUN and creatinine.</p><p>Several growth factors, most importantly, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p><p>PEDF inhibits the migration of endothelial cells induced by VEGF and FGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. In addition, PEDF has been suggested to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. PEDF inhibits the expression of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), VEGF, monocyte chemoattractant factor-1 (MCP-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. PEDF also significantly inhibits the activity of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in microvascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. From these observations, PEDF has been suggested to play a protective role against vascular damages by suppressing proliferative inflammatory responses to injuries in endothelial cells.</p><p>Chronic, low-grade inflammation is responsible for diabetic microangiopathy, such as retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] and nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Thus, the increase in the levels of PEDF in the plasma of diabetic patients with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy may be a counteractive system that inhibits the vascular damages in diabetic mellitus. Yamagishi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] also reported that serum PEDF levels may increase as a counteractive system against coronary risk factors in the metabolic syndrome. Together with the previous report, PEDF is most likely associated with metabolism and may be associated with angiopathy.</p><p>In contrast to our results, an earlier study demonstrated that the expression of PEDF was decreased at both the mRNA and protein states in the kidney of diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin. The PEDF levels in the serum in these rats were also significantly decreased at the late stage of diabetes when compared with the age-matched non-diabetic control animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. We still do not know the exact reason for this discrepancy; however one reason may be that they used an animal model of type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin, whereas we examined humans with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Although we found that the levels of plasma PEDF increased with advances in both diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, the level of intraocular PEDF has been shown to decrease with advancing stages of diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Because, PEDF is a potent anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], PEDF may be consumed in the eye with diabetic retinopathy to counteract the angiogenic and inflammatory responses of the endothelial cell, which would then lead to lower levels. A similar mechanism may apply to diabetic nephropathy and may account for the decreased expression of PEDF in the kidney of diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>A more recent study found high levels of PEDF in the serum of patients with end-stage renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] which is compatible with our results. Because of the close relationship between diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy and because both of these conditions result in diabetic microangiopathy, it is more likely that PEDF is associated with the metabolism of diabetic patients and may be associated with the angiopathy.</p><p>Estimates of the prevalence of retinopathy are usually based on direct examination of the anatomic retinal changes, whereas those of nephropathy are defined by functional abnormalities such as microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria. Further longitudinal studies with repetitive samples from the same donor should be performed to determine the changes with time. These findings should answer the question on whether the increased levels of PEDF in the blood of patients with diabetic retinopathy would indicate microvascular damage and may be used to predict the progression of retinopathy and nephropathy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported in part by a Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education in Japan.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tombran-Tink</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Barnstable</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>PEDF: a multifaceted neurotrophic factor.</article-title><source>Nat Rev Neurosci</source><year>2003</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>628</fpage><lpage>36</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12894238</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dawson</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>Volpert</surname><given-names>OV</given-names></name><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Crawford</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Benedict</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Bouck</surname><given-names>NP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pigment epithelium-derived factor: a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis.</article-title><source>Science</source><year>1999</year><volume>285</volume><fpage>245</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10398599</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="book">Klein R, Klein BE.
