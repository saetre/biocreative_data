Two Wnt pathways have been identified, the canonical and non-canonical pathways. More than 90% of colorectal cancers and other digestive cancers are associated with defects in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by mutations in APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], AXIN1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], or CTNNB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These mutations make it impossible to assist GSK-3&#x003b2; in phosphorylation and in rapid degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin through the ubiquitin pathway as a result of accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in the cytoplasm and formation of a complex with TCF in the nucleus, which initiates transcription of the Wnt target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The human cervical cancer oncogene 1 (<italic>HCCR-1</italic>) has been identified as a novel oncogene with strong tumorigenic features in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>is post-translationally localized in the mitochondria, sub-compartmentally in its outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and may functionally regulate the p53 tumor-suppressor gene negatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>is also overexpressed in various types of human malignancies, including colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

The activities from all the constructs tested were high in the K562, but weak in HEK/293 and nearly undetectable in A549 cells, indicating that the activity of the <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>promoter is constitutively enhanced in K562 cells. Northern blot analysis showed that <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>expression is high in K562 and weak in A549 cells, which is consistent with the present work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

HCCR-1 is also overexpressed in colorectal cancer and interacts with DP1 on the mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Overexpressed <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>may contribute to the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of human tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this study, we characterized the <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>promoter and elucidated the mechanism of expression of the strong oncoprotein <italic>HCCR-1</italic>. We found that <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>expression is directly modulated by TCF/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and may play a role in human cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>HCCR-1 </italic>has been isolated as an oncogene candidate and is overexpressed in various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To understand the modulation of <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>expression, several deleted mutants of the proximal promoter region of <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>were constructed. Reporter gene assays in K562 cells demonstrated that the proximal promoter region at nucleotides -166 to +30 have a pivotal role in <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>transcription. Mutagenesis of the Tcf1 site significantly decreased the reporter activity compared with its wild-type. Our data also indicate that the transcription of <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>is activated by treatment with LiCl, the reagent sensitive to GSK-3&#x003b2;. Site-directed mutagenesis on the Tcf1 site makes the <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>promoter activity insensitive to the stimulation of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF signaling by LiCl. In addition, stimulation with LiCl or AR-A014418 also increased endogenous <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>expression in K562 and HEK/293 cells, suggesting that the Tcf1 site on the <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>proximal promoter is a major element for <italic>HCCR-1 </italic>expression. Finally, we also observed that the transcription factor, TCF, and its cofactor (&#x003b2;-catenin) are indeed bound to the Tcf1 site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 (ATCC CRL-1573), K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (ATCC CCL-243), and A549 lung cancer (ATCC CCL-185) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).
