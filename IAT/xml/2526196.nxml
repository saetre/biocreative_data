T reg cells have a critical role in homeostasis by suppressing the activation of autoreactive T cells. Either mutations in the gene encoding Foxp3, a transcription factor required for T reg cell differentiation, or ablation of T reg cells results in devastating autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Chronic inflammation and autoimmunity can also result from defective activation of apoptosis that is normally required for the contraction of effector T cells after an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Dysregulated cytokine signaling can also lead to spontaneous T cell activation and inflammatory disease, independently of antigen stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>A hallmark of T reg cells is the expression of the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3. &#x0201c;Natural&#x0201d; Foxp3-expressing T cells arise in the thymus from a subset of thymocytes selected on class II MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Expression of Foxp3 is also induced in naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in response to antigen stimulation in the presence of TGF-&#x003b2;. These inducible T reg cells have also been shown to have suppressive activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>The decision of precursor cells to differentiate into phenotypically and functionally distinct lineages, such as occurs when immature CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes differentiate into cytotoxic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, helper CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, or regulatory Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, is ultimately governed by the regulation of gene expression in response to intrinsic or extrinsic signals. Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, from chromatin organization to transcription to posttranscriptional controls. It is now clear that not only proteins but also small regulatory RNAs play critical roles at each of these levels of regulation.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (&#x0223c;22 nt) noncoding RNAs, expressed from endogenous genes, that act on target protein&#x02013;encoding mRNAs through the RNA-induced silencing complex, targeting them for translational repression or degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). The biogenesis of miRNAs involves two processing steps that have been largely defined in cell-based and biochemical studies. Primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are first cleaved by the nuclear &#x0201c;microprocessor&#x0201d; complex containing the RNaseIII enzyme Drosha and its double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding partner DGCR8/Pasha, leaving short hairpin pre-miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). These pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm, where they are further processed by another RNaseIII enzyme, Dicer, and its dsRNA binding partner, TRBP, to liberate the mature miRNAs for loading into the RNA-induced silencing complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>Genetic studies have clearly demonstrated a critical requirement for Dicer in vivo. Dicer deficiency in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> causes sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), whereas deficiency in mice results in early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Dicer has also been shown to have critical functions in the differentiation of specific tissues, such as skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The function of Dicer, however, is not limited to miRNA biogenesis. Dicer is also required for the generation of small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) derived from endogenous dsRNA transcripts or exogenous sources of dsRNAs, including viruses and experimental siRNAs. siRNAs derived from endogenous dsRNAs may also play important roles in gene regulation. siRNAs generated from pseudogene-derived dsRNAs may regulate complementary protein&#x02013;coding transcripts, analogous to miRNAs, whereas siRNAs from retrotranspon-derived dsRNAs appear to be important for genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Thus, although the loss of miRNA-dependent regulation is implicated in the phenotypes caused by Dicer deficiency, it is not known whether they are a consequence solely of the loss of miRNAs or if the loss of other Dicer functions also contributes.</p><p>Unlike Dicer, Drosha is thought to be required for the biogenesis of miRNAs but not in the generation of other siRNAs. However, an early report suggested that this RNaseIII enzyme is required for processing of the preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). To investigate specifically the function of miRNA-dependent regulation, we generated mice with a targeted conditional <italic>LoxP</italic> allele of the <italic>Drosha</italic> gene and compared these with mice with a conditional <italic>LoxP</italic> allele of <italic>Dicer</italic>. By specifically inactivating these genes in T lymphocytes, we found that Drosha is indeed required for the biogenesis of miRNAs but not for the expression of rRNA subunits. Both Drosha- and Dicer-dependent pathways were critical for the induction of Foxp3 and function of the T reg lineage. Consequently, the loss of Drosha throughout the T cell compartment resulted in spontaneous T cell activation, inflammatory disease, and premature lethality. The absence of either Drosha or Dicer specifically in Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells was even more devastating, resulting in early onset lymphoproliferative disease, analogous to Foxp3 or T reg deficiency. Thus, we provide the first genetic and in vivo evidence that Drosha and Dicer function in the same pathway, and that this pathway, in the biogenesis of miRNAs, is critical for immune regulation and preventing lethal inflammatory disease.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Specific miRNA deficiency in mice with Drosha deficiency in the T cell compartment</title><p>The mouse <italic>Drosha</italic> gene (also known as <italic>Rnasen</italic> or <italic>Etohi2</italic>) consists of 35 exons spanning 110 kb on chromosome 15 (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081219/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081219/DC1</ext-link>). The full-length Drosha transcript was predicted to be 4.5 kb and to encode a 1,373-residue polypeptide (Fig. S1 B). However, an initial survey of expressed sequence tags that mapped to the <italic>Drosha</italic> locus suggested that multiple splice isoforms might exist. By using sequential primer pairs to amplify cDNA reverse transcribed from various mouse tissues, two alternately spliced isoforms were identified in addition to the full-length transcript. These were products of splicing between exons 2 and 7 and exons 4 and 7 of the primary transcript (Fig. S1, C and D). Although the full-length transcript was always the predominant species, both alternately spliced isoforms were predicted to be in frame. We therefore used a targeting strategy that would disrupt all three potential Drosha transcripts. By gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, a conditional <italic>Drosha</italic> allele (F) was generated by flanking exon 9 with LoxP sites (Fig. S2 A), which if deleted was predicted to cause a frame shift and the appearance of multiple stop codons in exon 11. Mice were generated from these cells, and subsequent recombination of the conditional allele in the germ line yielded the null allele (&#x00394;; Fig. S2 B).</p><p>Heterozygous <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup></italic> mice, which harbor only one functional Drosha allele, were viable. These were bred with transgenic mice expressing cre under regulation of the CD4 promoter/enhancer/silencer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Mice were maintained as <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup></italic> heterozygotes to ensure efficient deletion whenever cre was expressed. CD4-cre efficiently recombined the conditional allele at the DNA and transcript levels at the DP thymocyte stage. Deletion of the conditional allele was similarly observed in mature peripheral T cells, indicating that there was no preferential selection of cells that had failed to undergo recombination at the <italic>Drosha</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S2 C). Expression of the full-length Drosha protein, which was the only isoform detected in wild-type lymphocytes by Western blotting, was markedly reduced in DP thymocytes and was completely absent from mature T cells in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice. This resulted in the loss of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs specifically in T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). However, the expression of some mature miRNAs, such as miR-29a, was only partially down-regulated in the absence of Drosha, suggesting that different miRNA species may have different stabilities. Consistent with a function for the processing of pri-miRNA, an accumulation of pri&#x02013;miR-150 transcript was detected in Drosha-deficient T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Drosha deficiency abrogates miRNA but not rRNA processing.</bold> (A) CD4-cre efficiently deletes exon 9 from the conditional Drosha transcript from the DP thymocyte stage onwards. cDNA from the indicated populations was analyzed for expression of the Drosha exons 5/6 or exon 9/10 junction by quantitative RT-PCR.

Furthermore, although the ratio of CD4 to CD8 mature thymocytes was similar between <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice and littermate controls, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of mature CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the periphery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and H</xref>).

IL-17A expression was particularly prominent, as significant levels of IL-17A are normally only observed at mucosal surfaces, such as the small intestine, and in some autoimmune diseases, such as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).

Induction of Foxp3 was markedly blunted in both Drosha- and Dicer-deficient cells, even in the presence of RA. The magnitude of Foxp3 induction was similar between Drosha- and Dicer-deficient cells.

The finding that older <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice display very high frequencies of proinflammatory cytokine-secreting cells suggests that the differentiation of other Th cell subsets may not be dependent on Drosha. To examine this further, naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were purified from <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> and control mice and were activated in vitro under Th1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) or Th2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>) polarizing conditions.

This hypothesis remains controversial, as a more recent analysis found that TCRs derived from T reg and non&#x02013;T reg cells recognize foreign peptide&#x02013;MHC complex with similar frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Nevertheless, if a subset of Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells does express self-reactive TCRs, Drosha deficiency potentially may not only abrogate suppressive activity but also allow for activation through such TCRs.

However, female <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> heterozygous mice, in which only half of the Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells express cre because of random X chromosome inactivation, do not develop inflammatory disease and remain healthy.

The finding that both T reg cell&#x02013;specific Drosha- and Dicer-deficient mice display a phenotype identical to that of Foxp3-deficient mice demonstrates an absolute requirement for miRNA pathways in the function of T reg cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have shown identical phenotypes when either the <italic>Drosha</italic> or <italic>Dicer</italic> gene was inactivated in TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells and in Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells. These results confirm that these two RNaseIII enzymes function in the same biological pathway in miRNA biogenesis. However, it has previously been shown that Dicer also functions in the biogenesis of other siRNAs, in addition to miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), and Drosha was suggested to have a role in rRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Our results indicate that there is no defect in rRNA production in the absence of Drosha, and they are consistent with loss of miRNAs as the primary cause underlying the phenotypes observed. Although it is quite possible that Dicer-deficient cells will also exhibit other more subtle phenotypes, such as the derepression of retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), it appears that it is miRNAs, rather than other Dicer-dependent small RNAs, that are critical for most cells.</p><p>Ablation of the miRNA biogenesis pathway late in thymocyte differentiation, either by deleting <italic>Drosha</italic> or <italic>Dicer</italic>, did not prevent the development or maintenance of a peripheral mature T cell pool. Similarly, deletion of Dicer in terminally differentiated pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) or in dopaminoceptive postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) did not result in the loss of these cells. Instead, functional defects were manifest in these cells. In the case of the T cell compartment, a functional defect was particularly prominent in the T reg lineage. Either Drosha or Dicer deficiency led to defective Foxp3 induction and suppressive activity in these cells. Loss of miRNA biogenesis in T reg cells had a devastating effect on the survival of mice when the rest of the immune system was miRNA competent. Even though Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were still present in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic> and <italic>Dicer<sup>F/F</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic> mice, the animals succumbed to autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease indistinguishable from that in mice that lack Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells or a functional <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene. Even in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice, in which all T cells lacked the ability to generate mature miRNAs, spontaneous lethal inflammatory disease still ensued, albeit much later in life. This indicates that miRNAs are indispensable for the function of T reg cells. This is unlike what has been described for some cell types, such as postmitotic Purkinje neurons, in which the loss of Dicer activity results in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Why the loss of miRNA-dependent regulation in some cell types results in cell death instead of functional perturbations is unclear. It may be that neurodegeneration is secondary to the loss of function. Alternatively, components of the apoptotic machinery may be subject to miRNA-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>How might miRNAs enable a T reg cell to be immunosuppressive? T reg cells have been postulated to act via a myriad of mechanisms. These include secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines, such as TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10, modulation of co-stimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4&#x02013;induced tryptophan catabolism and direct cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have provided compelling evidence that all of these and other mechanisms contribute to T reg cell&#x02013;mediated immunosuppresion. However, abrogation of any one mechanism does not significantly impair the function of these cells. Even the ablation of IL-10 production by T reg cells results in only mild inflammation at mucosal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). It is likely that T reg cells use multiple mechanisms to maintain immune homeostasis. Ablation of miRNA biogenesis is the first example that completely phenocopies the loss of Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. This suggests that miRNAs may concurrently modulate multiple pathways in T reg cells, and the loss of this modulation may in effect abrogate multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms used by these cells. In addition to conferring some of the immunosuppressive properties of T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), Foxp3 itself has been shown to be responsible for a significant component of the miRNA signature in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Because miRNA pathways are also required for inducing and maintaining Foxp3 expression, this suggests that there is a positive feedback loop between Foxp3 and miRNAs that is critical for the function of T reg cells. Interestingly, like many other markers of T reg cells such as CD25, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, and glucocorticoid-induced TNFR, a T reg cell miRNA signature is also induced in naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells after TCR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p><p>Although spontaneous inflammatory disease appeared to be related to a loss of T reg cell function in both <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic> and <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice, only in the former was there massive lymphoproliferative disease, whereas lymphopenia occurred in the latter. The striking difference between the lifespans of <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic> and <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice suggests that different mechanisms may be involved in the two diseases. It is clear that Drosha-dependent pathways are required for T reg cell function. However, the finding that the conventional T cells in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice did not proliferate inappropriately to cause lymphadenopathy and early onset disease like the Drosha-sufficient conventional T cells in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic> mice suggests that Drosha-deficient T cells are also defective in some way, even though they are able to polarize into inflammatory effector cells both in vitro and in vivo. One possible defect may be the proliferative potential of Drosha-deficient T cells, as suggested by the lymphopenia rather than lymphoproliferation in <italic>Drosha CD4-cre</italic> mice. Indeed, both Drosha-deficient CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells displayed reduced proliferation in vitro in response to anti-CD3 stimulation, but this was overcome when anti-CD28 co-stimulation was provided (Fig. S9 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081219/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081219/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, these cells also proliferated marginally slower than wild-type cells when adoptively cotransferred into the same lymphopenic Rag-deficient hosts (Fig. S9 B).</p><p>miRNAs may be involved in regulating TCR signaling and/or proliferation in conventional T cells. One miRNA, miR-181a, has previously been shown to modulate TCR sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Increasing the levels of miR-181a in T cells was found to lower the threshold of signaling. Thus, loss of miR-181a may render T cells less sensitive to TCR engagement.

This suggests that the generalized lymphoproliferation and lymphadenopathy in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic>, <italic>Dicer<sup>F/F</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic>, or Foxp3-deficient mice is entirely secondary to the activation of T cells.</p><p>Another difference was the appearance of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013; and IL-17A<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013; but not IL-4&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in moribund <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice, whereas IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; and IL-4&#x02013;producing cells were dominant in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic> mice. The differentiation of IL-17A<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> CD4-cre</italic> mice may be related to the inability of Drosha-deficient conventional T cells to rapidly proliferate and up-regulate IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 in the perinatal period, as occurs in <italic>Drosha<sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> Foxp3<sup>Cre/Cre(Y)</sup></italic> mice. The massive expansion of Th1 and Th2 cells in the latter case may inhibit the differentiation of Th17 cells.</p><p>This study has clearly demonstrated a critical requirement for miRNA-dependent regulation in the prevention of spontaneous inflammation/autoimmunity. Might polymorphisms or mutations in miRNA machinery components or specific miRNA genes contribute to inflammatory or autoimmune disease in humans? Although mutations in this pathway have not yet been identified in humans with autoimmune disease, it has been shown that miR-17-92 overexpression in mice leads to spontaneous autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). A link to human disease, however, has been made for Drosha. Expression of Drosha, but not Dicer or DGCR8, is up-regulated in cervical squamous cell carcinomas and esophageal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Furthermore, the oncogenic ALL-1 fusion proteins have been shown to recruit Drosha to specific miRNA loci in leukemic cells lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), which may underlie the overexpression of certain miRNAs in leukemia. There is now a significant body of evidence correlating mutations or misexpression of miRNAs with numerous human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Thus, continued efforts to gain a better understanding of miRNA biogenesis and function will undoubtedly provide significant insight into human disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>A targeting construct containing exon 9 of Drosha flanked by LoxP sites and a LopP-flanked neomycin selection cassette (Neo) was assembled from genomic fragments subcloned from the bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP23-354M9. A LoxP-<italic>exon9</italic>-LoxP-Neo-LoxP configuration was used such that cre-mediated recombination between the 5&#x02032; and middle LoxP sites would yield a conditional allele, whereas recombination between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; LoxP sites would yield a null allele. EcoRI and SacI sites were inserted at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; LoxP sites, respectively, to allow for screening by Southern blotting. The construct was targeted into E14 129Sv-derived embryonic stem cells, from which mice were derived. These were bred with EIIA-cre mice, which transiently express cre in the early embryo, to obtain progeny harboring either the conditional or the null allele, and were then backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 genetic background for four more generations.</p><p><italic>Dicer<sup>F/F</sup></italic> (provided by M.
