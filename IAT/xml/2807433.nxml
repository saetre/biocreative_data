This translational mechanism has been shown to play a critical role in oocyte maturation, early development, and memory formation in the hippocampus.

We report the presence of eight alternative splicing patterns of CPEB3, including a novel one, in the mouse retina. All but one of the patterns appear to be ubiquitous in 13 types of tissue examined. The relative abundance of the patterns in the retina is demonstrated. Experimentally, we show that CPEB3 expression is increased in a time-dependent manner during the course of postnatal development, and CPEB3 is localized mostly in the inner retina, including retinal ganglion cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The level of CPEB3 was up-regulated in the retina during development.

Modification of translation initiation factors lead to global regulation that controls the translation of the transcriptome as a whole. Modification of regulatory factors specifically binding to mRNA motifs in the 3' or 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) can modulate the translation of defined groups of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Accumulated evidence now indicates that mRNA-specific regulatory factors exist as either multi-protein complexes, such as cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], or multi-proteins complexes containing a non-coding RNA (siRNA or miRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We now know that mRNA-specific translational control is essential for many biological processes including development, differentiation, and nervous system plasticity. Reports on the existence of these translational control mechanisms have added another layer of complexity to our understanding of gene regulation but this has been little explored in the retina.</p><p>Cytoplasmic polyadenylation was first brought to light in the 1980s, for its role in boosting translation of quiescent maternal mRNAs during oocyte maturation when little transcription activity is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This emerging area has particular significance for the nervous system because it provides insight into the molecular underpinnings of synaptic plasticity. The existence of a cytoplasmic polyadenylation mediated control system became a subject of interest to neuroscientists about a decade ago when it was first investigated in the hippocampus and the visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this case, CPEB1 was shown to control the polyadenylation and translation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases &#x003b1; (CaMKII&#x003b1;) mRNA upon N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation. Four paralogous CPEBs (CPEB1-4) have been characterized in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One of these paralogs, CPEB3, is dendritically localized in the hippocampus and was shown to be co-immunoprecipitated with glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2) mRNA. The knockdown of CPEB3 mRNA with the aid of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) resulted in enhanced translation of the synaptic protein GluR2 in neurons of the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of neurons to change their synaptic strength and efficacy in adaptation to input. It can be embodied in several forms, including changes in the amount of neurotransmitters released from presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], alteration in the composition, density or activity of receptors/ion channels on postsynaptic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], re-remodeling of synaptic structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and an increase or decrease in the number of synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Synaptic plasticity has long been recognized at higher levels of the central nervous system (CNS), such as the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and higher levels of the visual system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies of the neural retina indicate that it may share some of these characteristics of activity-dependent plasticity. For example, dark-rearing suppressed the maturational pruning of dendrites in the inner plexiform layer which normally occurs after eye-opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Visual deprivation elevated the expression of several synaptic related molecules in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Light responsiveness and oscillatory potentials were inhibited in both young and adult dark-reared animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The composition of &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor (AMPAR) in the retinal ganglion cells switches from predominantly GluR2-containing in the light phase to GluR2-lacking in the dark phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms controlling such events in the retina remain to be determined. A good candidate is CPEB-regulated translational control. Evidence has suggested the presence of CPEB1 in mouse retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], octpus retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and the expression of CPEB1-4 mRNAs in embryonic Xenopus retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The current study demonstrates the existence of multiple CPEB3 transcript variants in the retina. The presence of CPEB3 protein is also shown in this tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics analysis of transcripts and protein isoforms of CPEB3</title><p>A previous study characterized four different alternative splicing variants of CPEB3 transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], in which two short motifs of 69 nucleotides (nt) and 24 nt (coding for 23 amino acids and 8 amino acids, respectively) are removed individually, or concurrently. However, the structure of CPEB3 seems to be more variable than previously reported. When investigating a nucleotide database (UniGene) for CPEB3 variants, we were able to identify eight transcripts labeled here as transcript variants 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). With the aid of sequence alignment tools (UCSC Genome Browser Blat), we mapped each cDNA to mouse genomic DNA, and acquired the information related to alternative splicing. In addition to the two previously reported short sequences (69 nt and 24 nt) whose presence or absence results in 4 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], several other alternative splicing regions were discovered and elaborated here in diagrammatic form (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A similar search for the protein databases (UniProt and NCBI) identified six distinct CPEB3 protein isoforms labeled here as isoforms 1 through 6 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). With the bioinformatics tool Vector NTI, we inferred the matches between cDNA variants and protein isoforms, and designated the same numeric names to the matching transcripts and protein isoforms (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Transcript 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d all give rise to protein isoform 1.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Known transcripts of CPEB3</bold>.

Ten transcripts were shown, with their accession numbers and types of tissue (if reported to the UniGene database) given to the right. The alternative splicings of exon 4, 5, 7 and 11 would generate different proteins products.

Transcript 7 was a novel variant identified in the current study, of which the sequence upstream of exon 10 and downstream of exon 12 was not determined.

Gray boxes represented possible functional motifs. Dash-lined boxed represented deletions. For simplicity, the names of the motifs were only labeled in isoform 1. Poly-Q (poly-glutamine) and SA (poly serine-alanine) were two unique motifs of CPEB3 that were absent in the other three CPEBs. In the current study, each of the seven isoforms was named corresponding to the same numbered cDNA transcripts depicted in figure 1. Protein isoform 1 was the longest (716 aa) and may be derived from cDNA transcripts 1a-1d. One possible polymorphorism was located at the 372<sup>th </sup>amino acid of CPEB3 isoform 1: it was an N (asparagine) in [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: <ext-link ext-link-type="sprot" xlink:href="Q7TN99">Q7TN99</ext-link>-<ext-link ext-link-type="sprot" xlink:href="Q7TN101">Q7TN101</ext-link>] and [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAQ20843">AAQ20843</ext-link>] but a P (proline) in [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_938042">NP_938042</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAE27791">BAE27791</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAC41458">BAC41458</ext-link>]. Although the sequence of [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAC41458">BAC41458</ext-link>] was reported as 722 aa, we presume it was 716 aa, since the first 6 amino acids QQAAQT preceding the 7<sup>th </sup>amino acid M (methionine) was likely to be falsely generated by the prediction software. Isoform 7 was derived from computational translation based on the novel transcript 7 identified in the current study. The upstream sequence of this isoform was yet to be determined; but the in-frame translation of the identified sequence would result in truncated RRM1 ending with four unique amino acids (LNWQ) and removal of RRM2. 197<sup>P </sup>represented the 197<sup>th </sup>serine, a phosphorylation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

The lengths, molecular sizes and accession numbers were indicated to the right.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-109-2"/></fig><p>In addition to the previous reported alternative splicing regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], one of the alternative splicing locations identified in the current study was near exon 11. The prototypical transcripts have exon 12 immediately following exon 11 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, transcripts 1a-1d, 3, 4, and 6). However, transcript 5 has exon 11 extended, which causes a completely different 3' UTR and the omission of exon 12 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As a result, the derived protein isoform 5 terminates with four unique amino acids (GEWK) and is devoid of the second RNA recognition motif (RRM) and the zinc finger domain (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>Another variable region identified here was located within exon 4. A 388 nt partial exon skipping within exon 4 causes the use of an alternative translation start codon (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, transcript 6), resulting in the removal of the first 216 amino acids in the derived protein (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, isoform 6). Interestingly, this deletion removed the 197th serine, which is a phosphorylation site of CPEB3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>While the splicing patterns described above could result in various protein isoforms, we found several other splicing patterns which would not lead to altered protein sequences but would rather lead to variance in their UTR regulatory regions. For example, transcripts 1a, 1b, 1c use different 5'UTRs (exons 1, 2, and 3 respectively). Transcript 1d uses a different 3' UTR (via the use of an alternative polyadenylation signal in exon 13). Such variability is the result of differentially regulated transcriptional initiation and/or termination; it most likely leads to variation in the translational regulation of the specific transcripts. These interesting findings indicate the existence of a previously unrecognized complex regulatory control system for CPEB3 transcription and translation.</p></sec><sec><title>Several variants including a novel variant of CPEB3 are identified experimentally in the retina. One of the variants is selectively expressed among different tissue-types</title><p>We next investigated the expression of CPEB3 mRNA within the P60 mouse retina. Regular RT-PCR studies demonstrated that CPEB3 is present in the retina (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). We further investigated which of the known CPEB3 transcripts identified through our bioinformatics analyses are expressed in the retina. The primer sets for RT-PCR were designed to span exon 5-7, around exon 11, and the partial exon skipping site within exon 4 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>, table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Since one amplicon may correspond to more than one transcript (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>), for our purposes, we named each amplicon as an alternatively spliced "pattern" with a descriptive name rather than a numeric name. For example, the exon 5-7 region has four patterns ("+69+24", "-69+24", "+69-24", and "-69-24"), and the exon 11 region has two patterns ("exon 11 extension", or "exon 11 + exon 12"). The patterns within each splicing region are exclusive of one another. Each pattern correlated to one or multiple transcripts.

Two antibody-labeled bands with molecular weights of ~130 kD and ~75 kD respectively were identified in western blots and were both diminished by pre-adsorption with recombinant CPEB3 protein or by depletion of CPEB3 in Hela cells (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The ~75 kD band could be isoform 3 or isoform 4 based on their predicted sizes. The intensity of the ~75 kD band increased significantly during postnatal development of the retina, which was consistent with the postnatal increases in the level of CPEB3 transcripts (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The ~130 kD band could be a dimer, a pre-protein, or a prion form of CPEB3. Since the ~130 kD band was not weakened in reducing and denaturing conditions (by adding 1,4-dithioerythritol or beta-mercaptoethanol and boiling), it seems less likely to be a dimer. The possibility of it being a pre-protein needs further evidence. The transcripts shown here do not indicate the presence of a protein larger than ~78 kD, neither is there any such protein evident in the UniProt database. However, a previous study indicated the presence of a ~100 kD CPEB3 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. With the aid of a different gel/buffer system and different protein standards, we have since found that the larger band appeared to be around 97 kD. Therefore, it seems likely that the 100 kD band in the prior study and the 130 kD band in our study are of the same identity. We can only speculate that any transcripts for CPEB3 proteins larger than 78 kD are yet to be discovered. The possibility of it being a prion form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] also needs further investigation.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The expression of CPEB3 proteins in the retina</bold>. a) The regulation of CPEB3 protein during the postnatal development of the retina.

This may be attributed to the relative abundance of the transcript (a result of transcriptional regulation), or the variability in the 5' UTRs and 3' UTRs of the transcripts (leading to translational regulation). It is likely that not all transcripts are translated with equal efficiency under the current paradigm. Therefore, some protein isoforms may be expressed at very limited amounts, which are below the level of detection with the method used here. However, such isoforms may be expressed more robustly under other more appropriate, but unknown stimuli.</p></sec><sec><title>CPEB3 transcripts are expressed in the inner retina</title><p>With the aid of <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and light microscopy we identified which types of cells in the retina express CPEB3 mRNA in the P60 mouse.

Multiple CPEB3 transcripts were shown to be present in the retina. The majority of the transcripts described here appeared to have a wide tissue distribution. A novel transcript of CPEB3 ("exon 11 deletion") was discovered and was present in multiple tissues including the retina. In addition, the "+69+24" transcript pattern had various tissue distribution and was expressed in CNS tissues. The results also demonstrated for the first time that all CPEB3 transcripts were up-regulated in the mouse retina during postnatal development and reached maximum in adulthood.</p><sec><title>CPEB3 variants provide for a higher level of regulation complexity than has been hitherto recognized</title><p>The large number of variants in the coding region, together with variances in the 5' and 3' UTRs of CPEB3 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) provides evidence for an unexpected level of regulatory and functional complexity of CPEB3. First of all, the differences in CPEB3 protein sequences (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) add to the complexity of its function which may involve different temporal and spatial patterns. The alternatively used sequences may generate discrete "tags" that serve as hallmarks for localization of the protein, catalysis by discrete kinases/phosphatases/endopeptidases, or interaction with different protein partners. As a result, the activation, inhibition or turnover of CPEB3 proteins may also be affected. For instance, the 8-amino acids motif (present in isoform 1, 3, 5, and 6, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) presumably harbors phosphorylation sites for CaMKII, protein kinase A (PKA) and p70S6 kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The functional significance of the 23-amino acids motif (present in isoform 1 and 2, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and the 4-amino acids motif GEWK (present only in isoform 5, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) is unknown, but is of interest for future studies. The RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of isoforms 5 and 7 of CPEB3 were altered, which would likely to impact their substrate specificities, similar to an effect previously proposed for CPEB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, the regulatory properties of CPEB3 can stem from the differences in the 5' UTR and 3' UTR regions of the CPEB3 mRNAs. For example, transcripts 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d all yield the same protein product, but each has a different 5' UTR or 3' UTR. The variability in the UTRs is the result of differentially regulated transcription (alternative transcriptional initiation and termination); such variability in the UTRs would further lead to discriminations in translational regulation. The UTRs may also harbor signal motifs such as that for mRNA localization or degradation, hence subjecting the mRNA to distinct stimuli or degradation pathways. The mechanisms for the transcriptional and translational control of CPEB3 and the functional significance of the UTR variants shown here provide fertile ground for future investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>CPEB3 may play a role in synaptogenesis before eye opening</title><p>The level of CPEB3 was up-regulated during the postnatal development and reached maximum abundance in adulthood (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The presence of CPEB3 in the early ages may be related to a possible role during synaptogenesis. It is well established that the mammalian retina is premature at birth. The ganglion cell layer and the inner plexiform layer are recognizable at the time of birth, but the remainder of the retina is yet to be fully developed. The synaptogenesis in the IPL starts at day 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Robust glutamatergic synaptic formation occurs in the second postnatal week, and synaptic sublamina becomes visible in the IPL on day 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The rate of synaptogenesis in the IPL drops precipitously at day 15 (around the time of eye-opening) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Synaptic connections in the OPL begin to develop on day 3 and are well established by day 12, when the first light response was recorded as electroretinogram (ERG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The synaptogenesis in both the IPL and the OPL is concurrent with the increasing abundance of CPEB3 seen during the early ages. Also noteworthy is the pronounced labeling of CPEB3 proteins in the IPL and the OPL (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). This prompts the speculation that CPEB3 expression is important for the process of synaptogenesis; or alternatively, its expression is a consequence of synapse formation.</p><p>Future studies on the interactions between CPEB3 protein and mRNAs for synaptically relevant molecules, such as AMPARs, NMDARs, CaMKII, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNAs, can be employed to clarify this issue. For example, AMPAR is involved in fast synaptic transmission. GluR2/3 and 4 are expressed before the emergence of synaptic transmission, indicating a role of AMPAR in the establishment of retinal circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The onset and regulation of GluR2 expression in the retina is in accordance with the process of synaptogenesis: it starts early in postnatal development, and reaches a peak before eye-opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The distribution pattern of GluR2 in the IPL alters from a disoriented pattern just after birth to a laminated pattern prior to eye-opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], manifesting the reorganization of synaptic circuits. The expression pattern of CPEB3 in the retina observed in our study does appear to be consistent with that of GluR2. Thus, both are expressed in the same types of cells, and both are up-regulated in the first two weeks. Given the previous notion that CPEB3 protein binds to GluR2 mRNA in hippocampal neurons and that GluR2 is a potential target of CPEB3-mediated translational regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], it is plausible to conceive that CPEB3 also regulates the translation of GluR2 during synaptogenesis in the retina.</p><p>In addition to GluR2, there are several other synaptically-relevant molecules that are localized in the RGCs and amacrine cells and are developmentally up-regulated, among which are AMPAR subunits GluR1, GluR4, NMDAR subunits NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and CaMKII&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. A U-rich hairpin loop structure in the 3' UTR of mRNAs has been identified as the binding motif for CPEB4; such a motif was also recognized by CPEB3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although other possible recognition motifs for CPEB3 protein remain to be identified, the presence of the U-rich hairpin structure in the 3' UTR of mRNAs could serve as an indicator that these mRNAs may be targets of CPEB3 regulated translational control. Potential CPEB3 targets containing the U-rich motif can be explored with bioinformatics tools, and further verified with <italic>in vitro </italic>binding assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or <italic>in vivo </italic>manipulation of CPEB3 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>CPEB3 may play a role during synaptic maturation</title><p>Anatomical studies indicated that the retina matures at postnatal day 41 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Although most morphological and neurochemical properties of the mouse retina (i.e. the number of conventional and ribbon synapses, the expression of neurotransmitters receptors) have reached the adult level at the time of eye opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], the maturation of synaptic function continues for several weeks following eye-opening. The establishment of ON and OFF pathways occurs to a large extent after eye opening. The dendrites of RGCs ramifies widely in IPL during early postnatal days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], but remodels into a predominantly monostratified form within sublamina a or sublamina b of the IPL in two to three weeks after eye opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The synaptic strength of the RGCs, measured as the frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity, is low around the time of eye opening, but surges around P25 both in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) mediated by glutamate receptors and in spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) mediated by GABA/glycine receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. These maturational processes following eye-opening resonate with the continuing increase of CPEB3 after eye opening. Whether such resonance is coincidental or interrelated is an intriguing topic for future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>CPEB3 and synaptic plasticity in the adulthood</title><p>Both our real-time PCR data and western blot data indicated that CPEB3 continued to increase during development and reached its highest level in adulthood. These observations provide a strong indication that CPEB3 is functional in adult retinas. Neuronal plasticity has been historically characterized as a feature of the developing CNS, but several lines of evidence indicate that some forms of synaptic plasticity are not just the privilege of developing animals.</p><p>One form of activity-driven synaptic plasticity in the adult retina is described in the course of normal diurnal light/dark cycles. GluR2-containing AMPARs undergo rapid cycling in the RGCs and amacrine cells via endocytosis and exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Synaptic quiescence in the dark drives rapid cycling resulting in the presence of AMPARs-lacking GluR2 in the synaptic membrane. On the contrary, synaptic activity in the light period inhibits cycling and stabilizes AMPAR as predominantly GluR2-containing receptors on the cell surface. Such cycling of AMPARs is also present in hippocampal neurons and plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Although the underlying mechanisms for AMPAR cycling are yet to be fully deciphered, one may speculate that CPEB3 plays a role in this process.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that CPEB3 is expressed in the retina. The levels of all transcripts were up-regulated during postnatal development. We assume that all of these transcripts have corresponding protein products, but under the developmental paradigm used here, not all protein products were detected. It is possible that there are other paradigms which would lead to the translation of the other transcripts. This needs to be further explored. The variability in the protein-coding regions and the UTRs indicates a remarkable degree of complexity in both the regulation and function of CPEB3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>For CPEB3 transcript variants, the UniGene database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and the UCSC Genome Browser database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] was used.

Slides were treated with 0.1 M Rnase-free triethanolamine (TEA)-HCl pH 8.0 for 5 min, washed, and pre-hybridized at room temperature for an hour in hybridization buffer, which was then replaced with hybridization solution containing 100-200 ng/ml of RNA probes for overnight incubation at 65&#x000b0;C. On the second day, slides were washed in 0.2 &#x000d7; SSC several times then transferred to buffer B1 (0.1 M Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, pH7.5) for 5 minutes. Slides were then incubated in buffer B2 (buffer B1 with 10% heat-inactivated sheep serum) for 1 hour at room temp, after which buffer B2 was replaced with buffer B2 containing anti-DIG antibody (1:5000) for overnight incubation. On the third day, slides were washed, equilibrated in buffer B3 (0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, pH9.5), and colorization reaction was carried out in buffer B4 (buffer B3 with 20 &#x003bc;l/ml NBT/BCIP stock solution and 0.1% tween-20). Slides were then mounted in Mowiol mounting medium and the results were analyzed with the aid of a microscope.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Primers used to amplify probes for <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Probe</th><th align="left">Forward primer</th><th align="left">Reverse primer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">CPEB3-antisense</td><td align="left">5'ACAGAGCCAGCTGCGCAAACCA3'</td><td align="left">5'<bold>GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG</bold> GAAGGTGCCTCCGAAGACCG3'</td></tr><tr><td align="center">CPEB3-sense</td><td align="left">5'<bold>GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG </bold>ACAGAGCCAGCTGCGCAAACCA3'</td><td align="left">5'GAAGGTGCCTCCGAAGACCG3'</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The sequence in bold is T7 promoter.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Protein extraction</title><p>Frozen retina was homogenized with the aid of a sonicator (Biologics, Inc., Manassas, VA) in CelLytic MT cell lysis buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).
