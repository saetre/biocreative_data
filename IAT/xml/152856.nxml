The resulting genetic damage may cause cell death or genetic instability that can lead to cancer. To ensure the proper response to genetic damage, cells have employed a set of surveillance mechanisms termed checkpoint controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c2">2</xref>).</p><p>Checkpoint pathways are an evolutionarily conserved feature of eukaryotic cells. This conservation is exemplified by the family of genes encoding high molecular weight protein kinases: <italic>ATM</italic> (mammals), <italic>ATR</italic> (mammals), <italic>MEC1</italic> (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), <italic>TEL1</italic> (<italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>), <italic>rad3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c3">3</xref>). Each of these gene products falls into two family groups based on homology; ATM is homologous to Tel1, while ATR is more related to Mec1 and Rad3. This homology is not restricted to the kinase domain at the C-terminus, but rather extends over the length of the protein. The C-terminal kinase domain is structurally related to the catalytic domain of the PI-3 kinases. Despite this similarity, none of these proteins has been shown to phosphorylate lipids. Instead, all these proteins are capable of phosphorylating protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c8">8</xref>).</p><p>In the budding yeast <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>MEC1</italic> plays a critical role in checkpoint control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c9">9</xref>), whereas <italic>TEL1</italic> shares an overlapping role with <italic>MEC1</italic> in maintaining survival after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c11">11</xref>). Mec1 physically interacts with Lcd1 (also called Ddc2 and Pie1), a protein that exhibits limited homology to the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rad26 and mammalian ATRIP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c15">15</xref>). DNA damage responses have been well characterized in budding yeast, and consists of the G1-, S- and G2&#x0002f;M-phase damage checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c9">9</xref>). Mec1 and Lcd1 function as a complex that is essential for all three DNA damage checkpoints as well as the DNA replication block checkpoint. Similar to Mec1, Rad53 plays an essential role in both the DNA damage and replication block checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c9">9</xref>). <italic>RAD53</italic> encodes a protein kinase and functions not only downstream of <italic>MEC1</italic> but also downstream of <italic>TEL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c16">16</xref>). Following DNA damage and replication block, the Rad53 protein is hyperphosphorylated and activated by a mechanism dependent on Mec1. Consistent with their upstream role, both Mec1 and Lcd1 are recruited to sites of DNA damage, suggesting that the Mec1&#x02013;Lcd1 complex interacts with aberrant DNA structures or the DNA repair apparatus after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c19">19</xref>). Thus, the Mec1&#x02013;Lcd1 complex appears to recognize DNA damage and stalled DNA replication, and transduces a checkpoint signal to Rad53.</p><p>Additional DNA damage checkpoint genes in budding yeast are <italic>DDC1</italic>, <italic>MEC3</italic>, <italic>RAD9</italic>, <italic>RAD17</italic> and <italic>RAD24</italic>. Rad9 is hyperphosphorylated following DNA damage in a <italic>MEC1</italic>- and <italic>TEL1</italic>-dependent manner, and the phosphorylated Rad9 protein binds to Rad53 and modulates its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c21">21</xref>). Genetic evidence has suggested that <italic>RAD17</italic>, <italic>RAD24</italic>, <italic>MEC3</italic> and <italic>DDC1</italic> operate in a common checkpoint pathway. Indeed, Ddc1, Mec3 and Rad17 interact physically with each other and function in a complex to control the DNA damage checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c22">22</xref>). It has been proposed that Ddc1, Mec3 and Rad17 are structurally related to PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c23">23</xref>). <italic>RAD24</italic> encodes a protein structurally related to the subunits of replication factor C which consists of the one large subunit Rfc1 and the four small subunits Rfc2, Rfc3, Rfc4 and Rfc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c25">25</xref>). Rad24 regulates the recruitment of the Ddc1&#x02013;Mec3&#x02013;Rad17 complex to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c18">18</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, the <italic>ATM</italic> gene has an established role in controlling the cellular responses to double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c3">3</xref>). <italic>ATM</italic> is mutated in patients with the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), and mice carrying mutations in <italic>ATM</italic> exhibit phenotypes similar to those of AT patients. AT cells exhibit chromosomal instability and defects in the cellular response to ionizing radiation at the G1, S and G2 phases. Ionizing radiation causes various types of DNA damage, among which DSBs are the most lethal. In addition, AT cells are sensitive to the anticancer drug bleomycin, which causes DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c27">27</xref>). To activate the checkpoint response, ATM collaborates with the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Nbs11 complex which has been implicated in cellular responses to DSBs. Cells defective in the Nbs1 and Mre11 function shows phenotypes similar to AT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c28">28</xref>). Moreover, ATM phosphorylates Nbs1 to activate the S-phase checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c32">32</xref>). Thus, ATM and the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Nbs1 complex appear to constitute a DNA damage response pathway. In budding yeast, the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2 complex, which is related to the mammalian Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Nbs1 complex, plays an essential role in DSB processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c33">33</xref>). Several lines of evidence have suggested that Tel1 and the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2 complex also constitute a DNA damage response pathway. Cells carrying <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad50</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>xrs2</italic>&#x00394; mutations are sensitive to DNA damage, and are defective in checkpoint responses specifically to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c34">34</xref>). Although the <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutation alone does not confer sensitivity to DNA damage, it does enhance sensitivity of <italic>mec1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c11">11</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>xrs2</italic>&#x00394; mutations exacerbate the sensitivity of <italic>mec1</italic> mutants to similar extents as a <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c36">36</xref>). Furthermore, Mre11 and Xrs2 are phosphorylated after DNA damage in a <italic>TEL1</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c36">36</xref>). However, whether <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutations confer a defect in checkpoint responses remains to be fully addressed.</p><p>The observation that ATM is specifically required for cellular responses to DSBs raises a possibility that Tel1 might have a similar role in the checkpoint responses following treatment with DSB-inducing agents. Phleomycin, like bleomycin, creates DSBs in DNA, but causes more significant DNA lesions than bleomycin in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c38">38</xref>). In this study, we investigated whether <italic>TEL1</italic> is involved in the checkpoint responses to phleomycin-induced DNA damage. We show that <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants are defective in delaying cell-cycle progression after phleomycin treatment in S phase. Correspondingly, <italic>TEL1</italic> is required for the phleomycin-induced Rad53 phosphorylation in S phase. In contrast, <italic>MEC1</italic> is required for the checkpoint responses to phleomycin treatment in G1, S and G2&#x0002f;M phases. Consistent with the previous finding that <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants are not defective in the S-phase regulation following methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment, Rad53 is normally phosphorylated in <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants after MMS treatment during S phase. Phleomycin treatment induces Xrs2 phosphorylation in a <italic>TEL1</italic>-dependent manner during S phase, whereas MMS treatment does not cause significant Xrs2 phosphorylation. These studies provide evidence that both Mec1 and Tel1 control the checkpoint responses to phleomycin-induced DNA damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and general methods</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are isogenic and listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg252tb1">1</xref>.

These results suggest that <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutants retain a residual activity to phosphorylate Rad53 in response to phleomycin treatment, and that <italic>TEL1</italic> might be involved in activation of the checkpoint pathways after phleomycin treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Requirement of <italic>MEC1</italic> and <italic>TEL1</italic> for checkpoint response after phleomycin treatment in S phase</title><p>In budding yeast, DNA damage activates the checkpoint pathways in G1, S and G2&#x0002f;M phases. We first investigated the roles of Mec1 and Tel1 in the S-phase checkpoint response to phleomycin treatment. The S-phase checkpoint was analyzed by monitoring the DNA content of phleomycin-treated cells after release from the G1 block (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f2">2</xref>A). When released from &#x003b1;-factor arrest and treated with 25 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml phleomycin, the S-phase progression was delayed in wild-type cells as evidenced by lower rates of DNA synthesis. Compared with wild-type cells, <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutants were slow in the S-phase progression in the absence of phleomycin, suggesting that the <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; defect is not completely suppressed by the <italic>sml1</italic>&#x00394; mutation. Phleomycin treatment further delayed the S-phase progression of <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutants (see the cytometry profiles at 40 min after release). However, <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; cells progressed through S phase faster than wild-type cells in the presence of phleomycin. Similarly, <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants delayed the S-phase progression, but progressed through S phase faster than wild-type cells in the presence of phleomycin. These results show that both <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants are partially defective in the S-phase checkpoint after phleomycin treatment.</p><p>We next compared induction of Rad53 phosphorylation by phleomycin treatment in wild-type, <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; cells. Cells expressing Rad53-HA were synchronized by &#x003b1;-factor and released into medium containing 25 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml phleomycin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f2">2</xref>B). We found that Rad53 became phosphorylated within 30 min in wild-type cells. However, in <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutants, no Rad53 phosphorylation was detected at 30 min after release. Although Rad53 phosphorylation became apparent in <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutants at the later time points, its phosphorylation was clearly decreased as evidenced by the appearance of more weakly smeared bands in <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; cells than wild-type cells. In <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; cells, Rad53 phosphorylation was not detected at 30 min after release, but became apparent at 50 min after release at levels much greater than in <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; cells. The phosphorylation observed in <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; cells may result from the progression of cells into G2&#x0002f;M phase, because <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; cells are proficient in Rad53 phosphorylation in response to phleomycin treatment in G2&#x0002f;M phase whereas <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; cells are not (see below).

For this purpose, we used a weak <italic>mec1</italic> (<italic>mec1-81</italic>) allele in combination with the <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutation, because the <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutation confers a senescent phenotype resulting in a growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c44">44</xref>). In contrast to <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants, <italic>mec1-81 tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants grow as well as wild-type cells (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f7">7</xref>). We found that <italic>mec1-81</italic> single and <italic>mec1-81 tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants were defective in the S-phase checkpoint; these mutants progressed faster than wild-type cells in the presence of phleomycin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f2">2</xref>A). However, it was difficult to determine the additive defect in the cell-cycle delay. Similar to <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutants, these <italic>mec1-81</italic> mutants were slow in the S-phase progression in the absence of phleomycin, whereas <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants were not. We then examined Rad53 phosphorylation in <italic>mec1-81</italic> and <italic>mec1-81 tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants.

We first examined the delay in cell-cycle progression at the G1- to S-phase transition after DNA damage by monitoring cellular DNA content (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f3">3</xref>A). Phleomycin treatment induced a G1-phase arrest in wild-type cells and the arrest continued for 120 min. Although <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; cells exhibited delayed progression into S phase, these cells apparently progressed from G1 phase much faster than wild-type cells. We found that <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants were a little defective in delaying progression into S phase. We also examined the cell-cycle progression in <italic>mec1-81</italic> and <italic>mec1-81 tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants, and found that these mutants were defective in the G1 checkpoint. However, it was not determined whether the introduction of the <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutation enhances the defect of the <italic>mec1-81</italic> mutation. As discussed above, <italic>mec1-81</italic> and <italic>mec1-81 tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants were slow in cell-cycle progression through S phase in the absence of phleomycin, whereas <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants were not.</p><p>We then monitored phleomycin-induced Rad53 phosphorylation in G1-arrested cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f3">3</xref>B). Rad53 phosphorylation became visible in the G1-arrested <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; cells, but its phosphorylation was significantly decreased compared with the wild-type cells. Although Rad53 phosphorylation was detectable in <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants as in wild-type cells at 120 min after phleomycin treatment, it was clearly decreased in <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants at 60 min after treatment. We also examined the Rad53 phosphorylation in <italic>mec1-81</italic> and <italic>mec1-81 tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants. Similar to <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; cells, the phleomycin-induced Rad53 phosphorylation was detectable, but was significantly decreased in <italic>mec1-81</italic> mutants arrested in G1. No phosphorylation was observed in the G1-arrested <italic>mec1-81 tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants. Thus, as observed for the S-phase checkpoint, Mec1 and Tel1 affect Rad53 modification and cell-cycle delay in a parallel manner in G1 phase, but the role of Tel1 in delaying cell-cycle progression seems not to be pronounced in G1 phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of the <italic>mec1</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic> mutations on the G2&#x0002f;M checkpoint following phleomycin treatment</title><p>We further investigated the G2&#x0002f;M-phase DNA damage checkpoint in <italic>mec1</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic> mutant cells after phleomycin treatment.

Thus, MMS produces primary DNA lesions that are different from those produced by phleomycin, although MMS could create DSBs secondarily at high concentrations. To further assess the function of Mec1 and Tel1 in the MMS-induced S-phase checkpoint response, we monitored Rad53 phosphorylation in <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f5">5</xref>). Cells were arrested with &#x003b1;-factor, and then released from &#x003b1;-factor into medium containing 0.1&#x00025; MMS.

Under these conditions, all the cells remained in S phase for 60 min after release from the G1 arrest (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f5">5</xref>).

One explanation could be that Mec1 and Tel1 have different substrate preference. It has been shown that both Mec1 and Tel1 phosphorylate PHAS-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c7">7</xref>), and that Mec1 phosphorylates the C-terminal half of Rad53 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c8">8</xref>). We first asked whether Tel1 phosphorylates the C-terminal half of Rad53 <italic>in vitro</italic> as Mec1 does. For this purpose, we generated an HA-tagged <italic>TEL1</italic> construct (<italic>TEL1-HA</italic>). Tel1 contains the motif DXXXXN at positions 2612&#x02013;2616, which plays a critical role in protein kinase catalysis. We mutated this conserved motif to AXXXXS and constructed a kinase-negative version of <italic>TEL1-HA</italic> (<italic>tel1-KN-HA</italic>). Rad53 has 16 SQ&#x0002f;TQ motifs; eight of them are located in the N-terminus including the kinase domain, and eight are in the C-terminus. To examine Rad53 phosphorylation, GST fusion proteins with the C-terminal half of Rad53 (GST-Rad53C) were expressed and purified from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c8">8</xref>). PHAS-1 also contains SQ&#x0002f;TQ motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c7">7</xref>). Extracts were prepared from cells expressing Tel1-HA, Tel1-KN-HA or no HA-tagged protein, and were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. Immuno precipitates were then subjected to an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay. GST-Rad53C and PHAS-1 were phosphorylated by the immunoprecipitates containing Tel1-HA but not by the immunoprecipitates containing Tel1-KN-HA or no HA-tagged protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f8">8</xref>A). No specific phosphorylation of GST alone was observed with Tel1-HA (data not shown). Consistent with the previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c8">8</xref>), Mec1 phosphorylated GST-Rad53C and PHAS-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f8">8</xref>A). Our analysis, however, does not exclude the possibility that Mec1 and Tel1 phosphorylate others than SQ&#x0002f;TQ motifs in GST-Rad53C and PHAS-1.</p><p>We then performed the Mec1 and Tel1 kinase assay in the presence of the same amounts of PHAS-1 and GST-Rad53C substrates. In these reactions, Mec1 phosphorylated GST-Rad53C more efficiently than Tel1 did, whereas Tel1 phosphorylated PHAS-1 more efficiently than Mec1 did (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f8">8</xref>B). Both Tel1 and Mec1 were fused to the same HA tag at their N-termini (see Materials and Methods) and the amounts of each protein in the immunoprecipitates were estimated to be similar by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg252f8">8</xref>B). Together, these results suggest that Mec1 and Tel1 have different substrate preferences <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In mammalian cells, both ATM and ATR have been implicated in the response to DSB-inducing ionizing radiation. Both ATR-related and ATM-related proteins are also found in budding yeast, encoded by <italic>MEC1</italic> and <italic>TEL1</italic>, respectively. Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that Mec1 plays a central role in the DNA damage checkpoint, but the function of Tel1 in checkpoints has not been well characterized. Since ATM is specifically required for checkpoint responses to DSBs, we hypothesized that Tel1 might have a similar role. In this report, we investigated the roles of Mec1 and Tel1 in the checkpoint responses to phleomycin, an agent that causes DSBs in DNA. Phleomycin, like other DNA-damaging agents, induces Rad53 phosphorylation in cells. <italic>MEC1</italic> is required for Rad53 phosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest following phleomycin treatment in all the G1, S and G2&#x0002f;M phases. In contrast, <italic>TEL1</italic> is required for Rad53 phosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest in S phase. <italic>TEL1</italic> is as well partially required for Rad53 phosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase, but not in G2&#x0002f;M phase. Consistent with the role of Tel1 in the S-phase regulation, Xrs2 is phosphorylated after phleomycin treatment in a <italic>TEL1</italic>-dependent manner in S phase. Moreover, <italic>mec1-81 tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants are more defective than either single mutants in Rad53 phosphorylation in S phase. Finally, both Mec1 and Tel1 phosphorylate the Rad53 and PHAS-1 proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that both Mec1 and Tel1 control checkpoint responses to phleomycin-induced DNA damage.</p><p>Similar to phleomycin treatment, MMS treatment activates checkpoints and induces Rad53 phosphorylation in S phase. However, <italic>mec1</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic> mutants behave differently in response to MMS treatment; <italic>mec1</italic> mutants are defective in the S-phase checkpoint after MMS treatment whereas <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c46">46</xref>). Correspondingly, MMS treatment induces Rad53 phosphorylation in <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants as observed in wild-type cells, but the phosphorylation is not detected in <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. Together, these results support a model in which Mec1 and Tel1 regulate pathways in parallel and are activated by different types of DNA damage.</p><p>Cells carrying the <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutation are defective in delaying cell-cycle progression in S phase when DNA is damaged by phleomycin. In contrast, <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants are only weakly defective in the G1-phase responses and proficient in the G2&#x0002f;M-phase responses following phleomycin treatment. Thus, the checkpoint defect in <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants upon the occurrence of DSBs appears to be mainly caused by the inability to cope with DSBs in S phase. One possible explanation was that the checkpoint defect observed in <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants could be attributed, at least in part, to the cell-cycle-dependent expression of Mec1 and&#x0002f;or Tel1. However, the expression levels of both Mec1 and Tel1 are not altered during the cell cycle (data not shown). Alternatively, DSBs might be more improperly processed during S phase than G1 or G2&#x0002f;M phase, resulting in activation of a <italic>TEL1</italic>-dependent checkpoint response. Consistent with this possibility, Usui <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c36">36</xref>) have demonstrated that <italic>sae2</italic> and <italic>rad50s</italic> mutations, which cause a defect in DSB processing, enhance the Tel1-mediated checkpoint response.</p><p>Rad53 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, and its phosphorylation is correlated with activation of the Rad53 kinase. We showed that phleomycin treatment induces Rad53 phosphorylation in a <italic>MEC1</italic>- and <italic>TEL1</italic>-dependent manner. Recent evidence has suggested that Rad53 phosphorylation following DNA damage might result entirely from increased autophosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c20">20</xref>). However, DNA damage induces hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 mutant proteins which possess little autophosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c48">48</xref>). Thus, after DNA damage Rad53 becomes phosphorylated in <italic>trans</italic> in a Mec1- and Tel1-dependent manner. Consistently, both Mec1 and Tel1 were found to phosphorylate the Rad53 protein <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>It has been suggested that DNA damage accumulates more in checkpoint defective mutants than wild-type cells. Although <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants are defective in the S-phase checkpoint, they do not show hypersensitivity to phleomycin. One explanation could be that a functional G2&#x0002f;M checkpoint compensates for defects in S phase. Perhaps if the G2&#x0002f;M checkpoint is fully functional and activated, DNA damage might be repaired sufficiently to allow cells to remain viable. Indeed, similar phenotypes have been observed in several <italic>mec1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c49">49</xref>); these mutants are as defective as <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; in both the G1- and S-phase checkpoints following treatment with UV light and MMS, although they do not show hypersensitivity to UV or MMS. Alternatively, it is possible that in <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutants DNA damage accumulates but might be processed efficiently by the <italic>MEC1</italic>-dependent repair pathway. Supporting this, the <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutation was found to enhance sensitivity of <italic>mec1</italic> mutants to phleomycin.</p><p>The human genes mutated in AT and Nijmegen breakage syndrome, <italic>ATM</italic> and <italic>NBS1</italic>, respectively, are both involved in the cellular response to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c3">3</xref>). The Nbs1 protein forms a complex with the human Mre11 and Rad50 proteins, which are implicated in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c50">50</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>MRE11</italic> gene were also found in individuals with another AT-like disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c51">51</xref>). Moreover, ATM directly phosphorylates Nbs1 on several sites required for its checkpoint function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c32">32</xref>). These results have demonstrated a functional and biochemical link between ATM and the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Nbs1 complex in human cells. The budding yeast Mre11&#x02013; Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2 complex has an established role in both non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c33">33</xref>). Recently, several groups showed that the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2 complex is required for checkpoint responses after treatment of DSB-inducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c36">36</xref>). It has been also shown that <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>xrs2</italic>&#x00394; mutations enhance the DNA-damage sensitivity of <italic>mec1</italic> mutants to similar extents as a <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c36">36</xref>). Moreover, Mre11 and Xrs2 are phosphorylated after DNA damage in a <italic>TEL1</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c36">36</xref>). These findings have suggested the model in which Tel1 and the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2 complex constitute a DNA damage response pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg252c36">36</xref>). We have shown that Tel1 is required for Xrs2 phosphorylation as well as checkpoint responses after phleomycin treatment in S phase. Our results extend the notion that the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Nbs1&#x0002f;Xrs2 complex and ATM family protein are structurally and functionally conserved in eukaryotes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg252f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Effect of the <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; mutations on phleomycin-induced Rad53 phosphorylation.
