About 60% term infants and 80% preterm infants develop hyperbilirubinemia within one week after birth. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is mainly due to the accumulation of bilirubin as a result of metabolic disturbance caused by various factors. Normally, serum bilirubin levels increase within 3 to 5 days after birth, and then begin to decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, under pathologic states, serum bilirubin, especially indirect bilirubin, can reach an exceedingly high level which leads to neurotoxicity, namely kernicterus, and eventually results in permanent neurological damage or even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Bilirubin is produced by the degradation of heme. Heme oxygenase (HO) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in this catabolic process. HO consists of three isozymes: HO-1, HO-2 and HO-3. Heme released from degraded fetal red blood is a potent inducer of HO-1 in the neonatal period, which is responsible for the increase of serum bilirubin levels and the development of hyperbilirubinemia. Inhibition of HO-1 expression or its enzymatic activity concurs to the reduction of bilirubin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible to target HO-1 as a novel therapeutic rationale for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of direct inhibition of bilirubin production by suppressing HO-1 in a neonatal rat hyperbilirubinemia model.</p><p>Small interference RNA (siRNA) technology utilizes short double-stranded RNA to specifically inhibit the transcription of a given target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This technique has been proven to be a promising method in treating a number of diseases, such as hereditary diseases, viral hepatitis, and certain cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, RNA interference as a means of treating age-related macular degeneration has entered into a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These advances provide a theoretical and experimental basis to treat neonatal hyperbilirubinemia using siRNA. Previously, we demonstrated that siRNA specifically inhibits the expression of human HO-1 (hHO-1) in human liver cell line HL-7702 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this paper, methoxyl siRNA targeting rat HO-1 (rHO-1) mRNA was used to suppress HO-1 in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia rat model. This study tested the feasibility of preventing and treating neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin toxic encephalopathy by targeting <italic>HO-1 </italic>gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>siRNA Transfection Efficiency</title><p>To determine the transfection efficiency of siRNA, a carboxy-fluorescein (FAM) labeled negative control (NC)-siRNA was transfected into BRL cells, and the nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) after 6 hours.

Positive effects include its role as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the abnormal increase of total serum bilirubin, particularly indirect bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) in the neonatal period can cause devastating neurological complications. Indirect bilirubin, a lipid-soluble molecule, is taken up by hepatic cells and transformed into glucuronic acid bilirubin (direct bilirubin) in the presence of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Lipid-soluble indirect bilirubin can penetrate the cell membrane and the blood brain barrier, leading to neonatal kernicterus, whose central nervous system sequelae reflect both a predilection of bilirubin toxicity for neurons (rather than glial cells) and the regional topography of bilirubin-induced neuronal injury involving prominent basal ganglia, cochlear and oculomotor nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the treatments for neonatal hyperbilirubinnemia are traditional phototherapy, exchange transfusion and drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although these treatments are effective, they are limited to removing excessive bilirubin rather than preventing the production of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a product of complex heme metabolism that requires the participation of a series of key enzymes. HO is an inducible, rate-limiting enzyme in the production of bilirubin. ALA is a heme precursor which can rapidly and consistently cause elevation of the serum bilirubin levels. Concurrent with increasing bilirubin, hepatic heme oxygenase activity increases considerably due to the increased availability of ALA-derived heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently, HO-1 has become a novel therapeutic target for attempts to reduce bilirubin production. Sn-mesoporphyrin (SnMP) and SnPP, which are structural analogs of heme, competitively inhibit HO enzymatic activity and consequently decrease the synthesis of bilirubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that SnMP effectively prevents hyperbilirubinemia caused by premature birth and hemolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the inhibitory mechanism of SnMP on hyperbilirubinemia <italic>in vivo </italic>is uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the safety issue concerning the application of this compound in clinics remains to be fully studied.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether siRNAs can effectively inhibit HO-1 expression that is up-regulated by hemin under hyperbilirubinemia conditions. Recent progress in siRNA technology provides a novel means to treat many diseases including hyperbilirubinemia. siRNA shows a superior specificity and stability compared with antisense RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since HO-1 is an inducible enzyme, targeted suppression by siRNA is a promising therapeutic approach to suppress HO-1 both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We first compared four pairs of siRNAs for their effects on inhibiting rHO-1 in BRL cells. We found that siRNA-4 was the most potent inhibitor of HO-1 expression and activity, and its inhibitory effect was both dose- and time-dependent. To further test if siRNA-4 could suppress HO-1 induced by endogenous heme <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established an animal model of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia according to the report of Drummond <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Seven to 9-day-old neonatal SD rats were treated with ALA intraperitoneally. These animals subsequently developed hyperbilirubinemia that mimics human hyperbilirubinemia. Injection of siRNA-4 significantly inhibited the rHO-1 activity in the liver and reduced the levels of serum bilirubin in the hyperbilirubinemia rats. SnPP, as a chemical inhibitor, could also reduce the serum bilirubin levels. However, the indirect bilirubin of siRNA-4 treated rats decreased more significantly. Taken together, our results suggest that siRNA may hold for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia conditions in human neonates.</p><p>Although siRNA has been widely applied to therapeutic research on various diseases, there are still many difficulties that prevent its clinical application at the present time. One of the major challenges is the stability of siRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. After entering the body, unmodified siRNA is quickly degraded by endogenous nuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Various methods have been employed to stabilize the siRNA. For example, certain vectors are used to synthesize cationic polymer. Additionally, chemical modification of siRNA can improve siRNA stability and enhance its delivery efficacy as well as therapeutic specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As demonstrated in our study, the therapeutic effect of methoxy-siRNA can last more than 48 hours after a single administration. Previous studies have shown that similar modification of siRNA can enhance the affinity of siRNA to target sequences, improve resistance to degradation by nuclease, and increase the interference of a target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Another obstacle hindering siRNA treatment progress is that siRNA may not reach its therapeutic target or organ. Presently, this obstacle is overcome by local administration of siRNA. For instance, siRNA targeting vascular endothelial growth factor for age-related macular degeneration is delivered through retinal injection. In addition, siRNA can treat chronic neuropathic pain through intrathecal administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Systemic delivery of siRNA is used to target multiple organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For example, siRNA administrated intraperitoneally is mainly distributed in the liver, spleen and bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is well documented that HO-1 is primarily expressed in liver and spleen. Thus, we selected the intraperitoneal injection as the administration method for this study. We demonstrated that siRNA-4 was mainly distributed in the liver and spleen, and both serum bilirubin levels and HO-1 expression were significantly reduced in a dose- and time-dependent manner after intraperitoneal injection of siRNA. The maximal inhibitory effect was observed at 48 hours after single injection of siRNA. These findings are consistent with other published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared to the traditional phototherapy and exchange transfusion, the mechanism of siRNA treatment is different from the traditional methods in view of directly inhibiting the production of bilirubin.
