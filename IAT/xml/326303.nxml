This segment of DNA is capable of replication in the presence of a helper plasmid. The sequence data reveal similarities between pSC101 and several other replicons. The origin of replication contains three direct repeats of an 18bp sequence associated with a segment exceptionally rich in A-T base pairs. A promotor that probably directs transcription of a gene encoding an essential plasmid replication function is associated with a region of extensive potential secondary structure. The sequence presented here includes the sequence of the par region involved in partitioning of plasmids at cell division.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5645"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0333.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5646"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0334.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5647"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5648"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5649"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5650"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0338.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5651"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0339.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5652"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0340.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5653"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0341.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5654"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0342.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5655"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0343.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5656"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0344.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5657"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0345.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5658"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00361-0346.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5659"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
