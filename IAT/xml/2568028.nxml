However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain to be elucidated. Cholesterol dependency of &#x003b2; cleavage prompted us to analyze immunoisolated APP-containing detergent-resistant membranes from rodent brains. We found syntaxin 1 as a key molecule for activity-dependent regulation of APP processing in cholesterol-dependent microdomains. In living cells, APP associates with syntaxin 1&#x02013;containing microdomains through X11&#x02013;Munc18, which inhibits the APP&#x02013;BACE1 interaction and &#x003b2; cleavage via microdomain segregation. Phosphorylation of Munc18 by cdk5 causes a shift of APP to BACE1-containing microdomains. Neuronal hyperactivity, implicated in A&#x003b2; overproduction, promotes the switching of APP microdomain association as well as &#x003b2; cleavage in a partially cdk5-dependent manner. We propose that microdomain switching is a mechanism of cholesterol- and activity-dependent regulation of APP processing in neurons.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: A&#x003b2;, amyloid-&#x003b2; peptide; AD, Alzheimer's disease; APLP, amyloid precursor-like protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; CASK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase; CID, CASK-interacting domain; CTF, C-terminal fragment; DIV, days in vitro; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; FL, full length; GPI, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol; IP, immunoprecipitation; M&#x003b2;CD, methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin; MBS, MES-buffered saline; MID, Munc18 interaction domain; MS, mass spectrometry; OG, octylglucoside; PrP, prion protein; PTX, picrotoxin; sAPP, secreted APP; VSVG, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein; WB, Western blot.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Increasing evidence indicates that amyloid-&#x003b2; peptide (A&#x003b2;) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Selkoe and Schenk, 2003</xref>). A&#x003b2; is generated by sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by &#x003b2;-secretase (BACE1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vassar et al., 1999</xref>) and &#x003b3;-secretase, whereas alternative cleavage by &#x003b1;-secretase precludes A&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Strooper and Annaert, 2000</xref>). It is of critical importance to determine how these alternative cleavages are regulated. In vitro and in vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simons et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Refolo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fassbender et al., 2001</xref>) have shown that high cellular cholesterol levels promote &#x003b2; cleavage and A&#x003b2; generation. A recent study indicates that A&#x003b2; regulates cholesterol metabolism, suggesting that cholesterol dependency of &#x003b2; cleavage may be part of the feedback system for cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grimm et al., 2005</xref>). BACE1 associates with cholesterol-dependent membrane microdomains, lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riddell et al., 2001</xref>). Because a fraction of APP shows cholesterol-dependent association with lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simons et al., 1998</xref>), rafts have been postulated to be a critical site for &#x003b2; cleavage and cholesterol-dependent regulation of APP&#x02013;BACE1 interaction. Association of &#x003b1;-secretase with nonraft domains may also contribute to the cholesterol dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kojro et al., 2001</xref>). However, a paradoxical acceleration of &#x003b2; cleavage by a slight reduction in cellular cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad-Rodriguez et al., 2004</xref>) might point to a limitation of the alternative association model of APP with rafts or nonrafts for explaining cholesterol-dependent regulation of &#x003b2;/&#x003b1; cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolozin, 2001</xref>).</p><p>APP is anterogradely transported in axons and may contribute to neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reinhard et al., 2005</xref>). After exposure on the cell surface, APP undergoes a rapid turnover by &#x003b1;-secretase at the cell surface or by BACE1 after endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nixon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cirrito et al., 2008</xref>). The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of APP plays critical roles in its trafficking and processing by binding to adaptor proteins, including Fe65 and X11 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">King and Turner, 2004</xref>). Overexpression of X11 or X11L, which are predominantly expressed in neurons, suppresses APP processing and A&#x003b2; generation in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borg et al., 1998</xref>). Munc18, an X11/X11L-interacting protein, synergistically accelerates the inhibitory effects of X11 on APP processing through direct and indirect functional interactions between X11 and Munc18 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 2002</xref>). Neither the precise mechanism nor the effect of Munc18 on APP processing in neurons has been elucidated. X11 but not X11L interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK)-Veli to form an evolutionally conserved heterotrimeric complex involved in the targeting of receptors in polarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">King and Turner, 2004</xref>). Contrary to cell culture models, no significant change in the levels of APP and its metabolites was observed in X11-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ho et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal/synaptic activity is known as an important regulator of &#x003b2; cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamenetz et al., 2003</xref>). In this connection, new types of microdomains related to exocytotic SNAREs may be of importance. Syntaxin 1, which is involved in synaptic vesicle docking/fusion under the control of Munc18, is associated with cholesterol-dependent microdomains but is segregated from Thy-1, a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)&#x02013;anchored typical raft resident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2001</xref>). A structural change in syntaxin 1 from a closed to an open conformation induced by phosphorylation of Munc18 by cdk5 may promote core complex formation essential for exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rizo and Sudhof, 2002</xref>). A broad spectrum of substrates, including Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fletcher et al., 1999</xref>) and APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iijima et al., 2000</xref>), suggests the involvement of cdk5 in the coordination of vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith and Tsai, 2002</xref>). Cdk5 is active on the plasma membrane or cell periphery as a complex with p35, an essential activator with a membrane anchor at the N terminus. Ectopic hyperactivity of cdk5 caused by cleavage of p35 to p25 has been implicated in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nguyen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith and Tsai, 2002</xref>) and promotion of A&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cruz et al., 2006</xref>). These results may indicate convergence of the two important regulatory mechanisms of A&#x003b2; production, neuronal/synaptic activity and cellular cholesterol levels, on specific membrane microdomains.</p><p>We aimed to characterize APP-containing microdomains to understand the mode of cholesterol-dependent microdomain association of APP and neuronal activity&#x02013;dependent regulation of &#x003b2; cleavage. Our analyses indicate a preferential association of APP with syntaxin 1&#x02013;containing microdomains and segregation from BACE1-containing microdomains. Dissociation of the X11&#x02013;Munc18&#x02013;syntaxin 1 interaction induced a shift in APP association from syntaxin- to BACE1-containing microdomains and promotion of &#x003b2; cleavage. We also found that neuronal hyperactivity promoted the shift in microdomain association of APP and &#x003b2; cleavage in a partially cdk5-dependent manner. We propose that microdomain switching, the alternative association of APP with syntaxin 1&#x02013;containing microdomains via X11&#x02013;Munc18&#x02013;syntaxin 1 or with BACE1-containing microdomains induced by dissociation from syntaxin 1, is a novel regulatory mechanism of an activity-dependent increase in &#x003b2; cleavage in neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions isolated with Lubrol WX</title><p>Biochemically, membrane microdomains are characterized as DRMs by insolubility in nonionic detergents at 4&#x000b0;C and flotation on density gradients. Triton X-100 is the standard detergent for this purpose, but other detergents are also useful for showing microdomain heterogeneity or other types of microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pike, 2004</xref>). We prepared DRMs for two main purposes: (1) the efficient and reproducible recovery of APP in DRMs from brains and (2) to maintain the separate identity of membranes without substantial intermingling of protein components to validate immunoaffinity purification. We tried several nonionic detergents, including Brij 97 and Lubrol WX. All detergents tested showed a clear enrichment of a DRM marker, prion protein (PrP), in DRM fractions and separation from a detergent-soluble membrane marker, calnexin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). DRM fractions were also rich in cholesterol and GM1-ganglioside (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mature forms of APP and BACE1 show association with Lubrol-resistant membranes.</bold> (a) Mature forms of APP were efficiently recovered in DRM fractions derived from mouse brains solubilized with Lubrol WX but poorly with Triton X-100 or Brij 97.

GPI-anchored proteins Thy-1 and PrP were used as DRM markers, and calnexin and GM130 were used as detergent-soluble membrane markers. We used longer exposure to detect APP-CTFs compared with FL-APP. (d) Lubrol WX causes only negligible levels of artifactual intermingling of Thy-1. Rat and mouse brain tissues were cohomogenized in 1% Lubrol WX or 1% Brij 97, and DRMs were prepared.

Lubrol caused only negligible levels of mixing of Thy-1 on DRMs during solubilization, centrifugation, and immunoisolation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830339f01"></graphic></fig><p>By Western blot (WB) analysis, Triton X-100 and Brij showed variable (poor in most cases) recovery of APP in DRMs. In contrast, a substantial part of APP was found in DRMs isolated with Lubrol. Interestingly, Lubrol caused an enrichment of the mature forms of APP (late Golgi or post-Golgi forms) in DRMs and recovery of the immature form (an ER or early Golgi form) mainly in the detergent-soluble fractions. This differential solubilization might reflect the formation of a mature Lubrol-resistant microdomain during transport across the Golgi. Quantitative measurements confirmed that the majority of mature APP was resistant to solubilization with Lubrol but not with Brij (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). This differential solubilization of APP was also observed in DRMs derived from primary neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). With Lubrol, a substantial part of mature BACE1 was consistently recovered in the DRM fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riddell et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, ADAM17, a putative &#x003b1;-secretase, showed solubility with Lubrol.</p><p>We checked the levels of membrane mixing induced by Lubrol by using a DRM preparation from a cohomogenized mixture of mouse and rat brain tissues followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with species-specific anti&#x02013;Thy-1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madore et al., 1999</xref>). Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madore et al. (1999)</xref> had already demonstrated intermingling of Thy-1 in DRMs prepared by Triton X-100, we focused on Brij and Lubrol. WB analysis of DRM fractions derived from brain tissues demonstrated negligible levels of Thy-1 mixing in the case of Lubrol WX, whereas Brij 97 showed detectable levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>). These results demonstrate the superiority of Lubrol WX for analyzing APP-rich microdomains and suggest that Lubrol maintains the separate identities of membranes to validate immunoisolation.</p><p>To test the feasibility of the immunoisolation of DRMs, we checked the distribution of APP on Lubrol DRMs. First, we checked the morphology of DRMs by EM (Fig. S1, a and b, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804075/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804075/DC1</ext-link>). Triton X-100 DRMs showed vesicular structures as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roper et al., 2000</xref>), which is consistent with robust membrane mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madore et al., 1999</xref>). However, Lubrol DRMs showed various shapes and sizes of sheetlike structures. Next, DRMs were stained with anti-APP and gold-labeled secondary antibody and observed by EM (Fig. S1, c and d). Gold particles were visualized as clusters on significantly smaller numbers of membrane structures than expected from a random distribution (Poisson distribution, x<sup>2</sup> test, P &#x0003c; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 255), suggesting an accumulation of APP in specific subpopulations of Lubrol DRMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoisolation of APP-containing DRM subfractions</title><p>To analyze APP-rich Lubrol-DRM subfractions derived from brain tissue or primary neurons, we performed immunomagnetic isolation using an affinity-purified antibody against the APP cytoplasmic domain. Successful isolation was shown by WB analysis, demonstrating almost complete precipitation of APP in DRMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>) and blocking by antigen peptide preabsorption (not depicted). The anti-APP antibody precipitated a discrete set of proteins from the input DRMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>) corresponding to 2% of the total input (estimation by SYPRO Ruby staining), indicating an association of APP with specialized subpopulations of DRMs. Identification of protein components by mass spectrometry (MS) and WB analysis revealed syntaxin 1 as a probable link between APP and the cholesterol-dependent microdomains distinct from rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2001</xref>) and a possible connection with synaptic activity. As candidate links between APP and syntaxin 1, X11/X11L and Munc18 were detected in APP-containing DRMs by WB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>) but not by MS analysis. Because APP&#x02013;X11&#x02013;Munc18 and X11&#x02013;Munc18&#x02013;syntaxin 1 interactions have been reported, we hypothesized that X11/X11L&#x02013;Munc18 provides a link between APP and syntaxin 1.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Successful immunoisolation of DRM subfractions rich in APP or BACE1.</bold> Protein compositions of immunoisolated DRM subfractions were compared by silver staining (a) and WB (b). Brain-derived Lubrol DRMs were immunoaffinity purified with anti-APPc or anti-BACE1c. Protein band patterns of the DRM subfractions were distinct from that of the input (a). WB analysis showed minimal overlap between APP and BACE1 (b). X11, CASK, Munc18, and syntaxin 1 were enriched in APP DRMs. Proteins in the bound fraction derived from the same amount of DRM were loaded. The total amount of bound proteins in BACE1 DRMs estimated by SYPRO Ruby staining was roughly 50% of that in APP DRMs. PrP showed preferential association with APP DRMs over BACE1 DRMs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830339f02"></graphic></fig></sec><sec><title>Characterization of APP-containing DRM subfractions</title><p>To characterize the organization of APP DRMs, we treated them with 60 mM octylglucoside (OG), an effective detergent for solubilizing raft proteins, at RT. Next, we size fractionated the protein complexes in a glycerol gradient. APP, Munc18, and syntaxin 1 showed broad distribution across the gradient in contrast to BACE1 (see Fig. S2 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804075/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804075/DC1</ext-link>). Fractions corresponding to &#x0223c;6,000 kD lacking BACE1 were used for further immunoisolation with anti-APP. The bound fraction contained proteins such as Munc18, syntaxin 1, and CASK, suggesting an involvement of X11&#x02013;Munc18&#x02013;syntaxin 1 in the large APP complex.</p><p>Cholesterol depletion by methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin (M&#x003b2;CD) and subsequent cholesterol replenishment with a preformed cholesterol&#x02013;M&#x003b2;CD complex has been used to show cholesterol-dependent microdomain association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simons and Toomre, 2000</xref>). M&#x003b2;CD treatment caused a partial shift of full-length (FL) APP into heavier fractions that was reversed by cholesterol replenishment, indicating a cholesterol-dependent DRM association of APP as well as BACE1 (Fig. S2 b). A fraction of X11/X11L and CASK was associated with DRMs (Fig. S2 b for X11 and CASK), suggesting binding of these proteins to integral membrane proteins in DRMs. Association of X11 and CASK with DRMs showed cholesterol dependence, whereas that of Munc18 and syntaxin 1 was less clear. Because X11L demonstrated somewhat variable results in cholesterol dependency, we focused on X11 and CASK in subsequent experiments.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that accumulation of the identified proteins was the result of artifactual changes caused by detergent solubilization, we adopted a detergent-free preparation of DRM-like membranes followed by immunoisolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vetrivel et al., 2004</xref>). WB analysis of APP-rich membranes derived from cortical neurons showed coresidence of the same proteins in DRM-like membranes (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804075/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804075/DC1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>BACE1 is largely excluded from APP-containing DRMs</title><p>To study the involvement of syntaxin 1 in the APP&#x02013;BACE1 interaction, we isolated DRMs rich in BACE1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>).

To exclude the possibility that APP cleavage by BACE1 reduced coresidence, we used a membrane-permeable &#x003b2;-secretase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stachel et al., 2004</xref>) for DRM preparation from cortical neurons and immunoisolation. Even in this situation, overlap between APP and BACE1 was minimal (unpublished data). Consistently, X11, Munc18, and syntaxin 1 were detected only at low levels in the BACE1 DRMs. PrP was relatively enriched in APP-containing DRMs. These results suggest an exclusion of BACE1 from APP-containing complexes in DRMs.</p></sec><sec><title>APP and BACE1 associate with distinct microdomains in neurons</title><p>In living cells, Thy-1 segregates away from PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madore et al., 1999</xref>) and syntaxin 1 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2001</xref>) but associates with BACE1 in microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad-Rodriguez et al., 2004</xref>).

These results prompted us to study the relationship between APP and microdomains rich in Thy-1 or PrP. These two GPI-anchored proteins are useful markers to analyze distinct microdomains in living neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madore et al., 1999</xref>). We performed copatching of endogenous cell surface proteins on living hippocampal neurons as an established method to observe coresidence in the same microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harder et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad-Rodriguez et al., 2004</xref>). To visualize antibody-induced protein clusters (patches) on the cell surface, we incubated live cells with two different sets of primary and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies.

Although published data clearly demonstrate that APP is not a typical raft resident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parkin et al., 1999</xref>), the application of Lubrol permitted us to show that mature forms of APP are efficiently and consistently recovered in DRMs. Moreover, our procedures minimized mixing of protein components, which allowed us to analyze immunologically isolated DRMs that may reflect the in vivo organization of membrane protein complexes. Cholesterol depletion moves APP, X11, and CASK out of DRMs with less clear changes in Munc18 and syntaxin 1, suggesting that the DRM association of APP partly results from cholesterol-dependent recruitment of APP to syntaxin 1 microdomains containing Munc18 followed by stabilization through X11.</p><p>Contrary to our results, one study demonstrated the recovery of APP in Lubrol-soluble fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad-Rodriguez et al., 2004</xref>). We speculate that this discrepancy might be caused by experimental differences. Reduced dissociation of X11&#x02013;Munc18 in our quickly completed homogenization step may allow the recovery of mature APP in syntaxin 1 DRMs without moving into Lubrol-soluble fractions. Clearly, more needs to be done, but our results might lead to resolution of the discrepancy in DRM association of APP in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simons et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parkin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad-Rodriguez et al., 2004</xref>) by providing a new mode of microdomain association dependent on protein&#x02013;protein interactions that are easily disrupted by certain DRM preparation methods.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad-Rodriguez et al. (2004)</xref> demonstrated that a small reduction in cellular cholesterol levels paradoxically enhanced APP&#x02013;BACE1 interaction and A&#x003b2; production. Based on the recovery of APP in non-DRM domains, they proposed the promotion of &#x003b2; cleavage because of the shift of BACE1 localization to non-DRM. Our model provides another mechanism for the promotion of A&#x003b2; production from the APP side. Cholesterol reduction inhibits the recruitment of APP and X11 (Fig. S2 b) to the syntaxin 1&#x02013;containing microdomains and promotes an APP&#x02013;BACE1 interaction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Further study is required to clarify whether both nonexclusive mechanisms work together.</p><p>Unlike our results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehehalt et al. (2003)</xref> demonstrated an association of APP with BACE1-containing microdomains on the surface of N2a cells by using copatching experiments. We speculate that they analyzed N2a cells expressing relatively large amounts of exogenous APP (see Materials and methods). APP overexpression will saturate the binding sites and cause mislocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaether and Haass, 2004</xref>), which is similar to the switched conditions to BACE1-containing microdomains in our model. Because microdomain switching mainly relies on the results of copatching experiments with the endocytosis-defective mutant of BACE1 in this study, the role of microdomain switching in endosomes is speculation. In this respect, their observation might complement ours. They clearly showed a requirement of endocytosis for A&#x003b2; production, which was recently confirmed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cirrito et al., 2008</xref>). Promotion of &#x003b2; cleavage by antibody-induced clustering of APP and BACE1 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehehalt et al., 2003</xref>) would suggest a critical role of microdomain association during the endocytotic process. Because acidic pH&#x02013;induced conformational changes in BACE1 may be required for direct APP&#x02013;BACE1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shimizu et al., 2008</xref>), coresidence of APP and BACE1 in the same microdomains may be a prerequisite for APP&#x02013;BACE interaction in endosomes. Further studies will be required to clarify the involvement of microdomain association in endosomes in &#x003b2; cleavage.</p><p>After exit from the Golgi, APP is primarily transported in axons. From suggested physiological functions, cdk5's effects on APP&#x02013;BACE1 interaction may be coupled with exo-/endocytosis at presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith and Tsai, 2002</xref>) or vesicle formation in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paglini et al., 2001</xref>). X11 family proteins are shown to act as coat proteins for sorting and vesicle budding in the TGN to affect APP transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2003</xref>). This implies that the large APP-containing complex itself is a transport-related structure controlled by X11 for cargo segregation and vesicle packing and by cdk5 for cargo dissociation. In this respect, cholesterol-dependent association of APP with syntaxin 1 microdomains via X11&#x02013;Munc18 might be related to the sorting events in the TGN and maintained during axonal transport from the TGN through the plasma membrane. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that APP&#x02013;syntaxin 1 association is formed by a transient X11&#x02013;Munc18 interaction in the Golgi/TGN that is replaced by other proteins in the post-Golgi vesicles or at the plasma membrane. It is also possible that APP and syntaxin 1 will associate only at the plasma membrane. Further analysis of microdomain association in the TGN and axonal transporting vesicles will be required to clarify the point.</p><p>A human brain imaging study indicates a strong correlation between neuronal activity and A&#x003b2; deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckner et al., 2005</xref>). Activity-dependent enhancement of &#x003b2; cleavage may be a mechanism underlying this correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamenetz et al., 2003</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cirrito et al. (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2008</xref>) provided in vivo evidence to show that synaptic activity accelerates A&#x003b2; release mainly caused by promotion of APP endocytosis from plasma membrane. Synaptic activity would indirectly promote bulk endocytosis to induce transport of APP and BACE1 into the same endosomal compartment. Our PTX-induced hyperactivation model indicates an involvement of cdk5 in the activity-dependent promotion of &#x003b2; cleavage. We showed a promotion of microdomain switching by cdk5 as one underlying molecular mechanism, but the broad spectrum of cdk5 substrates might indicate that other parallel mechanisms are also involved. Analysis of activity-dependent changes in presynaptic endosomes will be critical to elucidate such molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Our data indicate a preferential association of APP with syntaxin 1&#x02013;containing microdomains via X11&#x02013;Munc18, which acts as a possible barrier for APP&#x02013;BACE1 interaction through microdomain segregation. Dissociation of X11&#x02013;Munc18&#x02013;syntaxin 1 caused by cdk5 phosphorylation induces a shift of APP association to BACE1-containing microdomains on the cell surface and promotes &#x003b2; cleavage, possibly in endosomes. Our data also implicate cdk5-dependent microdomain switching in the activity-dependent promotion of &#x003b2; cleavage in neurons. Further analyses of the mode and control of APP's microdomain association, especially in presynaptic endosomes, would shed light on the true nature of APP processing in neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used: anti-APP (22C11), anti-BACE1, and anti&#x02013;Thy-1.1 (Millipore); anti-PrP (SAF-32; Cayman Chemical); anticalnexin, anti-GM130, anti-X11, anti-X11L, anti-CASK, and anti-Munc18 (Transduction Laboratories); anti&#x02013;Thy-1.2 (AbD Serotec and Invitrogen); anti-X11, anti-p35, and anti-ADAM17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); rat anti-GFP (RQ2) and mouse anti&#x02013;syntaxin 1 (HPC-1; MBL International); rabbit anti-Munc18 (Affinity BioReagents); rabbit and mouse anti&#x02013;syntaxin 1a (Synaptic Systems GmbH); anti-BACE1, anti-sAPP&#x003b1;, and anti-sAPP&#x003b2; end-specific antibodies (Immuno-Biological Laboratories); rabbit anti&#x02013;human BACE1 and mouse anti&#x02013;human APP (P2-1; Invitrogen); mouse anti&#x02013;human BACE1 (R&#x00026;D Systems); rabbit and mouse anti-GFP (Invitrogen); rat anti-HA tag (3F10; Roche); mouse anti-HA tag (16B12; Covance); and anti-vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein tag ([VSVG] Sigma-Aldrich).

For BACE1 patching in N2a cells, we took advantage of a mutant BACE1 lacking a C-terminal endocytosis signal (LL499/500AA, BACE1AA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pastorino et al., 2002</xref>). Initial attempts at copatching of endogenous APP&#x02013;BACE1 in N2a cells failed because the surface expression of wild-type BACE1 was limited in N2a cells and insufficient for patch formation. Upon transfection, cells expressing enough wild-type BACE1 for patch formation showed almost no staining of FL-APP on the surface, probably because of intracellular &#x003b2; cleavage of APP during transport to the cell surface. Expression of a very small amount of BACE1AA enabled us to observe patches of BACE1 and APP simultaneously on the surface. This mutant has similar properties to wild-type BACE1 in copatching with Thy-1 and separation from PrP and syntaxin 1. The primary antibodies used were affinity-purified rabbit anti-APPex, mouse anti&#x02013;human APP, anti&#x02013;Thy-1.2 (rat or mouse), anti-PrP (mouse or rabbit), anti&#x02013;human BACE1ex (mouse or rabbit), and anti-HA (rat). After a 1.5-h incubation with primary antibodies in 1 mg/ml BSA in HBSS, patches were induced by a 1-h incubation with goat secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (Invitrogen). To eliminate cross-species reactions, the secondary antibodies were extensively adsorbed against mouse, rabbit, or rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) immobilized on agarose beads. In the case of APP&#x02013;syntaxin 1, the large and rigid complexes containing APP&#x02013;X11&#x02013;Munc18&#x02013;syntaxin 1 would be cross-linked to APP-free syntaxin 1&#x02013;Munc18 clusters or SNARE complexes by antibody treatment because of the similar lipid composition in microdomains. Most of the antibody-induced clusters would generate partial overlap through sterically constrained states by the protein complexes. Because complete copatching requires intermiscibility of two molecules on the membrane, we think that the standard copatching measurement is not appropriate in our case. In fact, we observed that most of the patches show partial overlap, which would be estimated as negative by the standard copatching analysis method. Therefore, we used the Metamorph software's colocalization extension (MDS Analytical Technologies) in a pixel-based manner for quantification of copatching. In randomly selected cells, fluorescence images corresponding to the top of the free surface were captured at RT on a microscope (IX70; Olympus) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Cool SNAPHQ; Roper Scientific) controlled by Metamorph through a water immersion 60&#x000d7; NA 1.2 objective lens, a 1.5&#x000d7; magnifying lens, and filter sets (86006; Chroma Technology Corp.). An in-focus region of images was selected with a region of interest tool, and area-based measurement of colocalization was performed after automatic background subtraction and segmentation. Because overexpression of proteins on the cell surface caused deleterious effects on copatching like fusion of patches, we used minimal amounts of plasmids for only a small fraction of cells to form patches of both proteins. Thus, we omitted the cells showing patches of only one protein or signs of overexpression from analysis. Data were collected from &#x0003e;10 images per well and at least three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Copatching experiments on primary neurons</title><p>For syntaxin 1 and BACE1 patching on axons of primary neurons, 3 days in vitro (DIV) hippocampal neurons were transfected with wild-type human APP, syntaxin 1&#x02013;HA, and BACE1AA with or without p25.

For neuronal hyperactivation by KCl treatment, the neurons were cultured in medium containing 25 mM KCl for 24 h before copatching experiments in the presence or absence of a cdk5 inhibitor because of insensitivity to PTX in the premature state.
