Genetic studies in zebrafish and mice have established that the Hedgehog (Hh)-signaling pathway plays a critical role in craniofacial development, partly due to the pathway's role in CNCC development. Disruption of the Hh-signaling pathway in humans can lead to the spectral disorder of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), which is often characterized by a variety of craniofacial defects including midline facial clefting and cyclopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Previous work has uncovered a role for Hh-signaling in zebrafish dorsal neurocranium patterning and chondrogenesis, however Hh-signaling mutants have not been described with respect to the ventral pharyngeal arch (PA) skeleton. Lipid-modified Hh-ligands require the transmembrane-spanning receptor Dispatched 1 (Disp1) for proper secretion from Hh-synthesizing cells to the extracellular field where they act on target cells.

We show that <italic>disp1 </italic>is required for post-migratory CNCC to become properly patterned within the first arch, while the gene is dispensable for CNCC condensation and patterning in more posterior arches.

Histology reveals that posterior arch residing-CNCC differentiate into fibrous-connective tissue, rather than becoming chondrocytes. Treatments with Cyclopamine, to inhibit Hh-signaling at different developmental stages, show that Hh-signaling is required during gastrulation for normal patterning of CNCC in the first PA, and then during the late pharyngula stage, to promote CNCC chondrogenesis within the posterior arches.

The final skeletal pattern depends on intrinsic positional information acquired by CNCC prior to migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], instructive signals encountered by CNCC during migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and morphogenetic cues that CNCC receive from surrounding tissues upon completing migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There are seven paired skeletal elements that arise on either side of the midline. The CNCC of the first PA (mandibular) forms the jaw, while those in the second PA (hyoid) add support to the jaw structure. Posterior to these two PA, the CNCC populate five posterior PA to form bilateral gill support structures. Although all of these elements derive from CNCC, the neural crest arise from different anterior-posterior regions of the neural axis, travel in different streams to arrive at the final destination, express different Hox genes, and encounter different local environments at the point of condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the genes that regulate the production of cartilage from CNCC are shared regardless of location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Genetic studies have revealed conserved requirements for Hedgehog (Hh)-signaling in craniofacial development. Abrogation of Hh-signaling through inactivation of the Hh-receptor <italic>Smoothened </italic>(<italic>Smo</italic>) leads to a complete loss of cranial skeletal elements in zebrafish and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It has been pointed out that these animal models represent extreme phenotypes, with complete suppression of signaling, and often result in embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, mutations within the key Hh-family member, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in humans can lead to the spectral disorder of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), often characterized by a variety of craniofacial defects including midline facial clefting and cyclopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been further suggested that HPE can be found in patients with significant impairment of the Hh-signaling pathway rather than its complete elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Genetic and pharmacological vertebrate studies have revealed that Hh-signaling is required by multiple facial tissues, including the neural crest, and the pathway's action is needed at multiple times during embryonic development in order for the face to grow and pattern normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, it is becoming apparent that the range of phenotypes that are apparent in HPE may be in part due to the affected tissue(s) and the timing of the Hh-pathway disruption.</p><p>The precise role for Hh-signaling in the zebrafish PA skeleton has yet to be elucidated. In the dorsal neurocranium, Hh-signaling has been demonstrated to control the placement and condensation of CNCC upon facial ectoderm prior to their chondrification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This CNCC patterning defect is followed by a delay in the expression of the chondrogenic marker <italic>sox9a</italic>, or a complete absence of gene expression in more severe genetic backgrounds where <italic>smo </italic>is disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Neurocranial and upper jaw cartilage elements, including the ethmoid plate, paired trabeculae and pterygoid process of the palatoquadrate, are lost or mislocalized with treatments of Cyclopamine (Cya), a pharmacological antagonist of Hh-signaling, administered to whole embryos during the gastrulation period, prior to CNCC migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This requirement is likely cell non-autonomous as the oral ectoderm requires early Hh-signals in order to promote CNCC condensation and the expression of growth factors as revealed by genetic mosaic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition to this, Wada et al., 2005 has proposed a second, cell-autonomous requirement for Hh-signaling wherein the Hh-signal is secreted, likely by the oral ectoderm, and is required by post-migratory CNCC that will form the neurocranium to undergo chondrogenesis. This finding is supported in mice and zebrafish with a tissue-specific loss of <italic>Smo </italic>function in CNCC, as these cells become properly patterned in the face but rarely differentiate into cartilage tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Despite this, these studies do not explain what happens to the CNCC after they fail to condense.</p><p>This study seeks to expand our understanding of Hh-signaling in craniofacial development by presenting a detailed characterization of ventral cartilage development in the PA upon genetic inactivation of the Disp1 gene by using the <italic>chameleon </italic>(<italic>con/disp1</italic>) mutant zebrafish. Disp1 acts within Hh-synthesizing cells to disperse Hh-ligands into the extracellular field where they are received by Hh-target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We found that these mutant fish demonstrate a significant, but not complete, reduction in Hh-signaling, similar to what has been proposed for HPE patients with DISP1 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, we pinpoint precisely during development when Hh-signals are required for ventral cartilage development through pharmacological inhibition using Cya. Collectively we report findings that provide insight into Hh-signaling function during jaw and gill cartilage formation in the developing zebrafish pharyngeal arch skeleton.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) embryos were obtained from natural crosses and staged as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

To better understand the role of Hh-signaling in this process, we studied cartilage development within two <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant alleles: the <italic>con/disp1</italic><sup><italic>tm</italic>15<italic>a </italic></sup>(genetic mutation characterized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) and <italic>con/disp1</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>392 </sup>(genetic mutation described in this manuscript, see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant phenotypes are less severe than <italic>slow-muscle-omitted </italic>(<italic>smu/smo</italic>) mutant phenotypes, making them more amenable for detection of subtle deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. <italic>con/disp1</italic><sup><italic>tm</italic>15<italic>a </italic></sup>and <italic>con/disp1</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>392 </sup>alleles displayed similar penetrance in their craniofacial phenotype, and also shared similar gene expression reductions in <italic>gli1</italic>, a Hh-signaling pathway transcription factor that is sensitive to the pathway's attenuation (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Due to the similar nature of the mutant phenotypes, and in an effort to be concise, in this study we simply report our findings using the <italic>con/disp1</italic><sup><italic>tm</italic>15<italic>a </italic></sup>allele, which we will herein refer to as <italic>con/disp1</italic>.</p><p>5 day old <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants were distinguished by an overall reduction in head size and displayed micro- or agnathia due to reduced jaw outgrowth (arrow, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>) and significant heart edema when compared to wild type larvae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). A closer examination of cartilage formation at 96 hpf using Alcian blue staining revealed the mandibular arch cartilages (lower jaw) in wild type larvae to be completely patterned, including the ventral Meckel's cartilage (Mc) and dorsal palatoquadrate (pq) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). However, <italic>con/disp1 </italic>Mc and pq elements were significantly reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Hyoid arch cartilages, which support the lower jaw, contain the dorsal hyosymplectics (hs) and ventral ceratohyals (ch). <italic>con/disp1 </italic>hs and ch cartilages were smaller and dysmorphic, with the ch often inverted posteriorly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). Inversion of midline arch elements is a common developmental byproduct of severe posterior arch cartilage disruptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and strikingly the ceratobranchial (cb) cartilages of the five posterior arches (gill-support) were consistently absent in the <italic>con/disp1 </italic>larvae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). Closer examination of the remaining <italic>con/disp1 </italic>jaw elements revealed a complete loss of dorsal cartilage elements comprising the pterygoid process (ptp) of the mandibular arch and the symplectic (sy) of the hyoid arch (arrowhead marks cartilage elements in wild type embryos, asterisk denotes cartilage loss in mutants, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E, F</xref>).

Injecting offspring from an incross mating of <italic>con/disp1 </italic>heterozygotes with 150 pg <italic>shh</italic>FL mRNA at the 1-cell stage yielded no discernable differences in cartilage phenotypes (11/45 [24%] larvae showing <italic>con/disp1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cartilage defects) from their uninjected siblings (15/55 [26%] larvae) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>), likely due to the inability of lipid-modified-ShhFL protein to be secreted from <italic>disp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>mutant cells. In contrast, injecting <italic>con/disp1 </italic>heterozygote offspring with 150 pg of <italic>shh</italic>N mRNA reproducibly decreased the number of larvae displaying PA-derived cartilage defects (3/50 [6%]) compared to uninjected siblings (12/45 [25%]). We determined cartilage rescue in these studies to be a partial-to-full restoration of cartilage outgrowth in the mandibular arch coupled with partial restoration of cb cartilages (arrow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> shows unilateral rescue in cb 4-5) in genotype-confirmed <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).

Alternatively, because <italic>shh</italic>N completely restored cartilages in the anterior arches, loss of full cartilage restoration may be due to the observation that arch cartilages develop sequentially, with posterior elements forming last, thus allowing for ectopic mRNA dilution and degradation to occur prior to the time in which chondrogenesis has completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tracking <italic>con/disp1 </italic>CNCC development with the <italic>fli1:gfp </italic>transgene</title><p>PA cartilages are derived from CNCC in zebrafish, consistent with higher vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

By 32 hpf, interactions between the post-migratory CNCC and surrounding epithelia take place to sequentially pattern the CNCC within the seven PA (PA1-7).

In wild type embryos, the anterior-most CNCC population migrated medial to the eyefield and resided anterior to the stomodeum (presumptive mouth, m) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

This hypothesis is consistent with our findings, and those by Eberhart et al., 2006 and Wada et al., 2005, which revealed that cell proliferation and cell death levels within the facial primordia of Hh-mutants (severe loss-of-function as well as hypomorphic alleles) are no different than wild type siblings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Mesenchymal CNCC that have migrated into the PA primordia are multipotent, able to give rise to fibrous-connective tissue such as smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts, in addition to specialized-connective tissue such as facial cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Therefore, in the absence of pro-chondrogenic gene expression (<italic>sox9a</italic>, <italic>col2a1</italic>, <italic>dlx2a</italic>) we wondered if the persisting posterior arch-residing CNCC gave rise to fibrous-connective tissue or an alternative cell type. To address this, we stained 5 day-old wild type and <italic>con/disp1 </italic>larvae with hematoxylin and eosin in order to differentiate cell types. Wild type larvae revealed the presence of chondrocytes (bluish-white staining, large vacuolated cell) in each PA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Viewing PA3 at higher magnification revealed that chondroctyes were neatly arranged into a circular rod, lying dorsal to the arch's muscle cell (red), and surrounded by a mass of fibrous-connective tissue (dark staining, smaller cell) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Within <italic>con/disp1 </italic>larvae, chondrocytes were clearly present within the hyoid arch, however chondrocytes were not detectable in the posterior arches (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Rather, these arches were populated fully by fibrous-connective tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Similar to the wild type PA3 organization, <italic>con/disp1 </italic>PA3 ectopic fibrous-connective tissue cells were organized within a small circular rod, lying just dorsal to the arch's muscle cell, surrounded by connective tissue in a highly ordered fashion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, F</xref> and cellular organization is schematized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, G</xref>).

Those remaining <italic>bapx1</italic>-expressing cells may reside in the PA1 joint region where the Mc and pq elements attempt to set up a joint between the poorly developed cartilage elements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>bapx1 </italic>expression was completely reduced within the midline of the <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). At 74 hpf, <italic>gdf5 </italic>expression can be detected in a bilateral population of cells that prefigures the jaw joint, as well as in a cell population at the midline that prefigures the unpaired ventral basihyal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

Together this data reveals novel requirements for Hh-signaling in the development of jaw joints, organization of the first arch RAP cartilage element and the establishment of jaw joint domains during the second day of development, which may be partly attributed to a reduction in early gene expression of two genes, <italic>bapx1 </italic>and <italic>gdf5</italic>. This phenotype is likely hidden in many Hh-signaling mutants due to the additional requirement for Hh-signaling on anterior arch chondrogenesis near the joint regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K</xref>, findings in this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) which in more severely affected larvae leads to the loss of all cranial skeletal elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>disp1 </italic>and <italic>shh </italic>are co-expressed in brain and facial epithelia during development</title><p>To determine the cells that produce and secrete Hh-ligands during craniofacial development we investigated the expression patterns for <italic>disp1 </italic>and <italic>shh</italic>.

We treated wild type embryos with Cya, to antagonize Hh-signaling activation by compromising Smo action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], at different developmental stages from 4-72 hpf.

The mandibular arch cartilage defects of gastrulation-stage treated embryos were similar to those described for the <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Despite this, hyoid and posterior arch cartilages were only slightly reduced and fairly well patterned in gastrulation stage treated embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). Cya-treatments administered during stages of early neurulation and neural crest specification (8-12 hpf) occasionally resulted in reduced mandibular arch cartilages but rarely affected other PA cartilages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>). Next, we found that in contrast to earlier treatments, Cya-treatments during CNCC migration (12-24 hpf) or during the timepoint critical for CNCC condensation within facial epithelial (24-32 hpf) produced no negative effects on the development of the PA elements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E, F</xref>).

Finally, blocking Hh-signaling in embryos after 48 hpf had no influence on PA cartilage development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8H</xref>). Collectively, this data indicates two critical time periods during which Hh-signaling is required for PA cartilage development, one early (4-8 hpf, gastrulation) to direct jaw outgrowth and chondrogenesis within portions of the anterior arches, and one later (32-48 hpf, late pharyngula stage) to promote chondrogenesis in the posterior arches (summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8I</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Early and late Cyclopamine treatments disrupt ventral PA development</bold>.

Its etiology is highly heterogeneous, likely due to the involvement of multiple genetic factors that are required in a variety of craniofacial tissues and at various times during facial growth and patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Disruption of the Hh-signaling pathway is the most frequently reported deficit underlying HPE, or its closely related clinical microforms of the disorder, in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For this reason, multiple studies have sought to experimentally demonstrate the requirements for the Hh-signaling pathway in craniofacial tissues and facial precursors. In the zebrafish, these previous studies have either focused solely on the development of the skull and upper jaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], or utilized severe loss-of-function alleles representing extreme cases of cranial skeleton loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Here we provide a detailed characterization for the role of Hh-signaling in the PA skeleton by utilizing a hypomorphic allele of Hh-signaling (<italic>con/disp1</italic>). Indeed, it has been suggested by others that these less-severe alleles may provide very useful insights into the etiology of Hh-associated HPE as they display characteristic craniofacial abnormalities in the absence of more debilitating phenotypes, such as cyclopia and nervous system deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>].</p><p>Our study revealed multiple requirements for Hh-signaling during CNCC development that influences the final facial skeletal pattern. First, Hh-signaling controls jaw outgrowth by influencing both patterning and chondrogenic differentiation of postmigratory-CNCC that reside in the anterior arches. Using the Hh-inhibitor Cya we revealed that Hh-signaling is needed during gastrulation for proper jaw formation. Hh-inhibition during gastrulation in zebrafish and chick embryos is also associated with cyclopia and mid-facial dysplasia (data not shown, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), and has also been shown to influence patterning and chondrogenesis in the zebrafish dorsal skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These phenotypes mimic severe loss-of-function mutations within human <italic>SHH </italic>in HPE, which is characterized by facial anomalies including cyclopia, cleft lip, and underdeveloped jaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite impairing jaw outgrowth, multiple cranial structures remained in the lower jaw of <italic>con/disp1 </italic>larvae. This not only revealed that some cranial structures were more sensitive to Hh-attenuation (i.e. the dorsal jaw and jaw support elements), but also allowed for detection of deficits in the jaw joint.</p><p>Our work further revealed a requirement for Hh-signaling in cartilage development within the posterior gill-forming PA. <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant posterior arch-residing CNCC fail to chondrify, despite becoming properly patterned within well-formed endodermal pouches. Cya treatments revealed the single and crucial time for Hh-signaling in this event is during the late-pharyngula stage, well beyond the time when CNCC have migrated into the PA primordia. It is not surprising that Hh-signaling is required by postmigratory-CNCC in the posterior arches as Hh-ligands become widely expressed throughout the facial epithelial tissues shortly after the time in which CNCC migrate into the face. By examining CNCC differentiation in these arches, we found that certain genes are specifically downregulated in the absence of Hh-signaling, and histological preparation of the gill arches suggest that CNCC are transfated to fibrous-connective tissue as a result. It is clear from these findings that multiple signaling interactions involving the Hh-pathway must occur for proper craniofacial development, and this likely reflects the variability in human phenotypes associated with disruptions to the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]</p><sec><title>Hh-signaling is required for mandibular arch patterning and chondrogenesis</title><p>Frontonasal development and the outgrowth of anterior craniofacial structures are strongly influenced by the facial oral ectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Fate mapping has revealed that dorsal CNCC precursors (neurocranium and pq) condense upon the oral ectoderm roof upon their arrival to the face, while ventral CNCC precursors (Mc and a subset of pq) migrate to, and condense upon, the oral ectoderm floor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The ability of CNCC to condense upon the oral stomodeum is negatively affected by the loss of Hh-signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], likely resulting in the aberrant localization of first arch CNCC. In our studies of <italic>fli1</italic>GFP:<italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants, CNCC that have migrated into the first arch were conspicuously absent just anterior to the stomodeum, and rather these cells preferentially localized posterior to the stomodeum. Interestingly, the anterior-most CNCC in the <italic>fli1</italic>GFP:wild type siblings never localized posterior to the stomodeum, suggesting that Hh-signaling may normally act to restrict CNCC from this region, either through promoting CNCC-stomodeum adhesion and/or by inducing midline tissue expansion posterior to the stomodeum that would serve as a physical barrier.</p><p>In addition to patterning defects, our studies revealed cell differentiation defects in the anterior-most CNCC. Local morphogenetic signals from the oral ectoderm, such as <italic>shh</italic>, are likely involved in promoting mesenchymal differentiation and skeletal outgrowth in the jaw and neurocranium. In chick embryos, <italic>Shh </italic>from the oral ectoderm influences expression of critical CNCC markers to promote maxillary and frontonasal outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. By closely examining the cell differentiation defects in the <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants, we found significant variability in the expression of CNCC markers between mesenchymal condensations in different DV domains within the lower jaw (PA1-2). Notably, neural crest-specific gene expression often appeared to be reduced in <italic>con/disp1 </italic>dorsal condensations within anterior PA, while expression in ventral condensations were less affected. This is similar to the anterior craniofacial development of <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse embryos wherein severe hypoplasia is seen in the proximal (dorsal) mandibular arch and maxillary mesenchyme, while the more distal (ventral) mandibular arch regions are less affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Furthermore, a shortened, hypoplastic ventral, first arch Mc element is the only remaining structure when Hh-responsiveness is specifically removed in all cranial precursors (CNCC) in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Collectively, this suggests that the dorsal jaw, dorsal jaw support and dorsal neurocranium are more sensitive to Hh-attenuation than the ventral jaw, a hypothesis that is supported by the suggestion that dorsal and ventral mandibular identities are controlled by specific sets of transcription factors and signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. This has been validated by the existence of a number of zebrafish jaw mutants where the dorsal and ventral structures within the first two arches are affected to differing degrees (<italic>chameleon, sucker, schmerle</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>].</p><p>Finally, our findings that Hh-signaling is required during gastrulation (4-10 hpf) for proper ventral jaw development is similar to previous findings that this time period is required for proper neurocranium development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, patterning of all anterior craniofacial structures (both dorsal and ventral) is likely controlled by the same Hh-signaling event that originates in the ventral brain primordium during gastrulation, as hypothesized by Eberhart et al., 2006. However, unlike dorsal neurocranium precursors that continue to require Hh-signaling for subsequent chondrogenesis up to 2 dpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we show that jaw precursors require a single Hh-signaling event during gastrulation for both patterning and chondrogenesis (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Importantly, this early Hh-signal also influences later gene expression in the oral ectoderm, such as <italic>pitx2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and <italic>shh </italic>itself (data not shown), which are good candidate genes for signals required by jaw precursors for CNCC chondrogenesis. However, more work will be required in order to determine the specific Hh-dependent signals for the proper development of both the neurocranium and jaw in the zebrafish.</p></sec><sec><title>Hh-signaling is required for patterning the jaw joint region in the mandibular and hyoid arch</title><p>Our studies here reveal multiple requirements for <italic>disp1 </italic>and Hh-signaling in the development of the jaw joint region.

The presence of these two phenotypes in the mutant hyoid arch cartilages likely reflects two separate requirements for Hh-signaling in CNCC and neighboring cells that reside within future joint sites; first, in CNCC chondrogenesis to promote cartilage formation (as described in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and secondly in joint organization within cells that will eventually chondrify (as described above).

However, our studies reveal that those cells residing in the posterior arches require Hh-signaling to undergo chondrogenic differentiation. This is not the case in the hyoid arch, however, wherein normal CNCC differentiation and subsequent chondrification occurs. Variations in the potential of PA2-7 CNCC to differentiate may be due to intrinsic differences in the ability of these cell groups to respond to Hh-signals, or Hh-dependent co-factor(s), in the facial primordia. CNCC-responsiveness to local facial patterning cues depends in part on their Hox gene expression, which is determined by the original location of these cells in the hindbrain. Moreover, Hox status differs between CNCC in the second arch (<italic>hoxa2</italic>) and the posterior arches (<italic>hoxa2/hoxb3</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. In chick embryos, grafts of facial ectoderm or foregut endoderm, into the PA2 region has no influence on the fate of this arch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Rather, PA2 mesenchyme is thought to be influenced by the pharyngeal ectodermal margin, and <italic>shh </italic>from this tissue has been implicated (directly or indirectly) in hyoid outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>].</p><p>The absence of cartilage elements in the posterior arches of 96 hpf <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant larvae is not due to changes in cell survival or proliferation as we were unable to find any variation in cell death or cell proliferation in the craniofacial region between <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants and their wild type siblings. This is consistent with zebrafish studies utilizing both <italic>smu/smo </italic>mutants and Shha;Shhb double morphant embryos, which lack dorsal cartilages yet display no changes in cell death or proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Rather, we found that Hh-signaling is involved in maintaining the chondrogenic differentiation potential of posterior arch mesenchyme. Specifically, critical transcription factors, <italic>sox9a </italic>and <italic>dlx2a</italic>, become down-regulated in these cells during the second day of development. Notably, other critical transcription factors such as <italic>hand2, barx1, msxb, msxe </italic>were not downregulated in these cells indicating that these cells persist in the posterior arches in a differentiated state that still resembles their neural crest origin.</p><p>Genetic analysis on the <italic>sox9a/jellyfish </italic>(<italic>jef</italic>) mutant has revealed a critical function for this gene in cartilage development within the posterior arches, potentially by influencing normal <italic>col2a1 </italic>expression in a similar fashion to the <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The critical importance of <italic>sox9a </italic>in directing PA3-7 prechondrogenic condensations to develop as chondrocytes is underscored by the findings that other chondrogenic factors, like <italic>runx2b</italic>, are expressed at normal levels in the <italic>sox9a/jef </italic>and <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants alike [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and our studies].</p><p>So what then happens to the mesenchyme within the posterior arches of <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants? Our histological sections on 5 dpf <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants suggest that CNCC in PA3-7 give rise to fibrous connective tissue, a common derivative of pluripotent mesenchymal neural crest cells. We hypothesize that these ectopic fibrous-connective tissue cells are of CNC origin and have committed to a mesenchymal lineage, instead of a neural one, independently of Hh-signaling. These cells then require the Hh-pathway to adopt, or maintain, a chondrogenic fate. Consistent with this, exogenous Shh can induce multipotent CNCC and pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells to adopt a chondrogenic fate <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. Examining later skeletal development in the <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant pharyngeal arches is frustrated by early embryonic death by 6-7 dpf in these animals.</p><p>Our stage-specific Hh-signaling inhibition studies revealed that the critical time for Hh-signaling to maintain chondrogenic differentiation in posterior arch-residing CNCC is the late pharyngula stage (32-48 hpf). At this time, <italic>shh </italic>and <italic>disp1 </italic>are coexpressed in facial ectoderm and endoderm, as well as the ventral brain, making it difficult to interpret the crucial Hh-source for posterior arch cartilage formation. An intriguing tissue source of <italic>shh </italic>in this process is the pharyngeal endoderm. In <italic>casanova </italic>mutants, which fail to make endoderm, all PA-derived cartilages are lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Further, surgical removal of foregut endoderm in chick embryo prior to CNCC migration results in a loss of ventral arch structures, yet arch identity is restored when Shh-soaked heparin beads are placed in the region of the excised tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. More studies will be required to determine the cell autonomy of Hh-ligands in posterior arch cartilage formation, as well as whether the signal must be interpreted by mesenchymal-neural crest and/or the surrounding epithelia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conserved and non-conserved roles for Hh-signaling in PA development</title><p>Zebrafish PA skeletal defects in <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutants resemble loss-of-function mutations to Shh in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>] and treatments with Shh-blocking-antibodies in chick embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], indicating a conserved role for Hh-signaling in PA development. However, unlike in fish, the primary defect attributing to the loss of mouse and chick PA skeleton is a high degree of cell death in CNCC as they migrate into the pharyngeal pouches. Additionally in Shh<sup>-/- </sup>mouse, further cell death is seen in the pharyngeal pouch endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>], indicating a pro-survival role for Hh-signaling in epithelial and mesenchymal facial tissue.</p><p>Hh-signaling may mediate its pro-chondrogenic (zebrafish) or pro-survival (mouse, chick) effects within CNCC through its influence on <italic>Sox9 </italic>gene activity. We noticed a strong correlation between the loss of <italic>sox9a </italic>expression in <italic>con/disp1 </italic>CNCC and the failure of those same cells to chondrify. In Shh<sup>-/- </sup>mouse there is a striking pattern of <italic>Sox9 </italic>gene expression loss in streaming CNCC just prior to cell death within the same regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. Inverse experiments, where ectopic Shh was used to stimulate mouse or human chondrocytes revealed that increased levels of Shh and downstream target genes in chondrocytes correlated with higher levels of <italic>Sox9 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>]. In zebrafish, due to gene duplication there are two orthologs of Sox9, <italic>sox9a </italic>and <italic>sox9b</italic>, which are co-expressed in postmigratory-CNCC and they control chondrocyte morphogenesis and survival, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>]. These roles are likely controlled by the single tetrapod <italic>Sox9 </italic>in higher vertebrates and can account for the cell death seen in these animals upon gene loss, whereas we show here that, for the most part, <italic>sox9b </italic>(survival) gene expression is independent of Hh-signaling in CNCC within the PA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While it has been previously established that Hh-signaling is required for craniofacial development, the characterization of the <italic>con/disp1 </italic>mutant has been invaluable for helping us determine precisely the requirements of Hh-signaling in ventral arch development. In full, we found that Hh-signaling is required for jaw size and outgrowth, jaw joint formation and for chondrogenesis within the posterior gill arches. The Hh-pathway controls CNCC patterning and differentiation in jaw precursors, but simply differentiation in gill cartilage precursors. We showed that multiple Hh-signaling events are required and these events are temporally separated and partly unique from those previously described for the neurocranium skeleton.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AP: anterioposterior; bh: basihyal; cb: ceratobranchials; ch: ceratohyal; cl: cleithrum; CNCC: cranial neural crest cells; Cya: Cyclopamine; dpf: days post fertilization; Dispatched 1: Disp1; Hh: Hedgehog; HPE: Holoprosencephaly; hpf: hours post fertilization; hs: hyosymplectic; hy: hyomandibular element; m: prospective mouth/stomodeum; Mc: Meckel's cartilage; ML: mediolateral; ne: neuroectoderm; op: opercle; PA: pharyngeal arches; pq: palatoquadrate; ptp: ptyergoid process; oe: oral ectoderm; pe: pharyngeal endoderm; pem: posterior ectodermal margin; Shh: Sonic Hedgehog; Smo: Smoothened; sy: symplectic; tr: trabeculae.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TS participated in the design of the study, carried out all the experiments and drafted the manuscript.
