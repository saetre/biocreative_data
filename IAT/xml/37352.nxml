Gap junctions are thought to be essential for maintaining skeletal integrity and coordinating repair of osseous tissue by propagating intracellular signals generated in response to soluble factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or mechanical stimuli, such as cyclic stretch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Connexins are the structural subunits of gap junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and connexin 43 (Cx43) has been shown to mediate intercellular communication in osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study, we reported that BMP-2 or TGF-&#x003b2;1 markedly inhibited GJIC in the murine-derived MC3T3-E1 cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

In previous studies, we reported that BMP-2 or TGF-&#x003b2;1 treatment as well as multiple cell passages inhibited GJIC in these clonal osteoblast-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Since Cx43 has been shown to mediate cell-cell communication in human osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we hypothesized that Cx43 may be an important mediator of GJIC in murine-derived MC3T3-E1 cells.</p><p>Northern blot analysis revealed no detectable change in the steady state level of Cx43 mRNA expression after treatment with BMP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2;1. Western blot analysis showed that the addition of ALP to untreated control groups increased the density of the 43 kD protein, while decreasing the density of the 46 kD isoform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). This effect was blunted in the presence of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor (data not shown), strongly suggesting that the 43 kD and 46 kD bands represent the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Cx43, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. All samples were tested with and without ALP, as previously described, to confirm the phosphorylated isoform, represented by the 46 kD band. The addition of ALP increased the unphosphorylated form (43 kD band) as would be expected.</p><p>There was no significant change in the expression of total Cx43 protein. However, both BMP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 increased the density of the 43 kD protein compared to control at 24 h and 48 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.). These effects were accentuated with the addition of ALP. When expressed as a 43 kD: 46 kD band ratio, both BMP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 significantly increased the ratio of the unphosphorylated: phosphorylated forms of Cx43 at 24 h and 48 h, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.).</p><p>Immunofluorescence studies showed no observable difference in the localization of Cx43 after BMP-2 or TGF-&#x003b2;1 treatment. Cells treated with TGF-&#x003b2;1 developed an elongated, spindle shape which was a phenomenon reported in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Since immunofluorescence studies may have lacked the sensitivity to distinguish minor changes in Cx43 redistribution, cell protein fractionation based on detergent solubility was performed. Immunoprecipitation of the cytosolic and membrane-bound protein fractions also showed no significant change in the distribution of Cx43 protein between the cytosol and plasma membrane. Both of these assays suggest there is no significant alteration in the distribution of Cx43 associated with BMP-2 or TGF-&#x003b2;1 treatment.</p><p>The phosphorylation of Cx43 has been implicated in gap junction assembly and gating events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Musil and Goodenough previously reported that communication-deficient cells demonstrated no detectable amounts of the Cx43-P<sub>2</sub> isoform (biphosphorylated Cx43) while cells with low gap junctional permeability had detectable amounts of the Cx43-P<sub>1</sub> isoform (monophosphorylated Cx43). They speculated that Cx43 phosphorylation correlated positively with cell coupling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our study also suggests that a decrease in the phosphorylated form of Cx43 (or conversely, an increase in ratio of unphosphorylated: phosphorylated Cx43 forms) may be associated with GJIC inhibition after BMP-2 or TGF-&#x003b2;1 treatment. It is unclear whether phosphorylation of Cx43 is inhibited or dephosphorylation of Cx43-P<sub>2</sub> or Cx43-P<sub>1</sub> is enhanced. The specific signaling mechanism of BMP-2 or TGF-&#x003b2;1 action is not yet defined and is currently under investigation.</p><p>GJIC is an important mechanism of cell-cell communication and has been shown to modulate gene expression in osteoblastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The regulatory signals that traverse gap junctions have yet to be defined and may consist of both stimulatory and inhibitory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. BMP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 have been shown to inhibit GJIC in MC3T3-E1 cells and their effects may be mediated by changes in the phosphorylation of Cx43. The identification of specific signaling pathways and regulatory actions of BMP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 in MC3T3-E1 cells will be important in understanding the role of intercellular communication in bone biology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>BMP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 do not alter expression of Cx43 at the mRNA or protein level.
