AAH and humbug are over expressed in a broad range of malignant neoplasms. We have previously reported that this locus contains two promoters, P1 and P2. While AAH and humbug are expressed in most tissues under the regulation of the P1 promoter, AAH, junctin and junctate are predominantly expressed in excitable tissues under the control of the P2 promoter.

To investigate the transcription mechanism we transiently transfected HeLa cells with sequentially deleted reporter constructs containing different regions of the -661/+81 P1 nucleotide sequence.

AAH catalyzes posttranslational hydroxylation of aspartate and asparagine residues in certain epidermal growth factor-like domains present in a number of proteins, such as receptors and receptor ligands, involved in cell growth and differentiation, and extracellular matrix molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. AAH, mediates cell motility and invasiveness, an effect which is of interest because of its role in placental implantation and "receptivity" of endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Humbug is a truncated homolog of AAH that lacks a catalytic domain. Overexpression of humbug increases intracellular calcium levels by promoting its release from intracellular stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The levels of humbug immunoreactivity are directly associated with colon cancer tumor grade and inversely associated with patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. AAH and/or humbug are over expressed in infiltrative intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, metastasized lung, breast, colon, hepatocellular carcinomas, and malignant neuroectodermal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These proteins can contribute to the malignant phenotype by increasing motility and enhancing proliferation, survival, and cell cycle progression. Inhibition of AAH and humbug expression could represent an attractive approach for gene therapy of infiltrating tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Junctate is an integral calcium binding protein of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum membrane, which forms a supramolecular complex with the inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor and modulates calcium entry through receptor- and store-activated channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Our group previously reported the identification of two promoter sequences, present within the human A&#x003b2;H-J-J locus (named P1 and P2), that are expected to regulate the transcription of this locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The generated primary transcripts undergo alternative splicing and direct the synthesis of AAH, humbug, junctin, and junctate. We have previously reported the characterization of the P2 promoter, demonstrating that the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) transcription factor binds to this promoter sequence and drives tissue-specific expression, being responsible of inducing transcription during muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In additon, we have recently reported the role of Sp factors in upregulating the P1-directed transcription of the A&#x003b2;H-J-J locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This was the first study about the role of the P1 promoter.</p><p>In the present study we focused our attention on the role of another putative regulating sequence, namely an E-box, which is located in the region of the P1 promoter and is required for high-level of transcription.</p><p>To characterize the expression directed by the P1 promoter, we have analysed the corresponding mRNAs in different cell lines. Furthermore, transfections of HeLa cells with progressively deleted reporter constructs of the -661/+81 P1 promoter region were performed and the transcription activity of each fragment was characterized.

In this experiment cDNA derived from MCF7, Colo 38, Hek293, HepG2, HeLa, RD and MDA human cell lines were employed. The results obtained indicate that the P1 promoter directs transcription in all the cell lines analysed and is more active in HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, column e).

An additional comparison was done with the pGL3-basic reporter vector. The results represented in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> demonstrate that: i) the -661/+81 promoter region exhibits high reporter gene expression in HeLa cells; ii) luciferase activity is higher with the reporter construct lacking the -634/-512 sequence, suggesting the presence in this region of cis-acting elements inhibiting transcription; iii) the expression of the reporter gradually decreases when the sequence from -512 to -160 is progressively removed. These results clearly demonstrate that the maximal luciferase activity is dependent on the -512/+81 sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref> construct), indicating the presence within this region of positive regulatory elements, responsible for the maximum level of transcription activity. In order to identify putative binding sites for transcription factors, computer-assisted analysis of the sequences was performed. The -512/+1 region displays sequence homology to the following transcription factor binding sites: USF1 (98%, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), AP-1 (88%), GATA-1/3 (90&#x02013;85%), NF-E2 (91%) and Sp1 (98&#x02013;81%).

We isolated and identified the 5'-flanking region of the exon 1 of this locus. The cloned nucleotide sequence allowed us to characterize the P1 promoter region, which is involved in the regulation of AAH and humbug expression. We have been able to identify transcripts relative to P1 promoter activity in all tissues and cell lines analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similar to many housekeeping gene promoters, the region under investigation lacks a TATA box and an initiator element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, this sequence is GC-rich and presents homologies with Sp1 consensus binding site, which we previously demonstrated to play a role in transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Transfection experiments with progressively deleted P1 promoter reporter constructs in HeLa cells showed that maximal promoter activity is located within 512 nucleotides from the principal transcription initiation site (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), a result which confirms our previous data in HepG2 and RD cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Computer-assisted analysis of the -512/+1 region indicates the presence of sequence homologies to binding sites for USF1, Sp1 and for other transcription factors. EMSA analyses demonstrated no binding activity for these identified elements with the exception of USF1 and Sp1 sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present study we analyzed the DNA binding activity and function of USF transcription factors on P1 promoter.</p><p>The first conclusion of this manuscript derives from EMSA assays, supershift analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which coherently demonstrated that USF1 and USF2 factors bind to the P1/USF site of the P1 promoter, both in vitro (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and in intact cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>The second conclusion is the demonstration that these interactions are functionally relevant for transcription efficiency. The relevance of the USF binding for the transcription regulation of the P1 promoter has been addressed by two complementary approaches: (a) mutagenesis of the P1/USF element and (b) use of a USF1 silencing approach.</p><p>The results obtained concurrently demonstrate that USF transcription factors and USF1 binding site are involved in the up-regulation of the P1 promoter of the human A&#x003b2;H-J-J gene locus. On the other hand, mutagenesis experiments point out that the residual transcription activity of the double mutant is compatible with the presence of other transcription factors participating in the regulation of the P1 promoter. This is in agreement with previously published results from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] demonstrating the presence of at least 12 Sp binding sites and Sp1/3 dependent transcription activity of P1 promoter. In addition, it is in agreement with the experiments on progressively deleted reporter constructs indicating that the decrease of transcription associated with the -512/-389 deletion is higher (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, &#x02013; 42%) than that of the single mutant -512 <italic>P1/USFmut </italic>construct with respect to the wild type plasmid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, &#x02013; 21%).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it appears that both Sp and USF DNA interactions and transcription activities are involved in the regulation of this human locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Comparison of the P1 and P2 promoter sequences of the A&#x003b2;H-J-J locus reveals important differences are clearly detectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The most interesting result emerging from studies focused on the P2 promoter is that the calcium-dependent transcriptional factor MEF-2 activates the transcription of junctin, junctate and A&#x003b2;H in striated muscles and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Neither Sp1 nor USF binding sites were detected within the P2 promoter. On the other hand, P1 promoter, which drives the expression of AAH and humbug in most tissues, contains one USF1 and several Sp1 functionally active binding sites within the sequence having maximal transcription activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The finding that the sequences present in the upstream P1 promoter are significantly different from those of the P2 promoter is, in our opinion, of great interest.</p><p>From the practical point of view, the impact of USF proteins in the transcriptional regulation of this locus will be of future interest considering the potential contribution of AAH and humbug to the infiltrating growth of neoplasms by increasing cell migration and enhancing proliferation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. For instance, overexpression of humbug and AAH is associated with malignant progression in human gastric cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

A negative control scrambled siRNA, which had no significant homology to human gene and transcript sequences, was designed to detect any non specific effects.</p><p>After cloning and sequence characterization, 500 ng of plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000 (Invitrogen), and, after 8 hours, 20 ng/ml of doxycycline were added. Fourty-eight hours later RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed. To quantitate the depletion of USF1 and A&#x003b2;H-J-J P1 directed transcripts, 1/20 &#x003bc;l aliquots of cDNA and 10 pmol of the primers reported in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> were used for each Sybr Green real-time PCR reaction. Resuls were normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) expression levels (housekeeping genes). Real-time PCR reactions were performed for a total of 40 cycles (95&#x000b0;C for 10 s, 66&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 50 s). The &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method was used to compare gene expression data.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the data were normally distributed and presented as mean &#x000b1; S.D. Statistical differences between groups were compared using one-way ANOVA (ANalyses Of VAriance between groups) software. Statistical significance was assumed at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AAH: aspartyl (asparaginyl) &#x003b2;-hydroxylase; PCR(s): polymerase chain reaction(s); bp: base pair(s); MEF-2: myocyte enhancer factor 2; USF: Upstream Stimulatory Factor; Sp: specific transcription factor; EMSA: electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP: chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA: short interference RNA; shRNA: short hairpin RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AF planned and performed all the experiments and participated in the design and writing of the manuscript.
