Allergic asthma is characterized by persistent airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). From several clinical and experimental investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), antigen-specific memory T cells, especially CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, were shown to play an integral role in orchestrating the disease process through the secretion of a variety of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which induce the development of AHR and eosinophilic inflammation. It has also been reported that the transfer of Th2-type cells in mice induces airway eosinophilia and AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>In addition, there is now increasing evidence for the role of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in these responses as well. Increased numbers of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have been shown in the lungs of asthmatic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and in animal models of allergic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). We demonstrated that allergen-primed CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were essential for the full development of AHR and airway inflammation through IL-13 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Subsequently, we also reported that in vitro&#x02013;generated allergen-specific effector memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T (T<sub>EFF</sub>) cells contributed to these responses in the challenge phase through their migration into lung tissue and local production of IL-13 in sensitized and challenged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). We recently demonstrated the critical role of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the sensitization phase for the development of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated AHR and airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). There are numerous articles addressing the molecules that regulate effector functions or activation of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>The Notch signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in cell fate decisions in all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In mammals, there are four identified Notch receptors (Notch1&#x02013;4) and five ligands of the Delta-like families (Delta1, Delta3, and Delta4) and Jagged families (Jagged1 and Jagged2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Notch receptors and their ligands are also expressed on the surface of mature lymphocytes and APCs. Notch proteins are transcriptional activators expressed first as transmembrane heterodimeric surface receptors. After ligation, Notch undergoes proteolytic processing, including a final cleavage by &#x003b3;-secretase to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and binds to CSL/RBP-J transcription factor, converting it from a repressor to an activator of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Several target genes of Notch, including Hes1, Hes5, and pT have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) can effectively prevent the enzymatic cleavage of the cytoplasmic domain of Notch receptors, thereby inhibiting the downstream signaling events triggered by activation of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>Recently, studies have implicated Notch in activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) of cells of the peripheral immune system. The role of Notch signaling, especially in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, and its involvement in allergen-induced AHR and airway inflammation have not been defined. In this study, we demonstrated Notch1 expression on CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells and that inhibition of Notch signaling using GSI reversed their effects on development of AHR and airway inflammation, in part due to the up-regulation of IFN-&#x003b3; production. Further, we showed that Delta1, a Notch ligand, is an effective inhibitor of allergen-induced AHR.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Notch1 is expressed in T<sub>EFF</sub> cells but not central memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells</title><p>We previously showed that the development of AHR and eosinophilic inflammation in CD8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was lower than in WT mice but could be fully restored after transfer of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from antigen-primed donors or after transfer of in vitro&#x02013;generated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells but not CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Reconstitution of heightened airway responsiveness by T<sub>EFF</sub> cells was paralleled by restoration of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and tissue eosinophilia, BAL IL-13 levels, and goblet cell metaplasia. To determine if there were differences in gene expression between T<sub>EFF</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cells, microarray analysis was performed (the microarray data have been deposited in the GEO database under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="GSM8632">GSM8632</ext-link>). In the analysis of T<sub>EFF</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cell total RNA, an up-regulation of Notch1 was detected in T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, which was &#x0003e;1,000-fold higher than in T<sub>CM</sub> cells (P &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, the expression of Notch2 and Notch3 was only minimally higher in T<sub>EFF</sub> cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Notch receptor expression and signaling in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells.</bold> (A) Relative gene expression of Notch family members in T<sub>EFF</sub> versus T<sub>CM</sub> cells.

To effectively maintain GSI interference in transferred cells, we used a secondary challenge protocol in which the analysis of AHR was completed within 48 h of a single provocative secondary allergen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>) and transfer of GSI-transferred CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Notch1 signaling is activated in T<sub>EFF</sub> cells after engagement of the TCR</title><p>To confirm Notch1 signaling in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, we examined Notch1 protein cleavage. Engagement of Notch by any of its ligands results in proteolytic cleavage at an intracellular site between glycine 1743 and valine 1744. This cleavage event, which results in the liberation of NICD, is dependent on the enzymatic activity of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex that contains presenilins and nicastrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells isolated from the lymph nodes or spleens of OT-1 mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 or SIINFEKL peptide in the presence of DMSO (vehicle) or 20 &#x003bc;M GSI for 24 h. The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for the cleaved form of Notch1 using a cleavage-specific antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Cleaved Notch1 was detected in T<sub>EFF</sub> cells cultured with either anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 or SIINFEKL. Treatment with GSI dramatically reduced the levels of cleaved Notch1 protein after TCR or antigen-specific activation. Examination of cell proliferation and cell survival showed no effect of GSI treatment on these parameters (unpublished data). These data demonstrate that Notch1 signaling can be inhibited pharmacologically in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells activated through the TCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of transfer of GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells on allergen-induced AHR and airway inflammation in WT mice</title><p>To assess the effects of the Notch signaling pathway on the enhancement of the functional activity of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells in vivo, GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells or DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells were transferred into sensitized and challenged recipient WT mice before secondary OVA challenge. Secondary challenge of sensitized and challenged mice led to the development of increased AHR in WT mice, illustrated by significant increases in lung resistance (RL) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), as described previously in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> also illustrates the changes in RL in WT recipients of GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells or DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells undergoing secondary challenge. AHR to methacholine (MCh) was significantly increased in recipients of DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, but recipients of GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells failed to increase AHR over that seen in WT mice not receiving T<sub>EFF</sub> cells. Indeed, transfer of DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells significantly increased AHR, whereas transfer of GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells inhibited the response to a modest degree. In parallel to the assessment of lung function, the inflammatory cell composition of BAL fluid was examined (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Eosinophil numbers in BAL fluid were significantly increased in the DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cell recipient mice, whereas GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cell recipient mice did not show such increases. In contrast, neutrophil numbers were increased in GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cell recipients. Transfer of either DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells or GSF T<sub>EFF</sub> cells increased lymphocyte numbers in BAL fluid compared with WT control mice after secondary allergen challenge.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Transfer of GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells fails to enhance lung allergic responses in WT recipients.</bold> Sensitized and challenged WT mice received GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> or DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells before secondary challenge (OVA/OVA/OVA).

The signal induced by ligand binding is conveyed intracellularly by a process involving proteolytic cleavage of the receptor and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of the Notch family protein. The GSIs prevent the generation of the NICD and suppress Notch activity. In the immune system, several studies have implicated Notch signaling in hematopoiesis, T&#x02013;B lineage commitment, and thymic T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Notch gene expression is induced and Notch1 is activated after CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell activation, possibly through a &#x0201c;positive feedback loop&#x0201d; in adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Studies have also suggested that Notch may influence both Th1 and Th2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to several reports that analyzed the relationship between CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and Notch in the peripheral immune system, there is a paucity of information regarding a role for Notch signaling in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Several studies have suggested that the activation of Notch suppresses CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). On the other hand, Palaga et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) reported that the number of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was significantly reduced by inhibition of Notch signaling, indicating that the activation of Notch may be required for CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell function.</p><p>There is now increasing evidence that in addition to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells contribute to the development of allergic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). In the development of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated AHR and eosinophilic inflammation, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells play an essential role in the sensitization phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We previously showed that CD8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop lower levels of AHR and eosinophilic inflammation compared with WT mice, and these responses can be restored by transfer of in vivo&#x02013;activated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from antigen-primed donors or by transfer of in vitro&#x02013;generated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, but not CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> cells, before challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Recently, we showed that T<sub>EFF</sub> cells up-regulate BLT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), the high affinity receptor for LTB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), and BLT1 plays a critical role in the recruitment of T<sub>EFF</sub> cells into allergen-challenged lungs resulting in AHR and airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used transcript expression profile analysis to define gene differences between T<sub>EFF</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cells. In light of the findings that Notch1 expression was much higher in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> than T<sub>CM</sub> cells, we investigated the role of this signaling molecule in CD8-mediated allergic airway responses. We first demonstrated that Notch can signal T<sub>EFF</sub> cells and determined the role of this signaling pathway using a pharmacological approach. We showed that after incubation of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 or the addition of SIINFEKL, cleaved Notch1 could be detected confirming Notch signaling, and incubation of T<sub>EFF</sub> cells with the GSI prevented this cleavage in vitro.</p><p>These observations were extended to assess the effects of preventing Notch cleavage in vivo. To effectively maintain GSI interference, we used a secondary challenge protocol in which the analysis of AHR was completed within 48 h of transfer of GSI-treated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In sensitized and challenged WT recipients, secondary challenge elicited AHR and airway inflammation. Transfer of DMSO (control)-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells led to further increases in AHR, airway eosinophilia, and BAL IL-4 and IL-13 levels. In contrast, transfer of GSI-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells failed to enhance the responses over those seen in WT mice. Notably, levels of BAL IFN-&#x003b3; were markedly increased in these recipients as were the levels of expression of T-bet with a decrease in GATA-3 expression. These results were not attributable to differences in the ability of GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells to accumulate in the lung, as the numbers of GSI- and DMSO-treated cells in the lung were the same. The failure of GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells to enhance AHR or eosinophilic airway inflammation could be attributed to the increases in IFN-&#x003b3; production. We previously demonstrated that IFN-&#x003b3; has the potential to inhibit AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>) and that intranasal administration of IFN-&#x003b3; effectively inhibited goblet cell metaplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Additionally, IFN-&#x003b3; has been shown to inhibit airway smooth muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>) and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>).</p><p>Differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells is tightly cross-regulated so that development of one subset is inhibited by cytokines produced by the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) plays a central role in Th1 development by activating Th1 genetic programs, IFN-&#x003b3; production, and repressing Th2 cytokine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). In contrast, GATA-3 serves as a Th2 cytokine-specific transcription factor selectively expressed in Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>) and leads to inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). In the secondary challenge model, transfer of GSI-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells shifted the balance with modest increases and decreases in T-bet and GATA-3, respectively, accompanied by failure to enhance lung allergic responses. However, the balance was not shifted to the extent that the transfer of GSI-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells prevented sensitized and challenged host cells from contributing to the lung allergic responses.</p><p>A similar pattern was seen in CD8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients where transfer of GSI-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, unlike DMSO-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, failed to reconstitute AHR, airway eosinophilia, or BAL IL-13 levels. As in WT recipients, transfer of GSI-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells resulted in increased IFN-&#x003b3; levels in BAL. In vitro, incubation of GSI-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 or SIINFEKL did lead to decreased expression of Notch1 mRNA (unpublished data), in keeping with the reduced levels of Notch1 cleavage protein determined by Western blotting. In parallel, activation through the TCR of the GSI-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells led to increases in the expression of Delta1 mRNA. However, these changes were only seen when GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells were co-cultured with CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells during the activation period, but not when the GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells were cultured alone (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072200/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072200/DC1</ext-link>). After GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cell transfer and recovery from the lungs of secondary challenged CD8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we noted a marked up-regulation of Delta1 mRNA compared with recovered DMSO-treated T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, with little or no difference between the two in levels of Jagged1 or Jagged2 mRNA.</p><p>Notch&#x02013;Notch ligand interactions govern cell fate decisions in T cells. Notch signaling can direct Th2 differentiation via GATA-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). In vertebrates, Notch can bind to two different families of ligands, Delta-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) and Jagged1 and Jagged2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Stimulation of naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with Delta1 involving interactions with Notch3 promotes the differentiation toward the Th1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), whereas Jagged1-mediated Notch1 activation is critical in driving Th2 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). As a rule, the ligands tend to be expressed in a more highly restricted pattern than their receptors.</p><p>These effects of GSI on CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells decreasing Notch1 expression, reducing Notch1 cleavage, and increasing T-bet and Delta1 expression, and the associated inhibition of enhancement or failure to restore lung allergic responses together with increased IFN-&#x003b3; production, indicated that Notch&#x02013;Delta1 pathways were critical regulators of AHR and Th2 lung allergic responses. The GSI reduced the amount of Notch signaling to potentially mimic a Notch1 loss of function phenotype. It appears that activated T cells, and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in particular, pretreated with GSI produce little IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). We analyzed IFN-&#x003b3; secretion in TCR-activated GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells and found production to be significantly decreased compared with similarly treated DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072200/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072200/DC1</ext-link>). After transfer, the majority of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing cells were localized to the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subset. The data imply that the increase in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells resulted from the changes in Notch signaling ligands expressed on the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, i.e., up-regulation of Delta1 on GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells interacting with Notch receptors on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. The total numbers of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in BAL fluid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) and lung (Fig. S1) were the same in recipients of GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells and DMSO-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells. However, only after the interactions mediated through Notch receptors and Notch ligands on GSI-T<sub>EFF</sub> cells was attenuation of CD8-mediated AHR and inflammation observed and associated with increased numbers of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in secondary challenged mice. These data are consistent with reports that Delta1 interacts with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and enhances IFN-&#x003b3; production in antigen-stimulated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>To further extend these observations, we examined the consequences of administering a Delta1-Fc protein before secondary challenge. Administration of Delta1-Fc resulted in increased IFN-&#x003b3; production from CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and this was associated with a significant inhibition of the development of AHR, airway eosinophilia, and BAL IL-13 levels. At the same time, BAL IFN-&#x003b3; levels were increased. These results are similar to recent observations in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, where treatment with Delta1-Fc increased the number of Th1 cells in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). Control mice that received Delta1-Fc did not increase the number of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing lung CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, suggesting that in the absence of activation, the expression of Notch is not up-regulated and that interactions between Notch receptor and Delta1-Fc do not take place. In recipients of Delta1-Fc, we detected the highest numbers of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, accompanied by markedly reduced levels of IL-4 and IL-13 in secondary challenged mice (Fig. S3).</p><p>After adoptive transfer, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells in the lung exhibit a Th2 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Thus, the phenotype of predominant Th1-type cytokine-producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could be redirected toward Th2-type cytokine production in the lungs of sensitized and challenged mice, a plasticity previously emphasized in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). As a result of the inhibition of Notch signaling by GSI, Th2 cytokine production by these lung CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells was superseded by Notch receptor&#x02013;Notch ligand interactions and increased IFN-&#x003b3; production in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Collectively, these data identify a new pathway involved in the regulation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell interactions and the development of Th2-mediated allergic responses through Notch signaling. The pathway appears tightly regulated by the expression pattern of Notch receptor and the Delta1 Notch ligand, which are in turn dependent on the activation of T cells. The data reveal the therapeutic potential of Delta1-Fc in the regulation of allergen-induced AHR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>WT C57BL/6 and OT-1 mice (C57BL/6 strain) expressing a transgenic TCR that is specific for OVA<sub>257&#x02013;264</sub> (SIINFEKL) peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
