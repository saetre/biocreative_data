The comparison of <italic>NSM3</italic> DNA sequences between the suppressor and the wild-type version, cloned from the parental strain FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170, revealed a G to A transition that causes the replacement of amino acid serine (AGU) by an asparagine (AAU) at position 388. In experiments switching restriction fragments between the wild type and suppressor versions of the <italic>NSM3</italic> gene, the rescue of respiratory deficiency was demonstrated only when the substitution was present in the construct.

Production of these proteins is coordinated with the production of proteins from nuclear genes, which are required for mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c1">1</xref>). Although most protein components of the translational machinery are encoded in the nucleus, the mitochondrial genome encodes a complete set of the RNAs necessary for translation. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the mitochondrial genome encodes 24 tRNAs, the large and small subunits of rRNAs, the <italic>tsl</italic> (tRNA synthesis locus) RNA and the <italic>var1</italic> protein (a subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c3">3</xref>).</p><p>Several steps are involved in expression of mitochondrial tRNA genes: (i) transcription initiation to synthesize the primary RNA molecules; (ii) maturation of tRNAs by 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-processing enzymes, modification enzymes, and CCA terminal transferase; (iii) recognition of tRNAs by mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; and (iv) interaction of amino-acylated tRNAs with mitochondrial ribosomes and translational factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c3">3</xref>). Except the <italic>tsl</italic> RNA for the 5&#x02032;-processing of tRNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c4">4</xref>), the genes encoding the enzymes that catalyze these steps are located in nucleus. These enzymes are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and subsequently transported into the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in the yeast mitochondrial tRNA genes result in the loss of mitochondrial protein synthesis and a phenotype of respiratory deficiency that is unable to use glycerol as a carbon source. This type of mitochondrial mutant is designated as syn<sup>&#x02013;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c6">6</xref>). A number of yeast syn<sup>&#x02013;</sup> mutants have been characterized at the molecular level, and in most cases, a single base substitution in the tRNA genes has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c10">10</xref>). In most syn<sup>&#x02013;</sup> mutants, the mitochondrial genome is gradually lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c11">11</xref>). However, a syn<sup>&#x02013;</sup> mutant FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170 contains a stable mitochondrial genome. It has a single base substitution (C to T transition) at position 72 in the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> gene, resulting in two adjacent non-Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairings at the acceptor stem. This mutant has a decreased level of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and shows no detectable mitochondrial protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c12">12</xref>). To understand the structural features of the mutated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> that are responsible for the respiratory deficiency, revertants of this syn<sup>&#x02013;</sup> mutant were isolated, including four independent nuclear suppressors and three other types of revertants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c13">13</xref>).</p><p>The original mutation of the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> gene was located at the acceptor stem which was demonstrated to play a vital role in the recognition by cognate aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c19">19</xref>). Several suppression mechanisms are possible, i.e. the mutated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> is recognized by a mutated aspartyl-tRNA synthetase or by proteins involved in the processing of pre-tRNAs or translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c21">21</xref>). To distinguish between these possibilities, we characterized one of these suppressor strains, FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170-E22 (hereafter referred to as strain E22) which contains <italic>NSM3</italic> allele (<underline>n</underline>uclear <underline>s</underline>uppressor of a <underline>m</underline>itochondrial mutation). A genomic DNA library was constructed from strain E22 and transformed into yeast strain H95 containing the mutated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> gene to isolate recombinant plasmids that are able to suppress respiratory deficiency in strain H95. Here, we show that the <italic>NSM3</italic> allele is a mutated mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase gene and that a G to A transition, which results in an amino acid substitution, is responsible for respiratory rescue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and strains</title><p><italic>Plasmids.</italic> The shuttle vector YEp13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c22">22</xref>) was used to construct a genomic DNA library from the suppressor strain E22 (<italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1; <italic>ura1 ura2 NSM3</italic> rho<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><italic>syn</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c13">13</xref>).

Prior to its mating with FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170-a and segregation to obtain haploid cells, the ethidium bromide (50 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml) treatment was applied to strain &#x003b1;KAR to remove its mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c24">24</xref>).

The results showed that neither region was able to rescue the respiratory deficiency.</p><p>To identify the suppression mutation, the 3.5 kb of DNA surrounding the two <italic>Hin</italic>dIII sites in the chromosomal insert was sequenced. Among the six possible reading frames, only one was found to be significant, as indicated by an open box below the restriction enzyme map (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f1">1</xref>). The first AUG codon of the open reading frame is 228 nucleotides downstream of the <italic>Nco</italic>I site. The open reading frame ends 121&#x000a0;nucleotides upstream of the <italic>Cla</italic>I site. This open reading frame codes for a protein of 658 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f1">1</xref>).</p><p>The expression of this open reading frame was examined by northern blot hybridization and S1 nuclease protection experiments. A single transcript of &#x0223c;2000 nucleotides in length was detected (data not shown), slightly larger than the size of the open reading frame. The results of S1-nuclease protection experiments revealed three possible initiation sites at the 5&#x02032; end of the open reading frame (indicated by filled circles with vertical bars in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f1">1</xref>). The middle site is about five times stronger than the other two, suggesting that this may represent the major site for initiation of transcription, 251 bp upstream of the start codon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f1">1</xref>).</p><p>The deduced amino acid sequence was used to search for homology with known proteins. Except one amino acid difference at position 388, this protein is identical to the yeast mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) encoded by the <italic>MSD1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c35">35</xref>). At the nucleotide level, these two proteins have only one base difference, a G to A transition, 1160 bp downstream of the start codon.</p><p>To distinguish the base difference as the suppression mutation from DNA sequence polymorphism, the wild-type allele in this region was cloned from strain FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170 and its DNA sequence was determined, which was found to be identical to that of the <italic>MSD1</italic> gene. Thus, the G to A transition results in the substitution of asparagine (AAU) for a serine (AGU), (S388N).</p><p>To confirm that this G to A transition is the cause of the suppression, four chimeric YCp plasmids were constructed with the DNA fragments from either the wild-type or the suppressor version of the <italic>NSM3</italic> allele (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f3">3</xref>B). The base substitution, as indicated by an asterisk, is located between the <italic>Hin</italic>cII and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f3">3</xref>A). YCpGL852, carrying the entire suppressor DNA fragment, caused suppression and served as a positive control. YCpGL1104-1, substitution of wild-type <italic>Nco</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Hin</italic>cII and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII&#x02013;<italic>Bgl</italic>II fragments, did not affect suppression, but YCpGL901-4, substitution of the wild-type <italic>Hin</italic>cII&#x02013;<italic>Hin</italic>dIII fragment, eliminated suppression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f3">3</xref>C). Since the mutation encoding the Ser to Asn substitution is located in this fragment, we conclude that the S388N substitution is responsible for the suppression of the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> mutation.</p><p>Based on the structural information of AspRS from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>, the S388N mutation is located at the end of &#x003b1;-helix H7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c36">36</xref>). An amino acid sequence alignment among 21&#x000a0;sequenced AspRSs revealed that positively charged amino acids at the third position of the &#x003b1;-helix H7 are highly conserved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f4">4</xref>). An implication that the &#x003b1;-helix H7 contacts the tRNA molecule and the possible suppression mechanism are discussed below.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present work, we characterized the nuclear suppressor <italic>NSM3</italic> allele.

The <italic>NSM3</italic> allele contains a single amino acid substitution from serine to asparagine at position 388 in the mitochondrial AspRS, S388N, which is responsible for the suppression of the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> mutation in strain E22.</p><p>The original mutation of the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> gene in strain FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170 was a C to T transition at position 72 (C72T) in the acceptor stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c37">37</xref>), resulting in two consecutive non-Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairings and causing mitochondrial defect. Since a lower level of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> was observed in strain FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170, this mutation might affect the numerous post-transcriptional modifications. The results of both primer-extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments indicated that the 5&#x02032; end of the mutant tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> molecule is properly processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c38">38</xref>). The results of northern blot hybridization further revealed that the mutated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> appears to be the same size as that of the wild-type molecules. No accumulation of larger pre-tRNA molecules was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c38">38</xref>), in contrast to a mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> mutant in which the 3&#x02032; end processing is abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c39">39</xref>). These results suggested that a certain amount of mutated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> molecules are properly processed at both the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends.</p><p>The acceptor stem where the C72U mutation is located has been proven to play a critical role in recognition of tRNAs by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c41">41</xref>). AspRS is required for maintenance of the mitochondrial genome (this study), therefore, the stable mitochondrial genome in strain FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c12">12</xref>) suggested that the mutated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> was probably recognized by AspRS at a lower efficiency. This is consistent with the observation that the defective phenotype of strain FF1210-6C&#x0002f;170 was corrected by over-production of the mutated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c13">13</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial function in two temperature-sensitive mutants, caused by mutations at either mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> or tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>, was restored by over-expression of the mutated tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> or wild-type AspRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c21">21</xref>). In this work, one copy of a mutated version of the gene coding for mitochondrial AspRS per haploid cell was sufficient to recover the mitochondrial function. Thus, the respiratory rescue is not due to <italic>NSM3</italic> over-production.</p><p>Yeast mitochondrial AspRS is a member of class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, containing characteristic conserved motifs 1, 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c44">44</xref>). Built on these motifs is the active site, six antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheets surrounded by three &#x003b1;-helices, which promotes aminoacylation by activating and transferring amino acid onto the acceptor stem of tRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c46">46</xref>). A comparison of amino acid sequences among seven cloned AspRSs first revealed that enzymes from <italic>E.coli</italic>, <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria have an insertion sequence of about 100 amino acids located between motifs 2 and 3. This insertion sequence forms an extra domain in the crystal structure of <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> AspRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c36">36</xref>). This domain seems to be a characteristic of prokaryotic AspRSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c47">47</xref>). The function of the extra domain is unknown, however, it has been suggested that the extra domain modulates function of the active site by stabilizing the complex with tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c47">47</xref>). The extra domain of <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> AspRS is similar to <italic>E.coli</italic> ThrRS in its N-terminal domain from which two &#x003b1;-helices contact tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> in the ThrRS:tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c48">48</xref>). One helix, H7 in the extra domain, at a similar position as one of these two helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c36">36</xref>) implicates that the C-terminus of the helix H7 likely contacts the D arm and&#x0002f;or the acceptor stem of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>.</p><p>Based on the amino acid sequence alignment and the structure of <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> AspRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd279c36">36</xref>), the amino acid substitution in the <italic>NSM3</italic> allele, S388N, is mapped to the 13th position of the helix H7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd279f4">4</xref>). This is the first reported mutation in the extra domain, indicating a possible biological function of this domain. An alignment among 21 sequenced AspRSs revealed that the amino acid residue at the third position of H7 is highly conserved. The S388N mutation resides on the same side of H7 as this conserved residue, presumably facing tRNA toward the active site (see figure 5C in ref. 36). This amino acid substitution results in four consecutive asparagine residues at the C-terminus of the helix H7. Amino acid asparagine with a longer side chain than serine might push the acceptor stem of mutant tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> closer to the active site of AspRS, restoring aminoacylation of the mutated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and resulting in the respiratory rescue. The examination of the aminoacylation efficiency of mutant tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> by the mutant AspRS would be required to support this explanation. Either a crystal structure or molecular modeling of the mutant AspRS:mutant tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> complex should reveal the proposed contacts. In addition, a systemic analysis of mutations in the helix H7 in the presence or absence of mutations in the acceptor stem of tRNA would bring better insights into the interactions between the helix H7 of AspRS and tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd279f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Diagram of the 4.5-kb DNA fragment carrying the <italic>NSM3</italic> allele.
