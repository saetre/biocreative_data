Dysfunction of the receptor-ligand system contributes to many human malignancies. Consistent with such various tasks, the Egfr gene family has expanded during vertebrate evolution as a consequence of several rounds of whole genome duplication. Of particular interest is the effect of the fish-specific whole genome duplication (FSGD) on the ligand-receptor system, as it has supplied this largest group of vertebrates with additional opportunities for sub- and/or neofunctionalization in this signaling system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified the predicted components of the Egf receptor-ligand signaling system in teleost fishes (medaka, platyfish, stickleback, pufferfishes and zebrafish). We found two duplicated <italic>egfr </italic>genes, <italic>egfra </italic>and <italic>egfrb</italic>, in all available teleost genomes. Surprisingly only one copy for each of the seven Egfr ligands could be identified in most fishes, with zebrafish <italic>hbegf </italic>being the only exception. Special focus was put on medaka, for which we more closely investigated all Egf receptors and Egfr ligands. The different expression patterns of <italic>egfra</italic>, <italic>egfrb </italic>and their ligands in medaka tissues and embryo stages suggest differences in role and function. Preferential co-expression of different subsets of Egfr ligands corroborates the possible subfunctionalization and specialization of the two receptors in adult tissues. Bioinformatic analyses of the ligand-receptor interface between Egfr and its ligands show a very weak evolutionary conservation within this region. Using <italic>in vitro </italic>analyses of medaka Egfra, we could show that this receptor is only activated by medaka ligands, but not by human EGF. Altogether, our data suggest a lineage-specific Egfr/Egfr ligand co-evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data indicate that medaka Egfr signaling occurs via its two copies, Egfra and Egfrb, each of them being preferentially coexpressed with different subsets of Egfr ligands. This fish-specific occurrence of Egf receptor specialization offers unique opportunities to study the functions of different Egf receptor-ligand combinations and their biological outputs in vertebrates. Furthermore, our results strongly support the use of homologous ligands in future studies, as sufficient cross-specificity is very unlikely for this ligand/receptor system.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr, also named ErbB1 or HER in humans) has fundamental roles in mammalian development, where it regulates diverse processes such as eyelid opening, tooth growth, wound healing, hair follicle and mammary gland development. On the cellular level, it controls key functions including cell division, differentiation, survival, motility and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Thus, it is not surprising that many tumors are associated with EGF receptor overexpression, mutations or autocrine production of growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The use of animal models such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>has provided considerable advancement in understanding Egf receptor functions in development and physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In vertebrate model organisms, numerous studies have been conducted in the mouse, but in the common fish models - the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and the Japanese medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) - only few publications address Egfr function. In zebrafish, Egf receptor signaling was shown to regulate cardiovascular processes during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, it promotes oocyte maturation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Egf receptor signaling appears to be self-regulated by several of its ligands in the zebrafish ovarian follicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], as deduced from the usage of recombinant human (rh) EGF, rh-betacellulin (BTC) and rh-heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF). For the medaka, Egfr detection with a human antibody directed against the tyrosine kinase domain showed temporarily and spatially different expression patterns during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>It is generally accepted that in addition to the two whole genome duplication events that occurred early in the vertebrate lineage ("R1" and "R2 duplication"), a later third whole genome duplication event, the so-called FSGD (fish-specific genome duplication or R3) occurred within the actinopterygian (ray-finned) fish lineage approximately 320-350 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Most of the duplicated genes have been lost secondarily (nonfunctionalization). In many instances, however, gene duplicates from this event have persisted within fish genomes, for example when one of the duplicates acquired a new function (neofunctionalization) and/or when the ancestral gene functions have been distributed among the two gene copies (subfunctionalization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we carried out phylogenetic and synteny analyses for a detailed insight into the evolution of Egf receptors and their ligands in teleost fishes.</p><p>Importantly, all previous studies in fish (zebrafish, goldfish and trout) that included the application of Egf receptor ligands were performed using recombinant mammalian proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This implies that mammalian Egfr and Egfr ligands share high structural similarity and functional homology with their fish counterparts and that mammalian ligands consequently have the ability to interact with the fish Egfr binding domain to trigger its dimerization and activation. However, it is unclear whether heterologous application of ligands truly mimics the physiological situation. Therefore, we examined Egf receptor domains conservation between tetrapods and teleosts and investigated the domains involved in ligand binding. We particularly focused on medaka, monitored expression pattern profiles for the two copies of the Egf receptor and the seven Egf receptor ligands in the embryo and adult fish. Finally, we developed an <italic>in vitro </italic>system to verify the functionality of medaka Egf receptor ligands in terms of receptor activation. To our knowledge, this is the first work encompassing a functional analysis of the fish Egf receptor-ligands system in this evolutionary context.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses of teleost Egfr ligands</title><p>In mammals, seven ligands bind and activate Egfr, namely epidermal growth factor (Egf), transforming growth factor alpha (Tgfa), amphiregulin (Areg), betacellulin (Btc), epiregulin (Ereg), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (Hbegf) and epigen (Epgn).</p><p>Using BLASTn and tBLASTn searches, we thoroughly surveyed the teleost genome assemblies from medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>), green spotted pufferfish (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>), torafugu (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/">http://www.ensembl.org/</ext-link> - as well as a platyfish (<italic>Xiphophorus maculatus</italic>) EST sequence database (R. B. Walter et al., unpublished) for Egf receptors and Egf receptor ligands. While we could identify two gene copies for the Egf receptor in all teleost species investigated, surprisingly only one gene copy for each of the seven Egfr ligands was isolated except for zebrafish that possesses two gene copies of the <italic>hbegf </italic>gene. A recent study by Kassahn et al. in five teleost fishes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] also provided evidence that duplicated Egfr but not Egfr ligands genes have been retained after FSGD. Amino acid sequences alignments of the identified tetrapod and teleost Egf receptors and of the mature Egfr ligands are shown in [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Supplemental figure S1B] and [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>].</p><p>For a more detailed insight into Egfr ligand evolution, a phylogenetic analysis based on tetrapod and teleost Egfr ligand genes was performed. The mature part of the ligands containing the Egfr-interacting motif was found to be the only part sufficiently conserved among all species to allow a phylogenetic tree reconstruction. A maximum likelihood (ML) bootstrap consensus tree of the 138 bp nucleotide sequences encoding the mature part of the ligands is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. A ML tree based on the original data is shown in [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]. Due to the short alignment used for its reconstruction, the trees exhibit many collapsed or poorly supported nodes, respectively. Based on these and other trees obtained with different methods (not shown), the orthology between teleost and tetrapod genes is well supported only for <italic>Egf</italic>, <italic>Tgfa, Hbegf</italic>, and <italic>Ereg</italic>. Therefore, we also undertook micro- and macro-synteny conservation analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>]) in order to obtain further information about the relationship of the teleost ligands to their tetrapod counterparts.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogeny of Egfr ligand genes</bold>.

A further large-scale synteny conservation analysis using the Synteny Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] revealed that the <italic>egf</italic>-containing regions in <italic>D. rerio </italic>[Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S4A] and <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic>[Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S4B] are derived from the teleost protochromosome <italic>f </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Medaka <italic>egf </italic>has not been mapped to any chromosome yet and is found on ultracontig 115. Still it was found in the vicinity of the same genes that surround <italic>EGF </italic>in the human genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In addition, the phylogenetic grouping with characterized tetrapod and zebrafish <italic>egf </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and the gene's unique structure further validated it as true <italic>EGF </italic>ortholog. From the large-scale synteny analysis it can be inferred that medaka <italic>egf </italic>is most likely located on chromosomes Ola10 or Ola18 [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S4C].</p></sec><sec><title>The Tgfa ligand gene</title><p><italic>Tgfa </italic>displayed no conserved synteny between tetrapods and teleosts (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S5]). <italic>D. rerio </italic>and <italic>T. nigroviridis </italic><italic>tgfa </italic>are located on chromosomes Dre6 and Tni11 respectively, which possess only few orthologous genes that are located on <italic>TGFA </italic>containing human chromosome Hsa2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S5A and S5B]. Medaka <italic>tgfa </italic>(ultracontig 62) has not been mapped to a particular chromosome. The large-scale analysis shows that the <italic>TGFA </italic>region on Hsa2 is syntenic to several chromosomes in the three teleost genomes but not to the <italic>tgfa </italic>containing ones [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S5A to S5C]. This might be due to an interchromosomal translocation of the <italic>tgfa </italic>gene in the teleost ancestor. Nevertheless, the high bootstrap values of the teleost and tetrapod node (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), support the orthology of vertebrate <italic>Tgfa </italic>genes.</p></sec><sec><title>The Hbegf ligand gene</title><p>In the micro-synteny analysis, no conservation of synteny in <italic>Hbegf </italic>regions was found between tetrapods and teleosts. The gene order is only maintained within the group of tetrapods or teleosts independently (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). However, teleost <italic>hbegf </italic>genes are located on Dre14, Dre21, Tni1 and Ola10, which were reported previously to be syntenic to Hsa5 where the <italic>HBEGF </italic>gene is found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S6]. In addition, the phylogeny data also support the grouping of teleost <italic>hbegf </italic>with tetrapod <italic>Hbegf </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>The zebrafish is the only investigated teleost species that has two paralogs for <italic>hbegf</italic>. One copy, called <italic>hbegfa</italic>, is located on chromosome Dre14 (orthologous to Ola10 <italic>hbegf</italic>); the other, called <italic>hbegfb</italic>, is found on Dre21 (corresponding to Ola14). The macro-synteny analysis revealed that the region containing <italic>HBEGF </italic>on Hsa5 is highly syntenic to Dre14 and Dre21, Tni1 and Tni7, as well as Ola10 and Ola14 [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S6]. These chromosomes were previously shown to be derived from the teleost protochromosome <italic>g </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, the most-likely scenario is that <italic>hbegf </italic>gene was initially duplicated in the teleost ancestor during the FSGD event. While <italic>hbegfa </italic>and <italic>hbegfb </italic>were kept in zebrafish, only the <italic>hbegfa </italic>copy was maintained in medaka and pufferfish, and the <italic>hbegfb </italic>copy was lost. So far, the two zebrafish <italic>hbegf </italic>paralogs are the only known teleost Egfr ligand genes that were maintained in two copies after the fish specific genome duplication.</p></sec><sec><title>The Epgn-Ereg-Areg-Btc ligand gene cluster</title><p>An interesting feature of the Egfr ligands is the clustering of the four remaining ligand genes, namely <italic>Epgn</italic>, <italic>Ereg</italic>, <italic>Areg</italic>and <italic>Btc </italic>on human Hsa4 and mouse Mmu5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). This cluster was also found on all well-annotated mammalian genomes. In chicken, only <italic>Epgn</italic>, <italic>Ereg </italic>and <italic>Areg </italic>genes are part of a cluster on Gga4. Two exons of chicken <italic>Btc </italic>could be found on another segment of Gga4 but they were not defined well enough to conclude the presence of a full functional <italic>Btc </italic>on chromosome 4 in this species. Still, it is likely that birds also possess a functional <italic>Btc </italic>gene, since it was possible to identify a well defined <italic>Btc </italic>gene on chromosome 4 of the zebrafinch (<italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>) (data not shown).</p><p>The orthology of these tetrapod genes with their teleost counterparts could not be resolved from the phylogenetic tree as most of the nodes were unresolved or poorly supported. The only exception is the relatively well supported monophyly of vertebrate <italic>Ereg </italic>genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We note that a previous study by Stein and Staros [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] described similar problems with establishing the relationships of these genes among vertebrates using phylogenetic reconstructions only. Therefore, we relied here on conservation of synteny to clarify the orthology of the respective medaka genes.</p><p>In medaka three of the ligands are also present in a cluster on Ola9, namely <italic>epgn</italic>, <italic>ereg </italic>and <italic>areg </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The medaka <italic>btc </italic>gene is located on Ola12. In contrast to that, <italic>epgn </italic>was not found in pufferfishes and no <italic>ereg </italic>gene could be identified in zebrafish and pufferfish genomes. The zebrafish <italic>areg </italic>(Dre5) and <italic>epgn </italic>(Dre8) genes showed no conserved microsynteny with the medaka cluster (data not shown). However, there is conserved synteny between the teleost <italic>btc </italic>regions (Dre21, Tni4 and Ola12) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p><p>According to the macro-synteny analysis, Dre5, Dre8 and Dre21, Tni12 and Tni4, as well as Ola9 and Ola12 share numerous orthologous genes with the ligand cluster region on Hsa4 [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Supplemental figure S7]. These teleost chromosomes were previously reported to be derived from the teleost protochromosome <italic>i </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, it appears that the ligand cluster located on protochromosome <italic>i </italic>was duplicated during the FSGD. After the FSGD, one of the cluster copies, which is now present on Ola9, has lost <italic>btc</italic>. In the zebrafish lineage, it broke further apart, separating <italic>areg </italic>and <italic>ereg </italic>genes. The other cluster then lost all genes but <italic>btc </italic>now found on Ola12, Tni4 and Dre21, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Thereby, the single teleost <italic>epgn-ereg-areg </italic>and <italic>btc </italic>genes are located on paralogous rather than orthologous chromosomal segments. Thus, the absence of the complete cluster in teleosts is not the result of translocation of <italic>btc </italic>to a new chromosome, but is due to differential gene loss from initially two clusters after the FSGD. A similar phenomenon has been observed for example for the Parahox cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Evolution of the vertebrate Egfr ligand gene family by whole genome and other types of duplications</title><p>How did the Egfr ligand gene family in vertebrates evolve in the first place?

Dot plots of paralogous genes within the human genome revealed that the human EGFR ligand regions on Hsa2 (<italic>TGFA</italic>), Hsa4 (<italic>EGF </italic>and ligand gene cluster) and Hsa5 (<italic>HBEGF</italic>) are highly syntenic to each other as well as with Hsa10, which does not contain an EGFR ligand gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This pattern also became visible using a circle plot representation of human EGFR ligand regions: all four EGFR ligand gene regions share many paralogous connections with each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Furthermore, all regions are connected to Hsa10, while no other human chromosomes shares comparable numbers of paralogous connections with all four EGFR ligand regions.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Synteny and evolution of human EGFR ligand regions</bold>.

On Hsa4, several intrachromosomal paralogous connections (green lines) are found. C) Model of Egfr ligand gene family evolution in vertebrates. An ancestral gene on vertebrate protochromosome <italic>C </italic>was duplicated twice during the R1 and R2 whole genome duplications.

One of the two descendent genes became <italic>Egf</italic>, the other one was duplicated in tandem giving rise to the ligand cluster. The protochromosome nomenclature follows ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2148-10-27-3"/></fig><p>It has been previously hypothesized that parts of chromosomes Hsa2, Hsa4, Hsa5 and Hsa10 are derived from the vertebrate protochromosome <italic>C</italic>, which was then duplicated twice during the R1/R2 whole genome duplications giving rise to the gnathostome protochromosomes <italic>C0</italic>, <italic>C1</italic>, <italic>C2 </italic>and <italic>C3</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The chromosomal locations of Egfr ligand genes in the chicken and teleost genomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) are also compatible with being derived from vertebrate protochromosome <italic>C </italic>and its four gnathostome derivatives. Thus, we hypothesize that all Egfr ligand genes in the present vertebrate genomes can be traced back to a single pre-R1/R2 Egfr ligand gene. Importantly, this does not rule out the possibility that multiple Egfr ligand genes were present before the R1/R2 genome duplications. Our model rather suggests that only one gene gave rise to the diversity of Egfr ligand genes found in vertebrate genomes today. The situation in other chordates, which could help to resolve this issue, remains unclear as we did not find clear orthologs of the vertebrate Egfr ligand in the genomes of <italic>Ciona </italic>or amphioxus using BLAST and synteny analyses (data not shown).</p><p>According to our model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), the ancestral Egfr ligand gene was then duplicated twice during the R1/R2 genome duplications. The Egfr ligand gene located on gnathostome protochromosome <italic>C0</italic>, which later became part of Hsa10, was lost secondarily. Protochromosome <italic>C1</italic>gave rise to Hsa4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The Egfr ligand gene on this protochromosome was duplicated again onto the same chromosome. This might have been the duplication of a larger chromosomal block as several paralogous connections are found between the two EGFR ligand gene regions on Hsa4. One of the two genes then became <italic>Egf</italic>, while the other gene underwent several tandem duplications, thereby generating the EGFR ligand gene cluster. The fact that the <italic>egf </italic>and cluster genes are not found on the same chromosome in teleosts may be due to the fission of protochromosome <italic>C1 </italic>in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Our model suggests that an original cluster consisting of <italic>Epgn</italic>, <italic>Ereg</italic>, <italic>Areg</italic>and <italic>Btc </italic>dates back at least to a common bony vertebrate ancestor of fish and tetrapods. Unfortunately, the genome assemblies of elephant shark (cartilaginous vertebrates) and lamprey (jawless vertebrates) are still too fragmentary to get more insights into the timing of the Egfr ligand cluster establishment in vertebrates (data not shown). Since its establishment, the cluster linkage has then been kept in the tetrapod lineage but is absent in the teleost lineage due to the differential loss of gene duplicates after the FSGD (see above).</p><p>Protochromosomes <italic>C1 </italic>and <italic>C3</italic>, finally, became parts of Hsa5 and Hsa2 containing <italic>HBEGF </italic>and <italic>TGFA</italic>, respectively.</p><p>We note that other ligand genes with Egf domain, i.e. tomoregulins, neuregulins and others, may be related to the canonical seven Egfr ligands analyzed here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

Subdomains I and III are involved in the formation of high-affinity ligand binding pocket, subdomains II and IV are forming an intramolecular autoinhibitory tether in the absence of ligand.

Subdomain II, involved in receptor dimerization, is the most conserved part of the extracellular domain with 62 to 67% identity.

Our analyses reveal that many amino acids located in the ligand-binding pocket are not conserved among vertebrates, and some even replaced with residues that induce a radical amino acid substitution. A similar picture emerged when comparing the Egfr ligands, namely tetrapod and teleost Egf and Tgfa [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. In both cases, amino acids that directly interact with Egfr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] are not always conserved between species. Examples are the non-polar Met17 in mammalian Egf that is replaced by the small polar Asp in chicken and by the aromatic Phe in teleosts. Likewise, the aliphatic Ile19 in mammals is replaced by a smaller aliphatic Val residue in chicken and by the aromatic Phe or Tyr in teleosts. Another example is the positively charged Lys24 in human EGFR that is replaced by a small polar Ser in mouse, a small polar Asp in chicken, small non-polar Ala in medaka and small polar Ser in all other investigated teleosts and the mouse.</p><p>This lack of conservation suggests separate ways of receptor-ligand co-evolution in tetrapods and teleosts.

As the Egf receptor ligand binding pocket is not well conserved between tetrapods and teleosts, the use of heterologous ligand to activate fish Egfr may differ and could hamper or event prevent the biological output. To analyze on the one hand the functionality of medaka Egfr and on the other hand its possible cross-specificity with human EGF, we performed stimulation experiments using either recombinant human EGF or a donor cell line expressing medaka ligands to stimulate a receptor cell line which over-expressed medaka <italic>egfr</italic>.

Wild-type melan-a cells and melan-a Ola-<italic>egfra </italic>cells were then stimulated for 30 minutes with conditioned supernatants from the transfected 293-T cells and activation of receptor and downstream signaling pathways was assessed by Western blot analysis. As expected, melan-a WT cells did not display any activation of Egf receptor and its downstream signaling pathways in response to any of the conditioned supernatants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In contrast, melan-a Ola-<italic>egfra </italic>could be stimulated with Ola-Egf, Ola-Areg or Ola-Hbegf conditioned supernatants as demonstrated by anti phospho-Tyr (P-Tyr) staining of a protein with the size of medaka Egfra, that was only visible in cells expressing this receptor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Ola-Hbegf conditioned supernatant showed the strongest effect on receptor-, Akt- and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, whereas the response was much weaker with Ola-Egf and Ola-Areg conditioned supernatants. However, a clear receptor phosphorylation was always and repeatedly observed in independent experiments. An explanation for the weak activation of downstream pathways by medaka Egf and Areg may indicate a better reactivity of medaka Egfra with medaka Hbegf when compared to other ligands, corroborating the expression patterns in adult organs data where medaka <italic>egfra </italic>was found to be preferentially expressed together with <italic>hbegf</italic>. Differences in receptor- or Erk1/2 turnover in response to different stimuli or, alternatively, different ligand half-lives in solution are other possible explanations for the observed differences.</p><p>Altogether, whereas recombinant hEGF did not trigger any response, all three medaka ligands led to activation of medaka Egfra or downstream pathways, indicating receptor functionality.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A detailed examination of the medaka Egfr/Egfr ligand system, considering both functional and evolutionary aspects, revealed that the medaka genome contains two Egfr gene copies, namely <italic>egfra </italic>and <italic>egfrb</italic>, but only one copy of each of the seven Egfr ligand genes. Including conserved synteny data from various vertebrate genomes, we found that most likely all present vertebrate Egfr ligands date back to a single Egfr ligand gene, which gave rise to the Egfr ligand repertoire found in extant teleost genomes.</p><p>All investigated fish Egf receptor genes occur in two copies that have been maintained in the course of teleost evolution. This may be due to subfunctionalization and specialization of the two receptor proteins. This theory is supported by the differential expression of both genes in medaka embryo and adult tissues, together with the expression of a distinct subset of ligand genes.</p><p>Finally, we assessed medaka Egf, Areg and Hbegf functionality, demonstrating that all of them could trigger medaka Egfra receptor activation. This was not accomplished using human EGF. Consequently, we strongly support the use of homologous ligands as prerequisite in future functional biochemical studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Database surveys</title><p>All the species used in this study are listed in [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>: Supplemental table S2].

Given that Egfr signaling is observed in the CNS, a feature conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, we took medaka adult brain as a reference organ for the adult tissues. cDNA was prepared from total RNA from a pool of 6 adult fish brains, eyes, gills, hearts, ovaries, testes, spleens, kidneys, livers, skins, fins, muscles, as well as medaka stem cells line using the RevertAid kit with random hexamer primers (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada).
