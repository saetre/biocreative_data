These essential enzymes facilitate chromosome replication and RNA transcription by regulating chromosome supercoiling. High-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in <italic>E. coli</italic> requires the accumulation of multiple mutations, including those that alter target genes and genes regulating drug efflux. Previous studies have shown some drug-resistance mutations reduce bacterial fitness, leading to the selection of fitness-compensatory mutations. The impact of fluoroquinolone-resistance on bacterial fitness was analyzed in constructed isogenic strains carrying up to 5 resistance mutations. Some mutations significantly decreased bacterial fitness both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We identified low-fitness triple-mutants where the acquisition of a fourth resistance mutation significantly increased fitness <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> while at the same time dramatically decreasing drug susceptibility. The largest effect occurred with the addition of a <italic>parC</italic> mutation (Topoisomerase IV) to a low-fitness strain carrying resistance mutations in <italic>gyrA</italic> (DNA Gyrase) and <italic>marR</italic> (drug efflux regulation). Increased fitness was accompanied by a significant change in the level of <italic>gyrA</italic> promoter activity as measured in an assay of DNA supercoiling. In selection and competition experiments made in the absence of drug, <italic>parC</italic> mutants that improved fitness and reduced susceptibility were selected. These data suggest that natural selection for improved growth in bacteria with low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones could in some cases select for further reductions in drug susceptibility. Thus, increased resistance to fluoroquinolones could be selected even in the absence of further exposure to the drug.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The increasing frequency of human pathogens resistant to important classes of antibiotics poses a serious and growing challenge for medicine and society. We need improved strategies to reduce the rate of resistance development, for established and novel drugs, based on knowledge of the factors that drive the increase in resistance. Resistance to fluoroquinolones in most bacteria develops via a series of sequential genetic changes affecting several different genes. These are selected and enriched in bacterial populations by exposure to the drug. Relevant factors driving this increase include overuse, and inappropriate use, of these drugs. In this paper we show that mutant bacteria with low-level resistance (not itself a problem to treat with standard drug doses) can evolve by natural selection (for improved growth rate) to acquire mutations that dramatically increase their level of drug resistance. This means that we may need to consider how to reduce inappropriate drug use that can enrich for bacteria with low-levels of resistance, because at that stage some of the mutant bacteria in the population may continue to evolve higher level resistance even in the absence of any further drug exposure.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluoroquinolones are potent antibacterial drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Andriole1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> that bind to bacterial type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) when they are in complex with DNA.

Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones, or co-selection of resistant bacteria with the use of other antimicrobial drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Gould1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> may be factors driving the increase in resistance but these may not be the sole causes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Ferech1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, resistant isolates of <italic>E. coli</italic> increased from &#x0223c;7&#x02013;19&#x00025; between 2001 and 2007 in the UK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-EARSS1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, while outpatient fluoroquinolone use remained unchanged from 1997&#x02013;2003 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Ferech1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. To develop an effective strategy to restrict the increase in resistance frequency will require that we have a full understanding of the factors driving the increase. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether selection for improved fitness in bacteria might itself be a factor promoting increased resistance.</p><p>The fitness costs of drug resistance can be reduced by selection of low-cost mutations or by the accumulation of secondary fitness-compensating mutations that do not reduce resistance. During experimental evolution of clinical isolates of <italic>E. coli</italic> for decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones most lineages (16/18) suffered reduced growth competitiveness after only two or three selection steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-KompLindgren2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, lineages selected for further decreases in susceptibility were occasionally associated with a relative restoration of fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-KompLindgren2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar reversal was noted in some constructed strains of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> carrying one or two resistance mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Rozen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggested that some resistance mutations might be selected because they decrease susceptibility to the drug and simultaneously reduce the fitness costs associated with existing resistance mutations. No cause for the phenomenon has been demonstrated, and it's relevance to bacterial fitness <italic>in vivo</italic> in not clear. To examine the phenomenon we constructed isogenic strains carrying various combinations of five resistance mutations found commonly in fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical <italic>E. coli</italic>, and measured their drug-susceptibility and fitness. The relationships between the number of resistance mutations and bacterial fitness were complex and the addition of a resistance mutation was shown in some cases to improve bacterial fitness. These findings have implications for the evolution of fluoroquinolone resistance in the absence of antibiotic exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Resistance and fitness in clinical isolates: the paradox</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> urinary tract infection isolate C1186 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-KompLindgren1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> is highly-resistant to fluoroquinolones (MIC for ciprofloxacin &#x02265;32 &#x000b5;g/ml) and carries resistance mutations altering topoisomerases (<italic>gyrA</italic> Ser83&#x02192;Leu, Asp87&#x02192;Asn; <italic>parC</italic> Ser80&#x02192;Ile), and up-regulating drug efflux (<italic>marOR</italic> small deletion, and amino acid substitution; <italic>acrR</italic> IS1 insertion). These 5 mutations are typical of highly resistant clinical isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-KompLindgren1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. C1186 has a growth rate similar to a laboratory wild-type.

A third possibility is that some resistance mutations reduce existing fitness costs while simultaneously decreasing susceptibility to the drug. This last possibility is highly relevant to the multi-step nature of fluoroquinolone-resistance development. We constructed 28 isogenic derivatives of the wild-type MG1655, each mimicking in part the complex resistance genotype of C1186 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000541-t001">Table 1</xref>). Mutations were initially isolated spontaneously (<italic>gyrA</italic>, <italic>parC</italic>) or constructed by &#x003bb;-red recombineering (&#x00394;<italic>marR</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>acrR</italic>) and then separately introduced into MG1655 by P1 transduction. The <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>parC</italic> mutations were transduced by selection for a linked genetic marker (introduced using &#x003bb;-red recombineering, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and at least 20 transductants of each cross were subsequently screened by phenotype (MIC) and DNA sequencing for the linked mutation. In every case only two phenotypic and genotypic classes were found, showing that the <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>parC</italic> mutations were not associated with other mutations.</p><table-wrap

Interestingly, the addition of a fourth resistance mutation to these strains restricted the minimum fitness value to 0.66 per generation, higher than that measured with three mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000541-g001">Figure 1</xref>). When all five resistance mutations were present the fitness value was 0.68. Thus, some strains carrying 4 or 5 resistance mutations have a higher fitness than some strains carrying only 3 mutations.

Thus, fitness did not decrease as a simple function of the number of resistance mutations, but instead depended critically on the nature of those mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>For some strains an increased MIC correlates with improved fitness</title><p>In general the addition of a resistance mutation to a strain was either neutral with respect to MIC and fitness, or it caused an increased MIC and / or decreased fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000541-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000541-t001">Table 1</xref>). Across all the strains constructed decreased fitness was very strongly associated with the presence of one or both efflux mutations. In contrast, strain LM693 (<italic>gyrA</italic> S83L, D87N; <italic>parC</italic> S80I) has high level resistance (MIC 32) with no significant reduction in fitness relative to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000541-t001">Table 1</xref>). LM693 shows that it is possible to evolve high level resistance with no, or minimal, fitness costs. However, mutations up-regulating drug efflux are highly relevant to resistance evolution because they arise at a rate hundreds of times higher than mutations in the structural genes for topoisomerases. This is because the genetic target for knockout mutations in efflux regulating genes is much larger than the target for the specific amino acid substitutions required in topoisomerase genes. Thus, even though, as shown here, efflux mutations are fitness-costly and contribute relatively small increases in resistance, they occur very frequently, and are found in many resistant clinical isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-KompLindgren1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. For three low-fitness strains, each carrying three resistance mutations including a <italic>marR</italic> mutation, the addition of an extra resistance mutation increased both MIC and fitness: LM695&#x02192;LM707; LM882&#x02192;LM707; and LM871&#x02192;LM707 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000541-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000541-t001">Table 1</xref>). In these strains the added mutation affected <italic>gyrA</italic> or <italic>parC</italic>. The increased fitness was statistically significant (Students t-test, two-tailed, p&#x0003c;0.05) in two of the three cases, LM695&#x0003e;LM707 and LM882&#x02192;LM707 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000541-t002">Table 2</xref>). The robustness of these results was verified by independently reconstructing each of these strains and re-measuring their MIC and fitness values. No significant differences were found from the original values. In addition, we tested these critical strains by de-construction experiments: replacing <italic>gyrA</italic> and/or <italic>parC</italic> mutations with equivalent wild-type genes and determining that the MIC and fitness values of the de-constructed strains were as expected. Based on these two experiments, re-constuction, and de-construction, we are confident that the isogenic strains do not carry any additional mutations affecting MIC or fitness. Thus, the addition of a single resistance mutation can increase growth fitness by 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; per generation and simultaneously increase MIC more than 40-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000541-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="ppat-1000541-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000541.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Single mutations decrease drug susceptibility and increase fitness.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="ppat-1000541-t002-2" xlink:href="ppat.1000541.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>gyrA</italic>1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>gyrA</italic>2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>parC</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>marR</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MIC<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt107">b</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fitness (SD)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt108">c</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt109">d</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt110">e</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM695</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S83L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D87N</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.75</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.79 (0.03)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.0001</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM707</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S83L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D87N</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S80I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.89 (0.03)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM882</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D87N</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S80I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.75</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.84 (0.05)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.014</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM707</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S83L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D87N</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S80I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.89 (0.03)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM871</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S83L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S80I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.86 (0.03)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.05</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM707</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S83L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D87N</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S80I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.89 (0.03)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt106"><label>a</label><p>Genotype; All strains are isogenic to MG1655 and carry only the mutations shown.</p></fn><fn id="nt107"><label>b</label><p>MIC for ciprofloxacin (&#x000b5;g/ml).</p></fn><fn id="nt108"><label>c</label><p>Fitness; Mean fitness per generation (relative to wild-type).

Qsc was 2.9 (SD 0.7) for MG1655 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6), 2.6 (SD 0.7) for LM695 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12), and 3.6 (SD 1) for LM707 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;13). In this assay neither of the mutant strains differed significantly from the wild-type, but LM695 and LM707 differed significantly from each other (P value 0.01, Students t-test, two tailed). From the expression data it was clear that the major cause of this difference in Qsc between LM695 and LM707 was due to a 25&#x00025; decrease in expression from the <italic>gyrA</italic> promoter construct in LM707 relative to LM695. Thus the introduction of the <italic>parC</italic> S80I mutation to make strain LM707 caused a significant increase in the Qsc, coincident with the improvement in fitness. Although we cannot explain the absence of an effect in the chloroquine-agarose assay, the reporter gene assay suggests that some changes in chromosomal supercoiling associated with the acquisition of topoisomerase mutations may provide a mechanism linking bacterial fitness and decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. However, an alternative explanation is that the combination of mutations in LM707 reduces expression of <italic>gyrA</italic> by a mechanism that does not change global supercoiling levels, and that it is a consequence of the reduced expression of <italic>gyrA</italic> that causes the increase in growth fitness. Additional experiments will be required to distinguish between these models.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Selection of improved-fitness highly-resistant mutants</title><p>In the sections above it was shown that the transfer of the <italic>parC</italic> S80I mutation into LM695 increased its MIC for ciprofloxacin and its competitive growth fitness versus the wild-type. This predicted that the resulting constructed strain, LM707, should outcompete LM695 in a head-to-head competition, and also raised the following questions: (i) could a mutant with an increased MIC for ciprofloxacin and a higher growth fitness be selected spontaneously from LM695 in the absence of drug; and (ii) would such a mutant be exclusively associated with of the acquisition of the <italic>parC</italic> S80I mutation. These predictions and questions were addressed experimentally. First, in head-to-head growth competition experiments in LB medium with no drug, LM707 (four resistance mutations) outcompeted LM695 (three resistance mutations), gaining &#x0223c;8&#x00025; per generation, in good agreement with the relative differences in growth fitness of each strain versus the wild-type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000541-t001">Table 1</xref>). Second, 96 independent lineages of LM695 were grown in rich medium in the absence of drug for 4 growth cycles. Each growth cycle was inoculated with 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cfu and grown to a total of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> cfu (&#x0223c;7 generations per growth cycle) in a volume of 200 &#x000b5;L. An aliquot of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cfu from each lineage was tested, after the completion of 2, 3, and 4 cycles of growth, for the presence of resistant mutants on solid medium (3 &#x000b5;g/mL ciprofloxacin, 4&#x000d7;MIC). Growth of LM695 is completely inhibited on 3 &#x000b5;g/mL ciprofloxacin and the spontaneous mutation rate to resistance on this media, measured in fluctuation tests, is 2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>. Accordingly, we expected that virtually none of the 96 independent lineages would contain a resistant mutant at the initiation of the experiment, but that a small number of resistant mutants would arise in each lineage during each growth cycle. If these mutants out-competed the parental LM695 they would be expected to increase relative to LM695, and thus have a greater probability of being transferred to the next growth cycle. The number of lineages from which resistant mutants were obtained was found to increase with successive growth cycles: from 2/96 (cycle 2)&#x02192;8/96 (cycle 3)&#x02192;15/96 (cycle 4). Because the spontaneous mutation rate to resistance (2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>) if much lower than the number of cells being tested from each lineage (5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>) it is very unlikely that these mutants arose on the selective media. Instead, the most reasonable conclusion is that the resistant mutants arose spontaneously and randomly during the growth of lineages in the absence of drug and were enriched because they out-competed the parent population. Three random drug-resistant mutants were chosen from independent lineages and tested by DNA sequencing for the presence of mutations in <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, in <italic>parC</italic> and <italic>E</italic>, and in <italic>marR</italic> and <italic>acrR</italic>. In each case the mutations originally present in LM695 were confirmed and in addition each of the mutants was found to have acquired a new mutation in <italic>parC</italic> (S80R in two cases, and E84K in one case). The MIC CIP of each of the mutants had increased from 0.75 to &#x0003e;32 &#x000b5;g/mL, and the exponential doubling time in rich medium had increased significantly, by &#x0223c;10&#x00025; per generation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000541-t003">Table 3</xref>). Thus, the selection of a spontaneous <italic>parC</italic> mutation in LM695 decreased its susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and increased its growth rate. From these experiments we concluded that the phenotypes generated directly by strain construction (LM695&#x02192;LM707; reduced drug susceptibility and increased growth fitness) could also be generated by a variety of spontaneous mutations, and that the growth advantage phenotype could be enriched by growth selection in the absence of drug.</p><table-wrap id="ppat-1000541-t003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000541.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Selection of LM695 to faster growth and increased MIC.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="ppat-1000541-t003-3" xlink:href="ppat.1000541.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dt<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt111">a</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt112">b</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mutation<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt113">c</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MIC<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt114">d</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM695</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.0&#x000b1;0.7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.75</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM1179</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.8&#x000b1;1.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.0001</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>parC</italic> S80R</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;32</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM1198</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.8&#x000b1;0.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.0001</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>parC</italic> S80R</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;32</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LM1199</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.2&#x000b1;0.7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.0001</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>parC</italic> E84K</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;32</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt111"><label>a</label><p>Dt; doubling time in min in LB medium at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></fn><fn id="nt112"><label>b</label><p>P-value; Significance of the difference in generation time relative to LM695, the parental strain, Students t-test for independent samples, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10 for each strain.</p></fn><fn id="nt113"><label>c</label><p>Mutation; Identity of the new mutation identified in each evolved strain.</p></fn><fn id="nt114"><label>d</label><p>MIC; for ciprofloxacin (&#x000b5;g/ml) of LM695 and each of the evolved strains.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>A set of 28 isogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains was constructed and used to measure the relationship between the accumulation of fluoroquinolone resistance mutations, drug susceptibility, and growth fitness. The question was whether the accumulation of up to five resistance mutations, commonly found in resistant clinical isolates, would progressively reduce bacterial fitness. Most of the published data on the relationship between drug resistance and bacterial fitness would predict two possibilities: (i) that these mutations would cause little or no fitness cost, explaining their high frequency among resistant isolates; or (ii) that their accumulation would cause a progressive decrease in bacterial fitness, and require additional fitness-compensating mutations to restore fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Andersson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Andersson2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, they also revealed, for some combinations of resistance mutations, a positive relationship between reduced drug-susceptibility and increased bacterial fitness. This positive relationship could be another driving force in the development of increased resistance to these antibacterial drugs. Although this may be the first demonstration in bacteria that in the absence of an antimicrobial, selection can increase resistance to that antimicrobial, a similar phenomenon has been reported for HIV resistance to a protease inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Borman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

The observed frequency of the efflux phenotype is very low relative to the frequency of specific gyrase and topoisomerase mutations in the same isolates, and given the much higher expected probability of mutations that knock out the function of efflux regulator genes it suggests selection against such mutations. This under-representation is consistent with our finding that mutations up-regulating efflux pumps carry significant fitness costs. The growth fitness of clinical isolates cannot be meaningfully compared with the data presented in this paper, in part because clinical isolates are not isogenic, and in part because clinical isolates will already have evolved to ameliorate the fitness costs, if any, associated with their resistance determinants. We believe that our data provide an insight into the likely initial effects on relative fitness and drug susceptibility of different pathways of resistance development. In particular, that one consequence of a following a high-probability but low-fitness evolutionary pathway may be that one or more steps may be driven by selection for increased fitness in the absence of drug exposure.</p><p>How fluoroquinolone resistance evolves in nature will depend on the genotype being selected and on the selective environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000541-Weinreich1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> but it is likely include mutational steps that reduce bacterial fitness. Bacteria that progress down an evolutionary path with reduced fitness relative to a competing population may be driven to extinction, or may, given the opportunity by mutation, acquire a change that increases their relative fitness thus improving their chances of survival. Evolutionary paths that could be taken on the road to extinction or antibiotic resistance are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000541-g003">Figure 3</xref>.
