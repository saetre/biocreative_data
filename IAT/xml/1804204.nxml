Journal Compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2007</copyright-year><abstract><p>The VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor is a seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptor for two neuropeptides, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). It has a distinct tissue-specific, developmental and inducible expression that underlies an important neuroendocrine role. Here, we report the characterisation of the gene that encodes the mouse VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor (<italic>Vipr2</italic>), localisation of the transcriptional start site and functional analysis of the promoter region. The <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene contains 12 introns within its protein-coding region and spans 68.6 kb. Comparison of the 5&#x02032; untranslated region sequences for cloned 5&#x02032;-RACE products amplified from different tissues showed they all were contained within the same exon, with the longest extending 111 bp upstream of the ATG start site. Functional analysis of the 3.2-kb 5&#x02032;-flanking region using sequentially deleted sequences cloned into a luciferase gene reporter vector revealed that this region is active as a promoter in mouse AtT20 D16:16 and rat GH4C1 cell lines. The core promoter is located within a 180-bp GC-rich region proximal to the ATG start codon and contains potential binding sites for Sp1 and AP2, but no TATA-box. Further upstream, in two out of three mice strains examined, we have discovered a 496-bp polymorphic DNA sequence that bears a significant identity to mouse LINE-1 DNA. Comparison of the promoter activity between luciferase reporter gene constructs derived from the BALB/c (which contains this sequence) and C57BL/6J (which lacks this sequence) <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter regions has shown three-fold difference in luciferase gene activity when expressed in mouse AtT20 D16:16 and &#x003b1;T3-1 cells, but not when expressed in the rat GH4C1 cells or in COS 7 cells. Our results suggest that the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene may be differentially active in different mouse strains, depending on the presence of this LINE-1-like sequence in the promoter region.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)</kwd><kwd>pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP)</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>gene</kwd><kwd>LINE-1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The 28 amino acid vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and 38 amino acid pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are structurally related neuropeptides that have several overlapping and distinct functions in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Three genes have been cloned that encode distinct VIP/PACAP receptor proteins belonging to the class II secretin receptor G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Two are receptors at which VIP and PACAP are equipotent and have been designated the VPAC<sub>1</sub> and the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptors. The third receptor, at which PACAP &#x02265;&#x0200a;100-fold more potent than VIP, has been designated the PAC<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Further diversity in VPAC/PAC<sub>1</sub> receptor isoforms is generated through alternative splicing of their respective genes, including several N-terminal and intracellular loop 3 splice variants of the PAC<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), and the recently identified &#x00394; exon 12 variant of the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Similar to other members of the class II secretin receptor GPCR family, the VPAC/PAC<sub>1</sub> receptors couple to adenylate cyclase activation and are capable also of coupling to additional second messenger pathways through distinct interactions with different heterotrimeric and small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The diversity in receptor isoforms generated by alternative splicing is reflected by altered ligand activation and G protein coupling for the VPAC/PAC<sub>1</sub> receptors. For example, there are notable differences in the activation of certain N-terminal domain PAC<sub>1</sub> receptor splice variants by VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and for the PAC<sub>1-hop-1</sub> but not the PAC<sub>1-null</sub> intracellular loop 3 isoforms; coupling to phospholipase D activation involves an additional ADP ribosylation factor-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In addition, the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor &#x00394; exon 12 variant does not couple to adenylate cyclase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). These differences may underlie the various actions of VIP and PACAP in different tissues and cell-types.</p><p>The distinct expression profile of the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor in the CNS and also in several endocrine cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) has prompted the suggestion that the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor may be responsible for mediating the neuroendocrine effects of VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In the pituitary, VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor expression levels are up-regulated during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), where one of its roles may be to mediate the potent prolactin-releasing action of VIP. The VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor also is expressed in several pituitary-derived clonal cell lines including rat somatomammotroph GH3 and GH4C1 cells, mouse adrenocorticotroph AtT20 and gonadotroph &#x003b1;T3-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) suggesting that, in addition to its role in mediating VIP and PACAP regulation of the synthesis and release of different pituitary hormones, it may have a role also in the development of pituitary cell lineages. In support of this, expression is detected quite early in development, and transcripts encoding VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptors are expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and mouse embryonic brain tissue as early as E9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In the adult brain, mRNA encoding the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor is present at relatively high levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, thalamus, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and several of the hypothalamic nuclei, in agreement with the mapping of VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor binding sites using a receptor-specific ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The VPAC<sub>1</sub> receptor is constitutively expressed in a number of different immune cell types whereas expression of the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor is induced in certain monocytes and lymphocytes only after activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), suggesting that the VPAC<sub>1</sub> and VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptors have different roles in mediating the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of VIP and PACAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Expression of the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor is induced also in spinal glial cells following a chronic constrictive nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) where it participates in sensory sensitisation involving p38 MAP kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>Very little is known about the regulatory elements involved in the tissue-specific, inducible, and developmentally regulated expression of the gene encoding the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor. Previously, we reported the characterisation of the human VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor gene and identification of a putative proximal promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In the present study, we have characterised the mouse VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor gene, <italic>Vipr2</italic>. The transcriptional start sites were determined by 5&#x02032;-RACE polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis utilising several anchored cDNA libraries derived from different mouse tissues and embryonic stages. In addition, the promoter activity and core promoter region within 3.2 kb of 5&#x02032;-flanking sequence were characterised using luciferase reporter gene constructs transiently expressed in different pituitary cell lines. Recent research has suggested that polymorphisms of the human <italic>VIPR2</italic> gene promoter may play a role in autism by altering transcriptional regulation and the level of protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Here, we have identified a polymorphic LINE-1 (L1)-like sequence that is present in the <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter region in 129 and Balb/c but not in C57Bl/6J and show that this sequence confers increased expression levels of a luciferase reporter gene.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Tissue culture media and Lipofectamine 2000 were obtained from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK); Primocin from Autogen Bioclear UK Ltd (Calne, UK); Genejuice from Novagen, Merck Biosciences Ltd (Nottingham, UK); standard laboratory chemicals of Analar grade were obtained from Sigma or BDH Chemicals Ltd (Poole, UK); oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Oswel DNA Service (Southampton, UK) and Life Technologies (Paisley, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Anchored 5&#x02032;-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) for the mouse VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor cDNA</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from the mouse adrenocorticotroph AtT20 D16:16 cell line using Catriomox-14 surfactant reagent (VH BIO Ltd, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK).

So far, this L1-like element has been found in the <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter derived from 129 and Balb/c genomic DNA but is not present in the <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter from C57BL/6J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>).

Conversely, this polymorphism may have a disruptive effect on the organisation of the promoter's transcriptional machinery. To test whether the polymorphism is functionally important, cells were transfected with luciferase reporter gene constructs containing the <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter region with or without this sequence. These were made with the 2.9 kb Balb/c (&#x02212;2892/&#x02212;33) or the 2.4-kb C57BL/6J (&#x02212;2434/&#x02212;33) <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene 5&#x02032; flanking sequences, respectively.

The relationship between the intron/exon structure of the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> and the transmembrane topology that it encodes is highly homologous to the structure of the human gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), and is similar to that reported for other members of the secretin receptor gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). All of the exon/intron boundaries conform to the consensus GT-AG rule for splice junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Primer extension was tried in the first instance to determine the transcriptional start site, but was unsuccessful, possibly due to the high GC content and also to there being multiple sites where transcription can be initiated. Analysis of the 5&#x02032; UTR of several cDNA clones amplified from an anchored AtT20 cDNA library and from anchored olfactory bulb cDNA libraries from Balb/c and C57BL/6J mice indicated that transcription can be initiated at multiple sites. The first was identified from the longest clone amplified from the AtT20 library (and corresponding to that amplified from the C57BL/6J olfactory bulb library) that extended the 5&#x02032; end of exon 1 to 82 nucleotides upstream of the ATG translational start site. A second site was identified within exon 1 from the longest clone amplified from the Balb/c olfactory bulb cDNA library that extended 43 nucleotides upstream of the ATG translational start site. Each is flanked on the 5&#x02032; end by an 8-bp sequence that resembles an Inr element (pyrimidine, pyrimidine, A(+1), N, T/A, pyrimidine, pyrimidine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), with that at the first site (&#x02212;89 to &#x02212;82) differing by only one nucleotide. At the end of each of these Inr-like motifs is the TG dinucleotide, previously defined as one of the three most preferred initiators by a genome-wide screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>).</p><p>For some members of the secretin receptor gene family, tissue- and developmentally-specific alternative promoters and/or splicing of the 5&#x02032; untranslated regions have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). In addition, the sequence of a human prostate cDNA clone encoding a VPAC<sub>1</sub> receptor with an altered N-terminal sequence that would arise from a 5&#x02032;-alternatively spliced transcript has been reported in the database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>), although whether this transcript is functionally expressed has not yet been determined. The possibility that such events play a role in the regulation of the <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene was examined here using 5&#x02032;-RACE PCR analysis of a panel of anchored cDNA libraries derived from different mouse tissues and developmental stages. Several cDNAs were sequenced, the longest extending 111 bp upstream of the ATG translational start site and extending the 5&#x02032; boundary of exon 1. This also was flanked at the 5&#x02032; end by an Inr-like element located at &#x02212;120 to &#x02212;113 in the genomic DNA sequence, thus identifying a third possible transcriptional start site. There was no evidence that further exons existed upstream of exon 1 or that the 5&#x02032; end is alternatively spliced, as the 5&#x02032; end of all of the 5&#x02032;-RACE cDNA clones that were sequenced matched that of exon 1. For two genes that are alternatively spliced in the 5&#x02032;-UTR, the rat PAC<sub>1</sub> receptor gene and the mouse PTHR1 gene, a consensus 3&#x02032; splice acceptor site is present a short distance (76 bp and 45 bp, respectively) upstream of the translation start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). No potential splice acceptor sites corresponding to consensus splice site sequence (3&#x02032; Y<sub>11</sub>NYAG,G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>) are found within the corresponding region of the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene. Furthermore, we have determined previously that the 187 bp 5&#x02032;-UTR (sequenced from the longest 5&#x02032;-RACE product amplified from a human placental cDNA library) and the translational start site of the human gene are encoded within the same exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Thus, it is likely that exon 1 contains both the major sites for initiation of transcription as well as for translation for the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene.</p><p>The core promoter region for the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene was identified as a 180 bp sequence located at &#x02212;212 to &#x02212;33 relative to the ATG initiation codon. A CpG island begins 160 bp upstream of the translational start site and extends 375 bp into intron 1 of <italic>Vipr2</italic>. As for the human gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), no TATA- or CCAAT-box sequences are found proximal to exon 1 for the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene. Instead, consensus binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 and related factors are present. These, in addition with a broad range of transcriptional start sites, are key features of CpG island promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Although CpG island promoters are mainly associated with house-keeping genes, they are also present in the promoter regions of a significant proportion of genes that show tissue-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that genes that are active during early development contain CpG island promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). CpG island promoters may be a common feature for genes encoding the Group II secretin receptor GPCRs. The promoter regions that have been characterised for the secretin receptor gene family are typically GC-rich, and many have Sp1 sites but not a TATA-box upstream of the transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>). Sp1 sites provide an alternative mechanism to initiate the transcription of genes that do not contain a TATA-box in their promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). The Sp1 sites have been shown to be active for the rat VPAC<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>), PTH receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>), mouse glucagon receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>) and human secretin receptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>).</p><p>The mouse and rat <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter regions are highly conserved, comparison of the 4.5-kb 5&#x02032; region flanking exon 1 between the mouse (C57BL/6J) and the rat (accession number AC096277) genes shows 78% identity. There is much less conservation between the mouse and human (accession number Y18423) 5&#x02032;-flanking and exon 1 sequences, the 650-bp regions proximal to exon 1 have 45% identity between the mouse and human genes. However, the overall structural features of both promoter regions are similar. Both have clusters of GATA and E-box sequences as well as C/EBP&#x003b2; binding sites within 3 kb of the translational start site that may be functionally significant for the tissue-specific and developmental expression of the gene in human and mouse. Several E-box sequences that are contained within both promoter regions are consensus sites for the basic helix-loop-helix factor NeuroD1/Beta2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Within the human <italic>VIPR2</italic> promoter, there are 25 NeuroD1/Beta2 sites, 24 of which are within the GATA repeat region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b2; and NeuroD1/Beta2 are important for neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>) and the development of different pituitary cell lineages is dependent on both NeuroD1/Beta2 and GATA-2 factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>). Thus, the presence of these sites within the human and mouse promoter regions suggests that the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor may potentially have a role in these processes in both species. Two E-box elements within the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter are binding sites for the circadian regulators BMAL/CLOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>) and may be responsible for the oscillatory modulation of transcription for the VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor gene in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>). The circadian regulator E-box elements were not found in the corresponding human <italic>VIPR2</italic> promoter region.</p><p>Lying within the 5&#x02032; flanking sequence of the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene, we have discovered a 496-bp polymorphic DNA sequence that bears a significant homology to mouse L1 DNA. This sequence is present in the <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter regions in 129 and BALB/c but not in C57BL/6J. L1 elements constitute the most common family of long interspersed elements in the mammalian genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>). These mobile genetic elements form part of the retrotransposon family and are characterised by the presence of flanking direct repeat sequences. The self-propagating nature of L1s is due to the presence of two ORFs, which encode an RNA-binding protein, an endonuclease, reverse transcriptase and a highly conserved cysteine-rich motif, all of which are required for reverse transcription of the L1 element via an RNA intermediate. Although full length LINEs are normally approximately 6&#x02013;7 kb, L1 elements are often found as inactive truncated versions which are incapable of retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>). The function of L1 elements remains elusive but it appears that these molecular parasites exist only to maintain themselves and their presence in the genome is far from insignificant. We have shown here that the L1 sequence within the promoter region of the <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene confers a three-fold increased level of expression for the luciferase reporter gene construct pGL3-BALB/c compared to pGL3-C57BL/6J containing the equivalent region without this sequence when transiently expressed in two mouse pituitary cell lines. The simplest explanation for this observation is that elements within the L1 sequence may enhance expression of the gene. However, this appears unlikely as the luciferase reporter gene construct pGL3-551, in which the 5&#x02032; region, including the L1 sequence, was deleted, maintained similar levels of expression compared to the pGL3-BALB/c construct. A more likely explanation is that the region upstream of the L1 sequence contains a repressor element (or elements) and that the L1 sequence contains an element that binds a transcriptional regulator that &#x02018;relieves&#x02019; this repression. One such candidate is the multifunctional transcription factor Yin Yang-1 (YY1), which can act as a transcriptional repressor, activator or initiator, depending on the context of its binding site in relation to those of other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref>). For the <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene, a YY1 repressor site is located approximately 1.25 kb upstream of the L1 sequence and a YY1 activator site is located midway within the L1 sequence. However, there are several elements within the L1 sequence that may contribute to the enhanced level of expression that is observed and we are currently investigating these to ascertain which are relevant.</p><p>In summary, the exon/intron organisation of the mouse VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptor gene, <italic>Vipr2</italic>, is highly conserved with that of the human gene and with other genes encoding Group II secretin receptor GPCRs. Transcription of <italic>Vipr2</italic> is initiated from multiple sites within an 80 bp region at the 5&#x02032; end of exon 1 and the core promoter region is contained within the GC-rich region proximal to the ATG translational start site. Several regulatory sites located upstream of the core promoter region were identified that may contribute to the tissue-specific, inducible and developmentally regulated expression pattern observed for <italic>Vipr2</italic> mRNA. In addition, a polymorphic L1-like sequence was identified that is present in the <italic>Vipr2</italic> promoter regions of 129 and BALB/c mice, but not in C57BL/6J, that could potentially contribute to differential expression levels of the gene. The functional consequences of this remain to be explored.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Melanie Mackay for the original isolation and characterisation of the 129 genomic DNA sequences encoding the mouse <italic>Vipr2</italic> gene, Cata Abad for assistance in setting up the reporter gene assays and Karen Stewart for technical assistance.
