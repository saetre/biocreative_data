Here we show that, like humans with AD, mice with skin-barrier defects develop AD-like skin inflammation and are susceptible to allergic asthma. Furthermore, we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), overexpressed by skin keratinocytes, is the systemic driver of this bronchial hyper-responsiveness. As an AD-like model, we used mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of RBP-j that sustained high systemic levels of TSLP. Antigen-induced allergic challenge to the lung airways of RBP-j&#x02013;deficient animals resulted in a severe asthmatic phenotype not seen in similarly treated wild-type littermates. Elimination of TSLP signaling in these animals blocked the atopic march, demonstrating that high serum TSLP levels were required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation. Furthermore, we analyzed outbred <italic>K14-TSLP<sup>tg</sup></italic> mice that maintained high systemic levels of TSLP without developing any skin pathology. Importantly, epidermal-derived TSLP was sufficient to trigger the atopic march, sensitizing the lung airways to inhaled allergens in the absence of epicutaneous sensitization.

We used genetic engineering to generate mice with chronic skin-barrier defects and a subsequent eczema-like disorder. With these mice, we were able to investigate how skin-specific defects predisposed the lungs to allergic asthma. We identified thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine that is secreted by barrier-defective skin into the systemic circulation, as the agent sensitizing the lung to allergens. We demonstrated that high systemic levels of skin-derived TSLP were both required and sufficient to render lung airways hypersensitive to allergens. Thus, these data suggest that early treatment of skin-barrier defects to prevent TSLP overexpression, and systemic inhibition of TSLP, may be crucial in preventing the progression from eczema to asthma.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allergic asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by T-helper2 (Th2)&#x02013;mediated inflammation and airway obstruction in response to allergen exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Meyer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Asthma is an increasingly common disorder affecting more than 300 million individuals around the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Masoli1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is another prevalent allergic disease, and 17&#x00025; of children in the United States suffer from this disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Spergel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In comparison to its 4&#x02013;8&#x00025; prevalence in the general population, asthma develops in up to 70&#x00025; of patients with history of severe AD, a phenomenon referred to as &#x0201c;atopic march&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Spergel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. It may be possible to prevent asthma in these at-risk individuals by early diagnosis of AD and blockage of the atopic march. To achieve this, it is critical that we understand the mechanism triggering the development of asthma in AD patients.</p><p>A survey of the literature has identified several possible mechanisms underlying the clinical link between AD and asthma. These include: (a) a systemic immune system disorder leading to excessive Th2 response at epithelial surfaces exposed to allergens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Umetsu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, (b) a barrier defect shared by both skin and lung epithelia that leads to overstimulation of the immune cells by invading allergens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Morar1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, or (c) systemic consequences of a skin-specific barrier defect causing immune cells to mount an allergic inflammation at any allergen-exposed epithelial surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Segre1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Epidemiological data supporting the third hypothesis include the observation that AD tends to be the first manifestation of the atopic march <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Spergel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Another supportive observation relates to filaggrin, a skin cornified envelope protein that is absent from the lung epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Palmer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Ying1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Although controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Rogers1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, it seems that AD patients with filaggrin loss-of-function mutations exhibit increased incidence of asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Marenholz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Weidinger1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with the third hypothesis, that loss of an epidermal-specific barrier protein can trigger systemic atopy in humans. Mechanistically, it is suspected that epicutaneous sensitization with allergens underlies the development of airway hyperreactivity in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Spergel2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and in humans with filaggrin mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Marenholz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Palmer2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is unclear whether intrinsic skin-barrier defects can trigger asthma in the absence of any epicutaneous sensitization. If epicutaneous exposure is not required, it will imply that systemic factor(s) produced by AD skin may be involved in sensitizing the bronchial epithelia. Such factors will be important as therapeutic targets in preventing asthma.</p><p>To address this question, we studied mice lacking Notch signaling in the skin. Skin keratinocytes are organized in highly interconnected basal, spinous, granular, and cornified layers, forming an elaborate barrier protecting the organism from the outside environment. One of the major molecular regulators of this structure is Notch signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Rangarajan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Blanpain1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Notch is a transmembrane receptor interacting with ligands expressed on the surface of neighboring keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Blanpain1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Lubman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon activation, sequential proteolysis of Notch releases its intracellular domain, which then translocates into the nucleus, binds to RBP-j (the DNA-binding partner of Notch), and activates downstream targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Lubman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of Notch signaling pathway components impairs epidermal differentiation, resulting in skin-barrier defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Demehri1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Blanpain1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. We have recently shown that Notch signaling loss in the skin also triggers a severe neonatal B-lymphoproliferative disorder (B-LPD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Demehri1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>). This systemic disease is directly caused by elevated levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) released into the circulation by Notch-deficient keratinocytes failing to differentiate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Demehri1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. TSLP, a general biomarker for skin-barrier defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Demehri1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, is an interleukin-7 (IL-7)&#x02013;like cytokine produced by epithelial cells and is implicated in the pathogenesis of both AD and asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Zhou1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Leonard1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. TSLP expression is sustained as long as barrier defects persist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Demehri1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the potentially high systemic availability of skin-derived TSLP and its central role in promoting asthma bring up the possibility that TSLP may be the factor predisposing AD patients to asthma.</p><p>Identifying a clear mechanism for the atopic march in the complex network of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors that contribute to AD has been a challenge to the field and has resulted in much debate as to the right therapeutic approach for preventing asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Segre1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine the mechanisms underlying the progression from AD to asthma, we first generated animals that lacked Notch signaling in a portion of their skin surfaces by embryonic removal of RBP-j from keratinocytes using the <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> transgene (<italic>Msx2-Cre/&#x0002b;;RBP-j<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> or RBP-jCKO). <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> is ectopically expressed at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) in clusters of ectodermal cells, resulting in a chimeric pattern of <italic>RBP-j</italic> deletion in the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Pan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of unaffected skin surfaces allowed RBP-jCKO animals to live for approximately 100 days on average with a few surviving up to one year (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000067.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Demehri1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Blanpain1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, presenting a model in which to determine whether a defective skin-barrier could cause AD-like symptoms and render susceptibility to asthma in the absence of epicutaneous sensitization. We found that defective skin-barrier function in adult RBP-j&#x02013;deficient animals caused the development of an AD-like allergic inflammation and a subsequent susceptibility to asthma. To determine whether TSLP is required for this susceptibility, we deleted the TSLP receptor in RBP-jCKO mice and showed that this genetic manipulation blocked the development of asthma in animals with persistent AD-like pathology and inflammation. To ask if TSLP overexpression by skin keratinocytes is sufficient, we used outbred transgenic mice overexpressing TSLP in epidermal keratinocytes and showed that epidermal-derived TSLP was sufficient to confer a severe asthmatic phenotype even in the absence of any skin defect. These findings establish that high systemic availability of TSLP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Demehri1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> can sensitize the lung to allergens, and provide a novel molecular mechanism for the atopic march.

In agreement with this notion, the impaired skin-barrier function in RBP-jCKO mice initiated an inflammatory cascade culminating in the development of an AD-like skin phenotype.

We show that creating an intrinsic skin-barrier defect (by removing Notch signaling specifically from some skin keratinocytes) results in the sensitization of the lung airways to allergens. Similar to the clinical cases, barrier-defective mice require a secondary insult by allergens to expose their predisposition to asthma. Importantly, we show that epicutaneous sensitization with a common allergen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000067-Spergel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> is not required to achieve this pronounced lung hyper-responsiveness.
