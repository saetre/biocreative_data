Mutations in either one of them are the major cause of non-syndromic prelingual deafness in humans. Because the mechanisms of cochlear pathogenesis caused by Cx mutations are unclear, we investigated effects of Cx30 null mutation on GJ-mediated ionic and metabolic coupling in the cochlea of mice. A novel flattened cochlear preparation was used to directly assess intercellular coupling in the sensory epithelium of the cochlea. Double-electrode patch clamp recordings revealed that the absence of Cx30 did not significantly change GJ conductance among the cochlear supporting cells. The preserved electrical coupling is consistent with immunolabeling data showing extensive Cx26 GJs in the cochlea of the mutant mice. In contrast, dye diffusion assays showed that the rate and extent of intercellular transfer of multiple fluorescent dyes (including a non-metabolizable D-glucose analogue, 2-NBDG) among cochlear supporting cells were severely reduced in Cx30 null mice. Since the sensory epithelium in the cochlea is an avascular organ, GJ-facilitated intercellular transfer of nutrient and signaling molecules may play essential roles in cellular homeostasis. To test this possibility, NBDG was used as a tracer to study the contribution of GJs in transporting glucose into the cochlear sensory epithelium when delivered systemically. NBDG uptake in cochlear supporting cells was significantly reduced in Cx30 null mice. The decrease was also observed with GJ blockers or glucose competition, supporting the specificity of our tests. These data indicate that GJs facilitate efficient uptake of glucose in the supporting cells. This study provides the first direct experimental evidence showing that the transfer of metabolically-important molecules in cochlear supporting cells is dependent on the normal function of GJs, thereby suggesting a novel pathogenesis process in the cochlea for Cx-mutation-linked deafness.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gap junctions (GJs) are the only known intercellular channels linking the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. They facilitate intercellular exchanges of ion, metabolite and signaling molecules. GJs in all vertebrates are assembled from connexins (Cxs).

It is clear that normal functions of Cx26 and Cx30 are required for hearing. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms explaining why these two Cxs are essential for normal hearing are unclear, although several plausible theories have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Schulte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-CohenSalmon2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>GJ-mediated ionic transfer is termed <italic>ionic coupling</italic>, while exchanges of larger molecules that are usually not permeable through traditional ion channels are called <italic>metabolic</italic> or <italic>biochemical coupling</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-White2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. GJ-mediated ionic diffusion has been considered an essential mechanism to allow endolymphatic K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to recycle in the cochlea in order to maintain the high extracellular K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration (&#x0223c;160 mM) in the endolymph. Both the high K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration and the accompanying electrical potential (endolymphatic potential) in the endolymphatic space are required for normal hearing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Wangemann1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of such a constant ionic flow in the cochlea by loss-of-function Cx mutations has been a leading theory in the field of auditory physiology explaining deafness caused by Cx mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Schulte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, direct experimental evidence in supporting of such a hypothesis is not available.</p><p>Recent data reveal that most cochlear GJs are co-assembled from Cx26 and Cx30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Forge1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, deleting a single Cx gene is unlikely to totally eliminate intercellular ionic coupling since the remaining Cx gene is still able to function and form homomeric GJs. This notion is directly supported by data showing that the cellular expression patterns of Cx30 and Cx26 in the cochlea of Cx26 and Cx30 null mice, respectively, are unaltered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-CohenSalmon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Teubner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of reconstituted GJs reveal that a subset of Cx26 point mutations specifically affecting biochemical coupling (e.g., V84L, V95M and A88S) are sufficient to cause deafness in human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Zhang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Beltramello1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These recent findings suggest that substantial ionic coupling remains in the cochlea of Cx30 null mice, which are inconsistent with the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> recycling theory. Therefore, further investigations into cellular mechanisms of cochlear pathogenesis resulted from Cx mutations are needed.</p><p>Similar to the lens in the eye, where mutations in Cx46 and Cx50 cause cataracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-White2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-MartinezWittinghan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, the sensory epithelium in the cochlea is an avascular organ. While the extensive intercellular coupling provided by GJs between cochlear supporting cells is thought to play nutritive roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-SantosSacchi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, it has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Therefore we used a novel flattened cochlear preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) to directly assess GJ-mediated ionic and metabolic coupling in the sensory epithelium of the cochlea. By comparing wild type (WT) and Cx30 null mice, our results provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that targeted deletion of Cx30 significantly compromised intercellular transfer of metabolically-important molecules among the supporting cells in the cochlea. In contrast, GJ conductance measured by two-electrode patch clamp recordings among these cells was not significantly different. The large reduction in the GJ-mediated transfer of a D-glucose analogue suggested that cellular energy supply was diminished in the cochlear sensory epithelium that normally lacks adequate microcirculation. Our data have identified one important cellular deficit that potentially constitutes a major pathogenesis process, namely a reduction in GJ-mediated glucose transfer in the cochlea of Cx30 mutant mice. These data support a novel theory explaining Cx-mutation-linked hearing loss.</p><fig id="pone-0004088-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004088.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Illustration of the flattened cochlear preparation used in this study.</title><p>(A) DIC image of an unfixed live preparation.

We, therefore, concentrated our effort on comparing differences in GJ-mediated ionic and metabolic coupling in the cochlear supporting cells between the WT and Cx30 null mice. We first examined whether the Cx30 null mutation affects the formation of GJs in this region of the cochlea by immunolabeling for Cx26 and Cx30 and examining the results using the flattened cochlear preparation. Consistent with the genetic deletion of the <italic>Gjb6</italic> (Cx30) gene, no Cx30 immunoreactivities were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004088.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>).

Extensive Cx26 immunoreactivities clustered apparently as GJ plaques, however, were found in the membrane of cochlear supporting cells of Cx30 null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004088.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Comparing the size of the evident GJ plaques between WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and Cx30 null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) mice, the density of Cx26 immunoreactivities in the Cx30 null mice was apparently decreased. Nonetheless, these presumably homomeric Cx26 GJ plaques were observed in the membrane of all cochlear supporting cells that normally co-express Cx26 and Cx30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results were consistent with previously published data showing that the cellular expression pattern of Cx26 is unaltered in the cochlear sections of Cx30 null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-CohenSalmon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Teubner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Next, we quantified the effect of the Cx30 null mutation on intercellular ionic coupling by measuring GJ conductance between adjacent cochlear supporting cells using two-electrode patch clamp recordings conducted with the flattened cochlear preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The intercellular currents recorded in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) were eliminated by GJ blockers (2 mM of octanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) or 200 &#x000b5;M flufenamic acid (FFA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>)), indicating that GJs mediated the electrical coupling. A significant amount of GJ-mediated current remained in the Cx30 null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). Average GJ conductance (G<sub>j</sub>) derived from the I&#x02013;V relation was 9.1&#x000b1;2.2 nS (the total number of cells (n) recorded was 10) and 8.3&#x000b1;1.3 nS (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8) in WT and Cx30 null mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g002">Fig. 2H</xref>).

Layers of optical sections were superimposed to show a more complete pattern of immunolabeling through multiple layers of cells in the flattened cochlear preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Double electrode patch clamp recording performed with the flattened cochlear preparation</title><p>A detailed protocol for double electrode patch clamp was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Zhang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, each cell in the cell pair was voltage clamped independently with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) by following a conventional whole cell voltage clamp method. Signals amplified by Axopatch 200B amplifiers were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Experiments were controlled by Clampex software (version9.2) via a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Holding voltage (V<sub>h</sub>) is &#x02212;70 mV for both cells. The voltage in one of the cells (V<sub>1</sub>) was stepped between &#x02212;110 mV and &#x02212;30 mV in a step of 10 mV for one second, while the membrane potential of second cell in the pair (V<sub>2</sub>) was held at &#x02212;70 mV. A transjunctional voltage (V<sub>j</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;V<sub>1</sub>&#x02212;V<sub>2</sub>) is therefore established, which resulted in junctional currents (I<sub>j</sub>) that were measured in the unstepped cell. The transjunctional I&#x02013;V curve was obtained by plotting the peak I<sub>j</sub> (y-axis) against the V<sub>j</sub> (x-axis). The junctional conductance (G<sub>j</sub>) was calculated by: G<sub>j</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; I<sub>j</sub>/V<sub>j</sub>. The GJ uncouplers, octanol and FFA were both purchased from Sigma Aldrich Inc. (St Louis, MO). Data were analyzed using pClamp (version 9.2) and Origin 7.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). The data points were presented as means&#x000b1;standard error (S.E). All data were statistically compared by student <italic>t</italic> tests and a significance level of p&#x0003c;0.05 was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Fluorescent dye diffusion assay performed with the flattened cochlear preparation</title><p>Flattened cochlear preparations were placed in a recording chamber mounted on an upright microscope (Axioskop2 FX plus, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Extracellular solution (HBSS) was perfused at a rate of &#x0223c;1 drop/second. DIC optics enabled us to directly recognize different cochlear cell types in the acutely-isolated cochlear segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Membrane impermeable fluorescent dyes were injected into the cytoplasm of a single cell by forming the whole-cell patch-clamp recording mode, which was confirmed by monitoring the whole cell resistance and capacitance using the standard protocol (Axonpatch 200B, Axon Instruments, CA). Pipettes had an access resistance of about 3 M&#x02126;. Analog signals were digitized with the Digidata 1322A interface (Axon Instrument, CA).</p><p>Pipette solution contained (in mM): 120 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Fluorescent dye (all purchased from Molecular Probes, OR) supplemented in the pipette solution was one of the following: (1) 1 mM lucifer yellow (LY, lithium salt, MW&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;457 Da, charge&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;2, catalog#L-453); (2) 0.75 mM propidium iodide (PI, MW&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;668 Da, charge&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x0002b;2, catalog# P1304MP); (3) 1 mg/ml AlexaFluor 568 (hydrazide sodium salt solution, MW&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;791.8 Da, charge&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;1, catalog#A-10441); (4) 200 &#x000b5;M 2-(<italic>N</italic>-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG, MW&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;342.3 Da, catalog# N13195). Intercellular dye diffusion patterns were recorded by a cooled digital CCD camera (AxioCam, Carl Zeiss, Germany) at various time points after the establishment of whole cell recording configuration. The image acquisition was controlled by AxioVision 3.1 software (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and the same exposure time was used for samples obtained from WT and Cx30 null mice. Dye recipient cells were visually identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g003">Figs. 3</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g004">4</xref>) using the same criteria in the images of WT and Cx30 null mice. Either the nuclei or the cell border must be clearly discernible, and their numbers were counted from these images. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Assessment of in vivo 2-NBDG uptake in the supporting cells after systemic applications</title><p>Mice were anesthetized by injections of xylazine (i.p., 10 mg/kg) and ketamine (i.p., 100 mg/kg). A shielded winged needle (Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy System Inc., Franklin Lakes, NJ) was penetrated into the left ventricle to introduce solutions into the cardiovascular system of mice. The speed of the perfusion was controlled by using a peristaltic pump (Instech Laboratories Inc, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Animals were divided into four experimental groups: (1) WT mice in which 3.8 mM of 2-NBDG (in HBSS) was perfused for 10 minutes; (2) WT mice in which 2 mM of octanol (in HBSS, catalog#: O-4500, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis) was perfused first for 10 minutes, then followed by another 10 minutes of 3.8 mM of 2-NBDG plus 2 mM of octanol (in PBS) perfusion. To exclude the possibility that the change in the 2-NBDG distribution in octanol-treated mice was due to the cardiac output decrease, we performed the heart massage during the injection of 2-NBDG until the end of the experiment to maintain systemic circulation. The presence of 2-NBDG fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004088-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>) in stria vascularis confirmed that the fluorescent tracer reached the cochlea. (3) WT mice in which 3.8 mM of 2-NBDG plus 0.5 M of glucose (in PBS, catalog#: G-7528, Sigma-Aldrich Inc, St Louis) were perfused for 10 minutes; (4) Cx30 null mice in which 3.8 mM of 2-NBDG (in HBSS) was perfused. Concentrations of NBDG used in these groups mimics the glucose concentration in the plasma and cochlea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Wangemann3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>During dissection and preparation of the samples 2 mM octanol was always present in the solution to prevent the loaded 2-NBDG from leaking out of the opened GJ hemichannels. Samples were then transferred to perfusion chamber mounted on stage of an inverted fluorescent microscope (Axioskop 2 FS plus, Carl Zeiss, Germany) for image acquisition. To minimize photobleach, we used a shutter wheel (LAMBDA 10-B, Sutter Instruments Inc, Novato, CA) in the light path to expose the samples to the intense fluorescent light source only during the image acquisition. To ensure fluorescent intensities are comparable across different samples, a constant exposure time (300 mSec) was used. Images were taken with a cooled-CCD camera (AxioCam MRm, Carl Zeiss, Germany) under the control of AxioVision software (version 4.6, Carl Zeiss Inc, Germany). Pictures were stored in the computer hard disk for offline analysis. The fluorescent intensity of the area of interest was measured with the ImageJ software (version 1.40 g) we downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Assessment of intracellular ROS level</title><p>The level of intracellular ROS was monitored with a fluorescent indicator dye CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA (Molecular Probes, CA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Royall1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Kirkland1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA is the acetoxymethyl ester form of H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA, which is cell-permeant and non-fluorescent until removal of the acetate group by ubiquitous intracellular esterase and oxidation occurs within the living cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004088-Royall1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The molecule then becomes highly fluorescent 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. The absorption and emission properties of fluorescent H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA are similar to FITC. Our time-lapsed recordings showed that the intracellular fluorescent intensity of H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA in the cochlear supporting cells was stabilized when these cells were incubated in H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA (10 &#x000b5;M) for about 70 minutes, suggesting that the intracellular dye loading was completed in such a time period. After 80 minutes incubation in 10 &#x000b5;m of H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA, images were taken with an AxioCam digital camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss, Germany) controlled by software AxioVision 4.6 (Zeiss, Germany). Same exposure time (20 mSec) was used for image acquisitions of WT and Cx30 null mice. Photobleaching was minimized by exposing the cells to the excitation light only when images were acquired by controlling an electronic shutter (Lambda 10, Sutter Instrument, CA) placed in the light path. ROS generation-correlated fluorescent intensities in the supporting cells were measured from individual cells by the ImageJ software and averaged results were presented.
