In all animals investigated so far, both the protostome genes and the vertebrate <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes were found to play crucial roles in neural and muscle development. Recently however, additional <italic>Lbx </italic>genes with divergent expression patterns were discovered in amniotes. Early in the evolution of vertebrates, two rounds of whole genome duplication are thought to have occurred, during which 4 <italic>Lbx </italic>genes were generated. Which of these genes were maintained in extant vertebrates, and how these genes and their functions evolved, is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we searched vertebrate genomes for <italic>Lbx </italic>genes and discovered novel members of this gene family. We also identified signature genes linked to particular <italic>Lbx </italic>loci and traced the remnants of 4 <italic>Lbx </italic>paralogons (two of which retain <italic>Lbx </italic>genes) in amniotes. In teleosts, that have undergone an additional genome duplication, 8 <italic>Lbx </italic>paralogons (three of which retain <italic>Lbx </italic>genes) were found. Phylogenetic analyses of <italic>Lbx </italic>and <italic>Lbx</italic>-associated genes show that in extant, bony vertebrates only <italic>Lbx1</italic>- and <italic>Lbx2</italic>-type genes are maintained. Of these, some <italic>Lbx2 </italic>sequences evolved faster and were probably subject to neofunctionalisation, while <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes may have retained more features of the ancestral <italic>Lbx </italic>gene. Genes at <italic>Lbx1 </italic>and former <italic>Lbx4 </italic>loci are more closely related, as are genes at <italic>Lbx2 </italic>and former <italic>Lbx3 </italic>loci. This suggests that during the second vertebrate genome duplication, <italic>Lbx1/4 </italic>and <italic>Lbx2/3 </italic>paralogons were generated from the duplicated <italic>Lbx </italic>loci created during the first duplication event.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study establishes for the first time the evolutionary history of <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in bony vertebrates, including the order of gene duplication events, gene loss and phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, we identified genetic hallmarks for each of the <italic>Lbx </italic>paralogons that can be used to trace <italic>Lbx </italic>genes as other vertebrate genomes become available. Significantly, we show that bony vertebrates only retained copies of <italic>Lbx1 </italic>and <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes, with some <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes being highly divergent. Thus, we have established a base on which the evolution of <italic>Lbx </italic>gene function in vertebrate development can be evaluated.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ladybird/Lbx proteins are part of a clustered set of Nk transcription factors, which encompass the Nk4 protein tinman/Nkx2, the Nk3 protein bagpipe/Nkx3, ladybird/Lbx, C15/Tlx, and the Nk1 protein slouch/Nkx1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In protostome genomes, <italic>NK </italic>genes are organised into a cluster, which, along with the molecular phylogeny of Nk homeodomains, indicates that they originated via tandem duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Indeed, the <italic>NK </italic>gene cluster is believed to be ancient, with aspects predating the divergence of sponges, cnidarians and bilaterians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In deuterostomes, however, tight clustering has been lost with only <italic>Nkx4/Nkx3 </italic>and <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>linkages remaining in the cephalochordate amphioxus and in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p><italic>Lbx </italic>genes have essential roles in development, including crucial functions in neural and mesodermal cell specification. In mammals and amphibians, <italic>Lbx1 </italic>controls the emigration of specialised, motile muscle precursors that give rise to limb and hypoglossal/tongue muscles, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In mouse embryos, <italic>Lbx1 </italic>is also required for the specification of several populations of dorsal spinal cord interneurons, which receive and process somatosensory information from the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Lbx </italic>genes with a similar spinal cord expression pattern to mouse have been described in chick, zebrafish and the spotted dogfish and, in the case of zebrafish and chick, these genes are also expressed in muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a protostome whose ancestors split from the deuterostome lineage over 500 million years ago, two tandem-duplicated <italic>ladybird/Lbx </italic>family members exist (<italic>ladybird early </italic>and <italic>ladybird late</italic>) that are also expressed in developing muscle and neural tissue and are required for the specification of subpopulations of myoblasts and neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Lbx </italic>genes may have evolutionarily ancient functions in muscle and neural development.</p><p>Despite the intriguing similarities of some <italic>ladybird/Lbx </italic>genes, significant differences become apparent when considering all of the members of the <italic>Lbx </italic>family in different vertebrates. For example, mammals, including humans, have two <italic>Lbx </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] as does the chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], whereas <italic>Danio rerio </italic>has three <italic>Lbx </italic>genes (this report), and the genome sequencing project for <italic>Xenopus tropicalis </italic>has so far only revealed one <italic>Lbx </italic>gene (this report). In addition, the expression pattern of mammalian <italic>Lbx2 </italic>is distinct from that of <italic>Lbx1 </italic>(<italic>Lbx2 </italic>is expressed in the urogenital system, eye and brain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], whereas the two chicken <italic>Lbx </italic>genes and all zebrafish genes are co-expressed in migratory muscle precursors (K. R. Wotton and S. Dietrich, unpublished data). Yet the second chicken <italic>Lbx </italic>gene is not expressed in neural tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] while all three of the zebrafish genes are, albeit in distinct regions (K. E. Lewis, unpublished data). Consequently, the evolutionary and functional relationship of <italic>ladybird/Lbx </italic>genes is not clear.</p><p>It is generally believed that at the base of the vertebrate lineage, the entire genome was duplicated twice (2R hypothesis; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). This was followed by a further genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage at the base of the teleost radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In all chordate relatives of vertebrates investigated so far, such as the urochordates <italic>Oikopleura dioica </italic>and <italic>Ciona intestinalis </italic>and the cephalochordate <italic>Branchiostoma floridae </italic>(amphioxus), only a single <italic>lbx </italic>gene has been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is, therefore, safe to assume that prior to the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication, only a single <italic>Lbx </italic>gene existed.</p><p>One prediction of the 2R hypothesis is that a 4:1 ratio of genes should have been present in an ancestral vertebrate when compared to their invertebrate relatives. However, with gene duplicates carrying redundant functions, many of these four copies (called ohnologs to indicate that they are paralogs that have originated by a process of whole-genome duplication &#x02013; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) were lost. Yet, despite considerable interest in <italic>Lbx </italic>gene function in extant vertebrates, orthologies between <italic>Lbx </italic>genes have not been established. Therefore, it is not known whether different vertebrate lineages have lost the same, or different, <italic>Lbx </italic>ohnologs. This raises two alternative hypotheses for the differences that have been observed between vertebrate <italic>Lbx </italic>genes.</p><p>1. Different vertebrate lineages have retained different <italic>Lbx </italic>ohnologs with distinct expression patterns and/or functions</p><p>2. The same <italic>Lbx </italic>ohnologs have been maintained in all vertebrates with differences in expression or function being due to more recent neo- and/or sub- functionalisation.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we have used a number of bioinformatics approaches to characterise the organisation of <italic>Lbx </italic>loci in extant osteichthyan vertebrates and to determine the relationship of <italic>Lbx </italic>genes and genes associated with <italic>Lbx </italic>loci. Our studies identified non-<italic>NK </italic>genes that were acquired by <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>region(s) prior to, or during, the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication and that hence, serve as signature genes for these loci. With the help of these signature genes, the remnants of all four <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>paralogons (eight in teleosts) were identified. Phylogenetic analyses of <italic>Lbx</italic>, <italic>Tlx </italic>and the co-localising non-<italic>Nk </italic>genes revealed that the first round of whole genome duplication in vertebrates created the ancestor of the <italic>Lbx1/Tlx1 </italic>and <italic>Lbx4/Tlx4 </italic>clusters plus the ancestor of the <italic>Lbx2/Tlx2 </italic>and <italic>Lbx3/Tlx3 </italic>clusters. After the second genome duplication, <italic>Lbx </italic>and <italic>Tlx </italic>genes were lost, such that before the split of the ray-finned and lobe-finned fish lineages only <italic>Lbx1/Tlx1</italic>, <italic>Lbx2/Tlx2 </italic>and <italic>Tlx3 </italic>genes were maintained. Gene loss also occurred after the additional genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage, leaving teleosts (including zebrafish and pufferfish) with two <italic>Lbx1 </italic>and <italic>Tlx3 </italic>genes but only one <italic>Lbx2, Tlx1 </italic>and <italic>Tlx2 </italic>gene. Since the amniote <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes diverge much more in their coding sequences than the <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes and the expression pattern of mouse <italic>Lbx2 </italic>is distinct from non-mammalian <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes, we propose that amniote (or possibly sarcopterygian) <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes have evolved at a faster rate and were subject to neofunctionalisation. <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes on the other hand may have retained more features of the original chordate <italic>lbx </italic>gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in extant Osteichthyes</title><p>To reconstruct the phylogeny of vertebrate <italic>Lbx </italic>genes we first attempted to identify the complete set of these genes in representatives of extant Osteichthyes. For this, BLAST-searches of sequence databases were carried out, using the known human and mouse Lbx1 and Lbx2, chicken Lbx1 and Lbx3, <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>Lbx1 and zebrafish Lbx1 sequences as query sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To obtain outgroups for these phylogenetic analyses, we also searched the databases for lbx/ladybird sequences in invertebrate deuterostomes, including the cephalochordate <italic>Branchiostoma floridae </italic>(amphioxus), the urorchordates <italic>Oikopleura dioica </italic>and <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, and the echinoderm <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus </italic>(purple sea urchin); moreover we included sequences from various protostomes. Our search confirmed the presence of two distinct <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in placental mammals and marsupials (human, mouse, dog, cattle, opossum), one <italic>Lbx </italic>gene in the still incompletely sequenced platypus and Anole lizard genomes, and two <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in the chicken. Only one <italic>Lbx </italic>gene was found for the frog <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>. On the other hand, besides the gene so far known as zebrafish <italic>lbx1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], two novel <italic>lbx </italic>genes were identified in this organism. Three <italic>Lbx </italic>genes were also identified in the teleosts <italic>Takifugu rubripes </italic>(fugu), <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>, <italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus </italic>(stickleback), and two genes in <italic>Oryzias latipes </italic>(Medaka), while only one <italic>lbx/ladybird </italic>gene was retrieved for the invertebrate deuterostomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis of osteichthyan <italic>Lbx </italic>protein sequences</title><p>To determine the evolutionary relationship between osteichthyan <italic>Lbx </italic>genes, we first determined the phylogenetic relationship of Lbx proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For this purpose, amino acid sequences were aligned and analysed, using maximum likelihood methods. We found that the vertebrate Lbx sequences were assigned to two distinct groups. The first group encompassed the known human, mouse, chicken and frog Lbx1 proteins. In addition, this group contained the two novel zebrafish Lbx proteins, encoded by the genes located on chromosomes 13 and 1, the fugu Lbx proteins whose genes are on scaffolds 52 and 62, the <italic>Tetraodon </italic>protein encoded by the <italic>Lbx </italic>gene on chromosome 18, the stickleback proteins with genes on groups VI and IX and the medaka protein encoded by the gene on chromosome 1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Lbx </italic>sequences</bold>. The tree shows a maximum likelihood analysis of Lbx protein sequences. Dark grey boxes indicate orthologous groups while light grey boxes indicate gene linkage. Bootstrap values below 70 have been removed. Only two <italic>Tetraodon </italic>Lbx proteins are included as the third sequence (found on scaffold 8483) is incomplete. Note that the Lbx sequences separate into two clear groups, Lbx1 and Lbx2, which are supported by bootstrap values of 79 and 83 (boxed), respectively. The chicken protein previously denoted as Lbx3 [18], the zebrafish protein previously denoted as Lbx1 [14] and one of the fugu, <italic>Tetraodon</italic>, stickleback and medaka sequences group with mammalian Lbx2 sequences. The two novel zebrafish Lbx sequences and the remaining teleost sequences group with mammalian, chicken and frog Lbx1. The tree shows significantly longer branch lengths for the Lbx2 proteins indicating that these sequences may be evolving at a quicker rate than the Lbx1 proteins.

The division into two distinct groups of Lbx proteins was supported by high bootstrap values. Our phylogenetic analysis shows significantly longer branch lengths for the amniote Lbx2 proteins, indicating that these <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes have probably evolved at a quicker rate than the <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes. No evidence was found for distinct Lbx3/4 proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of genomic <italic>Lbx </italic>loci in Osteichthyes</title><p>It is generally held that in the lineage leading to jawed vertebrates, two rounds of whole genome duplication occurred, followed by a further genome duplication in the lineage leading to teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, theoretically, if no gene loss has occurred, four <italic>Lbx </italic>genes should be detectable in extant tetrapods and eight in teleost fish. However, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that only two <italic>Lbx </italic>genes were retained after the second vertebrate genome duplication and before the genome duplication in ray-finned fish. To confirm these results and to further analyse the orthology of the various vertebrate <italic>Lbx </italic>genes, we compared the organisation of genes associated with the vertebrate <italic>Lbx </italic>loci, reasoning that orthologous <italic>Lbx </italic>genes would share a similar chromosomal environment, while paralogous genes would exhibit a distinct arrangement of the locus (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] for examples).</p><p>Since the human genome information is the most accurate and complete, we began by recording the genes that according to the NCBI Map Viewer database are located in the environment of human <italic>LBX1 </italic>and <italic>2 </italic>genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Subsequently, we looked for remnants of the <italic>LBX3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>loci, initially by searching the human genome for paralogues of the genes co-localising with <italic>LBX1 </italic>and <italic>2</italic>. We then identified and determined the arrangement of genes characteristic for each of these four paralogons in the genomes of other mammals, the chicken, the frog <italic>Xenopus tropicalis </italic>and the five teleosts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Human paralogons of the <italic>LBX/TLX </italic>cluster loci</bold>.

Furthermore, the duplicate <italic>Lbx2 </italic>paralogon and the two <italic>Fgf17-Npm2 </italic>paralogons are poorly preserved in teleosts. Therefore, to further confirm the evolutionary relationship of the <italic>Lbx </italic>loci and our assignment of genes to specific paralogons, we carried out a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences encoded by the genes in the various <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>regions. For this, we BLAST-searched sequence databases for related sequences and built phylogenetic trees which included various invertebrate outgroups (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic relationship of genes co-localising with several <italic>Lbx </italic>paralogons</title><p><italic>Btrc/Fbxw11, Mgea, Kazald</italic>, <italic>Ldb </italic>and <italic>Prom </italic>genes occurred at two, <italic>Tlx, Loxl, Slit </italic>and <italic>Dok </italic>genes at three and <italic>Kcnip</italic>, and the linked <italic>Fgf-Npm </italic>genes at four putative <italic>Lbx </italic>loci in tetrapods. If our assignment of <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>paralogons is correct, then the genes that we have assigned to particular paralogons should group together. In addition, if the fundamental lay-out of <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>paralogons was established in vertebrates before the divergence of lobe-finned and ray-finned fish and the additional genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage, then the teleost protein sequences should group with the tetrapod proteins. If, however, distinct <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>loci were maintained in the lineage leading to lobe-finned fish/tetrapods and ray-finned fish/teleosts, then our phylogenetic analysis should reveal additional groups of genes.</p><p>With the exception of Dok2 sequences, which seem to have become highly diverged, all of our analyses supported our assignment of the different <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>paralogons (discussed in detail in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Notably, our analyses of <italic>Ldb </italic>and <italic>Prom1 </italic>genes also support our model that the tetrapod <italic>Lbx2 </italic>loci was originally located in the <italic>Nkx3.2 </italic>containing cluster: the <italic>Ldb2 </italic>sequences, which are associated with <italic>Lbx2 </italic>in teleosts and with the now <italic>Lbx</italic>-less locus carrying <italic>Nkx3.2 </italic>in tetrapods group together, as do the <italic>Prom1 </italic>genes which are linked to <italic>Ldb2-Tapt-Anxa5 </italic>genes and hence, to the current plus the dispersed <italic>Lbx2 </italic>and <italic>Nkx3.2 </italic>loci (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition, our analyses of <italic>Prom2</italic>, <italic>Tlx</italic>, <italic>Kcnip</italic>, <italic>Fgf </italic>and <italic>Npn </italic>genes shows that orthologues associated with the <italic>Lbx1 </italic>and <italic>Lbx4 </italic>paralogons are more closely related to each other than to orthologues associated with the <italic>Lbx2 </italic>and <italic>Lbx3 </italic>paralogons and vice versa. This is most informative for the genes where four paralogues are still linked to potential Lbx loci in extant vertebrates (<italic>Fgf</italic>, <italic>Npm </italic>and <italic>Kcnip </italic>genes). In these cases, we found that <italic>Kcnip1 </italic>and <italic>Kcnip4 </italic>genes are more closely related to each other than to <italic>Kcnip2 </italic>and <italic>3</italic>. Similarly, Fgf8 sequences are closely related to Fgf17 sequences, and Fgf24 sequences are closely related to Fgf18. Finally, the Npm3-Npm2 and Npm4-Npm1 sequences are more closely related to each other, respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that the <italic>Lbx1/4 </italic>paralogons and the <italic>Lbx2/3 </italic>paralagons arose from different ancestral <italic>Lbx </italic>loci generated during the first vertebrate genome duplication.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>Ladybird/Lbx </italic>genes are crucial regulators of metazoan neural and muscle cell specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Yet before this study, it was difficult to evaluate the basic role of <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in vertebrate development and evolution, as it was unclear exactly how many <italic>Lbx </italic>genes exist in different vertebrates and how these genes are phylogenetically related to each other. The 2R hypothesis predicts that early in the vertebrate lineage, four ohnologs were generated for each gene in the genome; for teleosts, descendants of ray-finned fish, a further genome duplication should have produced eight gene copies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However four ohnologs are seldom found in vertebrate genomes, suggesting that gene loss has played an important part in genome evolution. In recent years, two <italic>Lbx </italic>genes were identified in amniotes, one in frogs and one in the teleost <italic>Danio rerio </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

This suggested that <italic>Lbx1, 2 </italic>and <italic>3 </italic>genes were retained in amniotes up to the split of mammalian and avian lineages, while despite their additional genome duplication ray-finned fish seemed to have experienced a near-complete extinction of <italic>Lbx </italic>genes. However, previous <italic>Lbx </italic>gene assignments were sometimes based on limited sequence comparisons, and neither a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis nor a comparative genomic analysis of vertebrate <italic>Lbx </italic>genes had been carried out. Therefore, it remained unclear whether more <italic>Lbx </italic>genes had yet to be found and whether these genes were survivors of <italic>Lbx1, 2, 3 </italic>or <italic>4 </italic>genes.</p><p>In this study, we searched vertebrate sequence databases for <italic>Lbx </italic>genes and determined their phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, we investigated the organisation of <italic>Lbx </italic>gene loci, identified signature genes linked to these loci and established the phylogenetic relationships of these genes. Our study confirms the existence of two <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in amniotes, while only one <italic>Lbx </italic>gene was found, thus far, in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>. However, we were able to detect novel <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in teleosts. Yet, we found no species with the predicted set of four (lobe-finned fish lineage) or eight (ray-finned fish lineage) <italic>Lbx </italic>genes. Thus, in all bony vertebrates, some <italic>Lbx </italic>genes have been lost. Nevertheless, tracing the signature genes linked to different <italic>Lbx </italic>loci, we were able to identify remnants of all four <italic>Lbx </italic>paralogons in tetrapods and all eight <italic>Lbx </italic>paralogons in teleosts. However, only <italic>Lbx1 </italic>and <italic>Lbx2</italic>-type loci retained <italic>Lbx </italic>genes; no evidence for surviving <italic>Lbx3 </italic>or <italic>Lbx4 </italic>genes was found. With cognate tetrapod and fish paralogons displaying a high degree of similarity, this suggests that <italic>Lbx3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>genes were lost before the split of the lobe-finned and ray-finned fish lineages. Finally, our phylogenetic and synteny analyses revealed that <italic>Lbx</italic>-associated genes in <italic>Lbx1-Lbx4 </italic>paralogons and in <italic>Lbx2-Lbx3 </italic>paralogons, respectively, are more closely related. This suggests that <italic>Lbx1 </italic>and <italic>Lbx4 </italic>paralogons originated from one, and <italic>Lbx2 </italic>and <italic>Lbx3 </italic>paralogons from the other, parental paralogon generated during the first round of vertebrate genome duplication.</p><sec><title>Two novel <italic>Lbx </italic>genes were identified in teleosts</title><p>Our searches of genomic databases identified two novel <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in zebrafish, and three <italic>Lbx </italic>genes in <italic>Takifugu rubripes </italic>(fugu), <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>and <italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus </italic>(stickleback). <italic>Oryzias latipes </italic>(medaka) carries two <italic>Lbx </italic>genes, with a sequence gap at the expected position of the third.

Indeed, tetrapod Tlx3 sequences form a phylogenetic group distinct from Tlx1 and Tlx2 sequences, supporting the idea that this gene did not arise from a single gene duplication event. Moreover, <italic>Tlx3 </italic>loci share the same organisation amongst tetrapods and encompass <italic>Btrc2, Fgf18, Npm1, Kcnip1</italic>, and <italic>Slit3</italic>, which according to our phylogenetic analysis are paralogues of the genes found at the <italic>Lbx1 </italic>site. Thus, while <italic>Lbx3 </italic>itself was lost from the <italic>Tlx3 </italic>locus, a number of genes that must have been acquired by the <italic>Nk </italic>cluster prior to the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication are still present.</p><p>Using the previously identified signature genes linked to the <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>loci as query sequences, we also identified remnants of the fourth <italic>Lbx </italic>paralogon. Interestingly, both the <italic>Lbx1/Tlx1 </italic>and the <italic>Tlx3 </italic>locus contain closely linked <italic>Fgf-Npm </italic>genes, and an additional pair of tightly linked <italic>Fgf-Npm </italic>genes, namely <italic>Fgf17 </italic>and <italic>Npm2</italic>, was found in mammals, linked to <italic>Dok2</italic>, <italic>Loxl2</italic>, <italic>Nkx3.1 </italic>and <italic>2.6</italic>.

In some tetrapods the <italic>Loxl2-Nkx3.1-Nkx2.6 </italic>genes were also linked to <italic>Prom2 </italic>and <italic>Kcnip3</italic>. This suggests that <italic>Prom2-Kcnip3 </italic>initially belonged to the fourth <italic>Lbx </italic>paralogon that contains <italic>Fgf17-Npm2 </italic>as well as <italic>Dok2-Loxl2-Nkx3.1-Nkx2.6 </italic>genes, while the placement of <italic>Prom2-Kcnip3 </italic>on the same chromosome but at a distance to <italic>Lbx2 </italic>in humans, cattle and dog (but not mouse) is probably a result of a more recent transposition event. In summary, presence of a number of signature genes for <italic>Lbx </italic>loci linked to <italic>Nkx2.6 </italic>and <italic>Nkx3.1 </italic>suggests that this region is the ancestral home of the lost <italic>Lbx4-Tlx4 </italic>genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Duplicates of the four tetrapod-type <italic>Lbx </italic>loci were identified in teleosts, with two <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes and one <italic>Lbx2 </italic>gene still present</title><p>In teleosts, the two novel, putative <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes were found in two types of genomic settings, both of which contained signature genes for the tetrapod <italic>Lbx1 </italic>locus.

Importantly, <italic>Slc2a15 </italic>and <italic>Fgf8 </italic>genes, which were found at both of the teleost loci as well as the tetrapod <italic>Lbx1 </italic>sites, also formed single groups, indicating that the two novel <italic>Lbx </italic>loci in teleosts arose from a common <italic>Lbx1</italic>-containing ancestor. Consequently, tetrapod <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes and the two novel teleost <italic>Lbx </italic>genes are orthologs.</p><p>Similar to the <italic>Lbx1 </italic>paralogons, the relationship of the now <italic>Lbx</italic>-less <italic>Tlx3 </italic>loci could readily be established. Teleosts harbour one locus containing <italic>Slit3, Kcnip1, Tlx3, Fgf18 </italic>and <italic>Btrc2 </italic>genes in the same order as found at the tetrapod <italic>Tlx3 </italic>site, with the exception of <italic>Tetraodon </italic>whose <italic>Slit3 </italic>gene intercalated between <italic>Kcnip1 </italic>and <italic>Fgf18</italic>. Notably, this <italic>Tlx3 </italic>locus is found on the same chromosome, but with different integration sites, as the gene we propose to rename <italic>Lbx2</italic>, suggesting extensive transposition between <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>loci in teleosts. The second <italic>Tlx3 </italic>locus contains <italic>Kcnip1</italic>-<italic>Npm1 </italic>and in zebrafish also <italic>Tlx3b</italic>, plus a second copy of <italic>Fgf18 </italic>and <italic>Btrc2</italic>. Further shared genes were found in the environment of the tetrapod and teleost <italic>Tlx3 </italic>loci; genes at these sites, including the <italic>Tlx </italic>genes themselves, grouped together in our phylogenetic analyses. This suggests that teleost <italic>Tlx3 </italic>and <italic>Tlx3b </italic>are orthologs of the tetrapod <italic>Tlx3 </italic>genes. The high degree of locus conservation also suggests that the basic lay out of this <italic>Tlx3 </italic>paralogon, including the elimination of <italic>Lbx3</italic>, was established prior to the teleost-specific genome duplication.</p><p>In the zebrafish, the gene currently known as <italic>lbx1 </italic>but placed with mammalian <italic>Lbx2 </italic>in our phylogenetic analyses was found in a genomic environment bearing the hallmarks of the mammalian <italic>Lbx2 </italic>locus, being linked with <italic>Pcgf1</italic>, a <italic>Tlx </italic>gene currently named <italic>Tlx3a, Aup1 </italic>and <italic>Loxl3</italic>. These genes formed monophyletic groups with the cognate genes at the mammalian <italic>Lbx2 </italic>locus, with teleost <italic>Tlx3a </italic>grouping with mammalian <italic>Tlx2</italic>. This suggests that this locus is indeed a <italic>Lbx2 </italic>paralogon. In fugu, <italic>Tetraodon</italic>, stickleback and medaka, the third <italic>Lbx </italic>gene was also linked to <italic>Pcgf1 </italic>and a <italic>Tlx2</italic>-type gene, although <italic>Aup </italic>was located at a distance or in case of <italic>Tetraodon</italic>, on a different chromosome.

Moreover, a duplicate of the <italic>Prom1</italic>-linked gene set was found at the same site. A similar arrangement of genes was also detected in the zebrafish, distributed however between two chromosomes and with individual genes missing from the set. Phylogenetic analyses grouped the genes with the cognate genes at the mammalian and teleost <italic>Lbx2</italic>-bearing sites, suggesting that this location is the second, now <italic>Lbx2/Tlx2</italic>-less <italic>Lbx2 </italic>paralogon in teleosts.

More partial remnants of two further <italic>Nk </italic>clusters have also been identified, one on chromosome 8 with <italic>NKX2.6 </italic>and <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>and one on chromosome 4 with <italic>NKX3.2 </italic>and <italic>NKX1.1</italic>. However, no <italic>LBX </italic>or <italic>TLX </italic>genes are linked to these regions.</p><p>A previous study, based primarily on the human genome, proposed that the <italic>Nkx2.6, 3.1 </italic>and <italic>6.3 </italic>paralogon (located on human chromosome 8) might be the ancestral location of <italic>Lbx2 </italic>and <italic>Tlx2 </italic>(now located on human chromosome 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. By a process of elimination, this would further suggest that <italic>Lbx4 </italic>and <italic>Tlx4 </italic>were lost from the <italic>NKX3.2 </italic>paralogon (currently located on human chromosome 4). Consistent with this hypothesis, paralogs of a few genes (<italic>Kcnip</italic>, <italic>Prom</italic>, <italic>Add</italic>, <italic>Adra2</italic>) are represented at both the <italic>Lbx2 </italic>and the <italic>Nk3.2 </italic>loci in mammals, suggesting that these two loci have derived from separate <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>paralogons. However, phylogenetic analysis of these gene families shows that the mammalian genes linked to the <italic>Lbx2 </italic>loci group with frog, chicken and/or teleost genes associated with <italic>Fgf17 </italic>and <italic>Npm2 </italic>loci (see phylogenetic analysis and discussion in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This suggests that these genes may have translocated to the mammalian <italic>Lbx2 </italic>loci from the putative 4<sup>th </sup><italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>paralogon (e.g. the genes now on human chromosome 2 may have originally been linked to the <italic>Tlx/Lbx </italic>paralogon now on human chromosome 8).</p><p>Consistent with this second interpretation our data suggests that the ancestral location of the <italic>LBX2/TLX2 </italic>paralogon now located on human chromosome 2 was the <italic>NKX3.2 </italic>paralogon on human chromosome 4 (as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The evidence for this is several fold. Firstly, we have identified four distinct <italic>Fgf </italic>and <italic>Npm </italic>genes, with <italic>Fgf8-Npm3 </italic>demarcating <italic>Lbx1/Tlx1 </italic>loci, <italic>Fgf18-Npm1 </italic>the <italic>Tlx3 </italic>loci, <italic>Fgf24-Npm4 </italic>the preserved teleost <italic>Lbx2/Tlx2 </italic>locus and <italic>Fgf17-Npm2 </italic>genes associated with tetrapod and teleost <italic>Nkx2.6-3.1</italic>-<italic>6.3 </italic>genes. Secondly, paralogous <italic>Loxl </italic>and <italic>Dok </italic>genes are present at both the <italic>Lbx2 </italic>locus and the <italic>Nkx2.6-3.1-6.3 </italic>locus, suggesting that these two loci have evolved from different paralogons. Thirdly, amniote orthologs of genes associated with the two teleost <italic>Lbx2 </italic>loci such as <italic>Fbxw7, Ldb2, Prom1, Slit1 </italic>and <italic>Kcnip4 </italic>co-localise with <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>, and these amniote and teleost genes fall into the same phylogenetic groups. Fourthly, the <italic>Lbx2 </italic>locus is still associated with <italic>Nkx3.2 </italic>genes in teleosts, and possibly, also in the chicken (the signature genes linked to the <italic>Lbx2 </italic>locus are assigned to chromosome 4, but their position is not determined). All together, this strongly suggests that the mammalian <italic>Lbx2-Tlx2 </italic>locus was once located in the <italic>Nk </italic>cluster containing <italic>Nkx3.2 </italic>and that <italic>Lbx4 </italic>and <italic>Tlx4 </italic>were lost from the <italic>Nkx2.6-3.1-6.3 </italic>paralogon that contains <italic>fgf17 </italic>and <italic>npm2</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Lbx4</italic>-<italic>Tlx4 </italic>were lost prior to the third genome duplication in ray-finned fish</title><p>If the assignment of <italic>Lbx2-Tlx2 </italic>to the <italic>Nkx3.2 </italic>carrying <italic>Nk </italic>cluster is correct then, as discussed above, the <italic>Nk </italic>cluster containing <italic>Nkx2.6, 3.1 </italic>and <italic>6.3 </italic>(and <italic>fgf17 </italic>and <italic>npm2</italic>) is the former location of the <italic>Lbx4-Tlx4 </italic>paralogon. This idea is supported by the presence of a number of signature genes for <italic>Lbx </italic>loci at this site. Moreover, genes at this locus do not group with paralogues accompanying other <italic>Lbx </italic>loci; most notably, the <italic>Fgf-Npm </italic>and <italic>Kcnip </italic>genes located here constitute distinct phylogenetic groups. Taken together, this suggests that different to <italic>Lbx2-Tlx2 </italic>genes, <italic>Lbx4-Tlx4 </italic>genes did not translocate to another chromosome. Rather, they were lost from this fourth <italic>NK </italic>cluster. Significantly, both teleosts and tetrapods retained a similar set of genes from this locus. This indicates that the basic lay-out of the paralogon, including the elimination of its <italic>Lbx </italic>and <italic>Tlx </italic>genes, was probably established in an ancestor of the Osteichthyes (i.e. prior to the split of the lobe-finned and ray-finned fish lineages).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Lbx </italic>loci in extant vertebrates arose from <italic>Lbx1/4 </italic>and <italic>Lbx2/3 </italic>precursors</title><p>Our study shows that of the genes associated with <italic>Lbx-Tlx </italic>loci, <italic>Fgf</italic>, <italic>Npm </italic>and <italic>Kcnip </italic>genes still exist in four copies, inferring that indeed, the original chordate locus was duplicated twice in the lineage leading to vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that <italic>Fgf8 </italic>genes found in the <italic>Lbx1/Tlx1 </italic>paralogon and <italic>Fgf17</italic>, found in the <italic>Lbx4/Tlx4 </italic>paralogon, are more closely related than <italic>Fgf24 </italic>found in the intact teleost <italic>Lbx2/Tlx2 </italic>paralogon and <italic>Fgf18 </italic>found in the <italic>Lbx3/Tlx3 </italic>paralogon. Similarly, <italic>Npm4 </italic>(teleost <italic>Lbx2/Tlx2 </italic>paralogon) and <italic>Npm1 </italic>(<italic>Lbx3/Tlx3 </italic>paralogon) are closely related to each other, distinguished from <italic>Npm1 </italic>(Tlx3 paralogon) and <italic>Npm4 </italic>(teleost <italic>Lbx2 </italic>paralogon), A similar grouping was found for <italic>Kcnip </italic>genes, with <italic>Kcnip1 </italic>(Tlx3 paralogon) and <italic>Kcnip4 </italic>(teleost Lbx2 and tetrapod Nkx3.2 loci) being the most closely related. This pair-wise grouping is supported by high bootstrap values and suggests that during the second vertebrate genome duplication, <italic>Lbx1 </italic>and <italic>Lbx4 </italic>paralogons arose from one of the <italic>Lbx-Tlx </italic>loci generated by the initial duplication event and <italic>Lbx2 </italic>and <italic>Lbx3 </italic>paralogons arose from the other duplicated locus. Consistent with this model, <italic>Tlx2 </italic>and <italic>Tlx3 </italic>genes are rather similar and are easily distinguished from the <italic>Tlx1 </italic>genes associated with <italic>Lbx1</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Basic roles of <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes and neofunctionalisation of mammalian <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes</title><p>Our analysis shows that the organisation of orthologous <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>paralogons is very similar in extant bony vertebrates, suggesting that the main compositions of the paralogons were established before the divergence of lobe-finned and ray-finned fish. This infers that Osteichthyes had only two types of <italic>Lbx </italic>genes. Expression analyses and functional studies on <italic>Lbx1 </italic>type genes suggest that they all play a role in dorsal spinal cord and muscle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, the zebrafish and chicken <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes are still expressed in muscle precursors, and zebrafish <italic>lbx2 </italic>is also expressed in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, mouse <italic>Lbx2 </italic>is not expressed in these regions, rather labelling the urogenital system, eye and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Amniote Lbx2 proteins also show the most divergent sequences. This suggests that amniote (or potentially sarcopterygian) <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes have evolved at a faster rate than their anamniote (or non-sarcopterygian) orthologs, and undergone neofunctionalisation. Other <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes, however, may have retained aspects of ancestral <italic>Lbx </italic>expression and function, which seems to be tied to the formation of specific neural and muscle cell types.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified remnants of all four <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>paralogons in extant bony vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of <italic>Lbx</italic>, <italic>Tlx </italic>and non-<italic>NK </italic>genes at these loci revealed that the first round of whole genome duplication in vertebrates created the ancestor of the <italic>Lbx1/Tlx1 </italic>and <italic>Lbx4/Tlx4 </italic>paralogons and the ancestor of the <italic>Lbx2/Tlx2 </italic>and <italic>Lbx3/Tlx3 </italic>paralogons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). After the second genome duplication, <italic>Lbx </italic>and <italic>Tlx </italic>genes were lost, such that before the split of the ray-finned fish/teleost and lobe-finned fish/tetrapod lineages only <italic>Lbx1/Tlx1</italic>, <italic>Lbx2/Tlx2 </italic>and <italic>Tlx3 </italic>genes were maintained. In the ray-finned fish lineage, genome duplication and subsequent gene loss left teleosts with two <italic>Lbx1</italic>, one <italic>Lbx2 </italic>and two <italic>Tlx3 </italic>loci. Since the amniote <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes show divergent amino acid sequences and expression patterns, we propose that these <italic>Lbx2 </italic>genes have been evolving at a faster rate and were subject to neofunctionalisation. <italic>Lbx1 </italic>genes on the other hand may have retained more features of the original chordate <italic>lbx </italic>gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>A model of the evolution of the vertebrate <italic>Lbx/Tlx </italic>loci</bold>. <italic>Lbx </italic>loci in extant vertebrates arose from a region containing an <italic>Lbx</italic>, <italic>Tlx</italic>, <italic>Fgf8/17/24/18 </italic>and an <italic>Npm </italic>gene.
