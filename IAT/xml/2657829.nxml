Together, these data suggest that plasma Cys redox potential is not only a biomarker of oxidative stress, but may also be a determinant of immune cell function. Because a number of dietary and behavioral risk factors for disease are known to oxidize Cys redox potential e.g., sulfur amino acid deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Nkabyo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, alcohol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Yeh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, and smoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Moriarty1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>; this provides a mechanistic basis to consider monitoring Cys redox potential as a risk factor for pro-inflammatory states, and consider interventional strategies to control oxidation of Cys redox potential in pro-inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that induction of IL-1&#x003b2; by non-infectious extracellular stimuli, such as ATP and cigarette smoke condensate, occurs by activation of membrane-bound receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Cruz1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Doz1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism by which oxidized extracellular E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS induces pro-IL-1&#x003b2; is unknown, but likely involves the generation of intracellular ROS signaled, in part, via oxidation of membrane-bound thiols. Studies in endothelial cells have revealed increased oxidation of cell-surface protein thiols, induction of intracellular ROS, and activation of NF-&#x0039a;B in response to an oxidizing extracellular E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Go1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The rapid and sustained induction of cellular ROS by oxidized E<sub>h</sub> in the present study is consistent with the same type of mechanism in U937 cells, i.e., the increase in IL-1&#x003b2; by oxidized E<sub>h</sub> could be signaled via the membrane and involve ROS-dependent activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-&#x0039a;B. Interestingly, the increase in ROS by oxidized E<sub>h</sub> occurred in the absence of changes to intracellular E<sub>h</sub> GSH/GSSG. This observation is, however, not unexpected. The major thiol/disulfide control systems GSH, thioredoxin, and Cys exist under non-equilibrium conditions and their redox states are distinctly modified by oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Moriarty1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, substrate availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Nkabyo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Go2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Anderson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, physiological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Blanco1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and pathological stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Hansen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Go2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, the present research shows that the oxidation of plasma E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS during acute endotoxemia <italic>in vivo</italic> occurs without the oxidation of plasma E<sub>h</sub> GSH/GSSG.</p><p>The acute oxidation of E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS by LPS is attenuated in mice supplemented with sulfur amino acids (SAA). This effect could be solely due to dietary augmentation of Cys reserves, an interpretation supported by the 1.4-fold higher plasma Cys concentrations in SAA-supplemented mice. However, plasma CySS does not increase in response to LPS suggesting the additional effects on ROS homeostasis due to SAA supplementation. The more reduced redox potential of the Cys/CySS couple in SAA-supplemented mice is associated with a significant decrease in circulating and tissue levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;. These data suggest that Cys and associated Cys redox potential are critical determinants of cytokine production during activation of the immune system by LPS in mice. Thus, preservation of E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS by SAA supplementation may be involved in decreased IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; levels during endotoxemia. It must be noted, however, that the effects of SAA supplementation may also include preservation of intracellular thiol/disulfide redox status.</p><p>In human nutrition, Cys is a conditionally essential amino acid because Cys requirements are normally met by the transulfuration of dietary methionine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Stipanuk1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Cys requirements increase during infection, injury, and in conditions associated with limited hepatic transulfuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Malmezat1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Hunter1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Because Cys is not routinely added to solutions used in parenteral therapy, patients with sepsis could be particularly susceptible to a deficiency of Cys. Studies in humans have shown that plasma Cys redox potential is modulated fairly rapidly by precursor availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Blanco1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, in the present study we find that plasma Cys in humans in negatively associated with plasma IL-1&#x003b2; levels. Thus, nutritional supplementation with Cys or Cys precursors during early sepsis may be a strategy to alleviate acute inflammation and associated tissue injury.</p><p>In addition to the pathology associated with disregulated cytokine production in conditions such as sepsis; elevated cytokine levels in healthy individuals independently predict risk of chronic diseases such as type II diabetes and atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Cesari1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Spranger1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the association between oxidized E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS and IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; in otherwise healthy individuals suggests that oxidized E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS may represent a risk factor for chronic inflammatory diseases. Accordingly, maintenance of Cys redox potential may be critical in protecting against subclinical inflammation in healthy individuals, and in ameliorating pathological processes associated with chronic inflammation. Large population studies with detailed measurements of known factors affecting redox potential along with pro-inflammatory cytokine markers and disease risk factors are needed to test this concept. Such data are critical because assays are available to assess plasma Cys redox potential in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Jones2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Johnson1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, and simple and inexpensive interventional strategies are available which could improve Cys redox potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-MoriartyCraige1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-MoriartyCraige3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The association between oxidative stress and inflammation is well-recognized and multiple studies have shown that antioxidants such N-acetyl cysteine, have anti-inflammatory effects.
