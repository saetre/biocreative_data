It is increasingly recognized that this intimal inflammation is paralleled over time by a distinct inflammatory reaction in adjacent adventitia. Though cross talk between the coordinated inflammatory foci in the intima and the adventitia seems implicit, the mechanism(s) underlying their communication is unclear. Here, using detailed imaging analysis, microarray analyses, laser-capture microdissection, adoptive lymphocyte transfers, and functional blocking studies, we undertook to identify this mechanism. We show that in aged <italic>apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) beneath intimal plaques in abdominal aortae become activated through lymphotoxin &#x003b2; receptor (LT&#x003b2;R) to express the lymphorganogenic chemokines CXCL13 and CCL21. These signals in turn trigger the development of elaborate bona fide adventitial aortic tertiary lymphoid organs (ATLOs) containing functional conduit meshworks, germinal centers within B cell follicles, clusters of plasma cells, high endothelial venules (HEVs) in T cell areas, and a high proportion of T regulatory cells. Treatment of <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with LT&#x003b2;R-Ig to interrupt LT&#x003b2;R signaling in SMCs strongly reduced HEV abundance, CXCL13, and CCL21 expression, and disrupted the structure and maintenance of ATLOs. Thus, the LT&#x003b2;R pathway has a major role in shaping the immunological characteristics and overall integrity of the arterial wall.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: &#x003b1;-LT&#x003b2;R, agonistic LT&#x003b2;R antibody; AAA, abdominal aorta aneurysm; ATLO, aorta tertiary lymphoid organ; DN, double-negative; FDC, follicular DC; GC, germinal center; GO, gene ontology; HEV, high endothelial venule; LCM, laser-capture microdissection; LT&#x003b2;, lymphotoxin &#x003b2; chain; LT&#x003b2;R, LT&#x003b2; receptor; MAdCAM-1, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1; PNA, peanut agglutinin; PNAd, peripheral LN addressin; SLO, secondary lymphoid organ; SMA, smooth muscle actin; TLO, tertiary lymphoid organ; TNFRSF1A, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Most studies of atherosclerosis to date have focused on intima lesions, which are composed of lipid-laden macrophage/foam cells, T cells, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). These lesion-forming cells elicit persistent inflammation and ultimately trigger adaptive immune responses toward arterial wall&#x02013;derived autoantigens, such as heat shock proteins or oxidized LDL. However, how and where atherosclerosis inflammation is translated into adaptive immune responses, including T and B cell autoimmunity, remains to be fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). It is unlikely that atherosclerotic intimal lesions carry out critical steps of adaptive immune responses themselves. Although such reactions may occur in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), infiltrates of leukocytes in the adventitia of coronary arteries in patients afflicted with atherosclerosis were noted decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and adventitial B cell follicle-like aggregates in human aortae were recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). We and others reported that the adventitia of <italic>apolipoprotein-deficient</italic> (<italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice contained T/B cell aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Although these data supported the concept that arterial wall inflammation spreads from the intima to the adventitia, the impact of adventitial immunity on arterial wall biology remains puzzling and unresolved. Moreover, the mechanism of how the inflammation spreads between the intima and the adventitia is unknown. The cellular composition of the two inflammatory foci is distinct, and there is no histological evidence that inflammatory cells readily traverse the medial SMC compartment to mediate steady and ongoing communication between the intima and adventitia. Indeed, passage of lymphocytes and phagocytes through the medial compartment of great arteries is typically minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), rendering the media itself some of the properties of immunoprivileged tissues.</p><p>Here, we have set out to characterize the mechanistic basis of communication between the two compartments, as we have reasoned that meeting the long-term goal of understanding whether the adventitial inflammation has either a beneficial or pathological role in atherosclerosis may require experimental manipulation of the inflammatory response in the adventitia itself. We now report that medial SMCs underlying intimal plaques become activated, and through a lymphotoxin &#x003b2; receptor (LT&#x003b2;R)-dependent signaling pathway, are induced to express CXCL13/CCL21, which in turn drives recruitment of T/B cell aggregates. These aggregates are precursors of fully structured aorta tertiary lymphoid organs (ATLOs) that contain large numbers of regulatory T cells (T reg cells), germinal centers (GCs), high endothelial venules (HEVs), and LN-like conduits that connect ATLOs to the medial SMC compartment and likely sustain and amplify the adventitial response. These data reveal how the intima and adventitia communicate to develop a coordinated reaction, even in an anatomical region where inflammatory cell traffic between the two compartments is limited.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>ATLO neogenesis occurs in old <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and is confined to lesion-burdened abdominal aorta</title><p>We searched for ATLOs in 6&#x02013;130-wk-old mice (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 30) using a three-stage classification scheme (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080752/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080752/DC1</ext-link>).

SLOs arise during development at predetermined locations, whereas TLOs emerge in adults at diverse sites in response to persistent inflammation, such as in autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). Unlike SLOs, TLOs are often accompanied by tissue destruction with progressing clinical symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Although common forms of atherosclerosis, including coronary heart disease, are recognized chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), this work is the first to characterize ATLOs associated with this disease in detail. These data in particular provide mechanistic insight into how, where, and when ATLOs form, and our findings also offer insight into possible roles that ATLOs may have in atherosclerosis.</p><p>Concerning the mechanisms of ATLO neogenesis, our findings suggest the new concept that medial SMCs translate signals from the overlying atherosclerotic plaques to promote ATLO neogenesis. We show that SMCs beneath atherosclerotic plaques become activated through LT&#x003b2;R and TNFRSF1A signaling to express CXCL13 and CCL21. Indeed, these activated SMCs acquired prototypical features of mesenchymal cells termed lymphoid tissue organizers that were originally described to control embryonic LN development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). It is well established that certain stromal cells resembling myofibroblasts may differentiate into lymphoid tissue organizers in adult organisms. These lymphoid tissue organizers interact with hyperactivated lymphocytes that are attracted to inflamed tissues and thereby organize TLO neogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). It is also known that lymphoid tissue organizers can acquire different phenotypes, as seen with activated intestinal fibroblasts in inflammatory bowel disease or activated synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Our findings suggest that SMCs in the aorta adjacent to ATLOs become lymphoid tissue organizers.</p><p>The lymphoid organization that they bring about is profound, as the level of cellular and structural organization in ATLOs was akin to organization previously only observed in LNs and spleen. ATLOs harboured all hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lineages, cell subtypes, and structures that are required to support lymphocyte recruitment and recirculation and to conduct antigen-dependent (auto)immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). These included FDCs, proliferative B cells that were differentiated and organized in follicles, T/B cell interactions in separate T cell areas, two major T reg cell subsets, and plasma cells (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). In addition, newly formed conduits establish an elaborate network connecting ATLOs to the medial SMC. This conduit network likely further facilitates and amplifies ongoing communication between ATLOs and the medial SMCs, and possibly overlying plaque, as these conduits could serve as channels for both soluble antigen and transport of molecules (e.g., chemokines, cytokines) between the activated media and ATLOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Our findings show that intravenously infused low molecular weight tracers could access and move through the conduits, highlighting their functionality, though the vector of molecular diffusion could not be determined.</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic choreography of cells and molecules in ATLO neogenesis.</bold> Blood monocytes/macrophages/foam cells, T cells, and SMCs form atherosclerotic lesions in the intima and initiate a transmural arterial wall inflammation pathway. Lesion cells such as CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and/or CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup> myeloid cells and T cells produce TNFR agonists LT&#x003b2; and TNF and, after LT&#x003b2;R/TNFRSF1A activation and induction of alternative and classical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways, media SMCs are activated and acquire features of lymphoid tissue organizers. Lymphorganogenic CXCL13/CCL21 and other mediators gain access to cells residing in the adventitia, recruit B and T cells through vasa vasora, and promote lymphocyte and stromal cell activation. A tissue microenvironment is then generated that induces conduit neogenesis via stimulation of reticular fibroblasts, DC recruitment, HEV formation, ectopic lymph vessel, and blood vessel neogenesis. ATLO formation accelerates and lymphocyte recirculation is markedly facilitated, B cell follicles form, and T reg cells in T cell areas are recruited. Transmural inflammation also generates autoantigen(s), although their nature, transport routes, and functional roles all remain to be defined. Accelerated B cell recruitment leads to B cell follicle formation, and ectopic GCs are activated. Autoantigen-binding FDCs initiates B cell proliferation, differentiation, and affinity maturation. Memory cells and/or plasma cells, and possibly autoreactive T/B cells, together with T reg cell deficiency may lead to clinically apparent and overt autoimmunity and arterial wall pathology.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2060233f10"></graphic></fig><p>An important observation in our analysis was the restriction of ATLOs to the abdominal aortae of aged <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Interestingly, it is the area of ATLO formation where abdominal aorta aneurysms (AAAs) preferentially form in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), raising the possibility that ATLOs are linked in some way to AAA. Leukocyte infiltrates have been associated with AAA, but the importance of T or B cells is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). Because we observed elastic fiber erosion adjacent to ATLO-associated media, we speculate that B cell and/or T cell aggregates in the adventitia of abdominal aortae may contribute to atherosclerosis and AAA pathology. In this context, our findings suggest that <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may serve as a suitable animal model that recapitulates similar events in the human abdominal aorta.</p><p>Though B cell follicles were prominent in the adventitia of aged <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we did not find a high rate of B cell trafficking into the adventitia after adoptive transfer of splenic B cells. It is possible that B cells in the adventitia may expand locally in response to aortic wall antigens. The ongoing GC reactions in ATLOs support this possibility, and from the limited work in human coronary arteries, we anticipate that the range of B cell clones in the adventitia may be broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Nonetheless, ATLO GC reactions may control antigen-dependent affinity maturation similar to the TLO GC B cell progeny of rheumatoid arthritis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). Although innate B cells appear to be atheroprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), it remains possible that autoreactive B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>) may be generated during later stages of the disease and contribute to plaque growth and/or AAA pathology.</p><p>With regard to the ATLO T cell compartment, it was remarkable to observe that a substantial proportion of ATLO T cells were regulatory in nature, with abundant populations of two major T reg cell subsets. Given indications that Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells are atheroprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), it is tempting to suggest that ATLO T reg cells confer a benefit to the host, but the veracity of this idea remains to be determined. Furthermore, it will be important to determine if the disproportionate number of T reg cells in the adventitial infiltrates holds true in all adventitial leukocyte accumulations, including those more diffuse T cell infiltrates that occur before or without accompanying B cells. The surprisingly high percentage of T reg cells in ATLOs versus the more diffuse infiltrate in the thoracic aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) suggests that both T reg cell subsets home into or proliferate within ATLOs subsequent to the formation of the diffuse T cell&#x02013;dominated infiltrate of the thoracic aorta. It will also be important in future work to determine if the substantial recirculation of T cells into the adventitia compared with that of B cells in our adoptive transfer studies was limited to a large proportion of T reg cells or whether T reg cells particularly expanded in situ. Because the treatment of <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with LT&#x003b2;R-Ig greatly reduced HEV abundance, and because HEVs in turn mediate T cell recruitment into ATLOs, our data imply that continuous LT&#x003b2;R activation maintains a high rate of aorta T cell recirculation. Thus, manipulation of the LT&#x003b2;R pathway may be one means to regulate the accumulation of T cells, including T reg cells in diseased arteries.</p><p>An unresolved issue requiring further investigation is the source of ligand to activate LT&#x003b2;R signaling in medial SMCs. The presence of CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD68<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the media between ATLOs and atherosclerotic plaques led us to consider the possibility that CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD68<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes that accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques might be a source of the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). In agreement with this possibility, we found that Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes expressed higher levels of LT&#x003b2; compared with more classical Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes. Studies to manipulate LT&#x003b2; expression selectively in these monocytes would help to determine whether they serve as the source of activating signal in the induction of ATLOs through SMC activation.</p><p>A major issue raised by our data relates to the functional impact of ATLOs on atherosclerosis. It is not surprising that the short treatment period of severely diseased and aged <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with LT&#x003b2;R-Ig failed to significantly reverse or aggravate the disease in standard atherosclerosis assays (unpublished data). To circumvent this limitation, it may be valuable to generate <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with tissue-selective deletion of the LT&#x003b2;R in SMCs or deletion of LT&#x003b2; in leukocytes subsets known to affect TLOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). While these experiments are underway, our data encourage reexamination of the roles of immune cell subsets in advanced stages of atherosclerosis as opposed to early stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). As pointed out above, most studies in mice have focused on the early stages of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), when autoreactive T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>) may not yet have had the opportunity to be fully activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). That natural T reg cells and the CD137/CD137L pair (which are both implicated in the regulation of tolerance and autoimmunity) control the development of atherosclerosis was recently demonstrated in hyperlipidemic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>), and here we have identified two T reg cell subsets in ATLOs. It is well established that autoimmune diseases develop in clinically separable phases and only in their late stages, when tolerance toward autoantigen(s) is breaking down, do they convert to explicit self-reactivity associated with debilitating tissue destruction. Similar multistage immune responses may occur in atherosclerosis. Clinically overt disease such as myocardial infarction is a late event triggered by plaque rupture and endothelial cell erosion. It will be of considerable interest to examine the possibility that these events are caused by autoreactive T- and/or B cells and/or autoantibodies, as well as dysfunction of T reg cells on the diseased arterial wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our data should help to advance experiments in aged <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to test the efficacy of pharmaceuticals that have been developed to treat autoimmune disorders.

Probe sets were included if in one group a minimum of 2 arrays was called present (detection P &#x02264; 0.05) and 2 or 3 arrays showed a log signal &#x02265;log2(200). Recorded genes were required to be up-regulated from 6&#x02013;78 wk with a fold change of at least log2(2.5). Using the data from the three <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> groups, the resulting list was subjected to a one-factor analysis of variance with Benjamini and Hochberg correction for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>). 1,163 probe sets were significantly differentially expressed (P &#x02264; 0.05) and used for further analyses (Table S1).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cluster analysis.</title><p>Group means of the selected probe sets were standardized to zero mean and unit variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>). A fuzzy c-means algorithm was applied with the euclidean metric and fuzzy parameter FP &#x0003d; 1.2. Using the maximum-membership function, hard cluster assignments were identified for the best out of 30 runs of the fuzzy c-means algorithm with random initial partitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>). Data were used to exploit the different time windows of atherosclerosis formation and ATLO development. For this purpose, each probe set of a presumed atherosclerosis cluster was required to show significant up-regulation between 6 and 32 wk (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>, Table S1, and Fig. S4), whereas each probe set of a presumed ATLO cluster was required to show significant up-regulation between 32 and 78 wk (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>, Table S1, and Fig. S4 B). This approach ascertained that genes that were up-regulated between 6 and 32 wk were segregated from genes that were newly appearing during the time window 32 to 78 wk. GO molecular function terms in both clusters confirmed the marked expression of macrophage/inflammation genes in the atherosclerosis cluster whereas the ATLO cluster showed preferential expression of B cell immunity and adaptive immune-effector genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Table S1). Although many genes in each cluster have multiple biological functions depending on their tissue-specific expression and local biology, these data provide preliminary evidence that the atherosclerosis cluster contained genes that largely represent the influx of blood-derived monocytes into the arterial wall intima, including multiple inflammation-regulating genes, whereas the ATLO cluster contained genes known to regulate embryonic LN development and TLO formation with a major overrepresentation component of genes regulating B cell maturation, GC formation, plasma cells (immunoglobulin genes), autoimmunity, and affinity maturation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Selected transcripts were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. S5).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>LCM procedure.</title><p>LCM was performed using a Palm MicroBeam laser system (PALM Microlaser Technologies AG) according to published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref>) with slight modifications. 10 sections (10 &#x003bc;m) of the abdominal aorta were placed on cooled PEN membrane-covered glass slides (PALM Industries). Slides were dried 10 min at 45&#x000b0;C and stored in an exsiccator. Approximately 200 unstained sections for each arterial wall compartment/array were obtained. Each section was collected from the membrane and transferred to Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted and purified using RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN). As a first step to ascertain reproducibility, RNA integrity, validity, and reliability of our LCM protocol, we established protocols to obtain various aorta arterial wall compartments. Unstained phase contrast images of 10 &#x003bc;m serial fresh-frozen tissue sections showed that the media/adventitia border (and for diseased arteries in <italic>apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, the media/atherosclerotic intima lesion border) could be readily identified before immunohistochemical staining caused by contrast-rich elastin fibers in the media. This allowed us to omit immunofluorescence staining before LCM. These data provide comprehensive information on media SMC gene expression of constitutively expressed genes (GEO accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="geo" xlink:href="GSE10000">GSE10000</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Adoptive transfer experiments.</title><p>Lymphocyte recirculation assays were done as previously described, with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In brief, total splenocytes were isolated from 12-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice, and erythrocytes were treated with lysis buffer (QIAGEN). Cells were labeled with 5 &#x003bc;M CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) for 10 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After washing, up to 35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CFSE-labeled cells were injected into the tail vein of 40- or 90-wk-old <italic>apoE</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. 3 or 18 h after cell transfer, recipient mice were killed and whole aorta with adjacent LNs (i.e., renal, caudal, lumbar, and inguinal LNs) were cryo-preserved. Sections were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy at 18 h when &#x0003e; 90% of blood CFSE<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells had left the circulation. To reduce unspecific autofluorescence of lipid deposits of the plaque region, LSM510 software was used. For this purpose two laser lines were applied separately to the same specimen. The first laser (488 nm) detected CFSE-specific signals as well as autofluorescence, and the second unrelated laser (543 nm) was used to visualize unspecific autofluorescence.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>In situ hybridization.</title><p>In situ hybridization was performed on cryostat tissue sections as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref>), with slight modifications.
