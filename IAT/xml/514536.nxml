We attach a His<sub>6</sub>-tag to one of the subunits of each complex and then co-express it together with the other subunits in <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> insect cells. The CDK complexes are subsequently purified by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA and Mono S chromatography. This approach generates large amounts of active recombinant kinases that are devoid of contaminating kinase activities. Importantly, the properties of these recombinant kinases are similar to their natural counterparts (Pinhero <italic>et al</italic>. 2004, Eur J Biochem 271:1004-14). Our protocol provides a novel systematic approach for the purification of these three (and possibly other) recombinant CDKs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cyclin-Dependent Kinases</kwd><kwd>Baculoviridae</kwd><kwd>Isolation and Purification</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play important roles in the regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle and gene expression. They represent a family of Ser/Thr protein kinases that are critically dependent on their association with a cyclin partner (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition, these kinases are regulated by a variety of mechanisms including phosphorylation events, association with inhibitory proteins and assembly factors, and protein degradation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Three CDKs (CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9) have been implicated in the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The phosphorylation of this domain is essential for several post-initiation events during the synthesis of mRNA in all eukaryotes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It is important that CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9 are biochemically and functionally distinct kinases (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) that execute non-redundant functions during the transcription reaction (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). CDK7 exists in several forms including a core tri-partite CDK7/CycH/MAT1 complex known as CAK (cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase), as a component in the general transcription factor TFIIH and as a component of larger complexes containing pol II and other transcription factors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). CDK8/CycC exists as a bipartite complex, but has also been found in a variety of complexes that contain pol II and general pol II transcription factors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). CDK9 was initially identified as P-TEFb (Positive Transcription Elongation Factor-b) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Independently, CDK9/CycT1 has been isolated as the HIV-tat associated kinase TAK (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>CDK7/CycH/MAT1 acts as a cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase that phosphorylates and activates different CDKs in <italic>Xenopus </italic>and mammalian extracts (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). As a component of the general transcription factor TFIIH, this complex also phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of pol II. The retinoic acid receptors (RAR)-&#x003b1;-1 and (RAR)-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the transactivator Oct-1 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and the tumor suppressor p53 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) have also been identified as substrates of CDK7. The substrate preferences of CDK8/CycC and CDK9/CycT1 have not been extensively characterized.</p><p>All of the previous studies on CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9 were carried out with kinases that were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts or by epitope-tagged recombinant kinases that were purified by analytical scale affinity schemes (for references see (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)). In many cases, the homogeneity of the preparations and the presence of contaminating kinase activities were not systematically addressed. In order to circumvent these problems and the variance that could result from the differences in the purification strategies, we designed a uniform procedure for the purification of recombinant CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9 complexes. Using these recombinant kinases, we identified additional differences in the preference of these kinases towards different parts of the pol II CTD (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In this manuscript, we provide extensive details on the expression/purification protocols for the three recombinant kinases that will be of use in future attempts to prepare these as well as other cyclin-dependent kinases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title><bold>Expression vectors</bold></title><sec><title><italic>a.

Sf9 cells at density of 0.1-0.3x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml were infected with individual viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1-1. The infected cells were incubated for 5-6 days. The efficiency of infection was monitored by the loss of adherence and the larger size of the cells. The supernatant from these cultures was used to infect a larger Sf9 culture of density 0.5-1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml at a MOI of 1. The culture was incubated for 4-5 days, cells were spun and the supernatant was immediately used or stored at -80&#x000b0;C for up to six months.

These amounts correspond to 100-500 fold molar excess of substrate versus kinase. It is important to note that the GST-CTD molecule has at least 52 sites of phosphorylation (52 repeats with a consensus YSPTSPS) on a single molecule, thus additionally increasing the kinase/substrate ratio. MBP also contains multiple sites of phosphorylation. Under the described conditions the kinase reactions are linear for at least three hours (data not shown). The kinase reactions were incubated for 30 minutes at 30&#x000b0;C and terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then boiled for 5 minutes. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels and autoradiography.

Each virus was applied at MOI of 4. Preliminary experiments have shown that this MOI generates the highest level of expression for all the CDKs and that further increase in MOI did not yield more protein. The expression of the different subunits of the CDK complexes was verified by Western blot with antibodies against CDK7, CycH, MAT1, CDK8, CycC and CDK9. These westerns were not quantitative and do not necessarily mean that all peptides were expressed at similar levels.</p><p>Monolayer Sf9 cells in large T-flasks were infected at high density (1.5-2x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml). We found that this high cell density did not lead to poorer expression or protein degradation as compared to infection at lower cell density (0.5-1 x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml). Considering the high cost of growth medium, this approach is more economical. We have not tested if the same trend applies to infecting Sf9 cells that are maintained in suspension.</p><p>An important consideration derived from the Western blot analyses was the choice of individual expression of the CDKs and cyclins and their subsequent reconstitution <italic>in vitro</italic> versus co-expression and assembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both approaches were applied in the past (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Although the Westerns blot analyses were not quantitative, we noticed that a higher level of expression of individual peptides was achieved by co-infection as compared to infection with individual viruses. These observations suggest that complex formation <italic>in vivo</italic> stabilizes the individual peptides and increases the yields of recombinant proteins. Therefore, we recommend that the production of these kinase complexes is carried out by co-infection rather than individual expression and mixing of the extracts <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is also important to mention that the mixing of the extracts <italic>in vitro</italic> poses the risk of inadequate modifications of the individual peptides <italic>in vivo</italic> that might lead to altered properties of the reconstituted kinases (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Confirmation of complex formation by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA pull-down assay</bold></title><p>We confirmed the formation of complexes between the recombinant proteins by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA pull-down assay.

In the case of His<sub>6</sub>-CDK9/CycT1, the peak containing the complex (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, lanes 19-23) was preceded by fractions that contained predominantly His<sub>6</sub>-CDK9 (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, lanes 15-18). Again, the profile of peptides in the Mono S chromatography fractions clearly indicates that the affinity chromatography step purifies a mixture of assembled complexes and monomeric tagged polypeptides. This observation should be considered if the properties of the monomeric subunits versus the assembled complex are to be analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Recovery of recombinant CDKs</bold></title><p>We estimate that, on an average, from 1 liter culture of infected Sf9 cells, we purified about 115 mg<bold>, </bold>880 mg and 1.2 mg of pure CDK7/His<sub>6</sub>-CycH/MAT1, His<sub>6</sub>-CDK8/CycC and His<sub>6</sub>-CDK9/CycT1 respectively. We suspect that the lower yield of CDK7/ His<sub>6</sub>-CycH/MAT1 is stemming from its poorer affinity towards Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA agarose as exemplified by its elution at lower imidazole concentration (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Activity of the kinases</bold></title><fig id="F5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of GST-CTD and MBP by CDK7/His6-CycH/MAT1, His6-CDK8/CycC and His6-CDK9/CycT1.</title><p> Lanes 1, 4, and 7 are kinases without any substrate. CDK8 and CDK9 have background bands that resulted from their autophosphorylation.

CDK8 and CDK9 produced only the IIa form.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bpo_v6_p163_m86f5lg"/></fig><p>The functional activities of the purified kinases were studied using GST-CTD and MBP as substrates ((<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>)). All the kinases phosphorylated GST-CTD and MBP (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). CDK7/His<sub>6</sub>-CycH/MAT1 transferred 1.6 and 0.94 nmols of ATP/min/mg protein with GST-CTD and MBP as substrates, respectively. The His<sub>6</sub>-CDK8/CycC preparations showed somewhat lower specific activities of 0.1 and 0.15 nmols of ATP/min/mg protein with GST-CTD and MBP, whereas the specific activities for His<sub>6</sub>-CDK9/CycT1 were 0.38 and 3.74 nmols of ATP/min/mg protein. No kinase activity was detected in the corresponding fractions from non-infected Sf9 cell. Importantly, the purified kinases displayed distinct patterns of CTD phosphorylation, which were reported elsewhere (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>As reported by others, roscovitine is a potent inhibitor of CDK7 and CDK9, but not CDK8 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), whereas DRB inhibits CDK9 at lower concentrations as compared to CDK7 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We used this information and performed several experiments to confirm the catalytical purity of the kinases. In Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, we show that, in agreement with the literature, roscovitine strongly inhibits CDK7/His<sub>6</sub>-CycH/MAT1 (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, upper panel, lanes 1-5), but not His<sub>6</sub>-CDK8/CycC (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, upper panel, lanes 6-10). In addition, we also show that His<sub>6</sub>-CDK9/CycT1 (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, upper panel, lanes 11-15) is equally sensitive to roscovitine as compared to CDK7/His<sub>6</sub>-CycH/MAT1 (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, upper panel, lanes 1-5, see also the graph in the lower panel of the figure). DRB is a potent inhibitor of His<sub>6</sub>-CDK9/CycT1 (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, lower panel, lanes 11-15) and a moderate inhibitor of CDK7/His<sub>6</sub>-CycH/MAT1 (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, lower panel, lanes 1-5). His<sub>6</sub>-CDK8/CycC showed intermediate sensitivity to DRB (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, lower panel, lanes 6-10). Together, this data shows the expected inhibition patterns of these kinases with two independent kinase inhibitors thus supporting the notion of their catalytic purity.</p><fig id="F6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Effect of roscovitine and DRB on the phosphorylation of GST-CTD by CDK7/His6-CycH/MAT1, His6-CDK8/CycC and His6-CDK9/CycT1.</title><p> Roscovitine and DRB were added to the kinase reaction mixtures at concentrations indicated and kinase reactions were carried out as described in Materials and Methods.

When CDK complexes are obtained by different expression/purification methods, there is a real risk for the introduction of contaminating kinases and other peptides. Consequently, the comparison of such complexes can be impaired by the nature of the impurities. This concern is especially valid when working with immunoprecipitated complexes, which may contain other kinases that are difficult to track. If the immunoprecipitates are derived from crude extracts, it is also possible that the experiment will be conducted with multiple forms of these complexes that share the same CDK component (see (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) for reference).</p><p>Many of the studies that have characterized CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9 have used either immunoprecipitated enzyme complexes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) or different methods for purification of different kinases (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In order to achieve a high precision in the comparison of the three CDK complexes, we expressed and purified them by a uniform procedure. This procedure generates large amounts of kinases that are practically devoid of other kinase activities. It is important that this procedure enabled us to identify distinct preferences of CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9 towards different parts of pol II CTD (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This analysis is demanding. The CTD consists of 52 repeats of a Ser/Thr-rich consensus heptapeptide (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) which might attract promiscuous kinase activities. We believe that our success in these analyses demonstrates the high value of the proposed procedure.</p><p>We did not detect measurable CTD kinase activities in the corresponding fractions from uninfected cells, meaning that our preparations are not contaminated with independent co-purifying CTD kinase activities. At the same time, we observed different patterns of contaminating peptides in the preparations of CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9. Our interpretation is that these peptides co-purified probably because of interactions with the complexes. We are not sure how these peptides contributed to the activity and specificity of each kinase. The inhibitory studies with roscovitine and DRB (see Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and juglone (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) suggest that most if not all of the CTD kinase activities should be attributed to the recombinant kinases. However, we can not exclude the possibility that minor amounts of very active contaminating kinases could alter the results with other substrates. We recommend that a set of inhibitory studies is preformed with each substrate to minimize these risks.</p><p>A similar, but not identical procedure for the purification of His-CDK9/CycT1 was used in an earlier study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The procedures for the purification of His<sub>6</sub>-CDK8/CycC and CDK7/His<sub>6</sub>-CycH/MAT1 are novel.</p><p>We believe that our systematic approach can be applied effectively to characterize other CDKs. In addition, we believe that the presented details on the purification of the three CDKs can be of use when other finer analyses of CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9 are conducted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
