The nucleotide sequence of this particular region (5702 base pairs) of the CIV genome was determined. The DNA sequence contains a number of perfect direct, inverted, and palindromic repeats including three clusters of tandemly organized repetitive DNA elements located between the nucleotide positions 1534 to 1566, 3720 to 3780, and 4350 to 4450. Eight long open reading frames (ORFs; EF1 to 8) were detected in the sequenced region of the CIV genome. ORF EF1 encodes a putative protein of 221 amino acid residues (aa) that is closely related to eukaryotic nonhistone chromosomal proteins of the high mobility group (HMG) superfamily. Virus encoded homologues of HMG proteins have not been reported so far. The EF2 gene product (145 aa) contains a specific zinc finger motif and belongs to a distinct group of identified and putative zinc finger proteins including a second putative protein (239 aa) of CIV encoded in the EcoRI DNA fragment Y (1984 bp; 0.381 to 0.391 viral map units). The product of EF6 (127 aa) is related to D250 ORF product of African swine fever virus (ASFV) and belongs to the recently described protein family sharing a highly conserved sequence motif with bacterial antimutator GTP phosphohydrolase MutT. Thus the sequenced region of the CIV genome encodes three putative proteins which may be directly involved in the replication and/or transcription of the viral DNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0055-a" xlink:role="159"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="158"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="159"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="160"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="161"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="162"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="163"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="164"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="165"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00026-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="166"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
