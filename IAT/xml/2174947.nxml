Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of a shared 34-nucleotide (nt) sequence stretch located at -81 to -48 in all <italic>edn </italic>promoters and macaque <italic>ecp </italic>promoter. Such a unique sequence motif constituted a region essential for transactivation of human <italic>edn </italic>in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay, transient transfection and scanning mutagenesis experiments allowed us to identify binding sites for two transcription factors, Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) and SV-40 protein-1 (Sp1), within the 34-nt segment. Subsequent <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>binding assays demonstrated a direct molecular interaction between this 34-nt region and MAZ and Sp1. Interestingly, overexpression of MAZ and Sp1 respectively repressed and enhanced <italic>edn </italic>promoter activity.

Their gene products belong to members of the human RNaseA superfamily, which comprises RNase1-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The eosinophil RNases EDN and ECP are secreted to body fluid and have neurotoxic, helminthotoxic, and ribonucleolytic activities. Previously, we demonstrated that ECP enters neuroendocrine cells through protein-protein interactions with a granular protease, which in turn allows the cytotoxic ECP to inhibit growth of the target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, the signal peptide of ECP is toxic to bacteria and yeast and induces expression of transforming growth factor &#x003b1; in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although both genes are expressed in eosinophils, <italic>edn</italic>, rather than <italic>ecp</italic>, can be extensively expressed in various tissues including liver, spleen, and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], whereas <italic>ecp </italic>is restrictively expressed in blood granulocytes. In terms of gene structure, <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>are similar as they both contain an intron between a noncoding exon 1 and a coding exon 2. Each of these genes is translated from exon 2, and the sequence identity of the DNA in the coding region is 85% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has been proposed that <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>were evolved through a duplication event about 31 million years ago in the evolutionary lineage of New World and Old World monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Gene duplication and subsequent functional divergence of duplicated genes is one of the important mechanisms for evolution of novel gene functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the regulatory motifs in promoter regions of duplicated genes are generally conserved during duplication events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Previously, three important transcription factor binding sites, C/EBP, NFAT-1 and PU.1 were discovered in the promoter regions of both <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp</italic>, and the non-translating exon 1 as well as intron 1 could enhance the promoter activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although as high as 92% sequence identity was observed in the upstream 1-kb regions of human <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp</italic>, much higher <italic>edn </italic>promoter activity was observed. Therefore, whether any sequence stretch located in the upstream regions of primate eosinophil <italic>rnases </italic>may govern regulatory transcription of <italic>ecp </italic>and <italic>edn </italic>was investigated employing cross-species sequence comparison, transcription element prediction and functional validation.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><sec><title>Primate <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>promoters share high sequence similarity</title><p>We amplified and sequenced primate eosinophil <italic>rnase </italic>promoter fragments, -921 to -1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and -937 to -1 relative to the human <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>transcription start site, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], from individual of six nonhuman primate species. These primate species represent independent genera from three great apes (<italic>P. pygmaeus, G. gorilla, P. troglodytes</italic>), one Old World monkey (<italic>M. fascicularis</italic>), and one New World monkey (<italic>S. sciureus</italic>). The sequence data have been submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ171721">DQ171721</ext-link>&#x02013;<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ171729">DQ171729</ext-link>). Multiple sequence alignment by ClustalW showed that the identities among primate <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>promoter sets were greater than 95% and 91%, respectively. In consistence with what Zhang and Rosenberg have characterized, the sequences of the 5' promoter regions of <italic>P. troglodytes </italic>(chimpanzee) <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>determined in this study were identical to those reported in AF294016-AF294018 and AF294027-294028, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative analysis reveals deletion of a 34-nt segment in the <italic>ecp </italic>promoter</title><p>Conventional multiple sequence alignment of primate <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>promoters revealed greater than 90% identity in the duplicated eosinophil <italic>rnases </italic>in each species, indicating that the promoter sequence patterns of all sequenced primate eosinophil <italic>rnases </italic>were quite similar. Interestingly, MISA analysis of 11 promoters showed a remarkably high degree of similarity as illustrated by the color-coded bars, and a 34-nt segment with significantly high variation was located at -81 to -48 as indicated by dotted grey grids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This characteristic sequence motif was present in promoters of all representative primate <italic>edns</italic>, but for <italic>ecp </italic>only in macaque. Since primate eosinophil <italic>rnases </italic>have been recognized to be emerged from a gene duplication event after divergence of Old World monkeys and New World monkeys, this finding suggests the possibility that the eosinophil <italic>rnase </italic>promoters might have further evolved after the duplication event.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A 34-nt region is present in primate <italic>edn </italic>and macaque <italic>ecp </italic>promoters</bold>.

The Furthermore, primate eosinophil <italic>rnase </italic>promoter sequences corresponding to -921 to -1 of human <italic>edn </italic>and -887 to -1 of human <italic>ecp </italic>were analyzed by MEGA 3.1, and the phylogenetic relationship between <italic>ecp </italic>and <italic>edn </italic>promoter sequences among different species is was illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>. The results showed that the <italic>ecp </italic>and <italic>edn </italic>promoters branched when the 34-nt segment disappeared in some species, in agreement with the notion that <italic>ecp </italic>and <italic>edn </italic>were the most rapidly evolving coding sequences of primate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The phylogenetic tree of <italic>ecp </italic>and <italic>edn </italic>promoter sequences suggested another evolutional event by which deletion of the 34-nt sequence stretch might have occurred in the lineage Old Word monkey and hominoid.</p></sec><sec><title>Presence of the 34-nt segment enhances transcriptional activities</title><p>Expression of human <italic>edn </italic>is dependent on the interaction between an intronic enhancer element(s) and the 5' promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The transcription activities of human <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>promoters in hematopoietic cell lines were previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, <italic>edn </italic>was demonstrated not only expressed in thymus but also in liver tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and its mRNA expression has been identified in hematopoietic cell line and liver tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, both <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>mRNAs were expressed in HL-60 clone 15 cells, but only <italic>edn </italic>mRNA was detected in HepG2 cells. Therefore, HepG2 cell line was used for further investigation of differential transcription regulation of <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp</italic>. In order to understand the sequences involved in the interaction, we constructed individually the +1 to +297 region containing exon 1 and intron 1 of <italic>ecp </italic>and <italic>edn </italic>promoters, along with the preceding promoter region into the pGL3-Basic plasmid. Here a liver cell line HepG2, known to express <italic>edn </italic>(<italic>epx</italic>) effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was used to investigate the transcriptional activities of human <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>promoters in the presence and absence of the 34-nt segment. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, HepG2 cells transfected with constructs containing human <italic>edn </italic>with the -81/-48 segment deleted (pGL3-<italic>edn</italic>&#x00394;(-81/-48)), human <italic>ecp </italic>(pGL3-<italic>ecp</italic>), human <italic>ecp </italic>with the 34-nt region inserted (pGL3-<italic>ecp</italic>+(-81/-48)) exhibited only 40%, 20% and 40% transcriptional activity, respectively, relative to that of human <italic>edn </italic>(pGL3-<italic>edn</italic>), indicating that presence of the 34-nt segment enhanced transcriptional activity of <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>promoters. Removal of the 34-nt region from the <italic>edn </italic>promoter led to a 60% reduction in transcriptional activity, suggesting that the 34-nt segment was critical for transcription of <italic>edn</italic>. Interestingly, when the 34-nt segment was artificially inserted into the <italic>ecp </italic>promoter in the region corresponding to its position in <italic>edn</italic>, the transcriptional activity of <italic>ecp </italic>increased two fold. Our results demonstrated that the presence of the 34-nt segment correlated with enhanced transcriptional activity of <italic>ecp </italic>in HepG2 cells. Similarly, the 34-nt segment also enhanced the <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>promoter activities in HL-60 clone 15 cells; cell of hematopoietic origin known to have transcriptional activities of human <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Thus, we postulated that a novel regulatory motif(s) residing in the promoter region of primate <italic>edn</italic>, especially those in the 34-nt segment, played an important role in regulating transactivation in liver and hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, the <italic>edn </italic>promoter activity dramatically reduced in response to the ablation of intron-based enhancer element no matter in the presence or absence of the 34-nt segment (unpublished data), indicating that the regulatory effect of the intronic enhancer was not correlated to the unique 34-nt segment.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The role of the conserved regions -74/-65 and -62/-48 in the 34-nt region in transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells</bold>.

Our study has advanced further that MAZ binds the 34-nt region through the third and fourth zinc fingers, extending its effects on transcriptional activity. We were surprised that unlabeled EMSA competitors m10 to m17 did not appreciably compete the major band shift even though these competitors all contained the full-length GA box believed to be tightly bound by MAZ. Comprehensive EMSA scanning mutagenesis revealed that MAZ bound not only to the known GA box but also to another conserved site, CTCTGCTG, an apparently novel transcription factor binding motif. Thus, we postulate that some other cofactor protein(s) may bind to the CTCTGCTG motif to further enhance MAZ binding, and thus mutations at any position in this novel motif leads to decreased MAZ binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, even in the absence of another protein(s), MAZ alone had strong binding activity because GST-MAZ bound the wild type 34-nt probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Notably, MAZ always cooperates with another transcription factor, such as Sp1, to control promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The discovery of two sites critical for MAZ binding is consistent with our luciferase assay results.

Song <italic>et al</italic>. have found that MAZ and Sp1 associate with histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase, respectively, to regulate transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we characterized the presence of an evolutionarily conserved 34-bp sequence in all primate genes encoding eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (<italic>edn</italic>) genes and only one gene encoding eosinophil cationic protein (<italic>ecp</italic>). Given the fact that primate <italic>edn </italic>and <italic>ecp </italic>are known to be products of gene duplication event,such a conserved 34-bp sequence motif constituted a region essential for transactivation of human <italic>edn </italic>in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our findings indicate that Sp1 as well as MAZ constitutively bind at 34-nt region of the <italic>edn </italic>promoter in HepG2 cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the activity of the promoter primarily depends on competition between Sp1 and MAZ. Furthermore, our data reveal that Sp1 binds at the 34-nt region and activates <italic>edn </italic>gene expression, on the contrary, MAZ represses <italic>edn </italic>gene expression upon binding to the 34-nt region. The underlying molecular mechanisms about Sp1 and MAZ cooperation in governing <italic>edn </italic>promoter activity still remain to be further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transient transfection</title><p>Cells from non-human primates including <italic>Saimiri sciureus</italic>, <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>, <italic>Pongo pygmaeus</italic>, <italic>Gorilla gorilla </italic>and <italic>Pan troglodytes </italic>were purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research and their cultures maintained at Dr. Chung-I Wu's Laboratory (University of Chicago).

The block-based pattern searching algorithms were designed to find short consensus motifs by a combination of hash encoding, quick sorting and interval-jumping techniques; this was to avoid unnecessary comparisons and to achieve approximate matching functions. In this module, each possible subsegment of the imported sequences was considered as a fundamental element, and its contents are encoded as a unique digital number and allocated in a corresponding interval for the following matching procedures. Due to the unique transformation and exact reconvertible features, the encoded numbers could be efficiently matched in an ordered and well-defined interval. According to a variable combination of parameter settings, we were able to identify the consensus motifs with different properties of pattern lengths, tolerance conditions, and occurrence frequencies and label each of the sequences. Once the consensus motifs were completely searched, a scoring matrix of pairwise distant measurements is constructed to select a referred indexed sequence prior to the multiple alignment procedures. The MISA algorithms are then implemented by performing dynamic programming and merging processing in accordance with the assigned reference sequence based on the indexed fundamental elements instead of single residues. If there are <italic>k </italic>indexed sequences under evaluation, the <italic>k </italic>pairwise alignments are further combined and transformed into a <italic>k</italic>-row multiple alignment indexing matrix through a multiple merging process obeying the principle "once a gap, always a gap" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Finally, the aligned overlapped consensus labels were combined as a representative segment to visually display the identified combinatorial patterns. To analyze primate eosinophil <italic>rnases </italic>in this paper, six <italic>edn </italic>and five <italic>ecp </italic>promoter sequences of approximately 1 kb length in FASTA format were input into MISA. Various combinations of fundamental pattern length, number of tolerant residues, and occurrence rate were set to scan along the full-length promoter sequences, and the results showed consistent performance for the conserved regions as well as the dominant portions of variation labeled in color-coded bars and dotted grey grids, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences</title><p>Primate <italic>ecp </italic>and <italic>edn </italic>promoter sequences were aligned using MEGA 3.1 software.
