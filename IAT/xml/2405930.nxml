We mapped the affected locus to chromosome Xp11-Xq21 in one family. In the defined region, both families were found to have novel missense mutations in the ectodysplasin-A (<italic>EDA</italic>) gene. The mutation of c.947A&#x0003e;G caused the D316G substitution of the EDA protein. The mutation of c.1013C&#x0003e;T found in the other family resulted in the Thr to Met mutation at position 338 of EDA. The <italic>EDA</italic> gene has been reported responsible for X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) in humans characterized by impaired development of hair, eccrine sweat glands, and teeth. In contrast, all the affected individuals in the two families that we studied here had normal hair and skin. Structural analysis suggests that these two novel mutants may account for the milder phenotype by affecting the stability of EDA trimers. Our results indicate that these novel missense mutations in <italic>EDA</italic> are associated with the isolated tooth agenesis and provide preliminary explanation for the abnormal clinical phenotype at a molecular structural level.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tooth development is a complex process with reciprocal interactions between the dental epithelium and mesenchyme; many transcription factors and signaling molecules are involved to guide this process. Tooth agenesis is the most common craniofacial malformation with patients missing one or more teeth. The term &#x02018;hypodontia&#x02019; is defined as the congenital absence of fewer than 6 teeth, whereas &#x02018;oligodontia&#x02019; designates the congenital absence of 6 or more permanent teeth and the complete absence of teeth is defined as &#x02018;anodontia&#x02019;. Tooth agenesis can occur in an isolated fashion, or as part of a syndrome. Affected members within a family often exhibit significant variability with regard to the location, symmetry, and number of teeth involved.</p><p>To date, mutations in two transcription factor genes, <italic>PAX9</italic> (14q12&#x02013;13) and <italic>MSX1</italic> (4p16.1), have been shown as the major causes of non-syndromic oligodontia. <italic>MSX1</italic> is a member of the homeobox gene family which contains a homeodomain. MSX1 is strongly expressed in the dental mesenchyme and is eliminated from the dental epithelia during the bud, cap, and bell stages of tooth development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Mackenzie1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

PAX proteins are defined by the presence of a DNA-binding domain, the &#x02018;paired domain&#x02019;, which makes sequence-specific contact with DNA. PAX9 is expressed in the neural-crest-derived mesenchyme of the maxillary and mandibular arches, and contributes to palate and tooth formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Peters1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

X-linked hypohidrotic or anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED, MIM 305100) is the most common form of ectodermal dysplasia and is characterized by sparse hair, eye lashes and brow, abnormal or missing teeth and inability to sweat due to the lack of sweat glands, a major disability in hot climates. The facial appearance of XLHED consists of a saddle-nose, frontal bossing and thick lips. Atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma are frequent complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Clarke1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. If unrecognized, XLHED is one of the causes of fevers of unknown origin, repeated bronchitis, and sudden death during infancy and early childhood. Affected males present most or all of these typical features. In female carriers, the severity of the disorder varies considerably, but most of them have mild to moderate manifestations of these typical features, ranging from none to some degree of hypodontia, hypotrichosis, and hypohidrosis.</p><p>Mutations of the ectodysplasin A (<italic>EDA</italic>) gene are responsible for this disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Kere1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Visinoni1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

The HED-causing mutations in the TNF domain which affect the function of EDA have been previously analyzed: most mutations (His252Leu, Gly291Trp, Gly291Arg, Gly299Ser, Tyr320Cys, and Ala349Asp) are likely to affect the overall structure of EDA, and some mutations (Tyr343Cys, Ser374Arg, Thr378Pro, and Thr378Met) alter the receptor binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Hymowitz1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Asp316Gly and Thr338Met mutations have not been reported previously.</p><p>Structural analysis of EDA protein showed that D316 and T338 were located at two adjacent loops at the bottom of the TNF domain (D316 at loop CD and T338 at loop EF respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002396-g006">Fig. 6A&#x02013;6C</xref>). Unlike the above mentioned HED-causing mutations, both p.D316G and p.T338M mutations were a distance away from the receptor-binding site, and thus are not likely required for the receptor binding. To understand the structural effects of these two point mutations, the detailed molecular modeling analysis of the interactions between mutated residues and their surrounding residues was performed and is presented below.</p><fig id="pone-0002396-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002396.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Structures of wild type, D316G and T338M EDA.</title><p>(A)&#x02013;(C).

Side chains have been omitted from most residues for clarity. Hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed green lines.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002396.g006"/></fig><p>Residue Asp316, which is located at loop CD, interacted with the residues including Ser335, Ile336 and Thr338 in the adjacent loop EF via van der Waals force or hydrogen bonds. In addition, the side chain of Asp316 extended and formed salt bridges or hydrogen bonds with Lys340 or Asn342 from the neighboring monomer, thus taking part in subunit-subunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002396-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Replacing this residue by Gly abolished the contacts between the side chain of Asp316 and its surrounding residues and its neighboring monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002396-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). This could reduce the inter-subunit interactions in this region and further affect the stability of the trimer. The mutation to Gly also decreased the hydrophilicity and negative charges of this site and may increase the flexibility of this region. Considering its role in interactions between loops, this Gly mutation may also affect the fluctuation of the adjacent loop EF.</p><p>Thr338, located in loop EF, could interact with the residues from loop CD, forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ile312. In addition, backbone and side chain atoms of Thr338 could interact with Asn313, Thr315 and Asp316 via van der Waals force or hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002396-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). The replacement of hydrophilic Thr with hydrophobic Met increased the hydrophobicity at this site. The absence of Thr338 in p.T338M mutant would cause a decrease in the stability of this region. Meanwhile, the large hydrophobic side chain of Met338 in the mutant might make hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions with Asn313 and Phe314 from neighbor loop CD and thus may contribute to the conformational rearrangement surrounding the residues. As a consequence, it could affect the conformation of Asp316 side chain and in turn disrupt the inter-subunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002396-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). These results by molecular modeling suggest that replacing hydrophobic residue at this site would not only affect the stability of loop EF but also affect the stability of the nearby loop CD.</p><p>In conclusion, this molecular modeling analysis suggests that although Asp316 and Thr338 are located at different sites in the primary sequence, they are spatially close and might interact with each other; the mutation in either site could affect the stability of its adjacent loop. It is possible that p.D316G and p.T338M might have similar impacts on the structure of EDA by interacting between each other. As strands E, F and C connected by CD and EF loops are directly involved in the inter-subunits interactions and Asp316 and its neighboring residues are directly involved in monomer-monomer interactions, it could be expected that significant variations occurring at these mutated sites would affect the stability of EDA trimer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identify two novel mutations in the <italic>EDA</italic> gene in two independent Chinese families with isolated tooth agenesis.

These mutations of p.D316G and p.T338M in EDA and their effects on the phenotype change have not been reported previously.</p><p>Mutations in ectodysplasin A have been previously identified as the cause of X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) (OMIM 305100). So far, only two articles reported that mutations in the <italic>EDA</italic> gene resulted in unique hypodontia phenotype rather than the full XLHED phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Tao1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Tarpey1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In that study the test group one was a Mongolian family with a missense mutation (p.R65G) in the juxtamembrane region of EDA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Tao1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Affected members in this Mongolian family did not show other XLHED characteristics, except hypodontia. The patterns of missing teeth were similar to the Family A in our study; the hypodontia occurring in both the Mongolian family and Family A involved all classes of teeth. Another previously reported study of an Indian family found a missense mutation (p.Q358E) in the EDA TNF domain. The phenotype of this Indian family most resembled the Family B of our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Tarpey1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Both Family B and the Indian family show incisor hypodontia and the symptom is milder than that observed in Family A and the Mongolian family. It seems that different mutation sites in EDA caused the difference in missing teeth patterns. Interestingly, a similar finding was also observed caused by the mutations in the <italic>PAX9</italic> gene. Lammi et al. reported a missense mutation in <italic>PAX9</italic> in a family with oligodontia phenotype that affected all tooth groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Lammi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In another report, Kapadia et al. showed Ile87Phe mutation in PAX9 in another family only affected posterior teeth, primarily the molars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Kapadia1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this report, we describe the identification of two novel missense mutations in the TNF domain of EDA. Both mutations associated with only tooth agenesis without causing other abnormalities. Unlike other reported HED-causing mutations in the TNF domain which were expected to affect the receptor binding site or overall structure of the EDA protein, molecular modeling suggests that these two mutations only minimally affect the stability of EDA trimer. Therefore, we presume that the human phenotype associated with the novel mutations could be caused by the decrease in the stability of the EDA protein. The phenotype of isolated tooth agenesis of the two families may be a milder clinical subtype of X-linked HED. Similar to p.D316G and p.T338M, p.Q358E is also located on the outer surface of the EDA protein. Tarpey et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002396-Tarpey1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> suggested that Q358E partially disrupts the interaction of the EDA homotrimers, thus resulting in the inability of EDA to interact with its target receptors. Until now, there have been four EDA mutations, p.R65G, p.Q358E, p.D316G and p.T338M that have been reported associated with unique tooth agenesis. p.Q358E, p.D316G and p.T338M are all in the TNF domain. These three mutants seem to share similar consequences: they all disrupt the interactions in the homotrimer and therefore result in the inability of EDA to interact with its target receptors. One unique feature among these mutants is that D316G is directly involved in interactions of the monomers, while the other two mutations indirectly affect the interactions of the EDA homotrimers. This difference may account for the phenotype of p.D316G being more severe than that of p.T338M and the phenotype of p.T338M is very similar to that of p.Q358E. In the p.R65G mutant, the substitution occurs on the edge of the transmembrane domain of the EDA protein and its effect on EDA function is still not clear.</p><p>Here we identify novel mutations in the <italic>EDA</italic> gene that are involved in the X-linked isolated hypodontia and provide an explanation for the clinical phenotype at the molecular structural level. This is an initial step in explaining the pathogenic mechanisms underlying EDA-mediated tooth agenesis. Further in vivo expression and functional characterization of the mutated protein might present more direct explanations for how the malfunctions in EDA protein caused by the identified missense mutations disrupted the tooth development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Pedigree, diagnosis, and DNA collection</title><p>The research project was submitted and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Nanjing University.
