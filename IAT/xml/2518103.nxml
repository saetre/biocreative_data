We show that uniform activation of endogenous PI3K is sufficient to polarize previously unpolarized neutrophils and trigger effective cell migration. After a delay following symmetrical phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) production, a polarized distribution of PIP<sub>3</sub> was induced by positive feedback requiring actin polymerization. Pharmacological studies argue that this process does not require receptor-coupled trimeric G proteins. Contrary to the current working model, rapid activation of endogenous Rac proteins triggered effective actin polymerization but failed to feed back to PI3K to generate PIP<sub>3</sub> or induce cell polarization. Thus, the increase in PIP<sub>3</sub> concentration at the leading edge is generated by positive feedback with an <italic>AND</italic> gate logic with a PI3K-Rac-actin polymerization pathway as a first input and a PI3K initiated non-Rac pathway as a second input. This <italic>AND</italic>-gate control for cell polarization can explain how Rac can be employed for both PI3K-dependent and -independent signaling pathways coexisting in the same cell.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemotactic cells such as neutrophils have the ability to sense, orient themselves and migrate toward a chemoattractant source even if the chemoattractant concentration difference is as small as a few per cent across the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Zigmond1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying this remarkable sensing capability is a fundamental question of chemotaxis research. In 1972, Alfred Gierer and Hans Meinhardt proposed an elegant conceptual model explaining how spatial patterns can be formed during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Gierer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

In their model, a self-enhancing positive feedback type reaction is triggered locally inside the cell where the chemoattractant concentration is highest and thereby orients the cell towards the source of the chemoattractant. The triggering of this local positive feedback is followed by a negative feedback that either globally suppresses the self-enhancing reaction or depletes activators from the back. The negative feedback is necessary to prevent the self-enhancing reaction to take place in other regions of the cell. The elegant logics of this model is that cells first polarize, reorganize the actin based migration machinery to the front and chemotax towards the source of the chemoattractant all based on the same local positive feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Meinhardt1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This raised the question what molecular entities may constitute such a local positive feedback.</p><p>PI3K has been widely studied as a principal regulator of cell polarization, migration and chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Sasaki1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Servant1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Niggli1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Wymann1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

This was supported by experimental evidence that extracellular addition of PIP<sub>3</sub> analogs were shown to be sufficient to cause polarization and subsequent migration in neutrophils and neutrophil-like cells such as HL-60 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Derman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Niggli2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Weiner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Together, these studies argued that PIP<sub>3</sub> is part of a positive feedback loop that can polarize cells and cause them to migrate. Experimental evidence further implied that also Rac proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Srinivasan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and polymerized actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Wang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Peyrollier1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> are part of this positive feedback loop. For example, cells with overexpressed constitutively active Rac had elevated levels of PIP<sub>3</sub> production, and treatment with Latrunculin A (LatA), an inhibitor for actin polymerization, led to an inhibition of the Rac-induced PIP<sub>3</sub> production. This led to the plausible model that PI3K, Rac and polymerized actin are the three core components of a local positive feedback, explaining how cells can polarize, how they organize the cell migration machinery to the front and how they are directed towards the chemoattractant source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Weiner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Srinivasan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003068-Wang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this method, a chemical dimerizer is used to translocate a peptide that activates PI3K from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. The PI3K activator peptide was derived from the inter SH2 domain region of the protein p85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). This synthetic system consists of two constructs, a PI3K activation probe (YFP-FKBP-interSH2 or YF-iSH) that interacts with endogenous PI3K, and a membrane-targeted FRB (Lyn-FRB or LDR). Addition of the dimerizer, iRap, to HL-60 cells triggered a rapid plasma membrane translocation of YF-iSH, which was followed by a production of PIP<sub>3</sub> within approximately 30 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

By normalizing the concentration of PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding YFP-PH(AKT) over the CFP-conjugated membrane-anchored CF-iSH, we found that uniform activation of endogenous PI3K triggered first a uniform PIP<sub>3</sub> distribution and then, with an approximately one minute delay, an enhanced PIP<sub>3</sub> concentration at the leading edge of the polarized and migrating cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). The normalization of the CF-iSH over the generic plasma membrane marker, Lyn-YFP, confirmed that the observed asymmetric PIP<sub>3</sub> accumulation was not due to membrane accumulation of CF-iSH at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g005">Fig. 5B, right small panel</xref>). A quantitative analysis of the normalized PIP<sub>3</sub> gradients is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>.

When we treated cells with Latrunculin A (LatA, an inhibitor of actin polymerization), polarized cells lost their enhanced PIP<sub>3</sub> at the leading edge and stopped migrating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). A quantitative line scan analysis more clearly shows this loss of polarization along the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). When LatA was added first, synthetic PI3K activation still triggered PIP<sub>3</sub> production, but without triggering significant PIP<sub>3</sub> polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Furthermore, PI3K-induced cell migration was completely suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>). Cells occasionally showed irregularly-shaped, transient pseudopod extensions during Latrunculin A treatment that did not develop into a mature, polarized leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). A similar inhibition of migration and PIP<sub>3</sub> polarization was observed in the presence of Cytochalasin D, a different type of inhibitor of actin polymerization (data not shown). This shows that PIP<sub>3</sub> polarization and PI3K-mediated migration both require actin polymerization. However, Rac activation on its own, while triggering actin polymerization, induces neither polarization nor initiates the positive feedback to activate PI3K. This argues for a coincidence requirement for the local positive feedback loop so that a pathway from PI3K to Rac and polymerized actin as well as a second feedback loop from PI3K to PI3K that does not involve Rac are both needed for triggering PIP<sub>3</sub> accumulation at the front (AND-gate logics; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003068-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003068.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Actin polymerization is not needed for uniform but for polarized PIP<sub>3</sub> production.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of experiments conducted in (B)&#x02013;(E).

Given that chemoattractants activate PI3K, this provides a strong argument that endogenously present PI3K enzymes are sufficient as a physiological input for triggering cell polarization and migration. Our study further shows that the PI3K positive feedback module that can trigger cell polarization has the logical form of an AND gate that requires two pathways emanating from PI3K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003068-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The existence of such an AND gate logic is based on the findings that the positive feedback for polarized PIP<sub>3</sub> production is only triggered if PI3K is active and if Rac-mediated actin polymerization has occurred.
