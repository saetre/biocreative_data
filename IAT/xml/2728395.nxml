In this study, we show that the budding yeast EB1 protein Bim1p is regulated by Aurora B/Ipl1p-mediated multisite phosphorylation. Bim1p forms a stable complex with Ipl1p and is phosphorylated on a cluster of six Ser residues in the flexible linker connecting the calponin homology (CH) and EB1 domains. Using reconstitution of plus end tracking in vitro and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that dimerization of Bim1p and the presence of the linker domain are both required for efficient tip tracking and that linker phosphorylation removes Bim1p from static and dynamic MTs. Bim1 phosphorylation occurs during anaphase in vivo, and it is required for normal spindle elongation kinetics and an efficient disassembly of the spindle midzone. Our results define a mechanism for the use and regulation of CH domains in an EB1 protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamic polymers formed by a cylindrical assembly of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin subunits that have essential functions for intracellular transport, chromosome segregation, and cellular architecture. Several MT-associated proteins regulate their dynamics and interactions and help to organize the MT cytoskeleton. An important subgroup among MT-associated proteins is constituted by the plus end&#x02013;tracking proteins (+TIPs), which are characterized by their preferential association with growing MT plus ends in vivo. +TIPs are highly conserved among all eukaryotes and they can be divided into different subfamilies, including the DIS/chTOG family of XMAP215-like proteins, the CLIP-170 or CLASP-related families, spectraplakins, and, finally, the EB1 (end binding 1) family of MT end&#x02013;binding proteins (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008</xref>). EB1 proteins have emerged as key regulators of MT plus ends in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vaughan, 2005</xref>). They contain an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which displays MT-binding activity and is part of various tubulin- or actin-binding molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi and Ikura, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Slep and Vale, 2007</xref>). The following C-terminal coiled-coil mediates homodimerization and is followed by a four-helix bundle (EB1 homology domain), which is critical for the tethering of cargo proteins to EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honnappa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Slep et al., 2005</xref>). Although crystal structures of the individual CH domain and the C-terminal cargo-binding domain have been solved, the spatial organization of these domains in the context of a full-length EB1 molecule remains unknown. Two recent studies of the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> EB1 homologue Mal3 have provided some basic insights into the function of EB1 proteins. Using an EM approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sandblad et al. (2006)</xref> have investigated the decoration of stabilized MTs by Mal3 and found that the protein preferentially associates with the lattice seam of the MTs, the structurally most labile part of the polymer. Thus, it may act as a &#x0201c;molecular zipper&#x0201d; supporting the stabilization of the closing lattice seam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sandblad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vitre et al., 2008</xref>). In a different approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieling et al. (2007)</xref> have reconstituted the interaction of three <italic>S. pombe</italic> +TIPs with dynamic MTs in vitro. Notably, only the EB1 homologue Mal3p had an intrinsic ability to track the MT end and was sufficient to localize the kinesin Tea1p and the CLIP-170 protein Tip1p to growing ends in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieling et al., 2007</xref>). Despite this progress, important questions concerning EB1-related proteins have remained unanswered. For example, what is the molecular mechanism by which these proteins bind to the MT lattice and to the growing end? Moreover, how does the cell regulate EB1 activity to control the dynamics and transport of proteins to plus ends? Because EB1 proteins constitute the center of extensive +TIP networks and control the association of many proteins with plus ends, they are particularly important targets for regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lansbergen and Akhmanova, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Plus ends establish the contact of MTs to various cellular structures, among them the kinetochore, a complex assembly of proteins on centromeric DNA which mediates the attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic and meiotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Westermann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tanaka and Desai, 2008</xref>). Regulation of kinetochore&#x02013;MT attachments is particularly important in the process of biorientation, i.e., the pathway by which the cell ensures that duplicated sister chromatids are connected to opposite spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the MT plus ends of interpolar MTs are bundled to form the spindle midzone, which is required for proper spindle elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khmelinskii et al., 2007</xref>) and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Norden et al., 2006</xref>). The mitotic kinase Aurora B is thought to be critical for the regulation of MT plus ends in both of these cellular situations. In the process of kinetochore biorientation, Aurora B phosphorylates kinetochore components to release improper attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>), and during anaphase, Aurora B localizes to the spindle midzone, where it is involved in timely spindle disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buvelot et al., 2003</xref>). To understand how Aurora B performs its critical functions, it is essential to identify all relevant downstream targets and elucidate their mechanism of regulation.</p><p>In this study, we identify the budding yeast EB1 homologue Bim1p as an Ipl1 substrate and provide molecular insights into its regulation. Biochemical analysis has revealed that Bim1p directly associates with the Ipl1p kinase and, upon activation by Sli15p, becomes phosphorylated on a cluster of six sites in the flexible linker domain. Our analysis indicates that the Bim1p linker domain is critical for MT binding, autonomous plus end tracking, and phosphoregulation of this EB1 family member.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bim1p is phosphorylated by the Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex at the linker domain</title><p>To analyze the protein&#x02013;protein interactions and posttranslational modifications of the budding yeast EB1 homologue Bim1p, we constructed a strain in which the endogenous <italic>BIM1</italic> gene was tagged at the C terminus with a tandem affinity tag. The protein was purified from yeast extracts of logarithmically growing cells, and the preparation was analyzed after in-solution digest by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Under our stringent purification conditions (300 mM KCl), the budding yeast adenomatous polyposis coli homologue Kar9p, a known interaction partner of Bim1p with a role in orienting the yeast spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>), was copurified. In addition, we mapped a total of six Bim1 phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, the identified sites (Ser139, -148, -149, -165, -166, and -176) were not randomly distributed throughout the molecule but clustered in a region of 40 aa in the flexible linker region connecting the well-conserved CH and EB1-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Closer inspection of the phosphorylation sites revealed that most of them contained a consensus sequence targeted by the Aurora B kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that Bim1p may be an Ipl1p substrate. To determine whether Bim1p is indeed phosphorylated by Ipl1/Aurora B, we expressed and purified full-length Bim1p from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, phosphorylated the protein with bacterially expressed Ipl1p in complex with its activator protein Sli15p, and analyzed the products of the kinase reaction by mass spectrometry. We found that precisely the same six phosphorylation sites we mapped in vivo were phosphorylated by purified Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To further validate the phosphorylation sites, Bim1p variants in which the six mapped phosphorylation sites were either mutated to Ala to prevent phosphorylation (<italic>Bim1<sup>6A</sup></italic>) or mutated to aspartate to mimic constitutive phosphorylation (<italic>Bim1<sup>6D</sup></italic>) were expressed and purified from bacteria. Although wild-type (WT) Bim1p (Bim1p<sup>WT</sup>) was an excellent substrate for Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 in vitro, changing the mapped phosphorylation sites to Ala or Asp prevented phosphorylation almost completely, demonstrating that the phosphorylation is highly specific for the mapped residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We also compared the efficiency of Bim1p phosphorylation either by Ipl1p alone or by Ipl1p and Sli15p. Although phosphorylation of Bim1p by Ipl1 alone was barely detectable under standard kinase assay conditions, the addition of Sli15p led to rapid phosphorylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Thus, effective phosphorylation of Bim1p by Ipl1p depends on the presence of Sli15p. Collectively, these results establish that Bim1p is a target of Ipl1p and that phosphorylation occurs on a cluster of six Ser residues located in the flexible linker region.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Bim1p is phosphorylated by the Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex.</bold> (A) Silver-stained gel of purified <italic>Bim1&#x02013;S-Tag-TEV-ZZ</italic> from yeast extracts.

A series of Bim1p N- and C-terminal truncation mutants were expressed, purified as GST fusion proteins, and tested for interaction with purified Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex in pull-down assays. We found that Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 could bind to Bim1p and that the interaction required the presence of the C-terminal residues 185&#x02013;344 encompassing the EB1 homology domain, which is required for the binding of other cargo molecules to EB1 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). The association between Bim1p and the Ipl1 complex was not affected by the phosphorylation status of Bim1p, as the phosphomimicking <italic>Bim1<sup>6D</sup></italic> mutant could interact effectively with Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15. Furthermore, we observed that Bim1p can interact with Ipl1p also in the absence of Sli15p (Fig. S2). The Bim1&#x02013;Ipl1 interaction was very robust and could be detected by analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) under physiologically relevant salt concentrations of 100 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Interestingly, upon Ipl1p binding, the elution position of Bim1p was shifted toward a smaller Stokes radius, suggesting that interaction with Ipl1p stabilized a more compact conformation of the Bim1 molecule. In further support of a direct association, a recent genome-wide two-hybrid analysis identified interactions between Bim1 and Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wong et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We tested the effect of the multisite phosphorylated linker on the overall structure of Bim1p. We first compared the hydrodynamic properties of WT and phosphomimicking Bim1p proteins. Bim1p<sup>WT</sup> elutes remarkably early during SEC with a Stokes radius of 58 &#x000c5;, suggesting a highly elongated shape of the dimeric molecule. However, the elution peak of the phosphomimicking Bim1<sup>6D</sup> mutant was shifted to a later elution volume (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). This different migration behavior in SEC did not correspond to the presence of dimeric versus monomeric forms, as a Bim1p variant lacking the coiled-coil dimerization motif eluted later than the 6D mutant, reflecting its monomeric nature (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). Thus, phosphorylation of the linker domain may lead to a conformational change of the dimeric Bim1 molecule, which results in a compaction. To further analyze the consequences of linker phosphorylation, we subjected Bim1<sup>WT</sup>, Bim1<sup>6A</sup>, and Bim1<sup>6D</sup> variants to limited proteolysis using the protease chymotrypsin. Although WT and the 6A mutant showed similar degradation patterns, the digestion pattern for the 6D mutant was significantly altered, arguing for a profound conformational change exposing different cleavage sites (Fig. S3 B). Thus, full-length Bim1p is a highly elongated molecule, and linker phosphorylation by the Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex may trigger a conformational change that results in a more compact dimeric molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>Bim1p phosphorylation occurs during anaphase in vivo</title><p>To study the phosphorylation status of Bim1p in vivo, we analyzed the pattern of epitope-tagged Bim1p by Western blotting. To enhance a potential phospho shift, SDS-PAGE was performed in the presence of the Phos-tag reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kinoshita et al., 2006</xref>). In extracts derived from WT cells, Bim1p displayed slower migrating forms, which were eliminated after shifting the cells to the restrictive temperature in an <italic>ipl1-2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). To study the timing of Bim1 phosphorylation in vivo, we synchronized cells expressing Bim1-myc and the yeast securin Pds1-myc in G1 phase of the cell cycle with &#x003b1; factor, released the cells, and analyzed the phosphorylation pattern by Western blotting. Interestingly, Bim1 phosphorylation was detected in a narrow time window of 15&#x02013;30 min after the beginning of Pds1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Thus, Bim1 phosphorylation depends on Ipl1 and is detected specifically during anaphase in vivo.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Bim1 phosphorylation occurs during anaphase in vivo.</bold> (A) Western blot analysis of Bim1 phosphorylation in a WT and in an <italic>ipl1-2</italic> background.

We compared the binding affinities of Bim1p<sup>WT</sup>, Bim1p phosphorylated in vitro with the Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex, and the phosphomimicking Bim1<sup>6D</sup> mutant for taxol-stabilized MTs in cosedimentation assays. Bim1p<sup>WT</sup> displayed a robust affinity for MTs with an apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of 0.44 &#x000b5;M. MT binding of Bim1p phosphorylated by Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 was markedly decreased, and the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was raised about fivefold. The phosphomimicking Bim1<sup>6D</sup> mutant displayed an even lower affinity for taxol-stabilized MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We next asked whether Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 phosphorylation could also release Bim1p from the lattice after it had been prebound to taxol-stabilized MTs. We loaded MTs with Bim1p, incubated them with different amounts of purified Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex either in the absence or presence of ATP, and separated supernatant and pellet fractions after centrifugation. Only in the presence of ATP, Bim1p was removed by Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 from the pellet fraction into the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15-mediated phosphorylation of the Bim1p linker domain decreases the affinity for taxol-stabilized MTs in vitro and removes prebound Bim1p from the MT lattice.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of Bim1p MT binding by multisite linker phosphorylation.</bold> (A) Equal amounts (1 &#x000b5;M) of Bim1<sup>WT</sup>, Bim1<sup>WT</sup> phosphorylated with Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15, and the phosphomimicking Bim1<sup>6D</sup> mutant were incubated with increasing amounts of taxol-stabilized MTs (0&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M).

The localization pattern of the 6A mutant appeared similar, although the spindle midzone seemed to be more prominently stained than in the WT control. However, the phosphomimicking 6D mutant displayed only very weak spindle staining, the cytoplasmic background signal was stronger, and only weakly fluorescent Bim1p dots remained visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), suggesting that constitutive phosphorylation of the linker domain also impairs binding of Bim1p to MTs in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>CH and linker domains synergistically enhance MT binding of Bim1p</title><p>The MT-binding activity of EB1-like proteins had previously been assigned to the CH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi and Ikura, 2003</xref>). However, our surprising finding that phosphorylation of the linker region substantially influences the binding of Bim1p to MTs prompted us to further investigate the mechanism of MT binding by Bim1p. To establish the molecular requirements for MT binding more rigorously, we constructed, expressed, and purified eight Bim1p variants encompassing different combinations of CH, linker, and dimerization domains as C-terminal EGFP fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>).

Finally, a construct containing only the CH domain fused to EGFP (Bim1<sup>1&#x02013;133</sup>) bound to MTs but only weakly, with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 8.9 &#x000b5;M.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular dissection of MT binding by Bim1p.</bold> (A) Cartoons of Bim1 variants (WT or mutants lacking the CH, flexible linker, or dimerization domain) expressed as EGFP fusion proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Although the majority of Bim1p accumulated at growing plus ends, there was always a significant amount of Bim1p also bound to the MT lattice, which increased upon lowering the ionic strength of the solution or raising the Bim1p concentration in the assay (unpublished data). In alternative experiments, we followed the plus end tracking with Bim1p covalently conjugated to Alexa Fluor fluorophores, either via Cys or amine linkages (unpublished data). We did not observe significant differences between the Alexa Fluor conjugates and the EGFP fusion protein. Thus, we conclude that the budding yeast EB1 homologue Bim1p autonomously tracks growing MT ends in vitro.</p><p>The molecular requirements for autonomous plus end tracking have not been established in a defined in vitro system. Therefore, we tested our engineered Bim1 constructs in the in vitro tracking assay and asked whether they could associate with the MT lattice or with growing ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Under conditions in which Bim1p<sup>WT</sup> displayed robust plus end tracking (70 nM final Bim1p concentration), the monomeric variant (Bim1<sup>1&#x02013;210</sup>) only weakly associated with dynamic MTs. Raising the final concentration of Bim1p<sup>1&#x02013;210</sup> to 1 &#x000b5;M yielded a faint staining all along the MT lattice, whereas a substantial Bim1 accumulation at growing ends could not be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Video 3</ext-link>). Thus, a monomeric Bim1p variant containing the CH and the linker domain failed to plus end track in vitro. In agreement with its low MT-binding affinity in the cosedimentation assay, the dimeric Bim1 variant lacking the linker domain (Bim1<sup>1&#x02013;133^210&#x02013;344</sup>) was barely visible on MTs under our imaging conditions and did not display tip-tracking activity. Thus, dimerized CH domains and the presence of the linker are both necessary for the autonomous plus end&#x02013;tracking activity of Bim1p.</p><p>To visualize the effect of Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 phosphorylation, we first analyzed the interaction of Bim1p with stable MT substrates. We incubated rhodamine-labeled, taxol-stabilized MTs with Bim1p&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 488 and observed the binding reaction by TIRF microscopy. Bim1p&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 488 decorated taxol-stabilized MTs along their length without any observable preference for MT ends. We included purified Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex in the binding reaction, and during recording, we introduced ATP into the flow chamber. Within seconds after ATP addition but not after a buffer control, the Bim1p&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 488 signal disappeared from taxol-stabilized MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Video 4</ext-link>). Finally, we investigated the effect of Ipl1 phosphorylation on plus end tracking in vitro. We performed the tip-tracking assay as described in this section but now added purified Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex either in the presence or absence of ATP. After initial association with growing plus ends, the Bim1 signal disappeared from the plus ends as well as from the lattice. This was not the case in control assays in which either the Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex or ATP was omitted from the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Video 5</ext-link>).

Spindle elongation in WT cells occurred with typical biphasic kinetics consisting of an initial fast and a subsequent slow phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). In a <italic>bim1</italic> deletion mutant, elongation started from a shortened metaphase spindle, the rate of elongation in anaphase was reduced, and the final spindle length was decreased.

In contrast, the mutant preventing Ipl1 phosphorylation (<italic>Bim1<sup>6A</sup></italic>) showed a faster rate of spindle elongation in both phases of anaphase B and reached an increased maximum spindle length. These results suggest that Bim1 phosphorylation is required for spindle elongation to occur with normal kinetics. As the spindles in the phosphorylation-deficient <italic>bim1</italic> mutant grew faster and overextended, we also analyzed the mode of spindle disassembly by following the dynamic behavior of GFP-tagged Bim1<sup>WT</sup> or Bim1 phosphorylation mutants in strains expressing mCherry-tubulin. Bim1<sup>WT</sup> was prominently localized to the spindle midzone in anaphase cells, and during spindle disassembly, the length of the Bim1 zone gradually decreased until only a small amount of Bim1p remained on the ends of depolymerizing spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Video 6</ext-link>).

In this study, we show that Bim1p, a member of the evolutionary conserved family of EB1 proteins, is a physiological substrate of the yeast Aurora kinase Ipl1p. In addition to characterizing Bim1's role in spindle dynamics, our study provides insights into the molecular mechanism and regulation of autonomous plus end tracking by EB1 proteins.</p><sec><title>Functional organization of EB1 proteins</title><p>The molecular mechanisms regulating the activity of EB1 proteins have so far remained elusive. In this study, we identify the flexible linker region as the critical regulatory domain of the budding yeast EB1 homologue Bim1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). This was unexpected, as previous work had assigned the MT-binding activity to the CH domain, and it has been speculated that the regulatory mechanisms may target this region of the molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi and Ikura, 2003</xref>). Among EB1 homologues, the sequence of the linker region is less well conserved than the CH and dimerization domains. However, the approximate length of the linker, its predicted unstructured nature, and its overall basic electrostatic character are common features of all EB1 proteins. A recent study suggests that the linker region may also be of critical importance for the <italic>S. pombe</italic> EB1 homologue Mal3, as C-terminal truncations of a monomeric Mal3 construct abolished its polymerization-promoting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">des Georges et al., 2008</xref>). There is further evidence that the observed interaction between Bim1p and Ipl1p may be evolutionary conserved: using two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, a recent study identifies human Aurora B as an interaction partner of EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). Although a direct phosphorylation of EB1 by Aurora B could not be detected in vitro, which may be caused by the absence of an activator protein, there remains the possibility that either EB1 or the related proteins EB2 and -3 may be relevant physiological Aurora B targets. Furthermore, we did not obtain experimental evidence that Bim1p is regulated by autoinhibition between the CH domains and the extreme C termini, as has been proposed for EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>). The reason may be that Bim1p is significantly larger than EB1 (344 residues compared with 268 for EB1) or that the C-terminal residues (ETF for Bim1p) differ from the sequence found in EB1 (EEY).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for Bim1 phosphoregulation.</bold> (A) Functional domains and regulation of the EB1 family member Bim1p.

Recent cryo-EM studies describing the decoration of MTs by Ndc80/Nuf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilson-Kubalek et al., 2008</xref>) or by the <italic>S. pombe</italic> EB1 homologue Mal3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">des Georges et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that the CH domain nestles into a groove at the interface between tubulin dimers on the MT lattice. The N-terminal tail domain of Ndc80 and the linker domain of EB1 proteins may contribute to binding by interacting with the negatively charged C-terminal tails of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin (E-hook). CH domains are used by a variety of molecules with very different binding partners. It seems that a general theme for their usage in MT binding is to combine them with adjacent flexible regions that have an overall positive charge. Modulating the electrostatic properties of the linker domain may be a very effective way to control the affinity for MTs. Mechanistically, there are different possibilities by which this can be achieved. First, multisite phosphorylation may down-regulate the MT-binding activity that is intrinsic to the unstructured region by changing its bulk electrostatic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Serber and Ferrell, 2007</xref>). Second, it may change the conformation of the flexible linker region with the consequence that the CH domains are not in the optimal position for cooperative MT binding anymore. Third, cluster phosphorylation may create a negatively charged domain that could compete with tubulin for binding to the CH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). The observed conformational compaction of the Bim1 molecule upon multisite phosphorylation of the linker domain supports the latter two possibilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Establishing molecular requirements for plus end tracking</title><p>The reconstitution of MT plus end tracking in vitro using a purified system in combination with the engineering of fluorescently labeled Bim1p variants has allowed us to address the basic molecular requirements for autonomous tip tracking. We demonstrate that Bim1p, like Mal3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieling et al., 2007</xref>), autonomously tracks growing MT ends in a purified system. Given the high degree of evolutionary conservation and a recent study demonstrating end tracking of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bieling et al., 2008</xref>), we expect autonomous tip tracking to be a general, defining feature of all EB1 proteins. Furthermore, we show that MT-binding CH domains and even dimerized CH domains alone are not sufficient to allow effective plus end tracking of Bim1p in vitro. Instead, our results indicate that the flexible linker region has an essential role in providing full MT-binding and tip-tracking activity. The failure of a monomeric Bim1p construct to display tip tracking is not just caused by its overall lower binding affinity for MTs because even raising its concentration in the assay does not lead to a specific accumulation at MT ends. Instead, it seems that the dimeric arrangement of CH and linker domains is essential for the effective recognition of a specific structure at assembling MT ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieling et al., 2007</xref>). This result agrees with in vivo observations demonstrating that artificial dimerization allows plus end tracking of various +TIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Slep and Vale, 2007</xref>). However, it is in contrast to a recent study demonstrating that an isolated CH domain of the human EB3 protein shows specific accumulation on growing plus ends in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komarova et al., 2009</xref>). Different properties of Bim1p versus EB3 may explain the contrasting experimental outcomes. In the future, the minimal requirements for plus end tracking will have to be investigated in more detail, and it will be interesting to see whether MT-binding proteins that have different arrangements of CH domains can display autonomous tip tracking. For example, in the Ndc80/Nuf2 head of the Ndc80 complex, the two CH domains reside very close together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>) and provide one common rather than two spatially separated MT-binding interfaces.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of Bim1 phosphorylation in vivo</title><p>What is the physiological role of Bim1 phosphorylation by Ipl1p? As judged from a mobility shift in SDS-PAGE, a fraction of Bim1p becomes phosphorylated in a narrow time window after securin degradation in mid to late anaphase. At this time, Bim1p localizes to the midzone of the anaphase spindle and is critical for its structural integrity by stabilizing the zone of overlapping MT plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gardner et al., 2008</xref>). Our results suggest that phosphorylation by Ipl1 regulates the interaction of Bim1p with the anaphase spindle. The Ipl1&#x02013;Sli15 complex colocalizes with Bim1p to the spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khmelinskii et al., 2007</xref>), and Ipl1 kinase activity increases before spindle disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buvelot et al., 2003</xref>). Although a stable midzone is essential for proper spindle elongation, the zone of overlapping MT plus ends needs to be destabilized to allow efficient spindle disassembly in telophase. In a WT cell, the majority of Bim1 is unloaded from the spindle just before disassembly, but in the Bim1 phosphorylation mutant, this unloading process is inefficient, the midzone is hyperstable, and the spindle disassembles by breakage rather than plus end depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). A constitutively high level of Bim1p on the spindle would also explain why the spindle overextends in the phosphorylation-deficient mutant. With an extended overlap zone, motors can act more efficiently in the fast phase of elongation, and sustained plus end polymerization will allow further extension in the slow phase. It is important to note that the <italic>bim1</italic> phosphorylation-deficient mutant does not precisely phenocopy the <italic>ipl1-2</italic> mutant, as this allele is not reported to have an effect on anaphase B kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buvelot et al., 2003</xref>). This may be explained by the presence of additional Ipl1 substrates relevant for spindle elongation such as the bundling protein Ase1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kotwaliwale et al., 2007</xref>). We also do not exclude additional functions for Bim1 phosphorylation and for the Bim1&#x02013;Ipl1 interaction, particularly in the process of kinetochore biorientation. Additional mutants that specifically affect the interaction between Bim1p and Ipl1 will be required to clarify whether this association is critical for the regulation of MT plus ends in other cellular situations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strain construction, purification of Bim1&#x02013;S-Tag&#x02013;tobacco etch virus (TEV)&#x02013;ZZ from yeast extracts, and mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>Yeast strains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901036/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>) were constructed using standard procedures.
