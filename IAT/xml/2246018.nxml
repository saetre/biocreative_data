A novel modification of the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) test was utilized, which compares EHH for a single allele across populations, to investigate the signature of selection at <italic>TRPV6</italic> and neighboring linked loci in published data sets for Europeans, Asians and African-Americans, as well as in newly-obtained sequence data for additional populations. We find that all non-African populations carry a signature of selection on the same haplotype at the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus. The selective footprints, however, are significantly differentiated between non-African populations and estimated to be younger than an ancestral population of non-Africans. The possibility of a single selection event occurring in an ancestral population of non-Africans was tested by simulations and rejected. The putatively-selected <italic>TRPV6</italic> haplotype contains three candidate sites for functional differences, namely derived non-synonymous substitutions C157R, M378V and M681T. Potential functional differences between the ancestral and derived <italic>TRPV6</italic> proteins were investigated by cloning the ancestral and derived forms, transfecting cell lines, and carrying out electrophysiology experiments via patch clamp analysis. No statistically-significant differences in biophysical channel function were found, although one property of the protein, namely Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependent inactivation, may show functionally relevant differences between the ancestral and derived forms. Although the reason for selection on this locus remains elusive, this is the first demonstration of a widespread parallel selection event acting on standing genetic variation in humans, and highlights the utility of between population EHH statistics.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recently, with the advent of large, publicly-available data sets, the completion of many mammalian genome sequences, and large-scale genotyping resources, there has been much effort in attempting to identify loci which have potentially been under selection in the entire human species, or locally in specific human populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Walsh1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. While there has been much success in producing lists of candidate genes, less effort has gone into a detailed characterization of the candidate genes, to verify the signature of selection obtained from genome-wide data, elucidate the functional differences between selected and non-selected alleles and their phenotypic consequences, and (ultimately) identify the nature of the selective force that produced the footprint of selection. Such further characterization is necessary for a complete understanding of the role and consequences of selection in shaping human genetic variation.</p><p>Here we present an analysis of independent parallel local selection on a candidate gene, <italic>TRPV6</italic>. <italic>TRPV6</italic> encodes a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> selective ion channel of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily, which is critically involved in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (re)absorption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Hoenderop1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>TPRV6</italic> is the primary route of dietary calcium uptake, and has previously been identified as a candidate for local selection in two other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Stajich1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies both used the SeattleSNPs data base, consisting at the time of full sequence data for over 130 genes in twenty-four individuals of African American decent and twenty-three individuals of European decent. Both studies identified putative selected genes by comparing the empirical data to simulated data that was based on an assumed demographic history. These studies found that the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus has an excess of high frequency derived alleles, an excess of rare alleles, and reduced diversity in Europeans relative to African-Americans, all consistent with local directional selection in Europeans. Furthermore, the date of selection in Europeans was estimated to be around 10,000 years before present, suggesting that <italic>TRPV6</italic> may have coevolved with lactose tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Bersaglieri1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> as fresh milk is a major source of calcium in European populations.</p><p>The <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus contains three non-synonymous substitutions (C157R, M378V and M681T) for which the derived allele is fixed (or nearly so) in Europeans, but are each polymorphic in African-Americans with a derived allele frequency of &#x0223c;50&#x00025;. The lack of any unique high frequency allele in Europeans suggested that selection on <italic>TRPV6</italic> must have occurred on a &#x0201c;preexisting mutation in the ancestral African population&#x02026;&#x0201d;, which subsequently &#x0201c;&#x02026;became advantageous in a new environment and rose to high frequency&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Stajich1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, three genes flanking <italic>TRPV6</italic>, namely <italic>EPHB6</italic>, <italic>TRPV5</italic> and <italic>KEL</italic>, were also identified as potential target(s) of selection that could then be influencing genetic variation in neighboring genes through hitchhiking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Thomson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, since <italic>TRPV6</italic> exhibits the most extreme departures from neutrality and is the only gene among these four with any high frequency derived amino acid substitutions, it is considered to be the most likely target of selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A subsequent study found that <italic>TRPV6</italic> exhibits accelerated protein evolution on the human lineage, as compared to Pan, Mus and Rattus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. A branch-sites model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Yang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> identified six sites with a high posterior probability of having been subject to selection; three of these sites are the nonsynonymous substitutions for which the derived alleles define the putatively selected haplotype in Europeans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This study also sequenced the three exons containing these non-synonymous substitutions in 90 individuals from six human populations, as well as genotyped these three sites in the CEPH diversity panel, a collection of DNAs from 51 human populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Cann1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The three non-synonymous sites were fixed or nearly so for the derived alleles in all non-African populations, and each of the non-African populations exhibited reduced diversity as compared to sub-Saharan African populations, consistent with the action of selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This shared signature of selection among all non-African populations studied led to the suggestion that the selective event occurred around the time of the major human migration out of Africa some 60,000&#x02013;100,000 years before present, and moreover indicated that dairying could not be the selective pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the present study we have also independently identified <italic>TRPV6</italic> as a candidate gene of local directional selection, using the SeattleSNPs data set and a different genome scan approach. We further characterize the footprint of selection on <italic>TRPV6</italic> in the aforementioned and additional populations, using a novel extended haplotype homozygosity approach, and find evidence for independent, parallel selection in Europeans and Asians (and possibly other populations). Our data and analyses suggest selection on standing genetic variation, also known as soft sweeps, in different populations for the same haplotype that differs from the ancestral haplotype by the three previously mentioned nonsynonymous substitutions. In addition, we also investigated the functionality of the ancestral form of <italic>TRPV6</italic> and the putatively-selected, derived form of <italic>TRPV6</italic>. Although some electrophysiological differences in protein function were found between the two forms in <italic>TRPV6</italic>, these differences were not statistically-significant. Thus, while functional consequences of the variation at <italic>TRPV6</italic> and the underlying selective force remain to be determined, this study does advance our knowledge about the temporal and spatial pattern of selection on <italic>TRPV6</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>SeattleSNP Genome Scan, Neutrality tests, and Dating Time since Selection</title><p>We identified <italic>TRPV6</italic> as a putative target of local selection by implementing a genome scan based on two summary statistics of the sequence data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001686.s001">Figure S1</xref>), analogous to that performed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Kayser1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

We then used the full sequence data from SeattleSNPs to estimate the time since fixation in Europeans, using two different methods. We estimated the age since fixation in Europeans to be approximately 7 ky (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001686.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These results are comparable to a previous estimated date of 10 ky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, but are not consistent with a suggested date of 60&#x02013;100 ky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, which was based solely on the apparent global distribution of selection at this locus.

The premise of the EHH test is to evaluate the age of an allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Fry1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> by comparing the decay of haplotype homozygosity among haplotypes with a pre-defined set of core SNPs. Haplotypes that have been subject to selection will have increased in frequency more rapidly than expected under neutrality, and hence will be associated with extended haplotypes relative to haplotypes that have not been subject to selection. A caveat and yet a useful feature of EHH tests is that discernable selective signatures may be found for selective events that occurred up to 400 generations ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Sabeti1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> but are not expected for much more than 1,000 generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Voight1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Sabeti2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, it has recently been shown that EHH tests have greater power to detect recent selection than other tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Voight1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We utilized this methodology and calculated Raw values (<underline>r</underline>elative iEHH of an <underline>a</underline>llele <underline>w</underline>ithin a population), which are based on comparing the EHH associated with the two different alleles at a SNP within a single population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Tang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We also introduce a novel EHH statistic called Rab (<underline>r</underline>elative iEHH of an <underline>a</underline>llele <underline>b</underline>etween populations), which compares the iEHH (integrated EHH) of the same allele between two different populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001686-g001">Figure 1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The Rab statistic is directly analogous to the recently developed Rsb statistic (<underline>r</underline>elative iEHH of a <underline>s</underline>ite <underline>b</underline>etween populations) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Tang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and allows us to analyze SNPs which are fixed (or nearly so) in a population and for which there is thus little information in a within-population comparison. Extreme Rab values would be associated with alleles that have potentially been under selection in one of the two populations. The median Rab value between Europeans and African-Americans is 1.54 in the SeattleSNP data, indicating that on average there is more EHH in Europeans than in African-Americans, consistent with previous findings of more linkage disequilibrium in Europeans than in African-Americans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Wang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Reich1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine if the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus in Europeans has a preponderance of sites that have extreme Rab values with respect to African-Americans, we calculated the number of sites found above the 95<sup>th</sup> quantile of the Rab distribution for each gene in the SeattleSNPs data set and in a simulated data set (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). From the empirical distribution, 56.25&#x00025; of the 112 <italic>TRPV6</italic> SNPs are above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile and 28.57&#x00025; are above the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile. The extent of the difference in EHH between Europeans and African-Americans can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001686-g001">Figure 1</xref>. None of the other 220 genes in the SeattleSNPs dataset exceed <italic>TRPV6</italic> in terms of the number of SNPs with Rab values above either the 95<sup>th</sup> or the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile. Based on the quantiles of the simulated data of 10,000 loci, 58.92&#x00025; (p-value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0021) and 57.14&#x00025; (p-value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0001) of <italic>TRPV6</italic> SNPs are above the 95<sup>th</sup> and 99<sup>th</sup> quantile respectively. These analyses demonstrate that the EHH associated with <italic>TRPV6</italic> in Europeans is highly unusual when compared to both other genes in the SeattleSNPs data and to simulated data, suggesting that local directional selection has indeed influenced variation and haplotype homozygosity at the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus in Europeans.</p><fig id="pone-0001686-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001686.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>An EHH plot of the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus from the SeattleSNP data, illustrating the calculation of Rab and Raw statistics.</title><p>The core SNP is the M378V mutation, where allele A is derived and allele G is ancestral.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001686.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Signature of selection on <italic>TRPV6</italic> in other non-African populations</title><p>All non-African populations are fixed or nearly so for the derived, putatively selected haplotype in Europeans (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001686.s005">Figure S5</xref>); do they also show the same signature of selection as in Europeans?

This raises the question as to whether the signal of selection at <italic>TRPV6</italic> differs between Europeans and Asians. We therefore compared the iEHH of each allele between the Asians and Europeans; the Rab values are significant (or nearly so) for all four genes in the TPRV6 region when either Asian group is compared to Europeans, as compared to other genes in the HapMap phase 1 data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001686-t002">Table 2</xref>). On average, the amount of EHH found in Han Chinese and Japanese at the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus is 2.18 and 2.39 times greater than that in Europeans, and both are 8.23 times greater than that in Africans.

We therefore used simulations to investigate if the observed differences in EHH between Europeans and Asians (Rab of &#x0223c;2.3) could be explained by a single selection event which occurred in the ancestral population of Europeans and Asians, some 50 ky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Harpending1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Zhivotovsky2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, as suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Using Hudson's ms program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Hudson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and demographic parameters previously found to provide the best fit to human data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Schaffner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> we simulated 850kbp segments (roughly the length needed for EHH in Asians to reach 0.05) for Africans, Europeans and Asians. To simulate a very strong selective event, we introduced a severe bottleneck in the ancestral population of non-Africans, setting the effective populations size (Ne) to 1 at 50,100 years before present for five generations. This would have the same effect as a selective event, in that a single haplotype will be fixed in this ancestral population, prior to the split of Europeans and Asians. This scenario provides a maximum amount of opportunity for the subsequent independent demographic histories of Asian and European populations to accumulate mutations and recombination events, which may then recapitulate the observed difference in EHH (Rab) seen in the empirical data. Our null hypothesis is that these independent demographic histories could, following a shared selective event, explain the observed difference in EHH between Asians and Europeans; rejecting this null hypothesis would imply independent selection for the same haplotype in Asians and Europeans. Average Rab values across all sites and all simulations were 1.08 for Asians as compared to Europeans, stressing the similarity in EHH between the two populations. As expected following a selective sweep, large Rab values were observed between non-Africans (who experienced the simulated selective event) and Africans (who did not experience the selection): average Rab equals 6.42 for Asians as compared to Africans, and 6.41 for Europeans compared to Africans. Moreover, a significant difference was observed between empirical and simulated Rab values between Europeans and Asians (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.023, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). These results suggest that the observed, significantly different EHH between Asians and Europeans is unlikely to reflect a single selection event in an ancestral population of these two populations some 50,000 years ago. Rather, we conclude from the data that the same <italic>TRPV6</italic> haplotype was subject to more recent, and hence independent, parallel selection in these different populations, with stronger and/or more recent selection in Asians than in Europeans.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Selection on <italic>TRPV6</italic> in Africans</title><p>Allele frequency and the HKA tests revealed no significant deviations from neutrality in African-Americans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001686.s009">Table S1</xref>), however there were a large number of African-American haplotypes which were closely related to the star-shaped cluster of European haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001686-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Although this may reflect European admixture, we also observed the selected haplotype at moderate to high frequency in some populations of Africa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001686.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, is there any signal of selection on <italic>TRPV6</italic> in African populations?</p><p>We first investigated EHH at the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus in African-Americans by calculating Raw values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Tang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> for the SeattleSNPs African-American data; these Raw values were then compared to both the empirical distribution of Raw values for all genes in the Seattle SNPs data for African-Americans, and to a simulated distribution. The proportion of Raw values above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile approaches statistical significance when compared to the empirical SeattleSNPs distribution (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.064 with 12.9&#x00025; of 109 sites significant), and is highly significant when compared to the simulated data, with 41.3&#x00025; of the 109 sites above the 95<sup>th</sup> quantile (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.012) and with 22&#x00025; of the sites above the 99<sup>th</sup> quantile (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.006). Since this signature of selection could reflect European admixture in the SeattleSNPs African-American dataset, we also calculated Raw statistics for each SNP for the Yoruba from the HapMap data. No allele at the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus in the Yoruba has a significant Raw value. The signature of selection that is present in the SeattleSNPs data therefore is likely to be the result of admixture with individuals of European origin, or (less likely) reflects very recent selection in this African-American population.</p><p>It was previously reported that the Mozabite population of North Africa has an excess of high frequency derived alleles and a significant Fay and Wu's H value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, which is consistent with the high frequency of the putative-selected haplotype in this population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001686.s005">Figure S5</xref>). However, this could be explained by admixture of this North African population with Europeans, and not necessarily selection operating on this population. Furthermore it was also previously suggested that South Africans and African Americans may be experiencing some form of balancing selection at the <italic>TRPV6</italic> locus, based on large positive Tajima's D values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Akey3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, given the data presented here, these large positive Tajima's D values could reflect an incomplete sweep that is in the process of driving some alleles to moderate frequency, while others are decreasing in frequency. Another possibility is the action of a soft sweep (i.e. selection on standing variation), shortening EHH, creating spurious values in neutrality tests, and in general confounding the signature of selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Przeworski1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001686-Teshima1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

If the solution was changed to Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as the only charge carrier, the current increased again and remained stable. Application of a solution with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as the only charge carrier induced a transiently increased current, which rapidly decayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001686-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

The same pattern was observed for the ancestral construct: large inward currents in DVF solution, relative stable or only slowly decaying currents with Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as charge carrier, and rapidly inactivating current when the charge carrier changed to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001686-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

First, current density at &#x02212;150mV did not differ significantly between the derived and ancestral <italic>TRPV6</italic> proteins under all three conditions: DVF; charge carrier Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>; or charge carrier Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001686-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Second, the same holds when only data were taken from cells in which all three protocols could be measured (DVF, Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) and the current density with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as the charge carrier could be normalized to the monovalent (DVF) current at &#x02212;150 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001686-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Third, as an estimate for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependent inactivation, we compared the ratio of the currents at the end of the 400 ms voltage step to &#x02212;100 mV and the maximal inward current during the step (I<sub>400ms,&#x02212;100mV</sub>/I<sub>max</sub>) for derived and ancestral <italic>TRPV6</italic>. This ratio reflects the extent of negative feedback inhibition of <italic>TRPV6</italic> by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. No inactivation is present with Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and under the DVF condition. In the presence of 30 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, inactivation of 48.9 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 5&#x00025; and 34.9 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 6&#x00025; was observed for the ancestral and derived <italic>TRPV6</italic> proteins.

However, channel function per se is not significantly changed by the C157R mutation. It is more difficult to predict any functional changes for the M378V mutant, which is located extracellularly, in the loop between the first and the second transmembrane helix, TM1 and TM2.

We calculated the Rab statistic for each non-African population vs. Africans, as well as for Han Chinese vs. Europeans and Japanese vs. Europeans. As with the SeattleSNPs data, we binned each Rab value by the frequency of the allele in the population in the numerator, calculated the 95&#x00025; percentile of each bin, and determined the proportion of alleles found above the 95&#x00025; percentile for each gene. The p-values were determined by comparing the proportion of significant alleles within the gene of interest vs. all other genes in the HapMap Phase I data set. Only genes with at least four Rab or four Raw values were considered, to avoid spurious results caused by too few SNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Construction of mammalian expression vectors</title><p>The open reading frame of the human <italic>TRPV6</italic> ortholog was cloned from a human European placenta and the cDNA sequence verified by sequencing.
