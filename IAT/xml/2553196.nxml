We recently reported that a transmembrane cleavage product, MUC1&#x0002a;, is the predominant form of the protein on cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Mahanta1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, our evidence indicated that MUC1&#x0002a; functions as a growth factor receptor on tumor cells, while the full-length protein appeared to have no growth promoting activity. Here, we report that MUC1&#x0002a; acts as a growth factor receptor on undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Cleavage of the full-length ectodomain to form MUC1&#x0002a;, a membrane receptor, appears to make binding to its ligand, NM23, possible. Unexpectedly, we found that newly differentiated cells no longer express the cleaved form, MUC1&#x0002a;, or its ligand, NM23. Newly differentiated stem cells exclusively present full-length MUC1. Antibody-induced dimerization of the MUC1&#x0002a; receptor on hESCs stimulated cell growth to a far greater degree than currently used methods that require the addition of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) as well as factors secreted by fibroblast &#x0201c;feeder cells&#x0201d;. Further, MUC1&#x0002a; mediated growth was shown to be independent of growth stimulated by bFGF or the milieu of factors secreted by feeder cells. Stimulating the MUC1&#x0002a; receptor with either the cognate antibody or its ligand NM23 enabled hESC growth in a feeder cell-free system and produced pluripotent colonies that resisted spontaneous differentiation. These findings suggest that this primal growth mechanism could be utilized to propagate large numbers of pluripotent stem cells for therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells are classified as totipotent, pluripotent or multipotent. A totipotent stem cell, such as a fertilized egg, is capable of developing into a complete organism. Pluripotent stem cells, exemplified by undifferentiated embryonic cells, are able to develop into any cell or tissue type. Multipotent stem cells, found for example in bone marrow, are able to develop into a limited subset of cell types. Pluripotent stem cells hold the greatest promise for therapeutic use because they possess the ability to become virtually any cell type in the human body. In principal, pluripotent stem cells could be used to replace damaged tissues in organs that have traditionally been thought not to have a significant potential for functional self-repair such as heart muscle, spinal cord, brain tissue and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Mountford1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Dalton1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, to implement these therapies, one must have the ability to produce a replenishable supply of pluripotent stem cells, on a large scale, that can then be induced to differentiate into the desired cell types. Certain technical hurdles must be overcome before clinical therapies using pluripotent stem cells can become a reality.</p><p>First, improved methods for propagating pluripotent stem cells and ensuring their pluripotency must be developed. Currently, it is not possible to culture embryonic stem cells (ESCs) without initiating some degree of spontaneous differentiation. Growing ESCs under optimized conditions yields only about 65&#x02013;75&#x00025; undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cells. The remainder spontaneously differentiate. This is a problem because the cells that have initiated differentiation appear to secrete factors that encourage neighboring cells to also differentiate. To maintain a useful supply of pluripotent stem cells, the undifferentiated colonies, or portions of those colonies, must be manually dissected away from those that have begun to differentiate, then re-plated for further growth. This process is labor intensive and inaccurate because it depends upon the technician's visual assessment of cell and colony morphology in the determination of which colonies remain undifferentiated. An additional problem is that there is an upper limit of about 100 generations that embryonic stem cells can be passaged before they lose pluripotency. Higher passage numbers often correlate with increased risk of abnormal karyotypes or genetic drift, wherein abnormal cells with a selective growth advantage overtake and suppress the pluripotent population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Draper1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The state of the art for culturing hESCs requires the addition of a milieu of poorly understood factors from fibroblast &#x0201c;feeder cells&#x0201d;. Some of these factors appear to be necessary to maintain the undifferentiated state, while others likely trigger differentiation. Factors secreted from fibroblasts are supplied either by growing the hESCs over a layer of fibroblast feeder cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Richards1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> or by growing the stem cells over matrigel-coated surfaces and feeding with growth media that has been supplemented with conditioned media from fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Xu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been identified as a mitogenic factor that helps maintain cultures in the undifferentiated state and is added to stem cell growth media for optimal yield of undifferentiated stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Xu2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There is also the need for improved methods for identifying and isolating pluripotent stem cells from a mixed pool of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. It is evident that local environment plays a critical role in the process of stem cell differentiation. Pluripotent stem cells can be influenced to differentiate into particular cell types when grown over more mature cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Roy1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. It may be that transplanted pluripotent stem cells differentiate into the cell type of the local environment in response to factors secreted by those cells/tissues. One can imagine that the contamination of pluripotent stem cells with even a small number of cells that have already committed to a particular differentiation pathway would be sufficient to confound the ordered differentiation process in a way that could have disastrous outcomes. Whether stem cells are transplanted as pluripotent or at an intermediate stage of tissue type differentiation, successful stem cell treatments may benefit from pure populations of stem cells and a detailed understanding of the molecular triggers that initiate the various steps along the path from undifferentiated to mature cell. Reliable, high throughput methods for rapidly identifying and isolating pluripotent stem cells, in a manner that preserves cell viability, have not yet been developed.</p><p>Therefore, what are needed are methods to identify and isolate pluripotent stem cells, to propagate pure populations in the undifferentiated state and to understand the molecular mechanisms that maintain pluripotency as well as those that trigger differentiation. To that end, we focused upon mechanisms that drive malignant growth related to so-called tumor stem cells. We focused on a cell surface protein that appears to mediate the growth of a large class of cancer cells and asked if it also mediates the growth of stem cells. This protein, MUC1, is a transmembrane protein that is expressed on normal epithelia that line the respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts. On healthy tissue, MUC1 is clustered at the apical border. But, on cancerous tissues MUC1 is over-expressed and uniformly distributed over the entire cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Kufe1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Girling1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. An estimated 75&#x00025; of all human solid tumor cancers aberrantly express the MUC1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Ren1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of MUC1 in the healthy state has not been studied as extensively as its role in cancer, where there is significant evidence that it promotes tumor cell growth and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Tsutsumida1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Singh1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In a recent article, we showed that a membrane-anchored MUC1 cleavage product, MUC1&#x0002a;, that retains only 45 amino acids of the original extracellular domain, is the predominant form of the protein on human cancerous tissues; the bulk of the extracellular domain is cleaved and shed from the tissue surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Mahanta1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. We further demonstrated that MUC1&#x0002a; has growth factor receptor-like activity wherein ligand-induced dimerization of the short extracellular domain activates the MAP kinase signaling pathway and stimulates cell growth. Blocking the ligand binding site of the extracellular domain inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. The purpose of the present studies was to investigate the possible roles of the two forms of the MUC1 protein, MUC1&#x0002a; and full-length MUC1, in the growth and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We used three antibodies to probe the expression of MUC1 on hESCs: two that recognize the full-length protein (MUC1-FL) and one that recognizes the cleavage product, MUC1&#x0002a;. Both VU4H5 and HMPV are commercially available antibodies that bind to epitopes in the tandem repeats of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003312-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). VU4H5 preferentially binds to underglycosylated MUC1, while HMPV recognizes full-length MUC1 in a glycosylation-independent manner and can bind to the fully glycosylated protein. Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; is a rabbit polyclonal antibody that was raised against a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the first forty-five (45) membrane-proximal amino acids of the extracellular domain, which comprises most if not all of the extracellular domain of the cleavage product, MUC1&#x0002a; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003312-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). As we previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Mahanta1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, although the epitope for Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; is present in the full-length protein, Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; does not bind to MUC1-FL when analyzed by Western blot or immunocytochemistry. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; reacts very weakly with MUC1-FL. One possible explanation is that full-length MUC1 contains a self-aggregation domain that likely contributes to the protein's characteristic clustering and could sterically hinder the binding of ligands to the adjacent region which is the Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; epitope. Cleavage of MUC1 on cancer cells releases the bulk of the extracellular domain, including most if not all of the self-aggregation domain. It is not known whether or not Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; binds to alternative splice isoforms, such as MUC1/X, MUC1/Y or MUC1/Z <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Baruch1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Hendrika1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, which, like MUC1&#x0002a;, contain the Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; epitope and lack the tandem repeat region; one way that they differ from MUC1&#x0002a; is that their extracellular domains are more than one hundred (100) amino acids longer and contain the self-aggregation domain. Although MUC1/Y is not cleaved, it has been reported that MUC1/X/Z can be cleaved to yield a membrane-attached fragment that is essentially indistinguishable from the MUC1-FL cleavage product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003312-Levitin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and thus would likely be recognized by Anti-MUC1&#x0002a;.</p><fig id="pone-0003312-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003312.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic and antibody recognition of full-length MUC1 versus the membrane-bound cleavage product MUC1&#x0002a;.</title><p>A.

Cells were treated with bivalent Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; or the monovalent Fab, in the presence or absence of exogenous bFGF. The addition of Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; to undifferentiated hESCs had a dramatic, stimulatory effect on cell growth. Treating hESCs with bivalent Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; for forty-one (41) hours, in the presence or absence of added bFGF, resulted in cells that were more viable and abundant than control cells that were cultured according to standard methods, which included adding bFGF. In stark contrast, the addition of the monovalent Fab fragment of Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; resulted in nearly total cell death within 12 hours of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003312-g007">Fig. 7A&#x02013;F</xref>).

Rather, they express a low molecular weight cleavage product, MUC1&#x0002a;, which we previously demonstrated has growth factor receptor-like activity on tumor cells. NM23, which was shown to be an activating ligand of MUC1&#x0002a; on cancer cells, co-localizes with MUC1&#x0002a; on pluripotent cells. Unexpectedly, we found that newly differentiated cells no longer express cleaved MUC1&#x0002a; or its ligand, NM23. Newly differentiated stem cells present full-length MUC1. Transition zones between undifferentiated and differentiating cultured stem cells can be found that continue to express OCT4, while also expressing uncleaved, full-length MUC1, which appears to be a marker for the onset of differentiation. Thus, the switch from cleaved MUC1&#x0002a; to the full-length protein may be one of the first detectable signals of the onset of differentiation. These results imply that MUC1&#x0002a; may be a more accurate marker of pluripotency than OCT4 and thus antibodies that recognize MUC1&#x0002a; could be used to search for, identify and isolate pure populations of pluripotent stem cells. Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; has been used extensively in our labs to effectively identify and sort both live and fixed MUC1&#x0002a;-positive cancer cells using FACS. These methods can be readily extended to identifying and sorting live embryonic stem cells, which could automate and improve the procedure for separating out stem cells that remain pluripotent from those that have begun to differentiate. At present this is an imprecise and labor-intensive process that depends on the technician's ability to visually discriminate between cell types then manually dissect pluripotent cells without contaminating the pool with cells that have already entered the differentiation process.</p><p>As on cancer cells, MUC1&#x0002a; functions as a growth factor receptor on pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Under conditions that included adding conditioned media from fibroblast feeder cells, antibody-induced dimerization of the extracellular domain of MUC1&#x0002a; stimulated the growth of hESCs more than two-fold better than current methods and importantly without requiring the addition of exogenous bFGF. Further, the addition of MUC1&#x0002a; dimerizing ligands, Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; or NM23, enabled the growth of pluripotent stem cells in feeder-cell-free and bFGF-free minimal growth media. In fact, stem cell growth supported by the addition of MUC1&#x0002a; ligands to minimal media resisted spontaneous differentiation and produced more pluripotent cells than any other growth condition that we tested. In contrast, neither minimal stem cell growth media nor media plus bFGF produced <italic>any</italic> undifferentiated stem cells. Stem cells that were cultured in conditioned media from fibroblasts plus bFGF generated a mixture of undifferentiated and differentiated colonies and the colonies were smaller than those produced by MUC1&#x0002a; stimulation. Thus, in addition to mediating the growth of embryonic stem cells, MUC1&#x0002a; may be a modulator of differentiation. The data presented strongly suggest that MUC1&#x0002a; is a critical marker for the identification and isolation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells as well as a key mediator of the growth and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Anti-MUC1&#x0002a; Antibodies</title><p>Polyclonal: Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first forty-five (45) amino acids of the extracellular domain, <named-content content-type="gene">GTINVHDVETQFNQYKTEAASPYNLTISDVSVSDVPFPFSAQSGA</named-content>, conjugated at the C-terminus with KLH and affinity purified by column chromatography.
