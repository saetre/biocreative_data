Glutathione S-transferase (<italic>GSTM1 </italic>and / or <italic>T1</italic>) null genotype modulates the risk of developing UADT cancer (primary as well as second cancer). The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in <italic>GST </italic>null genotype frequencies in females with paired cancers in the UADT and genital region as compared to females with paired cancers in the UADT and non-genital region. Forty-nine females with a cancer in the UADT and another cancer (at all sites-genital and non-genital) were identified from a database of patients with multiple primary neoplasms and were analyzed for the <italic>GSTM1 </italic>and <italic>T1 </italic>genotype in addition to known factors such as age, tobacco habits, alcohol habits and family history of cancer. Frequencies of <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null, <italic>GSTT1 </italic>null, and <italic>either GSTM1/T1 </italic>null were higher in females with paired occurrence of cancer in the UADT and genital site (54%, 33% and 75% respectively) in comparison to females with paired occurrence of cancer in the UADT and non-genital sites (22%, 6% and 24% respectively). The significantly higher inherited frequency of either <italic>GSTM1</italic>/<italic>T1 </italic>null genotype in females with a paired occurrence of cancers in UADT and genital region (p = 0.01), suggests that these females are more susceptible to damage by carcinogens as compared to females who have UADT cancers in association with cancers at non-genital sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Glutathione S-transferase</kwd><kwd>second cancer</kwd><kwd>paired cancer</kwd><kwd>multiple cancer</kwd><kwd>squamous carcinoma</kwd><kwd>genital</kwd><kwd>UADT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Precise risk estimation for the development of second cancers in the Head &#x00026; Neck, Lung, and Esophagus, also known as the Upper Aero-Digestive Tract (UADT), is difficult due to the multifactorial origin and gene-environment interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The Glutathione S transferase (<italic>GST</italic>) family of enzymes coded for by at least five distinct loci-<italic>alpha</italic>, <italic>mu</italic>, <italic>theta</italic>, <italic>pi </italic>and <italic>gamma </italic>detoxify tobacco carcinogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and play an important role in the gene-environment interaction associated risk for cancer. The results of a recently published meta- and pooled- analysis of 4635 cases and 5770 controls, support the widely studied association of inherited <italic>GST </italic>genotype with the risk of developing squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in the UADT. In addition the results support the notion that the risk increases when genotypes at multiple <italic>GST </italic>loci are considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Patients with second (synchronous and metachronous) cancers in the UADT also have a higher frequency of <italic>GST </italic>null genotype (particularly <italic>GSTM1 </italic>and <italic>T1</italic>) as compared to those with single cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the association seen in UADT cancers, <italic>GST </italic>null genotype has been associated with the risk of developing Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-positive primary cervical cancer in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and also with other cancers such as primary breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and primary thyroid cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Females with a primary HPV related cancer (particularly uterine cervix) develop second cancers in the UADT with an increased frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. HPV transmission has been suggested to account in part for the paired occurrence of cancers at these anatomically distinct sites of UADT and cervix. Exposure to tobacco carcinogens has been suggested as synergistic cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The mechanism by which HPV infection, necessary for the development of cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], causes UADT cancers is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

The median time to development of the paired cancer (or second cancer) was 4 years. The median age at diagnosis of first cancer in all females was 51 years and that of second cancer was 60 years. The commonest sites of first cancer were oral cavity (n = 17), genital region (n = 15), and esophagus including post-cricoid region (n = 12). Information on family history of cancer was available in 42 women and 6 (14.3%) had a first-degree relative affected with cancer. Of the 45 women where details of habits were available, 25 (56%) were tobacco chewers whereas only 1 (2%) smoked. Of the 29 patients in whom GSTM1 and T1 genotyping was done, the frequencies of <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null, <italic>GSTT1 </italic>null and either <italic>GSTM1/T1 </italic>null were 35%, 17% and 45% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Groupwise analysis</title><p>Results were further analyzed by dividing the females into two Groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>): Group 1 (n = 19), females who had a paired SCC in the UADT along with a cancer in the genital region and Group 2 (n = 30), females who had a paired SCC in the UADT along with a cancer at other sites (non-genital region). In the majority of the cases (80% in Group 1 and 86% in Group 2), UADT cancer occurred second in chronological order. The median time for the development of second cancer was 5-years (range 0&#x02013;20 years) for females in Group 1 in comparison to 3-years (range 0&#x02013;24 years) for females in Group 2. There were no significant differences in the median age at the diagnosis of the first cancer, family history of cancer or tobacco habits between the two groups. Uterine cervix was the commonest genital site of cancer in females in Group 1 (16/19, 84%), followed by vagina in one female, vaginal vault in one and vulva in one. The sites of second UADT cancer in females in Group 1 were: oral cavity (n = 7), oropharynx (n = 2), hypo pharynx (n = 1), trachea and Lung (n = 4), esophagus including post-cricoid (n = 4), thyroid (n = 1). In the females in Group 2, UADT was the commonest non-genital site of cancer (22/30, 73%), followed by breast (n = 6), duodenum (n = 1), and chronic lymphatic leukemia (n = 1). Histology of the cancer in the genital region in females in Group 1 was confirmed as SCC in the majority (18/19). In the remaining female the histology could not be confirmed as the records were missing, however it was confirmed that her cervical cancer was treated with radiotherapy, a treatment that is never given without histological confirmation at our hospital.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of host, environment and treatment related parameters in the two Groups of females with second cancer in the UADT.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">Group 1 [n = 19]</td><td align="left">Group 2 [n = 30]</td><td align="left">p value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Median age at the diagnosis of first cancer [years]</td><td align="left">50</td><td align="left">53</td><td align="left">0.58</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Median time to development of second cancer in years [range]</td><td align="left">5 [range 0&#x02013;20 years]</td><td align="left">3 [range 0&#x02013;24 years]</td><td align="left">0.31</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Family history of cancer</td><td align="left">3/18</td><td align="left">3/24</td><td align="left">1.00</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>GSTM1 </italic>null</td><td align="left">7/13 [54%]</td><td align="left">4/18 [22%]</td><td align="left">0.12</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>GSTT1 </italic>null</td><td align="left">4/12 [33%]</td><td align="left">1/17 [6%]</td><td align="left">0.13</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Either <italic>GSTM1</italic>/<italic>T1 </italic>null</td><td align="left">9/12 [75%]</td><td align="left">4/17 [24%]</td><td align="left">0.01</td></tr><tr><td align="left">*Tobacco habits</td><td align="left">9/18 [50%]</td><td align="left">17/27 [63%]</td><td align="left">0.54</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* Except one smoker, all other habitu&#x000e9;s were tobacco chewers and none of them consumed alcohol.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Null genotype frequencies for <italic>GSTT1</italic>, <italic>GSTM1 </italic>and either <italic>T1 </italic>or <italic>M1 </italic>were more frequent in Group 1 as compared to Group 2.

Of the 49 women with paired occurrence of an UADT SCC with a second cancer at any site, 19 (39%) were in the HPV related genital site. Majority (84%) of the genital cancers were in the Uterine Cervix and in more than half (68%) the genital cancer occurred before or within 6 months of development of the UADT cancer. Association between malignancies of the UADT and genital region (especially uterine cervix) has been observed by various investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Hemminki <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] studied the pattern of second cancers in females and found a consistent increase in second HPV related cancer when the first cancer was at an HPV related site (anogenital, skin, head and neck, oesophageal and rectal cancers). An excess of oral cancers (including lip, mouth, tongue, larynx and pharynx), as found in this study, followed cervical cancers. Other investigators have also found similar results in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Using incidence data from Surveillance, Epidemiology &#x00026; End Results (SEER), Spitz <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] found an elevated Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) for cervical cancer after an initial buccal cavity cancer and larynx cancer.</p><p>HPV transmission has been suggested to account in part for the paired occurrence of cancers at these anatomically distinct sites of UADT and cervix and smoking has been suggested as synergistic cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, smokeless tobacco is a predominant form of tobacco consumed by females in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and a recent study from India has shown a positive correlation of smokeless tobacco habits with cervical cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Additionally, results from another study from India found more than 80% of oral cancers in females attributable to smokeless tobacco habit as compared to the negligible influence of smoking and drinking on oral cancer in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In concordance with these figures, 44% of females in Group 1 in our study had smokeless tobacco habits and none of the patients, except for one, smoked.</p><p>The role of <italic>GST </italic>polymorphisms in the development of second cancers in the UADT has been a focus of few studies in various ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In all of these studies the <italic>GST </italic>null genotype (<italic>GSTM1 </italic>and or <italic>GSTT1</italic>) has been seen with increased frequency in patients with second cancers in the UADT as compared to those with single cancers in the UADT. The results of the recently published meta and pooled analysis support the notion of a greater risk of head and neck cancer when genotypes at multiple <italic>GST </italic>loci are considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The 35% <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null genotype frequency (in entire population of females with second cancers in the UADT) in this study is very similar to the <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null genotype frequency of 36% found in our previous study in male patients with second cancers in the UADT from similar ethnic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the null genotype frequency for <italic>GSTT1 </italic>in males was 41% vs. 17% in females from this study. Differences in the site of cancer and the form of tobacco use, which predisposes to cancer development at a particular site, between males and females might possibly explain the gender discordance in <italic>GSTT1 </italic>null genotype frequencies. Nonetheless the 41% and 17% null genotype frequency for <italic>GSTT1 </italic>in males and females respectively are higher than 8&#x02013;12% <italic>GSTT1 </italic>null genotype frequency found in healthy controls from similar ethnicity suggesting a true association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p><italic>GSTM1 </italic>and <italic>GSTT1 </italic>null genotype frequencies (54% and 33%) in the females who had second cancer in the UADT in association with a cancer in the genital region (Group 1) in the present study are higher than a) the respective frequencies (22% &#x00026; 6%) in females with second cancer in the UADT in association with a cancer at non-genital region (Group 2), b) the respective frequencies (49% &#x00026; 18%) found in subjects with single UADT cancers in two studies from a similar ethnic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], c) the respective frequencies (26% &#x00026; 19%) found in males with single UADT cancers from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and d) the respective frequencies (33% &#x00026; 8% and 24% &#x00026; 12%) found in Indian healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This suggests that the females who developed second cancers in the UADT in association with cancer at genital sites (Group 1 in this study) are possibly more susceptible to damage induced by carcinogens.</p><p>The association of <italic>GST </italic>polymorphism and the risk of single primary cervical SCC have been studied in female patients from various ethnicities. <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null genotype has been found to incur an increased risk for primary cervical cancer in a mixed Caucasian, Hispanic and African-American patient population as compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Like wise, in a study on 181 Korean cervical carcinoma patients, Kim <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], showed a positive correlation between <italic>GST </italic>genotypes and cervical carcinoma risk as compared to controls. In this study by Kim <italic>et al</italic>, <italic>GSTT1 </italic>null genotype was associated with an increased risk for cervical cancer. When the patients were stratified according to age, either <italic>GSTM1</italic>/<italic>T1 </italic>null genotype was significantly over represented in patients with cervical carcinoma who were = 40 years old. However, in a study on 190 Caucasian women, Chen <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], determined no association of <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null genotype with invasive cervical cancer risk. Other investigators have found results similar to that found in the study by Chen <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Differences in <italic>GST </italic>genotype frequencies in various control populations could account for the differences seen in various studies. For instance, the prevalence of <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null genotype in Caucasian, American and Korean population is similar (as high as 50%) whereas the prevalence of <italic>GSTT1 </italic>null genotypes varies from 15&#x02013;31% in the Caucasians to 50&#x02013;58% in the Koreans and Chinese.</p><p>In view of the known differences of the population frequency of null genotypes and its associated risks for cervical cancer across various ethnic groups, it is important to compare our results with those from studies conducted on subjects from a similar ethnic background. <italic>GSTM1 </italic>and <italic>GSTT1 </italic>null genotype frequencies (54% and 33% respectively) in the females who had at least one of the cancers in the genital region (Group 1) in the present study were similar to the respective frequencies (57% and 20% respectively) found in females with single (unpaired) cervical cancer cases from India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] suggesting that the association between <italic>GST </italic>genotype and cervical cancer risk in Group 1 females in our study is more likely to be a true association.</p><p>HPV is undoubtedly the main causative agent in cervical SCC's and the prevalence of HPV, mainly HPV16/18 of more than 95%, has been seen in tumours from cervical cancer patients from India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Evidence linking HPV to oral carcinogenesis is also growing and one of the highest prevalence rates of 74% of HPV 16 and 18 in oral tumors from smokeless tobacco habitu&#x000e9;s have been reported from southern India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As HPV infections are transient, the absence of HPV DNA does not rule out previous exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, though most of the patients with cervical cancer are positive for HPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], not all patients who have HPV infection will go on to develop cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Interactions between HPV and <italic>GST </italic>genotype may be a reason for this. The evidence for this is two-way. Chen <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] evaluating the reason for the lack of association between <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null genotypes and cervical cancer risk in their epidemiological study demonstrated that viral infection could have potential effect on the activity of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, particularly <italic>GSTM1</italic>. The results of their study raised a question of how chronic viral infections could affect cellular defenses against carcinogens in general. Evidence from other studies suggests that inherited susceptibility in the form of <italic>GST </italic>genotype may modulate the risk of developing HPV related cancer as evidenced by <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null genotype which, in addition to HPV infection and smoking, has been found to increase the risk of developing cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, in the patients with cervix cancers having a positive association with <italic>GST </italic>null genotype, as studied by Kim <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], HPV 16 or 18 infections were confirmed in all.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of our study suggest an association between the <italic>GST </italic>null genotype and the occurrence of paired cancers in the UADT and HPV related genital sites in females. Though this is the first study to report such an association, further confirmation from larger studies on patients from different ethnic backgrounds is required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>SGJ would like to thank his wife, Sudha, for her help with preparation of the manuscript.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref
