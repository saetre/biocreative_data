Separation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or base-paired regions in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules is a prerequisite for basic genetic processes, such as genome replication, repair, recombination and expression at multiple stages. The loss of helicase function causes a number of disorders in organisms. Three hereditary disorders (Werner&#x02019;s syndrome, Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome and a subset of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome) in humans are associated with the loss of function of the respective RecQ homologs &#x0005b;BLM, WRN and RTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c3">3</xref>)&#x0005d;. The eukaryotic RecQ homologs are thus named due to their similarity to the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ helicase, which participates in the bacterial RecF genetic recombination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c4">4</xref>). The RecQ helicase domains of BLM, WRN and RTS are similar to those of the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ enzyme. However, the mammalian proteins are larger, due to the presence of additional flanking domains. To date, five RecQ homologs have been identified in the human genome &#x0005b;RecQ1&#x0002f;QL, BLM, WRN, RTS and RecQ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c7">7</xref>)&#x0005d;.</p><p>In contrast to BLM, WRN and RTS, RecQ1&#x0002f;QL and RecQ5 possess only short N-terminal regions preceding the helicase domain. The functions of these short N-terminal type RecQ homologs are hitherto unknown. Recently, we isolated a <italic>Drosophila</italic> RecQ5 homolog, RECQ5&#x0002f;QE, specifically expressed in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c8">8</xref>). The results of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome project revealed that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> contains three RecQ homologs, <italic>Blm</italic>, <italic>Rts</italic> and <italic>RECQ5&#x0002f;QE</italic>, in addition to a Werner exonuclease protein family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c10">10</xref>). The only short N-terminal-type RecQ protein in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> appears to be RECQ5&#x0002f;QE, since no RecQ1&#x0002f;QL homolog has been identified so far. In both humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, RecQ5 exists as three isoforms produced by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c11">11</xref>). Small isoforms of human RecQ5 localize to the cytoplasm, while the large isoform is nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c12">12</xref>). The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein isolated from <italic>Drosophila</italic> by our group represents the large isoform, and localizes to the nucleus (S. Maruyama and K. Kawasaki, unpublished results; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c11">11</xref>).</p><p>The predicted RECQ5&#x0002f;QE gene product is a 1058 amino acid protein that contains a helicase domain comprising seven helicase motifs. We propose that <italic>RECQ5&#x0002f;QE</italic> encodes an active helicase, based on the results of studies on the <italic>in vitro</italic> translational product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c8">8</xref>). In addition, a small RECQ5 isoform may function as a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c13">13</xref>). The presence of multiple RecQ homologs in a single organism suggests that each enzyme has a distinct role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c7">7</xref>). Therefore, to elucidate the mechanistic and functional characteristics of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE, it is necessary to determine the biochemical properties of the protein. To achieve this goal, we have employed an insect-based expression system that permits the preparation of homogeneous RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein with a reasonable yield.</p><p>We report here that the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein is a ssDNA-stimulated ATPase and an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is a ssDNA-dependent GTPase, and that GTP binding stimulates the ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity of the protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of BmNPV&#x02013;RECQ5&#x0002f;QE</title><p>The full-length <italic>Dra</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Nco</italic>I RECQ5&#x0002f;QE cDNA (&#x02013;16 to &#x0002b;3487) was cloned into the <italic>Sma</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Nco</italic>I sites of the pBm31 transfer vector under the control of the polyhedrin promoter.

A linear KCl gradient (0.1&#x02013;1.0 M KCl) was used for elution. The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein eluted at 0.44 M KCl, as determined by SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of fractions and immunoblotting with anti-RECQ5&#x0002f;QE antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c8">8</xref>).

The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein eluted at &#x0223c;0.35 M NaCl. The purified, active protein was stored at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C. The heparin&#x02013;Sepharose fraction was also analyzed using Superose 6 (HR10&#x0002f;30; Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA.

Polyacrylamide gels were dried on Whatman DE81 paper and agarose gels were dried on GelBond PAG film (BMA). Dried gels were analyzed using the BAS 2500 Imaging plate reader, or were exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography. Experiments were repeated at least twice. The results were reproducible with little gel-to-gel variation, thus allowing quantitation among samples on different gels. Quantitative data from a single gel are shown.</p></sec><sec><title>SDS&#x02013;PAGE, immunoblotting and silver staining</title><p>SDS&#x02013;PAGE was performed according to the procedure of Laemmli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c17">17</xref>).

To circumvent these problems, the recombinant virus, BmNPV&#x02013;RECQ5&#x0002f;QE, containing the full-length RECQ5&#x0002f;QE under the control of the BmNPV polyhedrin promoter, was generated (Materials and Methods). Cells infected with BmNPV&#x02013;RECQ5&#x0002f;QE yielded a soluble product that migrated on SDS&#x02013;PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa. This corresponded to the expected molecular mass determined from the open reading frame of <italic>RECQ5&#x0002f;QE</italic>. Immunoblotting of crude lysates of infected cells with anti-RECQ5&#x0002f;QE antibodies revealed a single 120 kDa band, confirming that the overexpressed protein was the desired product. The majority of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein was recovered from a 0.45 M KCl extract and not the cytosol, suggesting nuclear localization. The protein was not detected in BmN cells prior to infection or by mock infection (data not shown). The 120 kDa protein was purified to near homogeneity by successive chromatography steps, as monitored by immunoblotting and DNA-dependent ATPase and GTPase assays (Materials and Methods; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f1">1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein is oligomeric</title><p>We examined the native molecular mass of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein. Superose 6 gel filtration of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein in the presence of 0.3 M KCl revealed a peak at 480 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f1">1</xref>B, C and E). This apparent molecular mass corresponds to a tetramer of the 120 kDa RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein. We did not detect RECQ5&#x0002f;QE in smaller molecular weight fractions corresponding to monomers or dimers. The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein in cultured cells showed the same molecular mass (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f1">1</xref>D), suggesting that the protein exists in an oligomeric form.</p></sec><sec><title>The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase</title><p>&#x02018;Walker Box&#x02019; motifs, which predict ATPase activity, were observed in the primary sequence of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE. The ability of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein to hydrolyze ATP was therefore examined. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f2">2</xref> shows that RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is associated with an ATPase activity that is strongly dependent on the presence of ssDNA. The substrate turnover rate was calculated as 18.2 s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with M13mp18 virion DNA as a co-factor, and 3.23 s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> without DNA. Moreover, the ATPase activity required divalent ions. Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> could be replaced by Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but not Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf487tb1">1</xref>). This specific requirement of divalent cations for activity is similar to that observed with the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c18">18</xref>). Monovalent ions inhibited the ATPase activity (50&#x00025; inhibition with 65 mM NaCl). The ATPase activity of the purified protein was stimulated by ssDNA, while dsDNA had no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein is a DNA helicase</title><p>To determine if the ATP hydrolysis by RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is coupled to the helicase activity, we examined whether the purified enzyme could displace a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligodeoxynucleo tide from single-stranded circular M13mp18 DNA. The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein separated the oligonucleotide from the ssDNA ring in the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f3">3</xref>). A time-course of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE-mediated strand displacement is displayed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f3">3</xref>A. Over 50&#x00025; of the labeled fragment was displaced within 3 min, and the reaction was close to completion within 10 min. The quantity of the labeled fragment separated from the single-stranded circular DNA depended on the amount of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein added (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f3">3</xref>B). The amount of protein required to separate the 69mer from the complementary ssDNA was twice that needed for the 20mer separation. RECQ5&#x0002f;QE separated the 20mer, 69mer and the Y-shaped short DNA region from single-stranded circular DNA, but not long duplex or blunt duplex DNA (data not shown). Therefore, we suggest that the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE DNA helicase has low processivity. Since blunt-ended duplex DNA was not a substrate for the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase, we prepared single-stranded linear DNA with 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032;-end labeled double-stranded regions at both ends (Materials and Methods). As observed for the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ helicase, displacement of DNA strands by RECQ5&#x0002f;QE occurred in the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction with respect to the ssDNA flanking the duplex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f3">3</xref>C). The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE DNA helicase activity was dependent on ATP hydrolysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f4">4</xref>). No helicase activity was observed when the ATP was replaced with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, adenosine 5&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-(thiotriphosphate) (ATP&#x003b3;S). Furthermore, in the presence of 2 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;ATP, the addition of the same concentration of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S partially inhibited the strand separation activity. ATP (2 mM) was replaceable by dATP, although other common nucleotide triphosphates either could not, or only weakly supported the DNA strand separation catalyzed by RECQ5&#x0002f;QE.

Unexpectedly, a ssDNA-dependent GTPase activity that was several fold higher than the ATPase activity was readily detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f2">2</xref>). The GTP hydrolysis required the presence of ssDNA, but was not activated by dsDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f2">2</xref>). The substrate turnover rate of GTPase using M13mp18 virion DNA as a co-factor was 75.8 s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> (3.63 s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> without DNA). The GTPase activity required divalent ions.

The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of ATP and GTP were 0.39 and 0.88 mM, respectively. Further characterization of the enzyme revealed that the ATPase activity was inhibited competitively by GTP and its analogs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f5">5</xref>B). Conversely, the GTPase activity was strongly inhibited in a competitive manner by ATP and its analogs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f5">5</xref>C). However, UTP and CTP did not inhibit the ATPase and GTPase activities as strongly. The optimum reaction conditions, in terms of pH, metal ions and salt, were quite similar for both activities. The purified protein exhibited both the ATPase and GTPase activities in the presence of ssDNA, but not dsDNA. Both the ATPase and GTPase activities were concomitantly inhibited by specific antibodies against RECQ5&#x0002f;QE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f5">5</xref>D). These data suggest that the active centers for the ATPase and GTPase activities are the same or indistinguishable in the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein.</p><p>We conclude that both the ATPase and GTPase activities are intrinsic properties of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein, based on the following observations: (i) the purified protein possesses both ATPase and GTPase; (ii) a significant correlation is noted between the ATPase and GTPase activities and the presence of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein throughout the purification steps in multiple preparations, while the corresponding activities were absent from extracts prepared from a mock infection of virus; (iii) GTP and GTP analogs competitively inhibit the ATPase activity; (iv) ATP and ATP analogs competitively inhibit the GTPase activity; (v) both activities display almost identical characteristics in terms of their optimal reaction requirements; (vi) GTP, albeit a weaker binding substrate than ATP, is also used in the DNA helicase activity of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE; and (vii) both the ATPase and GTPase activities were neutralized by anti-RECQ5&#x0002f;QE antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>GTP stimulates the helicase activity of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE</title><p>Since ATP and GTP bind to either the same or an indis tinguishable site of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE, we explored the possibility that GTP affects the strand separation activity of the protein. GTP resulted in weaker DNA helicase activity than ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f4">4</xref>). The GTPase activity of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein was higher than that of the ATPase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f2">2</xref>). To date, we have not established a function of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE that specifically requires GTP hydrolysis. GTP supported only weak helicase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 7), but did not inhibit the ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 6). Surprisingly, stimulation of the ATP-dependent helicase activity by GTP was observed in the presence of a limited amount of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 5 versus 6). Under these conditions, ATP strongly inhibited the ssDNA-dependent GTPase activity of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein, while GTP reduced the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity to approximately half the original value. Since guanosine 5&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP&#x003b3;S) inhibited the ssDNA-dependent ATPase of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE to the same extent as GTP, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP&#x003b3;S, was employed to distinguish whether the stimulation of activity was caused by GTP binding or hydrolysis. We observed that GTP&#x003b3;S stimulated the ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity to a greater extent than GTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 4). Therefore, we propose that the binding of GTP to RECQ5&#x0002f;QE specifically stimulates its DNA helicase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>GTP binding to RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is needed for stimulation of the helicase activity</title><p>GTP&#x003b3;S neither supported the helicase reaction itself (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 12) nor induced the DNA helicase activity in the presence of GTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 9). Moreover, ATP&#x003b3;S did not support the helicase reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 11), was inhibitory to this reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 3), and did not induce the DNA helicase activity in the presence of GTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f6">6</xref>, lane 8). GTP&#x003b3;S was slowly hydrolyzed by the GTPase, while guanosine 5&#x02032;-(&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-imidotriphosphate) (GMPPNP) was not. GMPPNP activated the DNA helicase activity in the presence of ATP, in contrast to GDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f7">7</xref>). We noted that the stimulation was GTP analog-specific and concentration-dependent (data not shown). Furthermore, GTP hydrolysis was not necessary for triggering the activity, although the requirement for GTP binding was evident. Although non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs inhibited the ATPase activity of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein, the remaining activity associated with strand separation was not only sufficient, but was actually enhanced.</p></sec><sec><title>Helicase activity stimulation by GTP analogs is caused by an increase in the strand separation rate in the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase reaction</title><p>GMPPNP and GTP&#x003b3;S reduced the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE to approximately half of that observed under stimulating conditions. In the helicase assay, a labeled 20mer was annealed to single-stranded circular M13mp18 DNA (7249b). The overall level of ATP hydrolysis reflected the presence of a large ssDNA region. The stimulatory effects of GMPPNP or GTP&#x003b3;S were specific for the helicase reaction. This stimulation may be caused by the efficient recognition of the substrate, ATP or DNA, or an increase in the strand separation rate during the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase reaction. GMPPNP did not affect the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for DNA (0.5 &#x000b5;M) or the <italic>S</italic><sub>0.5</sub> value for ATP (0.28 mM) in the DNA helicase reaction, but led to an increase in the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> value of the DNA helicase reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f8">8</xref>). The addition of GTP and GTP analogs did not affect the polarity of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase (data not shown). Therefore, GTP binding possibly stimulates the strand separation rate and&#x0002f;or the processivity of the DNA helicase.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>RECQ5&#x0002f;QE has a unique ssDNA-dependent GTPase activity</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is a DNA-dependent GTPase and ATPase, and an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Furthermore, GTP binding stimulated the DNA helicase activity. Most helicases favor ATP as their energy source, although in some cases GTP may be utilized in addition to ATP &#x0005b;e.g. HSV-1 helicase-primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c19">19</xref>), <italic>E.coli</italic> dnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c20">20</xref>) and T4 gp41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c21">21</xref>)&#x0005d;. The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein prefers ATP for the helicase activity, but is more active in hydrolyzing GTP than ATP on ssDNA. No ssDNA-dependent GTPase similar to RECQ5&#x0002f;QE has been reported so far. Helicase motifs share some homology with GTP-binding consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c22">22</xref>). A comparison of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE amino acid sequence with other members of the RecQ family and GTPases revealed similarities around the helicase motif I and in the GTPase P-loop &#x0005b;G-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c23">23</xref>)&#x0005d; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f9">9</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>E.coli</italic> FtsZ protein usually behaves as a GTPase. However, a single amino acid substitution (G to S, producing FtsZ84) results in a change in the activity to an ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c24">24</xref>). This substitution at the phosphoryl-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c25">25</xref>) is associated indirectly with purine recognition (adenine and guanine). Therefore, it is possible that the GTPase and ATPase active centers are the same in the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein. This position is well conserved in most RecQ family members (L or V), but varies in <italic>Dm</italic> RECQ5&#x0002f;QE (S), <italic>Ce</italic> E03A3.2 (S), <italic>Hs</italic> RECQ5(C), <italic>Mm</italic> RECQ5(C) and <italic>Dm</italic> RTS (T). It would be interesting to determine whether these RecQ proteins additionally exhibit the GTPase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase</title><p>Recently, the small RECQ5 isoform (54 kDa) was purified and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c13">13</xref>). The ATPase characteristics of this protein are quite similar to those of our large isoform (120 kDa), and its DNA helicase activity may also be comparable (i.e. low processivity and polarity). Significantly, the DNA unwinding reaction catalyzed by the small RECQ5 isoform requires unexpectedly high protein concentrations. On the other hand, our large isoform, RECQ5&#x0002f;QE, appears to be more active in the helicase reaction. These results are consistent with the results from <italic>in vitro</italic> translation products. Previously, we demonstrated that the full-length (amino acids 1&#x02013;1058) and the N-terminal half (1&#x02013;584) of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE showed DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c8">8</xref>). The small RECQ5 isoform (1&#x02013;473) exhibited very weak DNA helicase activity using <italic>in vitro</italic> translation products (K. Kawasaki, unpublished results).</p></sec><sec><title>RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is an oligomeric helicase</title><p>The native molecular mass of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein was &#x0223c;480 kDa, and no RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein was evident in smaller molecular mass fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f1">1</xref>). The DNA helicase family is categorized into at least two classes, specifically, oligomeric ring and monomeric forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c27">27</xref>). Physical data indicate that the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE DNA helicase belongs to the oligomeric type. The BLM helicase, a member of the RecQ family, exists as a hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c28">28</xref>). Harmon and Kowalczykowski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c29">29</xref>) demonstrated that the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ protein has a Hill coefficient of 3.3. The active complex formed upon RecQ helicase binding to DNA substrates is expected to be oligomeric, since multiple ATP-binding sites are utilized by the protein to achieve strand separation. These findings collectively suggest that members of the RecQ family are oligomeric DNA helicases. It should be noted that non-hydrolyzable analogs of helicase substrates assemble subunits into stable hexamers &#x0005b;dTMPPNP for T7 gp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c30">30</xref>) and ATP&#x003b3;S&#x0002f;GTP&#x003b3;S for T4 gp 41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c21">21</xref>)&#x0005d;. However, Superose 6 gel filtration experiments revealed that ATP&#x003b3;S did not change the apparent molecular mass of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE (K. Kawasaki, unpublished results). It remains to be determined whether ATP&#x003b3;S has the ability to assemble the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein into its active hexameric form in the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of ATP hydrolysis in the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase activity</title><p>We observed that ATP drove the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase activity, whereas GTP had little effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f4">4</xref>). However, the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein hydrolyzes GTP on ssDNA more efficiently than ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf487f2">2</xref>). These data suggest that the mechanism of the GTP-dependent DNA binding&#x0002f;release differs from that of the ATP-dependent DNA binding&#x0002f;release. Since the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase is oligomeric, it is possible that the protein subunits work cooperatively when utilizing ATP, but not GTP. Consequently, the GTPase activity of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is not coordinated to DNA binding&#x0002f;release for strand separation. Biochemical analyses of the NS-1 protein of the mouse minute virus and the UL5 protein of Herpes simplex virus revealed that most of the mutants retained significant levels of ATPase activity, while point mutations in the ATP-binding domain severely reduced the helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c32">32</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesize that the ATP-binding domain is important for the coupling of the ATPase and helicase activities. The ATP-binding sites of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE function in both the ATP hydrolysis and the coupling of the ATPase and helicase activities. Although GTP hydrolysis occurs at the same or an indistinguishable site as that for ATP hydrolysis, the former reaction does not accomplish efficient strand separation. The non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs, GTP&#x003b3;S and GMPPNP, also bind RECQ5&#x0002f;QE. Therefore, it is possible that GTP analogs induce a specific conformation in RECQ5&#x0002f;QE through interactions with the ATP-binding site.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible mechanisms of helicase stimulation by GTP analogs</title><p>Despite the partial inhibition of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE ATPase activity by GTP&#x003b3;S and GMPPNP, the strand separation activity was not inhibited, but rather, was stimulated. This implies that GTP analogs modulate the DNA helicase activity of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE under conditions where a decreasing supply of energy is available from ATP hydrolysis. Since the <italic>S</italic><sub>0.5</sub> (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) values for DNA and ATP remained unchanged in the absence and presence of GTP analogs during the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase reaction, the increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> may be explained by an elevated strand separation rate and&#x0002f;or processivity. The helicase reaction consists of multiple steps, specifically, oligomerization, ssDNA binding, encounter with the dsDNA region, ATP hydrolysis, DNA binding&#x0002f;release, coordination between ATP hydrolysis and DNA, polar translocation on DNA, displacement from DNA, and recycling. It is therefore important to determine the specific step of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE reaction that is influenced by GTP analogs. There are several possible explanations for the stimulation by GTP analogs. One hypothesis is that the population of active enzyme is increased upon preventing the formation of a non-productive enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex in the presence of GTP analogs. The helicase activity of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE is inhibited by ssDNA, presumably because the protein is sequestered by ssDNA. Therefore, the GTP analogs may increase the effective concentration of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE by blocking the sequestration of the enzyme. However, this possibility is unlikely, since the gel mobility shift experiments demonstrated that GTP analogs do not affect the preference or the strength of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE DNA binding (K. Kawasaki, unpublished results). Another potential explanation is that GTP analogs stimulate the formation of an oligomeric helicase. The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase exhibits an apparent native molecular mass corresponding to a tetrameric protein, while RecQ is a hexameric helicase. However, the native molecular mass of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE remained unchanged on Superose 6 gel filtration in the presence of GTP&#x003b3;S (K. Kawasaki, unpublished results). In addition, a pre-incubation of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase with GTP analogs did not cause stimulation of the helicase reaction. We cannot exclude the possibility that the active oligomeric formation is too fast to be detected, and is dependent on DNA. A third explanation for the stimulation of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase by GTP analogs is that these compounds directly enhance the translocation rate and&#x0002f;or the processivity of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase during strand separation. Non-catalytic nucleotide binding sites have been found in the F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase protein, which shares structural similarity with hexameric helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c33">33</xref>). In this case, it is thought that the non-catalytic sites ensure cooperative catalysis between the catalytic sites. A study by Singleton <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c34">34</xref>) demonstrated that, in the complex of homo-hexameric T7 gene 4 helicase with ADPNP, only four of the six sites bind nucleotides at any time. GTP analogs may define the non-catalytic sites in the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE oligomer, which ensures cooperativity between the catalytic sites for efficient strand separation. It is currently unclear how a homo-oligomeric helicase contains non-catalytic (permanently inactive) or empty, but active sites for NTP&#x0002f;NDP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c35">35</xref>). It remains to be determined whether the binding of GTP&#x003b3;S or GMPPNP similarly defines non-catalytic sites in RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase. Note that the above possibilities for the stimulation of RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase by GTP analogs are not exclusive of each other.</p><p>This study is an initial characterization of the large isoform of the RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase, and suggests a new mechanism of regulation or activation of the helicase activity. The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein is accumulated in early embryos (K. Kawasaki, unpublished results; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf487c8">8</xref>). The helicase activity stimulation implies that RECQ5&#x0002f;QE may be responsible for a quick response to DNA repair or&#x0002f;and processing of stalled replication forks in early embryonic DNA replication. The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE helicase activity is regulated by cofactors or unknown effectors inducing an active or suppressive state.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf487f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The RECQ5&#x0002f;QE protein has a molecular mass of 120 kDa and is oligomeric.
