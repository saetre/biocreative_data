However, the mechanisms of Fra-1 regulation and Fra-1 regulated gene expression in human malignant mesothelioma (MM) are unclear. We first show in a panel of human MM cells that Fra-1 mRNA expression in MM is complex and regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1, ERK2), Src, and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways in a tumor-specific fashion. Cell lines with PI3K-dependent Fra-1 expression were SV40 positive and expressed the lowest basal Fra-1 levels. Levels of Fra-1 expression correlated with amounts of CD44 expression that were greater in simian virus 40 negative (SV40-) MM cells. Using dominant negative (dn), short hairpin (sh) and small interference (si) RNA constructs, we next demonstrate that expression of CD44, the principal hyaluronic receptor in MMs, correlates with Fra-expression in both simian virus 40 positive (SV40+) and SV40- MMs. Moreover, both Fra-1 and CD44 expression are linked to cell migration in SV40- MM cells. Lastly, in contrast to normal lung tissue, tissue microarrays revealed that Fra-1 was expressed in 33 of 34 human MMs, and that all CD44+ tumors were SV40-. These results suggest that Fra-1 is associated with cell migration in human MMs and that Fra-1 modulation of CD44 may govern migration of selected MMs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an insidious tumor associated historically with occupational exposure to asbestos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recently, infection by simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated as a contributory factor in the development of MMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] but these findings are controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The average survival of patients is less than 1 year after initial diagnosis of MM, and no successful treatment options exist for the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These pleomorphic tumors are unique in that they have a long latency period (average of 30+ years) and various pathologies (epithelial, sarcomatous and mixed) that complicate their diagnosis and may govern their prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although the mechanisms of development of MM are obscure, the initiation of signaling events after interaction of mesothelial cells with asbestos fibers or infection by SV40 may result in transactivation of genes governing cell proliferation and other properties of neoplastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1) consists of members of the Jun (c-Jun, JunD, JunB) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) family of early response protooncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and is a major target of asbestos-induced cell signaling via activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In comparison to other Jun and Fos family members, increases in Fra-1 expression by asbestos are protracted in rodent lung epithelial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and pleural mesothelial cells and are critical in maintenance of the malignant phenotype of rat MMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>cd44</italic>, which encodes the principal hyaluronic acid receptor in a variety of cell types, is a <italic>fra-1 </italic>regulated gene in rat MMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>CD44 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein (85&#x02013;200 kDa) and functions as the major cellular adhesion molecule for hyaluronic acid (HA), a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). CD44 is expressed in most human cell types and is implicated in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes, including lymphocyte homing and activation, wound healing, cell migration, tumor cell growth, metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The CD44 gene consists of at least 19 exons, of which 12 can be alternatively spliced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and this differential gene expression through alternative splicing is important to various physiological and pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The most common isoform expressed in a variety of cell types is CD44s (standard). The distribution of the CD44 variants is usually restricted, and some variants are only expressed in certain tumor cells where their expression can confer metastatic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The CD44 hyaluronic acid receptor is upregulated in human MMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and increased hyaluronic acid in pleural fluid and serum is used both as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator of MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In a previous study, it was found that MM cell lines that expressed the highest amount of CD44 receptor showed increased proliferation and haptotactic migration when stimulated with low molecular weight hyaluronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the use of a monoclonal antibody against CD44 inhibited proliferation by 12&#x02013;40% and migration by 10&#x02013;35% in the MM cell lines that were studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The goal of studies here was to elucidate cell signaling pathways leading to transactivation of CD44 by Fra-1 and their functional ramifications on migration of both SV40+ and SV40- human MM cells. We first established that Fra-1 expression is inducible by serum and is heterogeneous in different MM cells when modulated by inhibitors of the P13K, Src or ERK1/2 pathways. Levels of Fra-1 correlated with CD44 protein levels that were higher in SV40- MMs. The functional significance of <italic>Fra-</italic>1<italic>-</italic>dependent CD44 expression was determined in high CD44-expressing SV40- MM cells using small hairpin (sh) RNA interference constructs. These experiments showed that inhibition of <italic>Fra-1 </italic>or <italic>CD44 </italic>significantly curtailed MM cell migration. More importantly, Fra-1 overexpression was observed in 33 of 34 human MMs in tissue arrays and all CD44+ tumors were SV40-.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of PI3K, Src or the ERK1/2 pathway diminishes <italic>Fra-1 </italic>expression, transactivation and protein levels in human MM cells in a tumor-specific manner</title><p>We first focused on whether heterogeneous pathways of Fra-1 regulation occurred in human MM cells using inhibition of upstream signaling cascades. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, we observed that the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (LY 20 &#x003bc;M), caused significant reduction of <italic>Fra-1 </italic>mRNA levels in 3 of the 4 MM lines initially examined, whereas addition of AG1478 (AG 10 &#x003bc;M), an inhibitor of EGFR phosphorylation, had no effects on <italic>Fra-1 </italic>expression. Two of the 4 MM lines showed inhibition of <italic>Fra-1 </italic>expression after pretreatment with PP2 (10 &#x003bc;M) or PD98059 (PD, 30 &#x003bc;M), respectively, suggesting additional pathways of <italic>Fra-1 </italic>modulation in some MMs. In MM3 cells in which <italic>Fra-1 </italic>mRNA levels were diminished significantly only after inhibition of the PI3K pathway, transactivation of <italic>Fra-1 </italic>dependent gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) were also inhibited selectively by LY294002 (20 &#x003bc;M). In accordance with data presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, pre-addition of the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478 (10 &#x003bc;M) did not affect Fra-1 protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, we also show using an EMSA super-shift assay that inhibition of the PI3K pathway by LY294002 (10 and 20 &#x003bc;M) causes reduced expression of Fra-1 in the AP-1 complexes of these cells in a dose-related fashion.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>ERK1/2, Src and PI3K regulation of Fra-1 expression in MM cell lines is tumor line-specific.

These studies revealed that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 diminished CD44 protein in a dose-related fashion in the SV40+ line, but not in the SV40- MM lines. The Src inhibitor, PP2, did not affect CD44 expression in the SV40+ MM line, but decreased CD44 expression in the SV40- MM line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). CD44 protein was decreased after addition of the PD98059 MEK1 inhibitor and in a SV40- cell line transformed with a dn-Fra-1 construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, CD44 depletion was not increased synergistically after PD98059 or LY294002 was added to the dnFra-1 stable cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results show the complexity of Fra-1 regulation in MM and suggest that Fra-1, Src, ERK1/2-and PI3K are also modulators of CD44 expression in different MM lines.

Although Fra-1 plays an important role in cell transformation and is upregulated by cigarette smoke, mitogens and phorbol ester tumor promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], little is known about how this important protein is regulated in human tumors. Moreover, the functional ramifications of its expression and its mechanisms of action on individual tumor types are unclear.</p><p>Fra-1 expression and its activation by the ERK1/2 pathway have been well documented in several systems including rat MM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. More recently, gene profiling studies revealed that Fra-1 was an AKT-inducible gene in prostate cancer cells and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and was a PI3K-dependent gene in human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and MM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Here we present evidence that Fra-1 mRNA expression is complex in human MMs, involving activation of the ERK1/2, PI3K, and Src pathways in a tumor cell-specific manner. In contrast, levels of Fra-1 in MMs were not modified by pre-addition of an inhibitor of EGFR phosphorylation (AG1478) although it is known that EGFR phosphorylation leads to ERK1/2 activation in rodent mesothelial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Moreover, both matrix metalloproteinase/EGFR/MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and PI3K regulated AKT independent signaling pathways regulate Fra-1 induction by cigarette smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>We previously reported that increases in Fra-1 expression in rat mesotheliomas were causally linked to genes governing cell motility and invasion (<italic>cd44 </italic>and <italic>met</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Other investigators also have reported that AP-1 mediated invasion of transformed fibroblasts requires increased expression of CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We hypothesize that the increased expression of Fra-1 in the AP-1 complex causes the activation of target genes that influence malignancy and invasion of human MMs. Here we present evidence that Fra-1 activation is through multiple survival pathways and that its expression governs human mesothelioma cell migration partially via indirect modulation of CD44 expression.</p><p>In human MM cell lines and tumors, the degree of constitutive Fra-1 expression is tumor line-dependent. The localization of Fra-1 in all tumors was primarily nuclear, but some cytoplasmic localization could be observed in CD44- tumors. Although the nuclear localization of any transcription factor is of critical importance for its function in downstream gene regulation, the cytoplasmic localization of Fra-1 could also have some impact in its function. Simultaneous nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of Fra-1 has been reported in breast malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], although its functional significance was unexplored.</p><p>We show here that low basal Fra-1 and CD44 levels correlated with SV40 positivity in MM cell lines and could be upregulated upon stimulation with serum. Previous studies have demonstrated that SV40 large T antigen can activate the PI3K pathway in different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and, in line with these observations, we have shown that SV40+ MM cells have higher AKT activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Moreover, SV40+ MMs were more susceptible to killing when the PI3K pathway was inhibited. These studies suggest that SV40 positivity of MMs may render a survival advantage. However, CD44 does not contribute to the migration of SV40+ MM cells which may depend upon multiple mechanisms including voltage-gated sodium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], expression of the EphA2 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], MAPK-regulated MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], and integrin or ECM composition and synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>The presence and role of SV40 in human tumors is still very controversial, but SV40 T-antigen or DNA has been found in human MMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Results here suggest that SV40 is a contributor to the heterogeneity of migration responses found in human MMs.</p><p>The role of other Fra-1-dependent genes and signaling pathways should be explored in prevention and therapy of MMs of both SV40+ and SV40- MMs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human mesothelioma (MM) cell lines</title><p>Human pleural mesothelioma cell lines were isolated from patients at autopsy (from Dr. Michele Carbone, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI (MM3, MM4, MM7), and Dr. Luciano Mutti (Maugeri Foundation, Pavia, Italy) (MM1, MM6), or from surgical debulking of MMs from Dr. Harvey Pass (New York University, NY, NY) (MM2).
