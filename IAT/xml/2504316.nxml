We investigated the direct role of GATA-1 interaction at the LCR HS2 enhancer by mutating its binding sites within minichromosomes in erythroid cells. Loss of GATA-1 in HS2 did not compromise interaction of NF-E2, a second activator that binds to HS2, nor was DNase I hypersensitivity at HS2 or the promoter of a linked &#x003b5;-globin gene altered. Reduction of NF-E2 using RNAi confirmed the overall importance of this activator in establishing LCR HSs. However, recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase CBP and RNA pol II to HS2 was diminished by GATA-1 loss. Transcription of &#x003b5;-globin was severely compromised with loss of RNA pol II from the transcription start site and reduction of H3 acetylation and H3K4 di- and tri-methylation in coding sequences. In contrast, widespread detection of H3K4 mono-methylation was unaffected by loss of GATA-1 in HS2. These results support the idea that GATA-1 interaction in HS2 has a prominent and direct role in co-activator and pol II recruitment conferring active histone tail modifications and transcription activation to a target gene but that it does not, by itself, play a major role in establishing DNase I hypersensitivity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcriptional activators bind to enhancers and/or promoters, consequently initiating the transcription of a gene at the proper level. One of the roles of transcriptional activators is to recruit co-activators with chromatin modifying activities such as histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity or ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling activities that alter chromatin structure to a favourable status for transcription in regulatory regions and genes. The locus control region (LCR) of the &#x003b2;-globin genes is a complex transcriptional enhancer element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Numerous binding motifs for transcriptional activators including NF-E2 and GATA-1 cluster in the LCR DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs) and are selectively occupied by the corresponding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Null mutations in murine erythroid cell lines indicate that these activators have important functions in chromatin remodelling and histone modification in the &#x003b2;-globin locus and transcription activation of the &#x003b2;-globin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p><italic>Gata</italic>-1 is essential for the maturation and differentiation of erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>) likely through pleiotropic mechanisms. In mouse and human erythroid cells, GATA-1 occupies HS1&#x02013;HS4 of the &#x003b2;-globin LCR and the promoters of actively transcribed globin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In murine erythroid G1E cells where the expression of GATA-1 protein can be regulated, transcription of the &#x003b2;-globin gene is strongly induced by restoration of GATA-1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The level of histone acetylation is also increased at the LCR HSs and the activated gene in this system and CBP, a co-activator HAT, associates with LCR HSs in a manner that is at least partially dependent on restoration of GATA-1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Moreover, experiments using this system indicate that GATA-1 function is required for loop formation (physical interaction) between the LCR and the &#x003b2;-globin gene which occurs upon transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Although these experiments support the idea that the effects of GATA-1 restoration are mediated directly through GATA-1 LCR (or promoter) occupancy, one cannot rule out the possibility that the effects are indirectly caused by other factors whose expression or function might be influenced by GATA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Individual NF-E2 or GATA-1 binding sites have not been ablated in their endogenous chromosomal setting. We have addressed the function of these activators at LCR sites by employing a model system in which LCR HS2 is linked to a complete &#x003b5;-globin gene on chromatinized minichromosomes in erythroid K562 cells. HS2 activates minichromosomal &#x003b5;-globin transcription to a very high level in this system. HS2 also induces an active chromatin structure across the 6 Kb model locus, including nucleosome remodelling in discrete regions and locus wide histone modification, faithfully recapitulating the chromatin structure at the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). NF-E2, which binds to HS2, plays an essential role in the function of HS2. When NF-E2 binding sites are mutated, transcription of the linked globin gene is completely abolished and chromatin structure is not altered to an open configuration either in HS2 or at the linked gene. The complete inactivation resulting from inhibition of NF-E2 binding in HS2 has raised questions about which functions of HS2 are directly contributed by this activator and which functions might be contributed by other activators, such as GATA-1, whose interaction at HS2 might be precluded by loss of NF-E2. A study specifically mutating GATA-1 sites in HS2 could reveal the direct role of GATA-1 bound to this site.</p><p>To understand the role of GATA-1 interaction at the HS2 enhancer, we mutated the two GATA-1 motifs 3&#x02032; of the tandem NF-E2 motifs in HS2 on minichromosomes carrying a 6 Kb HS2/&#x003b5;-globin locus. NF-E2 interacted normally with HS2 under these conditions. We found that GATA-1 was required for full function of the HS2 enhancer. Direct roles attributable to GATA-1/HS2 interaction included recruitment of CBP and RNA pol II to HS2 and of pol II to the &#x003b5;-globin gene promoter. Hyperacetylation of H3 and di- and tri-methylation of H3 K4 in the &#x003b5;-globin coding region depended on binding of GATA-1 to HS2. In contrast to loss of NF-E2 binding within HS2, loss of GATA-1 binding did not affect DNase I HS formation at HS2 or at &#x003b5;-globin, even though gene transcription was severely compromised. The importance of NF-E2 to DNase I HS formation at the endogenous LCR in K562 cells was confirmed by reducing this factor using RNAi. These studies delineate different direct roles for NF-E2 and GATA-1 at HS2 in chromatin modification and transcription of human globin genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Minichromosome construction and cell culture</title><p>Minichromosomes containing HS2 and the &#x003b5;-globin gene have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).

The minichromosomes were transfected into K562 cells, and multiple individual clones were selected and grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and hygromycin as a selective marker. Minichromosome copy numbers were typically 10&#x02013;15 per cell in these clones.

Mutation of a canonical GATA-1 binding motif in core HS2 (374 bp) in the context of minichromosomes stably maintained in K562 cells decreased transcription of a linked embryonic &#x003b5;-globin gene to 20% of the level obtained with a wild type HS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). More recently, we have studied the mechanism by which the HS2 enhancer remodels chromatin and activates transcription in this model locus using a longer 1.46 Kb HS2 fragment containing the core and flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). A more extensive mutation including an imperfect GATA-1 motif near the canonical site was created within this longer HS2 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>We verified that mutation of the GATA-1 motifs resulted in loss of GATA-1 binding by performing ChIP assays using an antibody against GATA-1 in K562 cells carrying minichromosomes. The K562 cells were cross-linked using formaldehyde and chromatin was fragmented into mono and di-nucleosome size fragments by MNase digestion and sonication and reacted with antibodies. DNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitated chromatin and analysed by quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probes. The HS2 core region was strongly immunoprecipitated by GATA-1 antibodies in K562 cells carrying unmutated HS2 minichromosomes, but the immunoprecipitation was greatly reduced in cells carrying GATA-1 mutant minichromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the importance of GATA-1 interaction at HS2 to transcription of the linked &#x003b5;-globin gene, we measured transcripts using RT real-time PCR.

This modified locus provides a highly appropriate tool with which to analyse the direct role of GATA-1 interaction at HS2 in recruitment of co-activators and chromatin remodelling of a target globin gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Non-reciprocal influence of GATA-1 and NF-E2 HS2 interaction</title><p>When NF-E2 binding was inhibited at core HS2 in minichromosomes, the occupancy of histone acetyltransferase CBP at HS2 was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However it was not clear from these experiments whether NF-E2 directly recruited CBP, because the HS2 DNase I HS fails to form in the absence of NF-E2 binding and this might preclude interaction at HS2 of other activators such as GATA-1 that might play a direct role in the recruitment. To examine this possibility, we used ChIP assays and real-time qPCR to analyse GATA-1 occupancy at HS2 after mutation of the tandem NF-E2 sites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A shows that the robust detection of GATA-1 in HS2 is severely reduced when the NF-E2 sites are mutated. However, the reverse is not true. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B shows that mutation of the GATA motifs in HS2 has no effect on NF-E2 occupancy, consistent with results in G1E cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Thus, the effect of the loss of GATA-1 from HS2 can be independently assessed in this model system. These data also indicate that NF-E2 does not substantially interact with the embryonic &#x003b5;-globin promoter as it does with the adult &#x003b2;-globin gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Interaction of NF-E2 at HS2 in the absence of GATA-1 binding there.

We analysed CBP and pol II occupancy at HS2 using ChIP assays and real-time PCR when the GATA-1 motifs were mutated.

(<bold>D</bold>) DNase I sensitivity was determined at HS1, HS2 and HS4 of the endogenous LCR in wild and mutant NF-E2i K562 cells as described in B.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn368f4"/></fig></p><p>HS2 was similarly sensitive to DNase I in wild type and mutant templates similar to results with G1E cells in the absence of GATA-1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Surprisingly, and in contrast to earlier data obtained with a smaller HS2 enhancer on minichromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), the analysis showed that DNase I hypersensitivity at the &#x003b5;-globin promoter was not affected by loss of GATA-1 binding in HS2. In addition, other regions across the locus such as between HS2 and the linked gene and coding sequences were similarly sensitive in both loci. Thus, &#x003b5;-globin transcription but not promoter hypersensitivity depends on GATA-1 interaction in HS2. We conclude that in the minichromosomal context both the promoter and HS2 enhancer hypersensitive sites form independently of GATA-1 binding in HS2. Promoter hypersensitivity in the absence of GATA-1 binding in HS2 is consistent with the retention of some pol II occupancy at &#x003b5;-globin in the absence of GATA-1 interaction within HS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) and with maintenance of an open chromatin structure at the &#x003b2;<sup>maj</sup> promoter in LCR deleted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>As we have seen, NF-E2 occupancy at HS2 was unaffected by loss of GATA-1 binding there. We had previously observed an important role for NF-E2 within HS2 in remodelling of the linked &#x003b5;-globin gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). To validate this observation in the endogenous globin locus, we knocked down expression of NF-E2 in K562 cells using RNA interference. NF-E2 protein was strongly reduced in NF-E2 shRNA cells (53% of WT) and expression of &#x003b5;-globin RNA was reduced, while expression of a control shRNA had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and data not shown). Reduction of NF-E2 had a widespread influence on the DNase hypersensitive sites in the globin LCR reducing sensitivity to about 40% compared to that observed with the control RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). These data confirm the importance of NF-E2 for formation of the LCR HSs.</p></sec><sec><title>H3 acetylation and K4 methylation in the &#x003b5;-globin open reading frame are variably affected by GATA-1 interaction at HS2</title><p>Acetylation of histone H3 N-terminal tails is observed in active chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). On minichromosomes, the entire HS2-globin gene locus is marked by this modification and the acetylation is dependent on NF-E2 interaction at HS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). GATA-1 independent HS2 formation allowed us to define independently the direct role of GATA-1 in histone acetylation in the locus. Mono- and di-nucleosomes were reacted with antibodies and small amplicons were used in real-time qPCR, generating high resolution results at the nucleosome level. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, histones were markedly less acetylated in the &#x003b5;-globin gene coding region in the absence of GATA-1 association at HS2. However at HS2 and in the intervening region between HS2 and the gene there were no major alterations in H3 acetylation. We conclude that binding of GATA-1 at HS2 is required for histone acetylation of the &#x003b5;-globin gene. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>GATA-1 interaction at HS2 increases H3 acetylation in &#x003b5;-globin but variably affects H3 K4 methylation.

K4 can be modified at the levels of mono-, di- or tri-methylation.

To understand the role of GATA-1 in H3 K4 methylation we determined the levels of mono-, di- and tri-methylation using ChIP and real-time PCR in normal and GATA-1 mutant loci.</p><p>Mono-methylation at H3 K4 was widely observed in the minichromosome globin locus, and was more prominent in HS2 and the intervening region between HS2 and &#x003b5;-globin than in the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). This pattern across the locus was not affected by GATA-1 binding at core HS2. H3 K4 di-methylation decreased modestly in the &#x003b5;-globin coding region when GATA-1 was lost from HS2 and increased K4 di-methylation was detected between HS2 and &#x003b5;-globin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). In contrast, K4 tri-methylation was almost completely lost from the gene coding region in the HS2 GATA-1 mutant locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). The decreases of K4 di- and tri-methylation in &#x003b5;-globin coding sequences correspond to the loss of gene transcription in the absence of GATA-1 interaction at HS2. That mono-methylation of K4 across the locus is unaffected by loss of GATA-1 suggests that this modification is either targeted to the locus independent of GATA-1 or is the result of random, untargeted events.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study addressed the roles of erythroid activator GATA-1 mediated by direct interaction at the LCR HS2 enhancer in activating chromatin structure and transcription of the embryonic &#x003b5;-globin gene. Recruitment of a second erythroid activator NF-E2 to HS2 was independent of GATA-1 binding, but interaction of both factors was required for full enhancer function. Through use of a model HS2/&#x003b5;-globin locus we were able to distinguish distinct roles for these two activators in chromatin modification and gene activation.</p><sec><title>GATA-1 in histone modifications</title><p>In murine erythroid GATA-1 null cells, CBP recruitment and histone acetylation require the restoration of GATA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). We show that these properties of GATA-1 result directly from its binding in HS2 and not from an indirect effect on other activators. GATA-1 bound to HS2 might facilitate histone acetylation by interacting with CBP as observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However GATA-1 alone does not appear to be sufficient for recruiting CBP to LCR HSs, because in the endogenous human &#x003b2;-globin LCR GATA-1 is strongly detected in HS1, HS2 and HS4, but CBP is substantially detected only at HS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). NF-E2, which is specifically enriched specifically at HS2, is likely to be also required for optimal CBP recruitment at endogenous and minichromosomal HS2. The physical interaction of the NF-E2 p45 subunit with CBP <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> supports the idea that NF-E2 has a role in CBP recruitment to HS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Therefore both GATA-1 and NF-E2 appear to be required for full CBP recruitment to HS2.</p><p>We found that methylation of H3 K4 was variably related with GATA-1 interaction at HS2. K4 mono-methylation across the model locus was unaffected by loss of GATA-1 binding at HS2, indicating that this modification is not directly targeted by GATA-1. Mono-methylation might be a mark for potentially active chromatin since it is observed across the endogenous globin locus in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). K4 di-methylation, which is also a mark for active chromatin, was modestly affected by the GATA-1 binding. Interestingly, the intervening region between the enhancer and gene was marked by mono and di-methylation in the wild and mutated model loci. The presence of these marks might relate to intergenic transcription in this locus or be indicative of a poised state of the locus as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and these events might be GATA-1 independent. In contrast, tri-methylation of H3 K4 was lost within the &#x003b5;-globin coding region when GATA-1 binding in HS2 was lost. The strong GATA-1 dependence of tri-methylation at H3 K4 was also observed in GATA-1 null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). However it is difficult to conclude that GATA-1 plays a direct role in tri-methylation at H3 K4, because the human histone methyltransferase sub-unit Ash2L binds to HS2 independent of GATA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). We suggest that the loss of K4 tri-methylation relates to failure to recruit pol II to &#x003b5;-globin and loss of transcription since this modification is known to be linked to the transcriptional apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The role of GATA-1 at HS2 in these events may reflect its required role in LCR-gene looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Distinct roles of GATA-1 and NF-E2 in chromatin modification and Pol II recruitment</title><p>The present studies using quantitative methods indicate that DNase I hypersensitive sites form at HS2 and the &#x003b5;-globin promoter on minichromosomes without GATA-1 binding in HS2. Earlier work showed that these sites HS failed to form in the absence of NF-E2 binding in HS2 and our RNAi study indicates the widespread influence of NF-E2 loss on globin locus LCR HSs formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Over all, these results suggest that formation of HSs is strongly influenced by NF-E2 and not GATA-1 consistent with the ability of NF-E2 to remodel chromatin in the absence of a SWI/SNF remodelling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). That GATA-1 is dispensable for HS2 formation is consistent with high accessibility to restriction enzymes at HS2 in murine GATA-1 null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). However, GATA-1-independent HS formation at &#x003b5;-globin contrasts with the results using G1E cells and also with earlier work using a different globin minichromosome with a truncated HS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In addition, another series of studies using stable transfections indicated that both NF-E2 and GATA-1 contributed to HS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>). The reasons for these varying results are unclear. However, we note that residual pol II within &#x003b5;-globin after loss of the HS2 GATA-1 sites is consistent with an open chromatin structure there. Furthermore, in LCR-deleted mice the &#x003b2;-globin gene promoter remained a DNase sensitive structure, although it was transcribed at a very low level, similar to our findings here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>The importance of GATA-1 to pol II recruitment to the promoter of the &#x003b2;-major globin gene was observed in murine erythroid GATA-1 null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and the present studies suggest that this is the direct result of lack of GATA-1 at HS2. Despite an open chromatin structure and a normal TATA box, only a low level of pol II (and GATA-1) was detected at a linked &#x003b5;-globin when the HS2 GATA-1 sites were mutated. These studies using null cells and mutant minichromosomes support a role for GATA-1 in pol II recruitment to active globin genes. However another recent study performed in murine erythroid progenitor cells established from foetal liver reported that the binding of GATA-1 and NF-E2 was not sufficient for pol II recruitment and active chromatin hub formation with close contact between HS2 and &#x003b2;-globin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Nevertheless, the occupancy of HS2 by these activators is substantially increased by induction, with ensuing pol II recruitment and active chromatin hub formation in the erythroid cells.</p><p>In summary, our results show that inhibition of GATA-1 binding in HS2 mirrors in reverse the effects of restoration of GATA-1 function in G1E GATA-1 null erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) indicating that these effects are directly attributable to the HS2/GATA-1 interaction. Furthermore, it appears from the two kinds of studies that GATA-1 function with respect to the adult &#x003b2;-globin and embryonic &#x003b5;-globin gene is substantially similar. This is interesting in light of the known role of GATA-1 in looping between the LCR HSs and the &#x003b2;-globin gene and the proposal that the &#x003b5;-globin may instead be regulated by a tracking mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Cecelia Trainor for helpful comments and Pharmacogenomics Research Center, Inje University, Korea for use of the ABI Prism 7900.
