Prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is one of the main catabolic factors involved in OA. Its synthesis is the result of cyclooxygenase (COX) and prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) activities whereas NAD+-dependent 15 hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is the key enzyme implicated in the catabolism of PGE<sub>2</sub>. For both COX and PGES, three isoforms have been described: in cartilage, COX-1 and cytosolic PGES are constitutively expressed whereas COX-2 and microsomal PGES type 1 (mPGES-1) are inducible in an inflammatory context. COX-3 (a variant of COX-1) and mPGES-2 have been recently cloned but little is known about their expression and regulation in cartilage, as is also the case for 15-PGDH. We investigated the regulation of the genes encoding COX and PGES isoforms during mechanical stress applied to cartilage explants. Mouse cartilage explants were subjected to compression (0.5 Hz, 1 MPa) for 2 to 24 hours. After determination of the amount of PGE<sub>2 </sub>released in the media (enzyme immunoassay), mRNA and proteins were extracted directly from the cartilage explants and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting respectively. Mechanical compression of cartilage explants significantly increased PGE<sub>2 </sub>production in a time-dependent manner. This was not due to the synthesis of IL-1, since pretreatment with interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1-Ra) did not alter the PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis. Interestingly, COX-2 and mPGES-1 mRNA expression significantly increased after 2 hours, in parallel with protein expression, whereas COX-3 and mPGES-2 mRNA expression was not modified. Moreover, we observed a delayed overexpression of 15-PGDH just before the decline of PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis after 18 hours, suggesting that PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis could be altered by the induction of 15-PGDH expression. We conclude that, along with COX-2, dynamic compression induces mPGES-1 mRNA and protein expression in cartilage explants. Thus, the mechanosensitive mPGES-1 enzyme represents a potential therapeutic target in osteoarthritis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability among the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Traumatic joint injury and joint overload are two major causes of cartilage degradation leading to OA. Although the process of this disease is not yet fully understood, it results from an imbalance in the loss of cartilage caused by matrix degradation and the death of the unique cellular population of cartilage, the chondrocytes. Joints are physiologically exposed to mechanical stress, which triggers gene expression and metabolic activity of chondrocytes in order to turn over the extra cellular matrix and eventually adapt the tissue to loading. The magnitude of the forces that are physiologically applied to cartilage is up to 20 MPa, according to the type of articulation, movement and weight of the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Moreover, pressure that is applied on joints comprises a complex combination of strain, shear stress and compressive forces, the latter seemingly being more prevalent in cartilage. The duration of mechanical stress is less than 1 second and leads to cartilage deformation of only 1% to 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Many biochemical changes are associated with cartilage degradation and OA progression. These include an increased production of matrix metalloproteinases, proinflammatory cytokines, proinflammatory lipid mediators, extracellular nucleotides, reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrated oxygen species as nitric oxide (NO). It is noteworthy that abnormal cartilage loading may trigger the synthesis of all of these mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Notably, Fermor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] described that intermittent compression (0.5 Hz, 24 hours, 0.1 to 0.5 MPa) caused an increase in NO production and inducible NO synthase activity (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Different mechanoreceptors have been proven to be at the surface of chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but the integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 could be the major link between extracellular mobilization and intracellular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which eventually promote the synthesis of the various mediators described above. Recent studies have focused on the intracellular events that promote these syntheses under mechanical stress. Among them are the extracellular signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) and c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], known for their involvement in many biological events.</p><p>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is one of the major catabolic mediators involved in cartilage degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. OA cartilage spontaneously releases more PGE<sub>2 </sub>than normal cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and in knock-out mice for EP4, a membrane receptor for PGE2, a decreased incidence and severity of cartilage degradation in the collagen-induced arthritis model is observable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Several studies have examined the effects of physical forces on PGE<sub>2 </sub>release. On the one hand, cyclic tensile strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and dynamic compression applied on chondrocytes cultured in agarose for 48 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] inhibited the release of PGE<sub>2. </sub>On the other hand, fluid-induced shear stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] as intermittent mechanical compression for 1 hour increased PGE<sub>2 </sub>release in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. So, depending on the type, the magnitude and duration of mechanical stress, different molecular events, such as PGE<sub>2 </sub>release, are triggered in chondrocytes.</p><p>PGE<sub>2 </sub>is a prostanoid derived from arachidonic acid released from membranes by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. Arachidonic acid is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) activity to form the prostaglandin endeperoxyde H<sub>2</sub>. Three isoforms of COX (COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3) have been cloned. Whereas COX-1 is constitutively expressed in various cell types to maintain homeostasis, COX-2 is inducible in an inflammatory environment. COX-3 is a recently described derivative of COX-1 that occurs as the result of conservation of the first intron and is also called COX-1 V1. At this time, its expression is described in both canine and human cortex and aorta, and in the rodent heart, kidney and neuronal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Prostaglandin endeperoxyde H<sub>2 </sub>is subsequently metabolized by PGE synthase (PGES) to form PGE<sub>2</sub>. Three types of PGES have been cloned. The cytosolic form (cPGES) is ubiquitous and non-inducible, whereas the microsomal PGES type 1 (mPGES-1) is involved in PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis during inflammation. mPGES-1-deficient mice exhibit a significant reduction in disease severity and cartilage degradation in the collagen-induced arthritis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. mPGES-1 belongs to the MAPEG family (membrane associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathion metabolism) and is glutathion dependent. We and others have recently shown that IL-1&#x003b2; upregulates mPGES-1 expression in OA chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A third form of PGES, called microsomal PGES type 2 (mPGES-2), has recently been cloned. This glutathion-independent enzyme is expressed in various cells and seems to be poorly regulated by inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; however, its expression and regulation have not yet been elucidated in cartilage.</p><p>Our investigation sought to explore the activation of the arachidonic acid cascade. We hypothesized that mechanical compression in certain conditions would lead to PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis by chondrocytes. Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether genes encoding COX and PGES isoforms are mechanosensitive or not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All of the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Quentin Fallavier, France), unless stated otherwise.

Compression was applied either on costal cartilage or on articular catilage. For each experiment, all of the rib cages and all of the knees and the hips were harvested from 6-day-old newborns from one Swiss mouse litter according to the procedure described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>For costal cartilage, explants were cleaned in PBS to eliminate soft tissues and bone sternum parts were discarded. The costal cartilage was cut and divided into segments, which were pooled. Each sample consisted of 50 mg of costal cartilage explants. For articular cartilage, cartilage of two femoral heads and two knees constitute one sample.</p><p>Immediately after the dissection, each sample was placed into individual compression wells of Biopress culture plates (Flexercell International, Hillsborough, NC, USA) in 1.5 ml of culture medium (DMEM, containing penicillin-streptomycin 1% v/v, glutamin 2% v/v, albumin 0.1% v/v and Hepes 30 mM) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All of the experiments were performed at 37&#x000b0;C, in air. The compressive stress was applied to individual samples by the Biopress system (Flexercell International) described by Fermor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], whereas the control explants were kept in unloaded conditions. At each time point (2 h, 4 h, 18 h and 24 h), we analyzed compressed and uncompressed explants supplemented or not with effectors. Our results are expressed as fold-induction in comparison to controls. After the application of the mechanical regimen, supernatants and cartilage explants were collected and stored immediately at -20&#x000b0;C and -80&#x000b0;C, respectively.</p><p>Intermittent compression was applied using a sinusoidal waveform at 0.5 Hz (1 s on, 1 s off) for 30 minutes to 24 hours. Fermor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] have established a calibration graph for the Biopress system. This calibration establishes a linear relationship between air pressure and the corresponding compression force applied on a 5 mm diameter cartilage disk. This calibration was calculated on a cross-sectional area of the explant. In our model, the cartilage explants were disposed of in order to form a 5 mm disk, which was composed of several cartilage explants. We considered that the mechanical stress applied is less uniform, but still is 1.0 MPa for an air pressure of 30 kPa, according to the calibration from Fermor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>Immediately after compression, cartilage was first incubated with collagenase D solution (3 mg/ml) for 90 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, and then incubated with collagenase D (0.5 mg/ml) overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. The cell suspension obtained was mixed to disperse any cell aggregates, producing a suspension of isolated cells. Cells suspended in a culture medium were colored with Trypan blue (0.04%) and counted in a hemocytometer. This cell viability assay was carried out on one uncompressed and two compressed explants, at 4 hours and 24 hours, and on one explant immediately after the dissection, in two independent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>PGE<sub>2 </sub>and NO assays</title><p>Absolute concentrations of nitrite, a stable end-product of NO metabolism, were determined in the media of the cartilage explants using a spectrophotometric method based on the Griess assay (Griess Reagent System, Promega, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France).

Disruption was achieved through the beating and grinding effect of beads on the cartilage samples as they were shaken together in the grinding vessels. One steel ball (diameter 5 mm) was added to each sample and they were mixed, at a cool temperature, for two cycles of 2 minutes at 25 pulses/second. Then, after removing the beads, the total RNA was extracted from each sample using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A proteinase K (Qiagen) digestion step was performed after the lysis of cartilage explants and a DNAse digestion step (RNAse free DNAse set, Qiagen) was added. RNA concentration was then measured using a spectrophotometer. The migration in an agarose gel enabled quality control.</p><p>Total RNA (1 &#x003bc;g) was reverse transcribed with Omniscript (Qiagen) in a final volume of 20 &#x003bc;L containing 50 ng of oligos dT.

At a sinusoidal waveform frequency of 0.5 Hz and a magnitude of 1 MPa, NO release significantly increased (6-fold increase; p &#x0003c; 0.001) within 2 hours compared to uncompressed explants, and lasted 24 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), as described by Fermor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Also, PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis in the media significantly increased, with a peak at 2 hours that was sustained up to 4 hours (6-fold increase; p &#x0003c; 0.001) and then decreased at 24 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).</p><p>Compressive stress was also applied to mouse articular cartilage explants in order to avoid a bias due to the origin of cartilage. As in costal cartilage, articular cartilage explants submitted to compression exhibit an increase in PGE<sub>2 </sub>release after 2 hours (16-fold increase; p &#x0003c; 0.01), which was sustained from 4 hours to 18 hours (6-fold increase) before declining to control levels. Even though PGE<sub>2 </sub>release in articular cartilage (16-fold increase, p &#x0003c; 0.01) was stronger at 2 hours than in costal cartilage (6-fold increase, p &#x0003c; 0.001) and was sustained for longer, only minor differences in kinetics were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Viability of the chondrocytes in the mouse costal cartilage explants was tested using Blue Trypan coloration. No alteration of cell viability was seen between compressed and uncompressed samples within 24 hours (data not shown).</p><p>To confirm the validity of our compressive model on mouse costal cartilage, we wanted to highlight the implication of integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 in the PGE<sub>2 </sub>release triggered by mechanical stress. Cartilage explants treated with anti-integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 blocking antibody (AB1950) at 2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml induced a 50% decrease of compression-induced NO (4.16 &#x000b1; 0.57 versus 2.68 &#x000b1; 0.43 &#x003bc;M; data obtained from 2 independent experiments with <italic>n </italic>= 2/group/experiments; p &#x0003c; 0.001, data not shown). Moreover, a decrease in PGE<sub>2 </sub>release of approximately 50% in compressed cartilage treated with the blocking &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 antibody was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). No modification in NO (4.01 &#x000b1; 0.1 versus 4.4 &#x000b1; 1.43 &#x003bc;M; data obtained from 2 independent experiments with <italic>n </italic>= 2/group/experiments, data not shown) or PGE<sub>2 </sub>release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) was detected in media of compressed cartilage treated with the non-blocking anti-&#x003b2;1 subunit antibody at 2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml (VMA1997).</p><p>We previously reported that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 triggers the expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Since the integrin antibody did not fully inhibit a compression-induced PGE<sub>2 </sub>release, even if other mechanoreceptors have been described on chondrocytes, we hypothesized that compression could indirectly act on cartilage by inducing the synthesis of IL-1. When the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL1-Ra was added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml prior to compression, no variation in PGE<sub>2 </sub>release was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), suggesting that compression-induced PGE<sub>2 </sub>release is not mediated by IL-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of COX and PGES enzymes in uncompressed and compressed cartilage explants</title><p>We subsequently focused our study on the enzymes involved in PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis, cyclooxygenases and prostaglandin E synthases. Mouse costal cartilage explants subjected to compressive stress for 18 hours were fixed in ethanol, embedded in methyl methacrylate and cut into serial sections that were immunostained with antibody against COX-2, mPGES-1, mPGES-2 and cPGES. Toluidine blue counterstaining colors the extracellular matrix and nuclei of cells. In uncompressed cartilage, a few peripheral cells presented positive immunostaining (brown) for COX-2 and none did so for mPGES-1. After compression, an increased brown staining for COX-2 and mPGES-1 in cells was visible around the nuclei, suggesting a colocalization of these enzymes in the perinuclear region in loaded chondrocytes. For cPGES and mPGES-2, no differences appeared in chondrocytes from compressed cartilage explants compared to uncompressed explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>COX expression in cartilage explants subjected to compression</title><p>To study the effects of mechanical loading on COX gene expression, we used real-time RT-PCR quantitative analysis and immunoblotting to evaluate, respectively, the transcriptional and translational expression of COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3 genes. We extracted the total RNA and proteins directly from costal cartilage explants. An increased expression of COX-2 mRNA, but not COX-1, was observed after 2 hours with a maximal effect after 4 hours of compression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,b</xref>). Interestingly, COX-3 mRNA was expressed in cartilage but compressive stress had no effect on its transcriptional expression in cartilage explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>).</p><p>We then assessed COX protein levels by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies raised against COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3. As expected, compression induced COX-2 protein expression after 4 hours and peaked at 18 hours, whereas COX-1 expression remained unchanged. Both the COX-3 protein and its mRNA were expressed in cartilage; however, compression did not modify its expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PGES expression in cartilage explants under compression</title><p>Expression of mPGES-1 but not cPGES mRNA increased after 2 hours of compression with a peak at 4 hours. Similarly, the amount of mPGES-1 protein increased in compressed explants after 2 hours, peaking at 18 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a,b,d</xref>). The increased expression over the time of mPGES-1 protein in uncompressed samples, which was also observed for COX-2, could be triggered by mediators release during explantation and cutting of cartilage.</p><p>Interestingly, mPGES-2 was not regulated by compressive stress, both at the mRNA and protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c,d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The gene encoding 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase is mechanosensitive</title><p>Because our results highlighted a discrepancy between the kinetics of PGE<sub>2 </sub>release and COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> with Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), we hypothesized that the decrease in PGE<sub>2 </sub>production observed after 4 hours was due, at least in part, to the activation of a catabolic pathway of PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>NAD+-dependent 15 hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is considered to be the key enzyme in the catabolism of PGE<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, the gene encoding 15-PGDH is mechanosensitive and the kinetics of its expression is in agreement with our hypothesis since a peak of expression is observed at 4 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that dynamic mechanical loading of costal cartilage can significantly increase PGE<sub>2 </sub>release. Moreover, we describe here for the first time that COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression is increased in mouse costal cartilage explants under compression but not their constitutive isoforms COX-1 and cPGES. Therefore, it appears that COX-2 and mPGES-1 are encoded by mechanosensitive genes implicated in the compression-induced PGE<sub>2 </sub>release. PGE<sub>2 </sub>is the pivotal eicosanoid involved in the initiation and the development of inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Notably, it is thought to be a key regulator of cartilage degradation during OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. An increase in PGE<sub>2 </sub>release induced by mechanical stress has already been described in various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and particularly in articular cartilage subjected to dynamic compression representative of the physiological range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of COX-2 mRNA expression in cartilage by mechanical stress has already been reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Notably, elements including AP-1 sites, cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) and shear stress response elements (SSRE) are found in the promoter region of mechanical stress-response genes, such as those encoding COX-2 and inducible NO synthase. Shear stress response elements contain a TPA response element to which NF&#x003ba;B, which is part of a main mechanical pathway, binds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Ogasawara and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] have described the role of C/EBP beta, AP-1 sites and CREB in shear stress-induced COX-2 expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, post-transcriptional regulation by mRNA stabilization seems to be involved in COX-2 gene expression in vascular endothelial cells subjected to fluid shear stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition to these studies at the mRNA level, we show here, for the first time in cartilage, that COX-2 is also increased at the protein level.</p><p>Interestingly, our data indicate that COX-3, also named COX-1 V1, is expressed in mouse costal cartilage. COX-3, which was cloned in 2002, was derived from COX-1 through retention of intron 1 in its mRNA. This probably resulted in the modification of the active site conformation of the enzyme. COX-3 expression has actually been found in several canine, human and rodent tissues, but never in cartilage, whatever the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this present study, we report for the first time the expression of COX-3 (mRNA and protein) in mouse cartilage. Moreover, we show that mechanical loading did not modify its expression. As COX-1 and COX-3 are derived from the same gene, these enzymes share the same promoter. However, no sites that are regulated through mechanical stress or pro-inflammatory cytokines have been found so far in the COX-1 promoter, which is consistent with the fact that COX-1 is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed. Thus, this might explain the lack of COX-3 regulation by compression.</p><p>The regulation of mPGES-2 expression has never been described in cartilage. mPGES-2 is ubiquitously expressed under basal conditions in many tissues and is activated by reducing agents, but its role in PGE<sub>2 </sub>release in both basal and inflammatory contexts remains unclear. In human rheumatoid synoviocytes, expression of mPGES-1 increased with severity of the disease, whereas that of mPGES-2 did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In COX-2-deficient mouse brains, a decreased release of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and a decreased expression of mPGES-2, but not of mPGES-1 or cPGES, was observed, suggesting that mPGES-2 could be functionally coupled to COX-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In the present study, mPGES-2 expression was similar in compressed and uncompressed cartilage explants, suggesting that mPGES-2 is not encoded by a mechanosensitive gene.</p><p>The striking point of our study is the evidence that mPGES-1 is encoded by a mechanosensitive gene. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that inflammation induces mPGES-1. In rat paws of the acute and chronic arthritis model, up-regulation of mPGES-1 mRNA and protein expression was observed. Moreover, levels of mPGES-1 mRNA and protein were markedly elevated in OA versus normal cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Additionally, we and others have previously reported an overexpression of mPGES-1 in OA chondrocytes in primary cultures stimulated by IL-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, our results identify an earlier significant transcriptional expression (as soon as 2 hours) after mechanical stress compared to the effect of IL-1 (after 12 hours). Moreover, its induction was higher with compression (five-fold) compared to IL-1 stimulation (three-fold). A structural comparison of COX-2 and mPGES-1 promoters revealed that the gene encoding mPGES-1 does not contain transcriptional elements that are classically involved in response to mechanical stress (AP-1, CRE, SSRE), as described for the COX-2 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It suggests that divergent transcriptional mechanisms are responsible for inducible mPGES-1 regulation. Yokota and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] have described the role of the nuclear regulator CITED2 (CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail 2) in shear-induced down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 1 and matrix metalloproteinase 13. This mechanism could also occur in compression-induced mPGES-1 expression. But post-transcriptional regulation could also be present since a stabilization of mPGES-1 mRNA has been recently described in cardiomyocytes, leading to delayed protein expression via cJNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that loading triggers mPGES-1 and COX-2 colocalization in the perinuclear region of the chondrocytes. This result is in line with the study from Kojima and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] that recently described COX-2 and mPGES-1 colocalization around the nuclei of chondrocytes after IL-1 stimulation.</p><p>Selective inhibitors of mPGES-1 have been developed recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Effectively, targeting the mPGES-1 enzyme in preference to COX-2 should represent a new therapeutical approach to treating joint diseases such as OA. Interestingly, Cheng and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] reported that mPGES-1-null mice exhibit no alteration in thrombogenesis or blood pressure, whereas selective COX-2 inhibitors (Coxib) did. These results suggest that inhibitors of mPGES-1 may retain their anti-inflammatory efficacy by depressing PGE<sub>2</sub>, while avoiding the adverse cardiovascular consequences associated with COX-2 deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>To understand the weak PGE<sub>2 </sub>release at 18 and 24 hours after compression, we focused on 15-PGDH mRNA expression because 15-PGDH is one of the major PGE<sub>2</sub>-inactivating enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. 15-PGDH expression decreases in response to IL-1&#x003b2; treatment in trophoblast cells in primary culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] as well as in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in liver and lungs of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Moreover, 15-PGDH expression is reduced in inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To our knowledge, 15-PGDH expression in cartilage has never been reported and its expression under mechanical stress was unknown. The findings presented in this study first indicate that 15-PGDH is expressed in mouse cartilage and is induced after 4 hours of compression (three-fold induction). Genomic structural analysis revealed that the human 15-PGDH promoter contains binding sites for AP-1 and CREB, two transcriptional factors implicated in the regulation of gene expression subjected to mechanical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. We suggest that the 15-PGDH enzyme could be implicated in the catabolism of PGE<sub>2 </sub>after 18 hours. So, proinflammatory stimuli (LPS or cytokines) induce monophasic PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis whereas mechanical stress triggers a biphasic response in cartilage, PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis followed by PGE<sub>2 </sub>degradation. We hypothesize that this response corresponds to an adaptation of the tissue to this stress.</p><p>The choice of an experimental model to study the physiological regulation of cartilage homeostasis by mechanical stress is challenging. Three types of mechanical stress have been described: shear stress, strain and compressive stress. Overloading of the joints, a major risk factor for OA, mainly induces compressive stress. However, shear stress and strain have also been described when overloading is experimentally applied on cartilage. The compression of chondrocytes embedded in agarose or collagen gels as well as the compression of <italic>ex vivo </italic>porcine cartilage explants represent the main strategies developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Among the literature, it appears obvious that the consequences to metabolism of chondrocytes vary according to the type of stress applied. Takahashi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] reported that static compression promotes type II collagen, whereas cyclic loading could denature type II collagen in articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Here, we used mouse cartilage explants subjected to cyclical uniaxial mechanical stress. Mouse cartilage was chosen because of the availability of a large choice of biomolecular tools suitable to study it, such as genetically modified mice. However, many labs work on discs of porcine or bovine cartilage, permitting a more homogeneous compressive stress. In our model, the compressive stress is less uniform because of the size of the explants. Enhancements to our system, in order to better define the stress applied, is ongoing.</p><p>We decided to work on costal cartilage rather than articular cartilage because of the extremely small quantity of the latter available. However, we performed comparative experiments in order to validate our model with costal cartilage explants. We observed an induction of PGE<sub>2 </sub>release in both types of cartilage, but with slight differences in kinetics.</p><p>The mechanoreceptor integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 is considered by many authors to be the critical mechanoreceptor for transducing signal from the extracellular matrix to the chondrocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our data confirm the major role of this receptor in compression-induced PGE<sub>2 </sub>release.</p><p>Among the mechanotransduction pathways recently described, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) plays a major role. In smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, mechanical strain increases the activity of all three MAPKs, namely p38 MAPK, ERK 1/2 and Junk kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In particular, <italic>ex vivo </italic>cartilage compression has been reported to activate the three MAPKs, but with different kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Preliminary results suggest that this is also the case in our model (personal communication).</p><p>Surprisingly, overexpression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 proteins was observed at 18 hours in uncompressed samples. Several authors have described the release of mediators, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and IL-1&#x003b1;, in cartilage after explantation and cutting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Moreover, Fermor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reported that uncompressed explants of articular cartilage exhibited a significant production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>(from 14 pg/mg/ml at 24 hours after explantation to 1 pg/mg/ml at 72 hours). We have considered that dissection alone induces COX-2 and mPGES-1 protein expression in the uncompressed samples.</p><p>As mature articular cartilage is an avascular tissue, the oxygen supply to resident chondrocytes could rather limit and influence chondrocyte activation under a mechanical signal. Fermor and colleagues have shown that oxygen tension influences the endogenous production of NO and PGE<sub>2 </sub>in porcine cartilage explants in response to mechanical stimulation. Under mechanical compression, PGE<sub>2 </sub>production in cartilage at 20% O<sub>2 </sub>increased 50-fold, but in cartilage at 5% O<sub>2 </sub>it increased only 4-fold and in cartilage at 1% O<sub>2 </sub>it did not increase at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Since previous studies have suggested that the oxygen tension in the superficial layer of articular cartilage is higher than in the deeper layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], our results could have occurred, at least in part, in the superficial zone of articular cartilage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that COX-2 and mPGES-1 are mechanosensitive enzymes after dynamic compression. Moreover, the key enzyme implicated in the catabolism of PGE<sub>2</sub>, 15-PGDH, is expressed in cartilage and its expression is regulated by compression. As mPGES-1 is currently described as a potential therapeutic target for controlling PGE<sub>2 </sub>release in OA, further research into the regulation of this mechanosensitive gene should be helpful for a better understanding of the key pathways implicated in its expression in order to counteract cartilage degradation in overloading joints.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>15-PGDH = NAD+-dependent 15 hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase; BSA = bovine serum albumin; C/EBP = CAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP); COX = cyclooxygenase; cPGES = cytosolic PGES; CRE = cyclic AMP response element; CREB = cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; ERK = extracellular signal regulated kinases; FGF = fibroblast growth factor; HPRT = hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; IL = interleukin; IL1-Ra = inteleukin 1 receptor antagonist; JNK = c-jun-N-terminal kinase; LPS = lipopolysaccharides; MAPK = mitogen-associated protein kinase; mPGES = microsomal PGES; NFkB = nuclear factor kappa-B; NO = nitric oxide; OA = osteoarthritis; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline;; PGE<sup>2</sup> = prostaglandin E2; PGES = prostaglandin E synthase; RT-PCR = reverse transcription PCR; SEM = standard error of the mean; SSRE = shear stress response element.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MG performed animal surgery, compression experiments, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and NO assays, PCR experiments, western blotting experiments and immunohistochemistry experiments, analyzed the results and drafted the manuscript.
