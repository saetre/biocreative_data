Although each of these pathogenic defects could be accounted for by specific mechanisms, impaired ATP production as a consequence of reduced oxidative phosphorylation might provide an intriguing common pathogenic pathway for all these defects. The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (protein PGC-1&#x003b1;; gene <italic>PPARGC1A</italic>) is an important factor regulating the expression of genes for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in target tissues through coactivation of nuclear receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. We have previously shown that the expression of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> and a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation is reduced in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, a common polymorphism, Gly482Ser, in the <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> gene has been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and an age-related reduction in muscle <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, genetic variation in the <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> gene was associated with indices of beta cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the central role of ATP for insulin secretion, the function of PGC-1&#x003b1; in human pancreatic islets and beta cells is less well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Obesity, reduced physical activity and ageing are well known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. However, all individuals exposed to an affluent environment do not develop the disease. One likely reason is that genetic variation modifies individual susceptibility to the environment. However, the environment could also modify genetic risk factors by influencing expression of a gene by DNA methylation or histone modifications. Cytosine residues occurring in CG dinucleotides are targets for DNA methylation and gene expression is usually reduced when DNA methylation takes place at a promoter. Whether DNA methylation influences gene expression in target tissues for type 2 diabetes and thereby the pathogenesis of the disease remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>The present study investigated: (1) whether expression of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> is altered in human islets from patients with type 2 diabetes; (2) if this expression is influenced by genetic (the <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> Gly482Ser polymorphism) and epigenetic (DNA methylation) factors; and (3) if expression of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> influences insulin secretion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Multi-organ donors</bold> The characteristics of the 48 non-diabetic and 12 type 2 diabetic multi-organ donors, whose pancreases were processed for islet preparation, are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Media (500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l aliquots from the 10&#x000a0;ml incubation volume) were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until insulin concentrations were measured by immunoradiometric assay (Pantec Forniture Biomediche, Turin, Italy).</p><p><bold>Animals</bold> Streptozotocin (STZ)&#x02013;nicotinamide (NA)-treated male Wistar rats (2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months old) were administered 210&#x000a0;mg/kg NA i.p. (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in saline, 15&#x000a0;min before an i.v. injection of 60&#x000a0;mg/kg STZ (Sigma) that had been dissolved in citrate buffer (pH&#x000a0;4.5) immediately before use. Control rats were injected with vehicle alone. STZ&#x02013;NA-treated animals had stable hyperglycaemia (8.9&#x02013;10.0&#x000a0;mmol/l) and they were used for the experiments 5&#x000a0;weeks after diabetes was induced. Pancreatic islets were isolated by the collagenase method using the procedure of pancreatic duct cannulation and density gradient purification as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>GK rats were obtained from the Stockholm colony and bred as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Inbred, normoglycaemic F344 rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA) and maintained by sister&#x02013;brother mating. Transfer of GK alleles onto the genome of F344 rats by repeated backcrossing (ten generations) established the homozygous congenic strains F344.GK-<italic>Niddm1f</italic> (NIDDM1F) and F344.GK-<italic>Niddm1i</italic> (NIDDM1I). NIDDM1F carries 0.5% of the GK genotype (8&#x000a0;cM), based on genetic distance, on a homozygous F344 genetic background. NIDDM1F rats display hyperglycaemia accompanied by fasting hyperinsulinaemia and increased epididymal fat, implicating insulin resistance. NIDDM1I carries 0.8% of the GK genotype (14&#x000a0;cM), and display hyperglycaemia and insulin secretion defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Backcrossing was designed to introduce mitochondrial DNA and chromosomes X plus Y from F344. The congenic strains were kept constant by sister&#x02013;brother mating for several generations. To avoid effects of the oestrous cycle and other sex-specific influences, only male rats were included in this study. Rats were maintained at constant temperature and humidity in a 12&#x000a0;h light&#x02013;dark cycle with free access to standard laboratory chow pellets and water. All experiments were approved by the local Ethics Committees. Isolated pancreatic islets were prepared from rats at 8&#x000a0;weeks of age after a 6&#x000a0;h fast (08:00&#x02013;14:00 hours), by injection of a collagenase solution via the bile&#x02013;pancreatic duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p><bold>Analysis of PPARGC1A mRNA expression in pancreatic islets</bold> Total RNA was extracted from human islets, after 3&#x000a0;days in culture, using the RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).

Human and rat <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> mRNA expression were quantified by RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Gene-specific probes and primer pairs for <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> (Assays-on-demands, human, Hs00173304_m1 and rat, Rn00580241_A1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were used. Each sample was run in duplicate and the transcript quantity was normalised to the mRNA level of cyclophilin A (human, 4326316E and rat Rn00574762_A1; Applied Biosystems). For each probe/primer set, a standard curve was generated, which was confirmed to increase linearly with increasing amounts of cDNA.</p><p><bold>Downregulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; in human islets using silencing RNA (siRNA)</bold> In order to test whether inhibition of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression could directly modulate insulin release, isolated human islets were transfected with <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> siRNA by using Arrest-In Transfection (Open Biosystem; Celbio, Pero, Italy). This is a polymeric formulation developed and optimised for highly efficient delivery of siRNA into the nucleus of suspension cells in the presence of serum-containing medium. Pre-designed Silencer siRNAs and Silencer non-targeting siRNAs (negative control) for <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) were used. Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Briefly, islets obtained from five pancreases were washed 12 times in KRB and exposed for 10&#x000a0;min to free Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-KRB to allow cell disaggregation. At the end of the incubation period, 400 islets per study point were re-suspended in 800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l M199 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) added with adult bovine serum. siRNA (80&#x000a0;nmol/l) was diluted in 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l M199, while 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Arrest-In solution (Celbio) was dissolved in 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l M199 and incubated for 10&#x000a0;min after rapid mixing to allow formation of transfection complexes. Finally, 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of this solution were added into wells containing islets and incubation was allowed for 48&#x000a0;h in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C. At the end of the incubation period well volume was doubled with M199 culture medium and samples were kept in the incubator for another 48&#x000a0;h, when islets function, viability, transfection efficiency (60% when measured by Polyfectamine tied to a fluorescent probe) and gene expression were evaluated.</p><p><bold>Genotyping</bold> Genomic DNA was extracted from pancreatic islets using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

A <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> sequence 986&#x02013;746 bases upstream from the translation start including four possible DNA-methylation sites and a putative hepatic nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) binding site, was selected and analysed for DNA methylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Genomic DNA, isolated from pancreatic islets of nine non-diabetic and ten type 2 diabetic multi-organ donors, was treated with bisulphite using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA). Bisulphite-modified DNA was amplified by nested PCR with primers designed using MethPrimer.

Notably, no significant change was seen in glucagon mRNA expression, suggesting that the effect was primarily due to a downregulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; in beta cells.

Moreover, we demonstrate that epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be operative in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes since DNA methylation of the <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> promoter was increased in human diabetic islets. Experimental downregulation of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression in human islets by siRNA resulted in decreased insulin secretion thereby demonstrating a causal link between PGC-1&#x003b1; levels and insulin secretion. Based on these observations we propose a model where combinations of genetic and epigenetic factors can influence the level of PGC-1&#x003b1; in human islets and subsequently glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.</p><p>The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1&#x003b1; is an important factor regulating the expression of genes for oxidative phosphorylation in a number of tissues including skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue. We and others have previously demonstrated reduced expression of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> and a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the level and role of PGC-1&#x003b1; in pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 diabetes remained to be determined. The present results indicate that the situation in human islets mirrors the situation in skeletal muscle, since the expression level of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> was reduced in human type 2 diabetic islets, thus providing evidence for a common defect that may simultaneously contribute to peripheral insulin resistance and impairment of beta cell function.</p><p>In contrast to the present results in humans, elevated PGC-1&#x003b1; levels have been reported in islets from diabetic rodent models, <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, ZDF rats and pancreatectomised rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In these rodent models, the increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; was associated with suppressed beta cell metabolism and insulin release. This could reflect true species differences, but also differences in experimental conditions. To address this issue, we determined: (1) the effect of inhibiting PGC-1&#x003b1; production by transfecting human pancreatic islets with <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> siRNA; and (2) <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression in pancreatic islets of different rodent models with experimental diabetes, i.e. STZ-diabetic Wistar rats and congenic strains from the type 2 diabetes-like GK rat. Silencing PGC-1&#x003b1; production was associated with concomitant reduction of insulin mRNA expression and insulin release in response to glucose. This effect appears to be highly specific for insulin regulation as it had no effect whatsoever on glucagon mRNA expression. The congenic strains have been bred from the GK rat based upon low insulin secretion or insulin resistance. In line with the results observed in human islets, <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression was reduced in islets from diabetic animals and in rat strains with suppressed insulin secretion. Collectively, these data support the notion that <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression is reduced in animal models of diabetes and human diabetes, and associated with impaired insulin secretion.</p><p>The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with high-fat/high-energy diets, reduced physical activity and age. However, not all individuals respond to the environment in the same way. This variation in response to environmental factors has partially been ascribed to genetic factors. The common Gly482Ser variant in the <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> gene is a plausible candidate for such a genetic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We have previously shown that this polymorphism is associated with an age-related decline in <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> gene expression in human skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The present study shows that the same <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> risk allele, 482Ser, is associated with reduced <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression and impaired insulin secretion in human islets. Thus, our results provide the ground for a common genetic predisposition towards type 2 diabetes contributing to both impaired insulin action and secretion.</p><p>Reduced <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression may not simply reflect an effect of the polymorphism per se but could also occur through epigenetic phenomena such as increased DNA methylation of the <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> promoter. Cytosine residues occurring in CG dinucleotides are targets for DNA methylation, and gene expression is usually reduced when DNA methylation takes place at a promoter. Epigenetic changes are well known to influence gene expression of suppressor genes and oncogenes in cancer cells and contribute to tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Increased DNA methylation of the promoter of the <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> gene in type 2 diabetic human islets may contribute to beta cell dysfunction by similar mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that DNA methylation may play a role in regulating gene expression in human diabetic islets.</p><p>Our data suggest that PGC-1&#x003b1; can modulate glucose-mediated insulin secretion in human islets, most likely via an effect on ATP production as indicated by normal insulin release in response to arginine and glibenclamide, which stimulate insulin downstream of ATP. In support of such a role, <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> mRNA expression correlated with glucose-stimulated insulin release. Moreover, inhibition of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression by siRNA transfection in human islets was associated with a decline in insulin mRNA and insulin release. Similarly, in human type 2 diabetic islets, reduced <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> mRNA levels were associated with impaired glucose-mediated insulin secretion. The <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> Gly482Ser polymorphism, which previously has been associated with type 2 diabetes, was also associated with reduced <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression and impaired insulin secretion in the human islets.</p><p>One caveat of this study could be that we did not measure the protein level of PGC-1&#x003b1; in human islets. However, we have previously demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> mRNA and PGC-1&#x003b1; protein levels in human skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and we therefore assume that this might also be the case in human islets. The reduction in <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression in non-diabetic carriers of a 482Ser allele was strong and factors other than haploinsufficiency may therefore explain this reduction. Moreover, whether the genotype influences <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression in diabetic islets would be of interest; however, the present study lacks statistical power to perform this analysis. These relationships should be addressed in future ad hoc studies.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> mRNA expression is reduced in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes and it is influenced by both genetic (Gly482Ser) and epigenetic (DNA methylation) factors. This reduction in <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> expression correlated with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which is known to require ATP. Thereby, the present study provides two novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of islet dysfunction in type 2 diabetes; first that a master transcription regulator of oxidative phosphorylation, PGC-1&#x003b1;, may be involved and second, that epigenetic factors like DNA methylation should be considered when searching for the genetic causes of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This investigation was supported by Linne Grant B31 5631/2006 and Grant 522-2006-6480 from the Swedish Research Council.
