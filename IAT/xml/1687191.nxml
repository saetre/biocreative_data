The expression of TRP53 is central to the regulation of the cell's capacity to proliferate and survive. In this study we found that Trp53 mRNA is expressed throughout the preimplantation stage of development. Levels of TRP53 protein expression were low during the cleavage stages and increased at the morula and blastocyst stages in B6 embryos collected from the reproductive tract. Embryos collected at the zygote stage and cultured for 96 h also showed low levels of TRP53 expression at precompaction stages. There were higher levels of TRP53 in cultured morula and the level in cultured blastocysts was clearly increased above blastocysts collected directly from the uterus. Immunolocalization of TRP53 showed that its increased expression in cultured blastocysts corresponded with a marked accumulation of TRP53 within the nuclei of embryonic cells. This pattern of expression was enhanced in embryos produced by in vitro fertilization and subjected to culture. The TRP53 was transcriptionally active since culture also induced increased expression of Bax, yet this did not occur in embryos lacking Trp53 (Trp53-/-). The rate of development of Trp53-/- zygotes to the blastocyst stage was not different to wildtype controls when embryos were cultured in groups of ten but was significantly faster when cultured individually. The results show that zygote culture resulted in the accumulation of transcription activity of TRP53 in the resulting blastocysts. This accounts for the adverse effects of culture of embryos individually, but does not appear to be the sole cause of the retarded preimplantation stage growth phenotype associated with culture in vitro.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Assisted reproductive technologies (ART; which includes techniques such as <italic>in vitro </italic>fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), embryo cryopreservation and embryo donation) are now central to the treatment of infertility in humans. These techniques are successful treatments, yet an individual embryo produced by these methods has less than a 50% chance of forming a viable neonate. Much of the loss of embryo viability occurs in the pre- and peri-implantation phases.</p><p>The use of animal models, particularly the mouse, has been important for the development of embryo culture procedures. In the mouse it is well known that embryo manipulation and culture results in a characteristic phenotype of slow embryo development <italic>in vitro</italic>. After several days in culture embryos have typically fewer cells and more cells within embryos undergoing death, than corresponding stage embryos collected from the reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This phenotype of impaired development is particularly severe in a range of inbred lines, such as B6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Such lines provide an attractive model for identifying the possible causative mechanisms.</p><p>A number of cellular stressors induced by the culture environment have been identified, and include growth and survival factor deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], metabolic and substrate imbalances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In somatic cells all these stresses are capable of activating the TRP53 stress response pathway. Increased TRP53 expression is a response to a wide range of genotoxic and non-genotoxic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. TRP53 is a transcription factor that has many functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] including a reduction in the rate of cycle-cell progression (for example, by the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup>) or induction of cell death (by the synthesis of pro-death mediators, such as Bax).</p><p>Mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and human embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] express <italic>Trp53 </italic>mRNA. In human embryos produced by IVF its expression was higher in embryos with poor morphology following culture, as assessed by the degree of cytoplasmic fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. There is much anecdotal evidence that transgenic over-expression of <italic>Trp53 </italic>is incompatible with early mouse embryo development. Furthermore, increased TRP53 activity (due to the deletion of <italic>Mdm2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) also results in early mouse embryonic lethality.

All animals were housed and bred in the Gore Hill Research Laboratory, St Leonards, NSW, Australia. All animals were under 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle and had access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Four to eight week old females were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 10 IU equine chorionic gonadotrophin (Folligon, Intervet International, Boxmeer, The Netherlands) followed 48 h later by 10 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG, Chorulon, Intervet). Females were paired with males of proven fertility. Pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of a copulation plug the following morning (day 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse embryo collection and culture</title><p>In most experiments cumulus masses or embryos were flushed from the reproductive tract with HEPES-buffered modified human tubal fluid medium and cultured in modified human tubal fluid medium (mod-HTF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. All components of the media were tissue culture grade (Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis, MO) and contained 3 mg bovine serum albumin/mL unless otherwise stated (CSL Ltd., Melbourne, Vic., Australia). Fertilization <italic>in vitro </italic>(IVF) was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Briefly, epididymides from males of proven fertility were punctured and the sperm squeezed into medium and allowed to disperse in mod-HTF media for 40 minutes. Motile sperm (0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) was added to groups of oocytes within their cumulus masses. Fertilization rate was assessed at 5&#x02013;6 h and all fertilized oocytes transferred to mod-HTF media. Fresh zygotes were collected 20&#x02013;21 h after hCG and freed from their cumulus cells by brief exposure to 300 IU hyaluronidase (Sigma) in HEPES-buffered mod-HTF. Embryos were recovered in minimal volume and assigned to various treatments as required in mod-HTF. Embryos were cultured in 10 &#x003bc;L volumes in 60-well HLA plates (LUX 5260, Nunc, Naperville, IL) overlaid by approximately 2 mm of heavy paraffin oil (Sigma). Embryos were cultured individually or in groups of 10. Culture was at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for the periods indicated in individual experiments. The developmental stage and morphology of embryos was assessed by visualizing the embryos with an inverted phase contrasted microscope (Nikon Diaphot, Japan) at 24 h interval after zygote collection. Fresh blastocysts were collected by flushing each uterine horn with 1 mL of HEPES buffered mod-HTF.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>Two cell lines were used as positive control material.

Proteins were blotted into PVDF membranes (Hybond-P, GE Healthcare) in a semi-dry blotting apparatus overnight using transfer buffer (12 mM Tris PH 7.0, 96 mM Glycine and 20% (v/v) methanol). Nonspecific binding was blocked by 5% (w/v) skim milk in PBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were probed with primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in 5% skim milk in PBST. A horseradish peroxidase conjugated second antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature.

Embryos produced <italic>Trp53 </italic>mRNA throughout the preimplantation stage, confirming findings in other strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TRP53 protein was also expressed at relatively low levels during the normal preimplantation phase development. This low level of expression is consistent with the finding that TRP53 is not required for normal development of the embryo <italic>in vivo</italic>, since <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos are viable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In blastocysts collected directly from the reproductive tract there is little obvious accumulation of TRP53 within nuclei and little expression of Bax, a TRP53 transcription product. These observations suggest a latency of expression and action of TRP53 in the embryo within the reproductive tract. Such latency is to be expected within normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. By contrast, the culture of embryos from the zygote stage or their production by IVF (and subsequent culture) resulted in a marked increase in the expression of TRP53 in the post compaction embryos. This increased expression was accompanied by pronounced nuclear accumulation of TRP53. Culture also resulted in increased expression of Bax, and this was <italic>TRP53</italic>-dependent. Thus, TRP53 expression and nuclear localization in culture embryos was transcriptionally active. This result does not of itself show that Bax is a major effector of TRP53 expression in the cultured early embryo. However, the resistance of <italic>Bax</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse blastocysts (and partial resistance of <italic>Bax</italic><sup>+/- </sup>blastocysts) to apoptosis induced by the presence of high glucose concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], may suggest that it plays some role. TRP53 induces the expression of many genes and an important research question for the future will be to characterise the TRP53-induced transcriptome in the cultured early embryo in preimplantation stage viability.</p><p>Embryos that have <italic>Mdm2 </italic>activity deleted (<italic>Mdm2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] show early lethality, and this was abrogated in the <italic>Mdm2</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Trp53</italic><sup>-/- </sup>compound mutant. MDM2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that leads to ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome of its targets, the most important of which is TRP53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The action of MDM2 is largely responsible for the short half-life of TRP53 in cells not subjected to stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is this degradation that accounts for the latency of TRP53 expression in most unstressed cells. MDM2 expression is in turn regulated by TRP53; the MDM2 promoter contains TRP53 consensus binding sites. Thus, MDM2 and TRP53 are recognised to form an autoregulatory feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>This study showed that the use of embryo's from mouse strains (such as the B6) that are susceptible to the various stresses of culture provide a useful model for the investigation of the cellular mechanisms of embryos response to culture. The use of this strain has the additional advantage that many gene knockout models are produced in the B6 background. The combined use of genetically modified animal models, experimental ART and modern cell biology provide the opportunity to ask fundamental questions about the embryos response to its culture environment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Australian Health and Medical Research Council.
