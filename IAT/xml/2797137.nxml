Gene activation can induce chromatin looping from chromosome territories (CTs) and is thought to require de novo association with transcription factories. We identify two types of factory: &#x0201c;poised transcription factories,&#x0201d; containing RNA polymerase II phosphorylated on Ser5, but not Ser2, residues, which differ from &#x0201c;active factories&#x0201d; associated with phosphorylation on both residues. Using the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene as a model system, we find that this inducible gene is predominantly associated with poised (S5p<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>S2p<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) factories prior to activation and localized at the CT interior. Shortly after induction, the uPA locus is found associated with active (S5p<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>S2p<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) factories and loops out from its CT. However, the levels of gene association with poised or active transcription factories, before and after activation, are independent of locus positioning relative to its CT. RNA-FISH analyses show that, after activation, the uPA gene is transcribed with the same frequency at each CT position. Unexpectedly, prior to activation, the uPA loci internal to the CT are seldom transcriptionally active, while the smaller number of uPA loci found outside their CT are transcribed as frequently as after induction. The association of inducible genes with poised transcription factories prior to activation is likely to contribute to the rapid and robust induction of gene expression in response to external stimuli, whereas gene positioning at the CT interior may be important to reinforce silencing mechanisms prior to induction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The spatial organization of the genome inside the cell nucleus is important in regulating gene expression and in the response to external stimuli. Examples of changing spatial organization are the repositioning of genes outside chromosome territories during the induction of gene expression, and the gathering of active genes at transcription factories (discrete foci enriched in active RNA polymerase). Recent genome-wide mapping of RNA polymerase II has identified its presence at many genes poised for activation, raising the possibility that such genes might associate with poised transcription factories. Using an inducible mammalian gene, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and a system in which this gene is poised for expression, we show that uPA associates with poised transcription factories prior to activation. Gene activation induces two independent events: repositioning towards the exterior of its chromosome territory and association with active transcription factories. Surprisingly, genes inside the interior of the chromosome territory prior to activation are less likely to be actively transcribed, suggesting that positioning at the territory interior has a role in gene silencing.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The spatial folding of chromatin within the mammalian cell nucleus, from the level of whole chromosomes down to single genomic regions, is thought to contribute to the expression status of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000270-Misteli1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000270-Pombo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

We use antibodies that specifically detect different phosphorylated forms of RNAP to investigate the association of the inducible uPA gene with transcription factories. Prior to induction, most uPA alleles are positioned inside their CT and extensively associated with RNAP sites marked by S5p. Transcriptional activation leads to looping out of the uPA locus from its CT, and increased association with active transcription factories marked by both S5p and S2p. However, the extent of gene association with factories, before and after activation, is independent of the uPA position relative to its CT.

These changes are likely to reflect the presence of different populations of resistant fragments at the uPA regulatory regions upon induction. Taken together, these findings show that the uPA gene adopts an open chromatin state before transcriptional activation, which is maintained after induction.

Intron lengths at the uPA gene are at most &#x0223c;900 bp, and small introns can be promptly removed within seconds of synthesis. In contrast, the level of uPA gene association with S2p sites can provide a higher estimate, with the caveat that these levels of association may also reflect, in part, an indirect colocalisation of uPA loci with transcription factories associated with the flanking genes.</p><fig id="pbio-1000270-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000270.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The induction of uPA gene expression is associated with an increase in the number of active alleles.</title><p>(A) TPA induction of uPA transcripts at the transcription site. uPA gene transcription was detected in HepG2 cells &#x000b1;TPA by combining RNA and DNA-FISH in the same cryosection.

These results show that the association of the uPA, CAMK2G, and VCL genes with RNAP-S2p occurs independently of CT position. A recent analysis of gene activation induced by the insertion of a strong (&#x000df;-globin) enhancer in a gene rich-region also showed no effect on the frequency of locus association with active transcription factories at different positions relative to the CT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000270-Noordermeer1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, although this region preferentially localises at the CT edge. In the case of the murine <italic>Hoxb</italic> locus, a small preferential association of <italic>Hoxb1</italic> and flanking genes with active transcription factories is observed outside the CT upon retinoic acid treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000270-Morey1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Different mechanisms of gene regulation may act on different genes and depend on the kinetics of induction over the shorter activation (3 h) of the uPA gene by TPA treatment in comparison with retinoic acid treatment for several days to induce <italic>Hox</italic> genes.</p><p>Finally, to investigate whether the CT position of the uPA gene has an influence on its transcriptional activity, we labelled the uPA gene, chromosome 10, and uPA transcripts simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000270-g007">Figure 7D, 7E</xref>). We used the fosmid uPA probe for highest spatial resolution. We find that the uPA gene is transcribed with the same frequency irrespectively of its CT position upon TPA activation (logistic regression analysis, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.74; <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;100). These results differ from the murine <italic>Igf2bp1</italic> and <italic>Cbx1</italic> genes, flanking the <italic>Hoxb</italic> cluster, which are also transcriptionally active at all CT positions, independently of <italic>Hoxb</italic> induction, but are preferentially active outside the CT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000270-Morey1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Difficulties in the detection of the <italic>Hoxb1</italic> transcripts did not allow a similar analysis of allelic transcription upon induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000270-Morey1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, to help establish how general the correlation is between gene positioning outside the CT and transcriptional states.</p><p>Prior to activation, we unexpectedly found that the largest fraction of uPA loci, which are internal to the CT, are less likely to be transcriptionally active (logistic regression analysis, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0001; <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;103), whereas the smaller proportion of uPA loci not located at the preferred internal CT position is transcribed at the same frequency as upon TPA induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000270-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). These results suggest that the internal CT positioning has a silencing effect on the primed uPA locus prior to its induction, which helps prevent transcript elongation or interferes with transcript stability, revealing unexpected properties of locus positioning within the nuclear landscape.</p><p>In summary, our analyses of the uPA gene prior to induction showed that it was (a) preferentially positioned at the interior of its CT; (b) in a poised state, characterized by open chromatin configuration and the presence of RNAP-S5p at regulatory regions; and (c) preferentially associated with poised, S5p<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>S2p<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transcription factories. Transcriptional activation induces large-scale relocation of the gene towards the CT exterior and a preferred association with factories containing both (S5p and S2p) RNAP modifications, as expected in the active state. Although the correlation between looping out of the CT and the change in RNAP configuration suggested that the external position might favour transcriptional activation, triple-labelling experiments showed that the position of the uPA locus relative to its CT and the association with poised or active transcription factories are independent events. RNA-FISH experiments confirm that after TPA induction both external and internal positions of the uPA gene, with respect to its CT, are equally competent for transcription. However, positioning of the uPA locus inside the CT, before activation, may help control the levels of transcription, as uPA genes that are found outside of the CT before TPA treatment are more likely to be transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000270-g007">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>Our findings reinforce the idea that the interior of CTs is not repressive for the association of genes with transcription machinery, suggesting that large-scale chromatin movements are unlikely to be necessary for genes to find transcription factories, although they may influence the extent of association for specific subsets of genes. This study expands current models of gene regulation by showing that silent genes can be associated with poised transcription factories and that factory association and gene position relative to the CT can be independent factors. Our results are also compatible with the notion that poised transcription factories represent a sub-population of specialized sites that may allow primed genes to respond rapidly and efficiently to specific activation signals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A detailed description of the experimental procedures is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000270.s010">Text S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Cell Culture, RNA Detection, and Western Blotting</title><p>HepG2 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml TPA (Sigma) for the indicated times as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000270-IbaezTallon1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
