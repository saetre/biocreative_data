Because of a lack of appropriate animal models, not much is known about their potential viral etiology. Infection by liver-tropic viruses is one possibility for the breakdown of self-tolerance. Therefore, we infected mice with adenovirus Ad5 expressing human cytochrome P450 2D6 (Ad-2D6). Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice developed persistent autoimmune liver disease, apparent by cellular infiltration, hepatic fibrosis, &#x0201c;fused&#x0201d; liver lobules, and necrosis. Similar to type 2 AIH patients, Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice generated type 1 liver kidney microsomal&#x02013;like antibodies recognizing the immunodominant epitope WDPAQPPRD of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Interestingly, Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected wild-type FVB/N mice displayed exacerbated liver damage when compared with transgenic mice expressing the identical human CYP2D6 protein in the liver, indicating the presence of a stronger immunological tolerance in CYP2D6 mice. We demonstrate for the first time that infection with a virus expressing a natural human autoantigen breaks tolerance, resulting in a chronic form of severe, autoimmune liver damage. Our novel model system should be instrumental for studying mechanisms involved in the initiation, propagation, and precipitation of virus-induced autoimmune liver diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: Ad-2D6, adenovirus Ad5 expressing human cytochrome P450 2D6; Ad-GFP, adenovirus Ad5 expressing GFP; AIH, autoimmune hepatitis; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AP, alkaline phosphatase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CYP2D6, cytochrome P450 2D6; GGT, &#x003b3; glutamyl transpeptidase; HCV, hepatitis C virus; ICP4, infected cell protein 4; LDS, liver damage score; LKM-1, type 1 liver kidney microsomal antibody; PBC, primary biliary cirrhosis.</p></fn><fn><p>M.

Nevertheless, autoimmune liver diseases comprising a variety of immune-mediated disorders, such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis, and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), do exist and often cause severe long-term consequences. The resulting syndromes partially overlap, and clinical signs and symptoms are often inconsistent and variable, making a definite diagnosis sometimes difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Infections are prime candidates for initiating autoimmunity in genetically predisposed individuals because they frequently induce strong inflammatory responses in various organs and can attract a multitude of potentially autoaggressive lymphocytes to the site of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). To evaluate whether virus infections can break tolerance to liver autoantigens, we infected mice with adenovirus Ad5 expressing human cytochrome P450 2D6 (Ad-2D6), which constitutes the major human autoantigen in type 2 AIH (AIH-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is recognized by type 1 liver kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM-1s), which are present in up to 10% of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#x02013;infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) and are the hallmark defining AIH-2 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>One possible mechanism by which viruses could induce autoimmunity is a structural similarity of virus and host components, a phenomenon commonly referred to as &#x0201c;molecular mimicry&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). It has been demonstrated in the past that molecular mimicry may be involved in the induction, acceleration, and prevention of autoimmune processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Interestingly, the occurrence of LKM-1s in chronic HCV&#x02013;infected patients might be explained by molecular mimicry, because antibodies recognizing the HCV proteins NS3 and NS5a recognize a specific conformational epitope on CYP2D6 between aa 254 and 288 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Furthermore, HCV has the potential to induce autoreactive CD8 T cells, which cross react with the cytochrome P450 isoforms 2A6 and 2A7 that contain sequence homology to HCV aa 178&#x02013;187 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Indeed, antibodies to CYP2A6 have been found in HCV-infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Importantly, LKM-1s of AIH-2 patients recognizing CYP2D6 aa 193&#x02013;212 have been demonstrated to cross react with epitopes of HCV (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase NS5 aa 2977&#x02013;2996) and CMV (alkaline exonuclease aa 121&#x02013;140) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). A further sequence homology has been reported between the immunodominant CYP2D6 epitope, DPAQPPRD, and the infected cell protein 4 (ICP4) of HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). However, definite proof for environmental factors, such as viruses, as inducers of human autoimmune liver disease has been elusive.</p><p>Thus, we wished to test, as a proof of principle, whether viral inflammation caused by liver-tropic adenovirus can facilitate the breaking of tolerance to a naturally occurring autoantigen in the liver. This concept has been previously shown in several diabetes models in which virally meditated inflammation provided a &#x0201c;fertile field&#x0201d; for autoimmune reactions, for example the RIP-LCMV mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) and Ins-HA mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). For the present study, we have chosen the human autoantigen CYP2D6 as a target antigen. We generated Ad-2D6 and infected nontransgenic FVB/N and transgenic CYP2D6 mice, expressing human CYP2D6 under the control of its own promoter as a self-antigen in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). The use of such an Ad-2D6 vector system ensured both a high expression rate of the triggering antigen (CYP2D6) in the liver (antigen-specific initiation) and a potent activation of the immune system by viral infection. We found that infection with Ad-2D6 results in two distinct phases of liver damage: an acute, antiviral phase, characterized by transient elevation of serum aminotransferase levels and minor cellular infiltrations, followed by an autoimmune phase characterized by massive hepatocellular damage, strong cellular infiltration, formation of high titer anti-CYP2D6 antibodies, and extensive hepatic fibrosis.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Infection of mice with adenovirus results in transient hepatic damage</title><p>Transgenic CYP2D6 mice and nontransgenic FVB/N littermates were infected with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> particles of adenovirus Ad5 expressing GFP (Ad-GFP), the liver was removed at different days after infection, and expression of GFP was examined under a fluorescence microscope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). GFP-expressing cells were detected from day 1 after infection and reached a maximal number at day 7 after infection, when GFP expression was detected throughout the liver. At day 14 after infection, only very few cells were still expressing GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Similar expression kinetics for GFP were detected in Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected wild-type FVB/N mice (not depicted). Upon infection of FVB/N and CYP2D6 mice with either Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP, all mice developed transient hepatic damage characterized by an elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Values reached up to 150 and 250 U/liter of serum for AST and ALT, respectively, from weeks 1 to 5 after infection. The serum aminotransferase regressed to normal, preinfection levels around week 6 after Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Statistical evaluation of the augmentation over time after infection revealed that there was no significant difference between mice that have been infected with Ad-2D6 and Ad-GFP and between FVB/N and CYP2D6 mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). There is, however, a nonsignificant tendency toward an earlier increase in both AST and ALT in mice that have been infected with Ad-2D6. Further, we measured alkaline phosphatase (AP) as a cholestasis marker and found a minor increase at weeks 1 and 2 after infection with Ad-2D6 but not with Ad-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). As observed for AST and ALT, this elevation was only transient and no significant increase in AP levels was found at week 4 or later, indicating that no persistent biliary obstruction or cholangitis occurred after infection of mice with either Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP. No acute or persistent elevation of &#x003b3; glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels was detected in infected FVB/N and CYP2D6 mice (not depicted). In summary, these data indicate that adenovirus infection by itself results in acute but transient hepatocellular damage.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Phase 1: acute liver damage by adenovirus infection.</bold> (A) Expression of GFP in liver sections at several times after infection of CYP2D6 mice with Ad-GFP.

In contrast to the infection of mice with Ad-GFP, Ad-2D6 infection resulted in severe and persistent liver damage. Morphologically, livers of Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice showed several features characteristic for liver damage associated with autoimmune-mediated liver disease and/or chronic viral hepatitis, such as fused liver lobes, hyperplasic nodules, and capsular fibrosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Importantly, none of these morphological changes occurred in Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected mice. To semiquantitatively evaluate the morphological appearance, we defined a liver damage score (LDS; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). LDS was determined over a period of 45 wk for both CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice infected with either Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Interestingly, &#x0003e;50% of wild-type mice already developed the first morphological signs of liver damage at week 1 after infection with Ad-2D6, whereas mice expressing CYP2D6 showed obvious signs of liver damage only at week 2 after Ad-2D6 infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, left). However, no significant difference in the overall LDS between transgenic and wild-type mice was detected at later times (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, left). Importantly, LDS was persistently elevated in both CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice even at times later than 3 mo after infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, left). Note that with some minor exceptions, no morphological signs of liver damage were detected in mice infected with Ad-GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, right). However, statistical evaluation revealed that the LDS was significantly different between Ad-2D6&#x02013; and Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected CYP2D6 as well as FVB/N mice (P &#x0003c; 0.05 using the Mann-Whitney test). These data demonstrate that although only a transient elevation of ALT, AST, and AP was detected after adenovirus infection of CYP2D6 or FVB/N mice, the viral expression of CYP2D6 resulted in persistent liver damage.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Phase 2: persistent liver damage after infection of mice by Ad-2D6.</bold> (A) Paraformaldehyde-fixed livers of CYP2D6 mice infected with either Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP at week 8 after infection.

This initial inflammation is likely caused by the direct antiviral immune response mounted to eliminate the infectious agent. However, later on the immunopathology differed between Ad-2D6&#x02013; and Ad-GFP (control)&#x02013;infected animals. At week 4, the areas of focal necrosis were becoming larger and increased in number in Ad-2D6&#x02013;treated mice, whereas Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected mice showed a reduction of focal necrosis in both size and number (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, middle row), and at week 8 nearly no focal points of lymphocyte accumulation were detectable in Ad-GFP&#x02013;treated mice, leaving behind only some scattered lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, bottom row, far left). In contrast, Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice had a massive increase in inflammation and liver cell destruction at week 8. Interface hepatitis with extensive infiltrates in the periportal and parenchymal regions could be detected, and areas of focal necrosis were growing larger and confluent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, bottom row). Semiquantitative analysis of the obtained cellular infiltration data revealed a significant persistence in CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice at week 8 after Ad-2D6 infection when compared with Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In FVB/N mice, a significant difference was even found starting from week 4 after infection, suggesting an accelerated liver damage in wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis 2 wk after infection revealed that the cellular infiltrates consisted predominantly of B cells (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells), CD4 T cells, and macrophages (F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, only a few CD8 T cells were found (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In support of our initial observation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we found that FVB/N mice had more rapid cellular infiltration compared with transgenic CYP2D6 mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Liver sections of Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected FVB/N mice already displayed a degree of cellular infiltration similar to that observed in CYP2D6 livers at weeks 4 and 8 after infection at week 2 after infection, whereas the livers of CYP2D6 mice showed only minor infiltrates at week 2 after Ad-2D6 infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Liver fibrosis was detected exclusively in Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice, as demonstrated by Sirius red staining of collagen fibers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and immunohistochemistry using an FITC-conjugated anti&#x02013;collagen I antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Sirius red staining was performed with liver sections of CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice obtained at various times after infection with either Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP. Tissue sections covering the entire liver from three to five mice per experimental group have been analyzed, and a representative picture is displayed for each time point (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). An increase in subcapsular fibrosis over time was found in Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected Ad-2D6 and FVB/N mice only (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), whereas no difference was found in Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Interestingly, the development of subcapsular fibrosis was accelerated and more pronounced in wild-type FVB/N mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). For a better visualization of the predominantly subcapsular and interlobular fibrosis, we performed a reconstruction of an immunofluorescent staining of a representative liver section of a CYP2D6 mouse at week 8 after Ad-2D6 infection, covering the entire organ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The figure shows the massive subcapsular fibrosis and the interlobular collagen I deposits that &#x0201c;glue&#x0201d; the individual lobes (including the left and right medial as well as the left lateral lobes) together. No significant collagen I deposits were found in Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, inset). Costaining for B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells demonstrates that many cellular infiltrates are located in close proximity to the subcapsular collagen I deposits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, regions 1 and 2). Similar results have been obtained for Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected FVB/N mice (unpublished data). These data indicate that Ad-2D6, in contrast to Ad-GFP, induces a persistent damage of the liver in both CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice. Further, the finding that cellular infiltration is augmented (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) and development of fibrosis is accelerated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) in wild-type FVB/N mice indicates the existence of partial tolerance in CYP2D6 mice.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Hepatic necrosis and massive cellular infiltrations after Ad-2D6-infection.</bold> (A) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of liver sections obtained from CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice infected with either Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP at weeks 1, 4, and 8 after infection.

We collected blood of CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice infected with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> particles of Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP at various times after infection and determined the activation state of B cells and the titers of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies. We used either a goat anti&#x02013;mouse pan-Ig antibody or recombinant human CYP2D6 protein to capture total Ig or anti-CYP2D6 antibodies produced by activated B cells in a B cell ELISPOT assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). No striking differences in the frequency of Ig-producing cells of FVB/N or CYP2D6 mice infected either with Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP were observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, top). In contrast, B cells secreting specific anti-CYP2D6 antibodies were exclusively generated in Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, bottom). The highest frequency of anti-CYP2D6 antibody-secreting cells of &#x0223c;0.01% of all splenocytes was found at week 4 after infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Interestingly, FVB/N mice generated a higher number of anti-CYP2D6 antibody-secreting cells than CYP2D6 mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). These data were mainly reflected in the titer of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies in the serum. IgM-type anti-CYP2D6 antibodies were found to a similar extent in FVB/N and CYP2D6 mice after infection with Ad-2D6, but not Ad-GFP, and reached a maximum titer of 500&#x02013;900 between weeks 2 and 4 after infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). In contrast, IgG-type anti-CYP2D6 antibodies reached titers up to &#x0003e;500,000 in Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected FVB/N mice and increased with time until around week 6 after infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). We could not detect any CYP2D6-specific IgE-type antibodies in CYP2D6 or FVB/N mice infected with Ad-2D6 or Ad-GFP (unpublished data). The finding that Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected CYP2D6 mice did not reach as high titers as FVB/N mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>) fits well with our previous results (as reported earlier in this paper), in which CYP2D6 mice showed a lower frequency of anti-CYP2D6 antibody-secreting B cells and had attenuated hepatocellular damage and fibrosis compared with wild-type FVB/N mice. For further characterization, we compared the staining patterns of rat liver sections by the sera of Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice with the sera of patients with various autoimmune liver diseases. A similar LKM-1&#x02013;like staining pattern was found for the sera from Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice (CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice) and the sera of AIH-2 patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>).

Thus, we next mapped the dominant human CYP2D6 B cell epitope recognized by the sera of Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice by using the SPOTs technology, in which staggered peptides covering the entire human CYP2D6 sequence are covalently linked to a nylon membrane. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> shows an example of a serum of an Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected CYP2D6 mouse reacted with the SPOTs membrane.

Interestingly, sera from all Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected CYP2D6 as well as FVB/N mice predominantly reacted to a cluster of overlapping peptides within the core aa sequence WDPAQPPRD (CYP2D6 aa 262&#x02013;270; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>).

Most importantly, in an extensive study with the sera of 26 LKM-1&#x02013;positive AIH-2 patients, 22 recognized a 33-aa segment of CYP2D6 in this region, and 11 (50%) of these sera recognized the minimal B cell epitope DPAQPPRD (CYP2D6 aa 263&#x02013;270) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).

In contrast, sera from patients with other autoimmune liver diseases (AIH-1 and PBC) did not recognize the immunodominant CYP2D6 B cell epitope (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B</xref> [bottom] and C). In addition to the immunodominant CYP2D6 aa 262&#x02013;270 epitope, other epitopes were recognized by FVB/N and CYP2D6 mouse sera as well, although to a much lesser extent and with some variation between individual mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). However, the overall pattern of epitope recognition was mostly overlapping between sera from Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice and patients with AIH-2, but not with the sera of patients with other autoimmune liver diseases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Mouse anti-CYP2D6 antibodies and sera of AIH-2 patients recognize the identical immunodominant CYP2D6 epitope.</bold> (A) SPOTs membrane containing staggered peptides of 12 aa in length covering the entire 497 aa of the human CYP2D6 molecule.

Importantly, wild-type FVB/N mice, which do not express the human CYP2D6 model antigen but express several mouse Cyp isoenzymes with high homology to human CYP2D6, exhibit even a lesser degree of immunological tolerance toward human CYP2D6 and might therefore generate an even stronger immune response toward human CYP2D6.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>By infecting CYP2D6 humanized and wild-type FVB/N mice with an adenovirus vector expressing the natural human autoantigen CYP2D6, self-tolerance to CYP2D6 and orthologous mouse cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (Cyp) was broken, resulting in persistent autoimmune liver damage. For the first time, we show the generation of autoantibodies in an animal model with the same specificity as human LKM-1s occurring in AIH-2 patients, combined with severe autoimmune-mediated hepatic damage and characterized by hepatocellular necrosis, massive cellular infiltration, and hepatic fibrosis.</p><p>In theory, the liver should be a prime target for autoimmunity. First, because of its function as a detoxifying and drug-metabolizing organ, cellular destruction (i.e., by ethanol) and neoantigen formation (i.e., protein adduct formation by reactive metabolites) can occur. Second, the liver is the target of potential environmental triggering factors for autoimmune disease, including hepatitis, coxsackie virus, HSV, and many more. It has further been suggested that the liver may act as a sink for activated lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). However, the frequencies of autoimmune disorders that specifically afflict the liver, such as AIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), PBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), or halothane hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), are relatively low when compared with other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, certain types of thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease and Grave's disease), multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, it is known that liver allografts are less frequently rejected than other transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Nevertheless, the consequences of autoimmune liver destruction are often severe, including massive hepatic damage, cirrhosis, and subsequent multiorgan dysfunction, which frequently makes liver transplantation unavoidable. Several possible explanations for strong hepatic tolerance have been suggested in the past, including T cell inactivation by antigenic priming in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), tolerance induction via cross-presentation by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), induction of regulatory T cells by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), and hepatic stellate cell&#x02013;induced T cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>Such immunosuppressive mechanisms certainly have made the generation of a reliable animal model to study persistent autoimmune-mediated liver damage difficult. Although several, mostly transgenic, mouse model systems have been tested in the past, only transient damage to the liver has been detected in most models, such as the HBsAg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), H-2K<sup>b</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), ALB1-LCMV-GP33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), LCMV-NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), and TF-OVA models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). In addition, induction of disease often required the transfer of antigen-specific lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In another recent study, AIH-like disease was reported in mice by xenoimmunization using a plasmid containing the antigenic region of CYP2D6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). However, only coexpression of CYP2D6 and IL-12 resulted in significant inflammation in the liver. In addition, only minor elevations in serum ALT and a transient generation of low-titer anti-CYP2D6 antibodies with large interindividual differences were stated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>).</p><p>A common hypothesis to explain the etiology of autoimmune disease is genetic predisposition of the host (intrinsic risk factors) paired with environmental triggers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Many autoimmune diseases have been associated with pathogen infection (for reviews see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). To date no firm proof for environmental factors, such as viruses, as inducers or enhancers of most human autoimmune diseases, including human AIH, has been found. Direct evidence for viruses to induce or accelerate autoimmune disease is, however, hard to come by because (a) virus infections are often &#x0201c;hit and run&#x0201d; events that leave no traces behind at the time of diagnosis of autoimmune disease; (b) patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, as well as healthy individuals, undergo several pathogen infections during their lifetime; (c) viruses might not directly induce autoimmune disease but instead accelerate a preexisting autoimmune condition to progress to clinical disease; (d) the exact time, location, and magnitude of infection might be important; and (e) some pathogens have even been demonstrated to have protective properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). However, several pathogens have been associated with autoimmune liver disease. For PBC, it has been suggested that the xenobiotic-metabolizing bacterium <italic>Novosphingobium aromaticivorans</italic> might be involved in the initiation of the diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). For AIH, several studies implicate viruses, such as measles virus, hepatitis viruses, CMV, and Epstein-Barr virus, in its initiation (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). In particular, sequence homology has been reported between the immunodominant CYP2D6 epitope DPAQPPRD and ICP4 of HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Further, a study by Kerkar et al. demonstrates that a considerable fraction of AIH-2 patients (12 out of 13, or 93%) and LKM-1&#x02013;positive patients with chronic HCV infection (5 of 10, or 50%) carry antibodies reacting to the CYP2D6 epitope RLLDLA (aa 204&#x02013;209) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Interestingly, this reactivity can be neutralized by incubation with epitopes of HCV (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase NS5 aa 2977&#x02013;2996 containing the core sequence RLLDLS) and CMV (alkaline exonuclease aa 121&#x02013;140 containing the core sequence RLLDLA), suggesting a possibility of molecular mimicry as a mechanism involved in the etiology of AIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>As a proof of principle of how environmental factors can initiate autoimmune liver disease in an animal model, we used an adenovirus expressing the natural major human liver autoantigen CYP2D6 as a triggering factor. One has to acknowledge that, in this system, large amounts of the target/triggering protein (CYP2D6) are being expressed from the adenoviral vector directly in the liver in context with a significant viral inflammation of the target organ. Thus, our current findings underline the strong need for inflammation to trigger autoimmune liver damage. In our case, a hepatotropic adenovirus was capable of preparing a fertile field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>) for the arrival of autoaggressive lymphocytes. It is remarkable that, under these conditions, strong systemic induction of CYP2D6-specific B cells was still required, and even the expression of transgenic human CYP2D6 under control of its own promoter in CYP2D6 mice was not sufficient to break tolerance with a virus that did not express CYP2D6 (Ad-GFP control).</p><p>The 2D6 isoform of the large cytochrome P450 enzyme family is the major antigen component specifically recognized by LKM-1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), which are the defining hallmark autoantibodies present in patients afflicted with AIH-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). AIH is a severe form of an adverse immune reaction resulting in the progressive destruction of the hepatic parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Among AIH patients, &#x0223c;10% are affected by AIH-2 and develop LKM-1s, which are regarded as serological markers for AIH-2. Besides LKM-1, up to 50% of AIH-2 patients develop anti&#x02013;liver cytosol type 1 antibodies, and &#x0223c;10% develop LKM-3s to family 1 uridine 5&#x02032;-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). However, the majority (90%) of AIH patients are affected by AIH-1 and develop ANAs, anti&#x02013;smooth muscle actin antibodies, atypical perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti&#x02013;soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas antigen antibodies, which are all less well characterized than LKM-1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Susceptibility factors for the individual AIH subtypes are dominated by the MHC haplotype, although other factors, such as complement genes, Igs, and TCR variants, may play a minor role as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). In contrast to AIH-1, which is predominantly associated with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4, AIH-2 is primarily associated with HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1, and the presence of HLA-DR2 seems to be protective (for details see Krawitt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]). Autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells specific for CYP2D6 have been found in the blood and the liver of AIH-2 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). However, although the major target antigens have been characterized on the level of specific epitopes, the etiology of AIH-2 is only poorly understood. It is intriguing that the CYP2D6 antigen performed well as an autoantigenic target in our model of adenovirally induced liver inflammation, underlining its importance in liver autoimmunity across species and under various conditions. Interestingly, our model system exhibited two phases of liver injury after infection of CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice with Ad-2D6. First, infection with adenovirus (Ad-2D6 as well as Ad-GFP) initiated an antiviral immune response associated with transient damage to the liver, characterized by minor elevation of serum aminotransferase levels and focal infiltration by mononuclear cells. It had been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>) that replication-deficient adenoviruses can induce acute injury and inflammation. As early as 1 h after infection with 10<sup>10</sup> particles of an adenovirus-&#x003b2;gal vector, expression of chemokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein 2, monocyte chemoattractant protein 2, and IFN-inducible protein 10, was strongly increased and neutrophils infiltrated immediately thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). All adenovirus vectors tested by Muruve et al. did cause transient hepatic damage and cellular infiltrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>) similar to the focal clusters of infiltrating cells we detected at day 7 for Ad-2D6 and Ad-GFP in our own experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Our crucial observation in this study, however, is that a second autoimmune phase with persistent hepatic damage follows the viral inflammation, but only when the triggering adenovirus drives the expression of the CYP2D6 autoantigen. Generation of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies at very high titers was restricted to mice infected with Ad-2D6, whereas infection of mice transgenically expressing human CYP2D6 with Ad-GFP was not sufficient for anti-CYP2D6 antibody formation. The specificity of these antibodies was directed to the same immunodominant CYP2D6 epitope that was recognized by LKM-1s found in the sera of AIH-2 patients. These data suggest that the breakdown of tolerance in Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice might be mediated via a similar pathway than in patients suffering from AIH-2. It is further important to note that virus infection was necessary to induce liver disease in the CYP2D6 model system. We injected CYP2D6 and FVB/N mice with recombinant human CYP2D6 in combination with Poly-IC (i.v.), CpG (i.v.), or CFA (s.c.). None of these mice showed any signs of liver damage, such as elevated serum aminotransferases, cellular infiltrations, and fibrosis. In these experiments only s.c. injection of recombinant human CYP2D6 emulsified in CFA resulted in the generation of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies at a titer similar to Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice (unpublished data). These data indicate that the generation of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies per se is not sufficient to induce autoimmune liver damage.</p><p>Interestingly, wild-type FVB/N mice showed an accelerated course of hepatic damage with an enhanced number of activated CYP2D6-specific B cells and generated higher titers of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies compared with transgenic CYP2D6 mice, indicating that tolerance to human CYP2D6 is harder to overcome in CYP2D6 mice. Although, none of the mouse cytochrome P450 family genes (<italic>Cyp</italic>) encode an isoenzyme with similar catalytic activity as human CYP2D6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>), wild-type FVB/N mice do express Cyp isoenzymes with high sequence homology to the human CYP2D6 and other human CYP isoenzymes. A screening of the National Center for Biotechnology Information databank revealed that the mouse Cyp isoenzymes Cyp2D9, Cyp2D11, Cyp2D22, and Cyp2D26 display up to 75% aa sequence homology to human CYP2D6 (available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession nos. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAE25635">BAE25635</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="P24457">P24457</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAF34652">AAF34652</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Q8CIM7">Q8CIM7</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M33388">M33388</ext-link>, respectively). Further, the mouse Cyp2D26 protein contains an aa sequence (aa 262&#x02013;270) identical to the human CYP2D6 epitope WDPAQPPRD, which was found to be immunodominant in AIH-2 patients and in Ad-2D6&#x02013;infected mice. Thus, upon challenging FVB/N mice with Ad-2D6, autoimmune liver damage was most likely induced because of true molecular mimicry between the human CYP2D6 expressed via the adenovirus system and homologous mouse sequences (i.e., mouse Cyp2D26), as demonstrated by our experiments. However, tolerance to human CYP2D6 was more pronounced in CYP2D6 humanized mice, which express the identical human CYP2D6 molecule and exhibited delayed liver damage, a lower frequency of activated B cells, and a lower anti-CYP2D6 antibody titer. These observations allow for the speculation that similar yet not identical autoantigens might be better targets for autoimmune reactions, because central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms will be less efficient.</p><p>We would like to propose that molecular mimicry remains one of the possible mechanisms that could become relevant with a concomitant viral infection of the liver. Indeed, our earlier studies have shown that molecular mimicry can enhance an ongoing autoimmune process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), although cross-reactivity alone was not able to elicit autoimmune diabetes in naive animals. Indeed, several pathogens confer molecular mimicry with human CYP2D6. Most prominently, ICP4 of HSV-1 carries the peptide sequence PAQPPR, which is also found in the immunodominant human CYP2D6 epitope DPAQPPRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). However, no epidemiological association that would link HSV-1 infection with AIH-2 has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In contrast, an epidemiological link was demonstrated for HCV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>), and antibodies to HCV were found in a large proportion of AIH-2 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). In addition, LKM-1s were detected in up to 10% of HCV-infected individuals, depending on the geographic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). It is, however, noteworthy that LKM-1s of HCV-infected patients recognize a different pattern of CYP2D6 epitopes than LKM-1s of AIH-2 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>), indicating a divergent pathway leading to the breakdown of tolerance toward CYP2D6 in HCV-infected individuals. It is therefore important to further analyze the mechanisms of tolerance breakdown to human CYP2D6 in the humanized CYP2D6 mouse, which generates anti-CYP2D6 antibodies recognizing a similar epitope pattern as human LKM-1s, and to analyze the kinetics of epitope recognition by the sera of AIH-2 patients in more detail. It is important to note that the CYP2D6 reactivity of LKM-1s is not restricted to the immunodominant WDPAQPPRD epitope (aa 262&#x02013;270). The detection of several other CYP2D6 epitopes that have been recognized by various proportions of patients' sera has been reported, including the regions aa 321&#x02013;351, aa 373&#x02013;389, and aa 410&#x02013;429 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>); aa 196&#x02013;218 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>); aa 193&#x02013;212, aa 238&#x02013;257, aa 268&#x02013;287, and aa 478&#x02013;497 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>); and aa 284&#x02013;391, aa 412&#x02013;429, and the conformational epitopes aa 1&#x02013;146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>) and aa 321&#x02013;379 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). However, it seems that the outcome of these studies was largely dependent on the assays used and the selection of LKM-1 sera analyzed. It will therefore be important to dissect these immunoreactive epitopes in more detail to screen for pathogen structures conferring molecular mimicry. A very recent article reports a dominant CD8 T cell reactivity to the HLA-A2&#x0002a;0201&#x02013;restricted CYP2D6 epitope aa 245&#x02013;254 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). Interestingly, aa 245&#x02013;254&#x02013;specific CD8 T cells could be detected in sections of an explanted liver of an AIH-2 patient by in situ MHC tetramer staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). These data indicate that besides the overwhelming B cell/antibody&#x02013;mediated immune response to liver autoantigens, an aggressive CD8 T cell&#x02013;mediated process might be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune liver diseases such as AIH-2. Thus, it will be important to further develop animal models reflecting all the aspects of the autoreactive immune response. In this context, it is noteworthy that a similar approach of virus-induced inflammation and breakdown of self-tolerance has been used to develop an animal model for myocarditis. Infection of susceptible BALB/c mice with a &#x0201c;heart-passaged&#x0201d; Coxsackie virus B3 containing cardiac myosin caused acute and chronic myocarditis similar to the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). Interestingly, such mice quickly generated autoantibodies specific for cardiac myosin, suggesting that, similar to our CYP2D6 model, concomitant infection of and antigen delivery to the target organ breaks tolerance and induces disease.</p><p>It was the goal of our study to generate an experimental model for virally induced autoimmune liver disease. Infection with an adenovirus expressing human CYP2D6 with 75% sequence homology to mouse Cyp2D isoenzymes elicited persistent damage to the liver associated with anti-CYP2D6 autoantibodies. A first transient phase of liver damage caused by the antiviral response was followed by permanent autoimmune liver damage. Importantly, neither TCR transgenic T cells nor transgenic expression of the autoantigen were required in this model, which brings it much closer to an immunological scenario that one could envision happening in human disease. Thus, our model system serves as a hallmark to further investigate and characterize the immunopathological mechanisms that lead to loss of tolerance to human autoepitopes and such a chronic hepatocellular destruction. Finally, such models may help to establish a basis to evaluate possible treatments for human autoimmune liver diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice and viruses.</title><p>CYP2D6 humanized mice, generated by microinjection of the entire human <italic>CYP2D6</italic> gene, including its promoter region, into the pronucleus of fertilized FVB/N mouse eggs to produce a transgenic mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), were provided by F.J.
