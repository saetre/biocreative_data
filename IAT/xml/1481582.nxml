Further research resolved the cellular mechanism by which cigarette smoke induces cytokine production in monocyte-derived macrophages. Cigarette smoke causes subsequently a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of IRAK and degradation of TRAF6. Moreover, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was phosphorylated which suggests involvement of NF-&#x003ba;B.

The major risk factor for the development of COPD is cigarette smoking. Smoking causes activation of resident cells and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs, which leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemotactic factors, oxygen radicals and proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Airway inflammation in COPD involves inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; which are generally considered to be important mediators in neutrophil recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Many observations suggested macrophages to be the orchestrators of chronic response and tissue destructions in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For instance, macrophages in broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) from asymptomatic smokers and patients with COPD are higher than in BAL from nonsmokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Macrophages produce cytokines including IL-8 and the levels of IL-8 in induced sputum are correlated with the extent of inflammation and severity of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In alveolar cells, cigarette smoke (CS) constituents induce mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, cultured human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] release IL-8 in response to CS medium prepared by bubbling smoke through cell culture medium.</p><p>The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an evolutionarily conserved family of cell surface molecules which participate in innate immune response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Among TLR family the best described and most studied is TLR2 and TLR4. TLR2 and TLR4 are shown to be expressed maximally in CD14 positive mononuclear cells within fractionated peripheral blood leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Activation of macrophages through the TLR4 signal transduction pathway leads to nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B activation and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators like IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since CS may provide many potential inflammatory stimuli and the role of TLR proteins in inflammatory airway diseases, such as asthma and allergy is being intensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we hypothesized that CS medium may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD by stimulation of macrophages through ligation of TLRs. To examine the objection, firstly, the effects of CS on pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion including IL-8 were evaluated. Then, the involvement of TLR2 and TLR4 in IL-8 production was studied and, finally, signaling pathways in human monocyte-derived macrophages after exposure to CS medium were investigated. The findings explain the possible mechanisms behind the initial inflammatory process in lungs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Isolation of PBMC and culture of human monocyte-derived macrophages</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] by density gradient centrifugation (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) of buffy coats obtained from normal blood donors.

The remained cells used for preparation of lymphocyte fraction by centrifugation on a Percoll density gradient (purity 85%).

Briefly, fresh blood was incubated with RosetteSep&#x02122; cocktail at room temperature followed by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation (Life Technologies, Cergy Pontoise, France). The enriched monocytes were collected from the Ficoll:plasma interface and purity was assessed by FACS analysis using a FITC-labeled anti-CD14 mAb (95%). Macrophages were obtained by culturing monocytes for 5 days in medium containing 2.5 ng/ml GM-CSF and 25 ng/ml M-CSF (R&#x00026;D), as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>CS medium preparation</title><p>CS medium was prepared as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Hereafter, absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically and the media was standardized to a standard curve of CS medium concentration against absorbance at 320 nm. This concentration was serially diluted with untreated media and applied to the cells. Freshly prepared CS medium was used in all experiments. Nontoxic concentrations of CS medium were detected performing different toxicological assays (SRB, WST-1, and LDH) and FACS analysis (annexin-V and 7-AAD staining).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of human cytokines</title><p>Cells were plated at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml in 96-well cell culture plates and stimulated with different concentrations of CS medium or LPS (as positive controls) for overnight.

PBMC stimulated by CS medium produced inflammatory cytokines such as high amounts of IL-8 (5 ng/ml) (data not shown). Further experiments showed that monocytes in comparison with neutrophils and lymphocytes are the major source of IL-8 generation in PBMC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In addition, high expression of intracellular IL-8 was demonstrated in CD14 positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Since these findings suggested that most likely monocytes are the major source of IL-8 production after exposure to CS medium, a human monocyte-derived macrophage culture system was established. Purified monocytes were cultured for 5 days in medium containing GM-CSF and M-CSF to gain macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

First we investigated whether or not the effect is due to LPS that might be present CS extract? We analyzed the samples for endotoxin biological activity using the Limulus assay. The amount of endotoxin in the applied CS medium was less than 3 pg/ml, which is most likely not enough to trigger the cytokine production by human macrophages. Polymixin B is an antibiotic that contains a cationic cyclopeptide with a fatty acid chain that can neutralize the biological activity of endotoxins by binding to the lipid A portion of the bacterial LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We exposed the cells to CS medium which has been treated with polymixin beads. Macrophages stimulated with polymyxin bead treated CS medium did not show a significant decrease in the amounts of IL-8 generation (data not shown). The amount of IL-8 release in response to CS medium just varied from 21.6 &#x000b1; 1.02 ng/ml to 19.8 &#x000b1; 3.6 ng/ml when the medium was treated with polymyxin beads demonstrating that the effects of CS is not due to LPS presents in the medium.</p><p>Since CS extract contains many inflammatory stimuli, two well described TLRs, TLR2 and TLR4 which are expressed in human macrophages, were studied. We found that neutralization of TLR4 but not TLR2 inhibits CS medium-induced IL-8 secretion by human macrophages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The discrepancy can be explained by the recent report suggesting that the functional outcomes of signaling via TLR2 or TLR4 are not equivalent and in spite of their shared capacities to activate the same signaling molecules, different TLRs are capable of activating distinct cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The possibility of changes in cellular behavior of macrophages after incubation with TLR4 neutralizing antibody was studied. The amounts of IL-8 release after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin was monitored (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). PMA stimulates PKC and ionomycin increases intracellular calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The cytokine production by human monocyte-derived macrophages is modulated by PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We pretreated the cells with anti-human TLR4 antibody before CS medium exposure and examined the amounts of IL-8 generation. We demonstrated that macrophages produce IL-8 in response to PMA/ionomycin and the amount of IL-8 release is not affected by TLR4 neutralizing antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Indeed, the same levels of IL-8 production by macrophages following PMA/ionomycin stimulation in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody suggest that Anti-TLR4 inhibition of CS-induced IL-8 release is not due to cellular damage but blockade of TLR4. Then, TLR4 and its downstream pathways were studied. TLR4 ligation leads to NF-&#x003ba;B activation and signals via IRAK and TRAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our observations show that the signaling cascade of TLR4 ligation by CS medium involves IRAK-1 phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Additionally, we found that TRAF6 degradation is also involved in the signaling pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Ligation of TLR4 by LPS activates NF-&#x003ba;B and induces production of cytokines in human myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, induced transcriptional activity of NF-&#x003ba;B leads to maximal amount of IL-8 generation (19). We demonstrated increases in phosphorylated I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; levels after CS medium stimulation of macrophages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The proteosome inhibitor MG-132 blocks the degradation of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, an increase in the phospho- I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; level was detected in the CS-treated samples (see lanes cells and cells plus CS). In contrast, the samples pretreated with MG-132 did not show such levels of phospho- I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; upon CS stimulation. Moreover, the degradation of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; is blocked when the cells were exposed to MG-132 (lanes MG-132). The natural product curcumin is a known inhibitor of activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. Involvement of NF-&#x003ba;B in CS-induced IL-8 production was demonstrated when macrophages were treated with NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor curcumin prior to CS medium exposure. Curcumin completely blocked the CS induced IL-8 production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin and its ability to inhibit the immune response upon exposure to a variety of external stimuli may, at least in part, result from inhibition of the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by these external signals, since many of the genes that are implicated in the immune/inflammatory response are up-regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B. For example, curcumin inhibits the LPS-induced production of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; which NF-&#x003ba;B is implicated in these signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. SB 203580 is an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase. Recently, significant advances in the understanding of signaling pathways, which coordinately regulate IL-8 transcription as well as mRNA stabilization in response to external stimuli, have been made. The maximal IL-8 amounts can only be generated if the resulting mRNA, after NF-&#x003ba;B translocation, is rapidly stabilized by the p38 MAPK pathway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Blocking the p38 MAPK pathway by SB203580 decreased the amount of IL-8 generation suggesting that p38 MAPK pathway involves in the maximal amounts of IL-8 production after CS exposure. More studies are needed to demonstrate that whether the role of p38 MAPK pathway is to stabilize IL-8 mRNA after CS stimulation or the pathway at least partially activates NF-&#x003ba;B activation. It has been demonstrated that SB203580 attenuates lysophosphatidic acid-dependent phosphorylation of I-&#x003ba;B, NF-&#x003ba;B and NF-&#x003ba;B transcription in human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These findings suggest that SB203580 by itself might be involved in NF-&#x003ba;B activation. The increases in phosphorylated I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; levels as well as the dramatic decline in amount of IL-8 secretion by NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor (see above) showed that NF-&#x003ba;B activation is involved in the pathways of CS stimulation of human macrophages.</p><p>The five members of the mammalian NF-&#x003ba;B family, p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-&#x003ba;B1), and p52/p100 (NF-&#x003ba;B2), exist in unstimulated cells as homo- or heterodimers bound to I-&#x003ba;B family proteins. NF-&#x003ba;B activation leads to the translocation of thetranscription factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We studied the translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B subunit p65 to the nucleus following CS activation. We detected an increase in p65 level in nuclear protein extracts following CS exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Furthermore, no p65 was detected in the nuclear protein extracts where the cells were pre-treated with anti-TLR4 prior to CS medium stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These findings confirm that CS induces NF-&#x003ba;B translocation to the nucleus and that this can be inhibited by blockade of TLR4.</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented here show that the mechanism underlying IL-8 production by human macrophages after CS medium exposure involves activation of TLR4 specific signaling pathways. It has to be stressed at this point that a secreted TLR2 agonist from different bacterial LPS, induced distinct patterns of cytokine production by macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, we can not rule out the possibility of the ligation of TLR4 by different LPS or bacterial endotoxins present in CS medium. However, these compounds are part of CS extract and must be considered as one of the inflammatory stimuli of CS constitutes which might triggers initial lung inflammation in COPD.</p><p>In our study no analysis done to characterize the chemical nature of the activity present in CS medium. For instance, our CS medium may contain reactive oxygen species (ROS) which activates NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and may regulate immune signaling through TLR4. Further studies are needed to address firstly the presence of ROS in our CS medium preparations and secondly the possible ROS interaction with TLR4 signaling.</p><p>During the preparation of the manuscript, Droemann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] proposed a smoke related change in the phenotype of alveolar macrophages demonstrating a reduced expression of TLR2 in smokers and COPD. Although the alteration is restricted to TLR2 expression but supports the hypothesis that COPD pathogenesis might be associated to stimulation of macrophages through TLRs.</p><p>Peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages are a unique cell type generated in vitro and are an attractive cell model to study the role of macrophages in inflammatory process. However, consideration of how the findings can be linked to the human disease must be given. Indeed, human alveolar macrophages can be employed to further examine the validity of our findings in the context of human disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Increased levels of IL-8 in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD has been demonstrated suggesting that the migration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells from the bronchial wall to the lumen could be increased through IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Our study suggests that in lungs, macrophage-derived IL-8 after TLR engagement may trigger the recruitment of neutrophils and CD8 positive T cells, both the major effector cells in COPD inflammatory process. The clarification of the mechanisms of macrophage activation by CS through this TLR may offer new insight into the treatment of COPD. In conclusion, our observations suggest a cellular mechanism that links smoking with inflammation in COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p><bold>COPD</bold>: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, <bold>CS</bold>: cigarette smoke, <bold>MDM</bold>: Monocyte-derived macrophages, <bold>BAL</bold>: bronchoalveolar lavage, <bold>TLR</bold>: Toll-like receptors, <bold>MFI: </bold>Mean Fluorescence Intensity</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KK conceived of the study, and participated in the design of the study and performed immunoassays, FACS analysis, statistical analysis, and wrote the first draft and final version of the manuscript.
