It generally follows an inflammatory injury and involves an unbalanced repair process characterized by an inappropriate production/degradation of the organic matrix, which leads to abnormal lung architecture and impairment of lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Remodeling involves destruction of basement membranes as well as of elastic fibers, and the exaggerated accumulation of organic extracellular matrices (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. During the fibrogenic process, the pre-existing equilibrium between matrix synthesis and degradation in the healthy lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] is disrupted, leading to an excessive accumulation of ECM. The secretion of growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), together with the modified expression of matrix degrading-related enzymes contribute to the increased production by fibroblasts and pulmonary accumulation of ECM, such as collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) have been extensively studied for their role in ECM turnover in the lung and other organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Several MMPs were found to be abnormally regulated in human fibrotic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and rodent models of fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although the expression of most MMPs was observed to be increased in fibrotic lungs, the expression of collagenases (MMP-1, 8, 13) appears to depend on the model or type of pathogenesis studied and the stage of the disease. The simultaneously increased expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) led several authors to suggest that an imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs occurring during fibrogenesis could lead to abnormal lung remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Despite clues pointing to MMPs/TIMPs as important players in the control of fibrosis, none of them has been shown so far to exert a protective function in this process <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Since they have also been involved in the turnover/degradation of ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], lysosomal cysteine proteases could also apply to play a role in the development of lung fibrosis. One of them, cathepsin K (Cat K), is the most potent mammalian collagenase compared to other cysteine proteases (Cat B, L and S) and MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Cat K plays a pivotal role in bone remodeling. Indeed, mutations in the Cat K gene were found to be responsible of pycnodysostosis in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and of a similar bone phenotype in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In a murine model of lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin, this cathepsin was found to be induced in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently, it was suggested to exert a protective role against matrix deposition during pulmonary fibrosis, since lungs of Cat K deficient mice accumulated more collagen than wild type animals in response to bleomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this work was to identify lysosomal cysteine proteases potentially important in the development of pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model induced by the instillation of crystalline silica particles. Our study revealed that Cat K transcripts are highly increased in the lungs after silica treatment compared to Cat S, L and B and that this upregulation is specific to the fibrotic process. We also compared Cat K expression in "fibrosis-prone" and "fibrosis-resistant" mouse strains, and identified cells responsible for Cat K upregulation in the silicotic lung. Finally, the regulation of Cat K expression by growth factors involved in the inflammatory and/or fibrotic reactions was studied <italic>in vitro </italic>in both mouse and human fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and instillation method</title><p>C57BL/6 and BALB/c female mice were obtained from the local breeding facility of the Ludwig Institute (Brussels, Belgium).

C57BL/6 mice were instilled with 2.5 mg silica particles or PBS (control) and their lungs were collected after several time periods. We chose to concentrate on three time points representative of different stages of the silicotic disease in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The early inflammatory reaction was monitored 3 days after instillation, the interface between the inflammatory and the fibrotic process after 1 month, and the established fibrosis at 2 months, as demonstrated later by the accumulation of collagen in the lung. The establishment of fibrosis in silica-treated mice was assessed by measuring lung OH-proline content, which reflects collagen deposition. We and others have shown the good correlation between this marker and histological fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Two months after administration of silica particles, collagen significantly accumulated in silicotic lungs to levels twice that of healthy lungs (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

TGF-&#x003b2; is thought to play a role in the differences of sensitivity in response to fibrosing agents because it was found to be more expressed in sensitive than in resistant mouse strains treated with bleomycin or irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We measured TGF-&#x003b2; lung content in response to silica to verify this hypothesis. One month after instillation, i.e. at the onset of the establishment of fibrosis, total TGF-&#x003b2;1 level was found to be significantly increased in C57BL/6 silicotic lungs compared to control lungs and TGF-&#x003b2;1 lung content in BALB/c mice remained unchanged (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). No significant differences were observed between control and treated mice 3 days and 2 months after instillation (data not shown). Interestingly, Cat K transcripts were differentially upregulated upon silica treatment in C57BL/6 and BALB/c lungs. Although Cat K mRNA levels at 1 and 2 months were increased in both strains in response to silica, the overexpression was significantly higher in resistant BALB/c mice than in sensitive C57BL/6 mice (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). No such difference between the both strains was observed after saline treatment (control situations) or 3 days after silica treatment. We concluded that pulmonary collagen contents and Cat K expression levels were inversely associated in this murine model of lung fibrosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Cat K is more strongly upregulated in response to silica in "fibrosis-resistant" than in "fibrosis-prone" mice.

To determine which cells are responsible for the increase of Cat K mRNA in the lung, we studied the expression of this cathepsin in BAL leukocytes and fibroblasts from control and silica-instilled C57BL/6 mice. Cat K was found to be upregulated in BAL leukocytes collected 3 days and 1 month after instillation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To further identify Cat K producing cells, lung macrophages were separated from other inflammatory cells by adherence. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> revealed that at 1 month adherent silicotic macrophages overexpress Cat K in comparison to adherent control macrophages, indicating that pulmonary macrophages are, at least in part, responsible for the Cat K upregulation.

Moreover, TGF-&#x003b2;1 was also able to downregulate Cat K in lung fibroblasts purified from mice 2 months after silica instillation, i.e. at the fibrotic stage of the disease (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

While several mechanisms and mediators responsible for the stimulation or inhibition of matrix production have been widely studied, little information exists on the implication of proteases in the limitation of matrix accumulation in the fibrotic lung. In this study, we used a model of silica-induced lung fibrosis to screen the expression of four lysosomal cysteine proteases known for their collagenolytic activities in order to identify cathepsin(s) potentially important in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Quantitative analysis of the cathepsin transcripts revealed Cat K as the most strongly upregulated protease in response to silica compared to Cat S, L and B. Several clues indicate that the overexpression of Cat K is intimately related to the fibrogenic process. First, the increased Cat K mRNA content in the lung of silica-treated mice was maximal after 1 month, i.e. when extracellular matrices start to accumulate, and remained elevated when fibrosis was clearly established (after 2 months). In the resolutive model of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, Cat K overexpression also slightly preceded collagen accumulation but returned to its basal level when the lung collagen content started to decrease (unpublished observation). These results show that Cat K expression is apparently modulated in parallel with collagen accumulation. Secondly, while silica particles induced a strong upregulation of Cat K in the lung, instillation of inert (WC) or inflammatory (MnO<sub>2</sub>) particles had no or little effect on its expression. These data, together with the fact that Cat K is also upregulated in patients suffering from different interstitial lung diseases and in mice instilled with bleomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], support a particular role of Cat K in lung fibrotic diseases with various origins.</p><p>Two months after silica instillation, homogenates of silicotic lungs were shown to have a much higher Cat K activity than control lungs. This indicates that, despite the presence of endogenous cathepsin inhibitors in the cytoplasm of most cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], it is possible to measure changes in Cat K activity in this kind of sample. It also shows that pulmonary overexpression of Cat K transcripts correlates with an increase of its activity in lung homogenates 2 months after instillation, which corresponds to the maximal collagen accumulation.</p><p>We further characterized the contribution of Cat K in the development of lung fibrosis in the silica model by investigating its expression in "fibrosis-resistant" and "fibrosis-prone" mouse strains. We found higher levels of Cat K transcripts in the lungs of resistant (BALB/c) than sensitive (C57BL/6) mice in response to silica particles. These observations indicate that a high level of Cat K expression is associated with a low fibrotic response in the present model. Overall, our data, together with the fact that mice deficient for Cat K developed significantly more fibrosis than wild type counterparts after bleomycin instillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], indicate that Cat K might play a protective role in silica-induced lung fibrosis. This also illustrates that, during pulmonary fibrosis, not only profibrotic but also antifibrotic factors can be (over)produced and that fibrosis results from the inappropriate balance between these.</p><p>In bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, qualitative immunostaining of lung sections have shown epithelial cells, macrophages and fibroblasts as Cat K producing cells while normal lungs expressed Cat K in epithelial cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The same authors also showed that lung fibroblasts were the main contributors of Cat K overexpression in fibrotic human lungs. In silica-induced lung fibrosis, alveolar macrophages contribute to the installation of a chronic inflammation by producing several mediators leading to the recruitment and activation of other inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Lung fibroblasts locate more downstream of the process by mainly overproducing components of the ECM, resulting in the excessive accumulation of ECM in the lung parenchyma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Because of their central role in the induction of a fibrotic response induced by silica, Cat K expression was examined in these cell types. Both alveolar macrophages and lung fibroblasts were found to contribute to the overexpression of Cat K in silicotic lungs.</p><p>We confirm the overexpression of Cat K by fibrotic fibroblasts and suggest the macrophage as another overproducing cell in murine silicotic lungs. We can, however, not exclude that epithelial cells also contribute to the increased expression of Cat K in the lungs of these mice.</p><p>To identify regulators of Cat K expression, we tested the influence of several mediators involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. We mainly concentrated our <italic>in vitro </italic>study on fibroblasts because this cell type has been found to overexpress Cat K in both human and mouse fibrotic lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is already well established that several factors, such as cytokines, can modify the expression or the secretion of cathepsins <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. We chose to test cytokines and factors known for their different activities on the development of lung fibrosis: proinflammatory (IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;), profibrotic (IL-4 and TGF-&#x003b2;) and antifibrotic mediators (IL-9 and PGE-2). None of the molecules tested <italic>in vitro </italic>could reproduce the overexpression of Cat K observed in the lungs of silica-treated mice. Some proteases are known to be upregulated by components of the organic extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Fibronectin but not type I collagen has been found to increase Cat K mRNA expression in osteoclasts cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Studies have shown that fibronectin starts to be overproduced earlier than collagen in the fibrotic process both in human fibrosis and mouse models of silica- and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to postulate that fibronectin or other components of the ECM could contribute to the upregulation of Cat K <italic>in vivo</italic>. The fact that two important proinflammatory cytokines did not modify Cat K expression and that inflammatory particles (MnO<sub>2</sub>) had only little effect on its expression compared to fibrogenic particles (silica), suggests that the inflammatory response induced by the instillation of silica probably plays a limited role in the induction of Cat K.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; is able to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and expression of ECM proteins by these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It has also been shown to stimulate the production of the protease inhibitor TIMP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and to downregulate some proteases, such as MMP-1, Cat B and L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. We show for the first time that the expression of a highly collagenolytic protease, Cat K, is repressed by this growth factor in collagen overproducing cells, i.e. fibrotic fibroblasts. The fact that TGF-&#x003b2; reduced Cat K expression in both control and silicotic mouse fibroblasts, as well as in human pulmonary fibroblasts suggests similar modes of regulation. Interestingly, although it has been shown that TGF-&#x003b2; represses Cat K expression in monocyte-derived osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], we did not find a similar effect on alveolar macrophages, although these cells seem to express both TGF-&#x003b2; receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. This might imply different TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways in both cell types.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; has been detected in several forms of lung fibrosis. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, TGF-&#x003b2; located to activated foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Similarly, in silicosis, this growth factor was found to co-localize with silicotic granulomas both in rodents and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. We could therefore speculate that the presence of TGF-&#x003b2; at sites of high collagen production could repress the expression of Cat K by fibroblasts, limiting its potential antifibrotic activity. One argument in favor of this hypothesis is the stronger accumulation of Cat K transcripts in "fibrosis-resistant" BALB/c mice than in "fibrosis-prone" C57BL/6 mice in silica-instilled animals. Although the exact reasons for this difference in the fibrotic response between these two strains are still unclear, some evidence point to TGF-&#x003b2; as a key player in this phenomenon. First, because of its well-characterized profibrotic activity already mentioned. Secondly, we showed that TGF-&#x003b2; content increased in response to silica in the lungs of C57BL/6 but not BALB/c mice, confirming that TGF-&#x003b2; is more expressed in fibrosis-sensitive mouse strains than in fibrosis-resistant strains in response to fibrogenic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Overall, these observations suggest that Cat K might be one of the downstream targets of TGF-&#x003b2; that could account for the difference of strain sensitivity, as it was recently proposed for TIMP-1 and the connective tissue growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that the most potent collagenolytic mammalian protease, Cat K, is upregulated during a fibrotic process induced by the instillation of crystalline silica particles in mice.
