An abundant enzyme expressed in all cells, complex regulation of PP1 is thought to be essential for proper temporal and spatial regulation of PP1 catalytic activity towards individual substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Three different isotypes of the catalytic subunit, designated PP1&#x003b1;, PP1&#x003b4;, and PP1&#x003b3;1, are expressed in many different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Studies employing many eukaryotic systems all point to a crucial role for PP1 activity in controlling cell cycle progression, and an absolute requirement of this activity for mitotic exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There is also evidence to suggest that phosphorylation of PP1 and its associated proteins by the cyclin-dependent kinases may regulate PP1 activity in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Hence, current efforts are directed towards identification of cell cycle-dependent substrates for PP1, and how regulation of PP1 activity towards these substrates controls the cell division cycle.</p><p>One physiological substrate for PP1 appears to be the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, pRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], a demonstrated tumor suppressor. The cell growth and tumor suppressive activity of pRB is regulated by its phosphorylation state. pRB phosphorylation varies as a function of cell cycle phase; during G<sub>1 </sub>the hypophosphorylated form predominates, while the hyperphosphorylated form accumulates during S, G<sub>2 </sub>and M phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is this hypophosphorylated form of pRB present during early and mid G<sub>1 </sub>which functions to modify gene expression. This is achieved by complexing with transcription factors resulting in repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] of transcription. Under conditions favoring proliferation, the phosphorylation of pRB via cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in mid-to-late G<sub>1 </sub>phase results in liberation of E2F and other pRB-bound transcription factors, which then activate the transcription of S-phase genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In late M phase, pRB returns to its growth suppressive, hypophosphorylated form due to the action of a pRB-directed protein phosphatase belonging to the type 1 class of serine/threonine protein phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Of critical importance is the question of the <italic>in vivo </italic>effect of PP1 activity on pRB and growth regulation. To date, several techniques have been employed in this regard to demonstrate PP1 actions in intact cells. Berndt et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] used electroporation to introduce PP1 protein into tissue culture cells having noted that previous genetic attempts to accomplish overexpression were not readily accomplished. Using this technique, they showed a G1 block by PP1 that was dependent upon the presence of pRB. In another report, micro-injection of PP1 decreased extractability of pRB from nuclei, presumably by increasing dephosphorylation and increasing association with nuclear proteins thereby playing a role in G1/S transition inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Micro-injection of antibodies to the PP1 catalytic subunit has been shown to block cells in metaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Since this is the time during mitosis when pRB is normally dephosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that prevention of pRB dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP1 activity impedes an orderly progression through mitosis, perhaps contributing towards a transformed phenotype.</p><p>Here, using the tetracycline induction system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we developed an inducible PP1 expression system to investigate the regulation of PP1 activity. We view this as a first step towards addressing the question of the <italic>in vivo </italic>effect of PP1 activity on pRB and growth regulation. Our results support the notion that induced PP1&#x003b1; protein functions identically to endogenous PP1&#x003b1; with respect to non-catalytic subunit binding and activity towards phosphorylase <italic>a </italic>and the tumor suppressor pRB. Localization of this protein to the nucleus also mirrors that of endogenous PP1&#x003b1; <italic>in vivo</italic>. When using this system to forcibly overexpress 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;, there is a concomitant decrease in endogenous PP1&#x003b1; levels, suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism by which PP1&#x003b1; protein levels remain constant. RT-PCR analyses of isolated polysome fractions supports the notion that this putative autoregulatory mechanism is exerted, at least in part, at the translational level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Induction of 6His-HA-PP1 in LLW02F cells</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows construct of the tetracycline-inducible plasmid used to express 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, 24 hr incubation with doxycycline in the medium has no appreciable effect on endogenous PP1&#x003b1; protein expression in the untransfected parent cell line (UMUC3) or a cell line transfected with the reverse tetracycline transactivator plasmid pUHD172-1neo only (LLWO1). A time course of induction by doxycycline was then carried out in stable clone LLWO2F. Harvested at various time intervals, whole-cell lysates were prepared and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for western blotting using antibody to the hemagglutinin tag. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, a protein with the anticipated molecular weight of 40 kDa was detected. A clear differential of expression of 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; (indicated at the left of the panel) was observed at 1.5 hours after addition of doxycycline, which became more pronounced at later time points. The doxycycline-independent increase in 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; is attributed to background expression when using this system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As predicted for a protein under the control of the doxycycline-inducible promoter, the abundance of 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; decreases in the absence of the inducer over time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Subsequent time course experiments revealed peak abundance occurring between 16 and 24 hr, and remaining constant thereafter for at least 72 hr, at which time the experiment was terminated. As such, we have chosen the 24 hr induction time for all subsequent experiments to ensure peak abundance of the induced 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;-pTEP4m plasmid.

This reduction continued through the 24 hr time point at which time the experiment ended. Taken together, these data confirm the dependence of 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; protein production on the tet-O/CMV promoter, thus demonstrating inducible expression of PP1&#x003b1;.

Thus, not only can doxycycline-induced expression of PP1&#x003b1; be detected immunohistochemically, but localization of this protein appears to be identical to that of endogenous PP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Immunohistochemistry with the antibody to hemagglutinin shows doxycycline-dependent expression of 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; <italic>in vivo</italic>.

To further investigate the properties of inducible PP1&#x003b1;, we performed coprecipitation studies to determine if PNUTS can also be found associated with 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;. Towards this goal, a fusion protein of GST and PNUTS was tested for the ability to capture induced PP1&#x003b1;. Lysates from induced LLWO2F cells were combined with GST-alone- or GST-PNUTS-loaded glutathione Sepharose beads. Following separation by SDS-PAGE and western blotting, antibody to hemagglutinin was used to detect any associated 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;. Antibody reactivity would indicate a link from the GST epitope to the hemagglutinin epitope via a PNUTS to PP1&#x003b1; interaction. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the hemagglutinin epitope was captured by the GST-PNUTS fusion protein, but not the GST-alone protein. These data support the idea that induced PP1&#x003b1; and the nuclear targeting PP1-associated protein PNUTS can form a complex. These results further support the view that induced PP1&#x003b1; behaves similarly if not identically to endogenous PP1&#x003b1;, and provides a possible mechanistic explanation for 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; localization to the nucleus.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Coprecipitation of 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; with GST-PNUTS.

First, immunocomplexed 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; was tested for its ability to dephosphorylate phosphorylase <italic>a</italic>. Phosphorylated on a single serine residue, this substrate is often used to monitor the biochemical activity of PP1 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, greater phosphatase activity is detected in immunoprecipitates from induced LLWO2F cell lysates compared to uninduced. This is consistent with the notion that inducible PP1&#x003b1; is enzymatically active. Our second approach involved testing immunopurified 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; for its ability to dephosphorylate the growth suppressor protein pRB. Having previously reported on the ability of immunocomplexed endogenous PP1 to dephosphorylate pRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we followed the same experimental approach. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> shows a significant decrease in the <sup>32</sup>P radiolabel intensity for pRB following incubation with the anti-hemagglutinin immunoprecipitate compared to the normal mouse IgG control immunoprecipitate. In addition, okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], significantly inhibits pRB dephosphorylation in this reaction. Taken together, these data indicate that inducible PP1&#x003b1; is biochemically active.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Dephosphorylation of phosphorylase <italic>a </italic>by anti-hemagglutinin immunoprecipitates from uninduced (Control) and induced (Doxycycline) LLW02 cells.

To address this, we tested the phosphatase activity of LLWO2F whole-cell lysate using phosphorylase <italic>a </italic>as the substrate. To inhibit any endogenous PP2A activity, which can also dephosphorylate phosphorylase <italic>a </italic>and thus interfere with PP1 activity measurements, these assays were carried out in the presence of 5 nM okadaic acid, which does not inhibit PP1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although reproducible, we observed only modest increases in PP1-specific activity found in lysates from induced cells compared to the uninduced controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). One possible explanation for this finding is that the overall level of PP1&#x003b1; within the cell remains relatively constant regardless of induction. Indeed, a time course of induction followed by western blotting of whole cell lysates using antibody to PP1&#x003b1; revealed diminution of the endogenous PP1&#x003b1; signal after 4 hr of induction, while the 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; signal increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). To further test this hypothesis, immunoprecipitation and western blotting experiments were carried out using PP1 isoform-specific antibodies. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, top panel, induced (approximate molecular weight of 40 kDa) and endogenous (approximate molecular weight of 37 kDa) PP1&#x003b1; are clearly resolved by SDS-PAGE. As predicted, both proteins are recognized by antibody specific for PP1&#x003b1; when performing immunoprecipitation or western blotting. Immunoprecipitation using PP1&#x003b1; antibody followed by western blotting using the same anti-PP1&#x003b1; reveals a reciprocal relationship in PP1&#x003b1; abundance following doxycycline induction; endogenous PP1&#x003b1; levels decrease in response to increasing levels of 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; (top panel, compare left two lanes). This difference in abundance is more striking in the whole-cell lysate lanes; endogenous PP1&#x003b1; fails to be detected in lysates prepared from induced cells (compare middle two lanes). Parallel experiments performed using the same lysate and antibody to hemagglutinin for immunoprecipitation and western blotting show the position of 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; and the fact that endogenous PP1&#x003b1; is not recognized by this antibody (bottom panel). Western blotting for additional isoforms of PP1 reveals that this reduction in PP1&#x003b1; following induction is isotype-specific; when 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; levels increase, concomitant with a decrease in PP1&#x003b1; levels, PP1&#x003b4; and PP1&#x003b3;1 levels remain relatively unchanged from those found in uninduced cell lysate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that an as yet undescribed negative-feedback or autoregulatory mechanism exists for PP1&#x003b1; which contributes towards maintaining a constant level of protein expression and enzyme activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>PP1 activity in lysates of cells expressing 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;.

This protein behaves similarly if not identically to endogenous PP1&#x003b1; with respect to nuclear localization, complex formation to a recently described PP1-associated nuclear targeting protein, and <italic>in vitro </italic>enzymatic activity towards phosphorylase <italic>a </italic>and the cell growth and tumor suppressor protein pRB.</p><p>We observed that endogenous PP1&#x003b1; protein levels decrease in response to increasing levels of induced 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; protein. This observation suggests that an as yet undescribed negative-feedback or autoregulatory mechanism exists for PP1&#x003b1; which contributes towards maintaining a constant level of this enzyme. Given the difficulty in achieving overexpression of PP1 protein and activity in mammalian cells, this suggestion provides an attractive explanation. This putative mechanism appears to be isotype-specific, since the protein levels of PP1&#x003b4; and PP1&#x003b3;1 remained relatively unchanged in response to induced expression of PP1&#x003b1;. Precedent for an autoregulatory mechanism comes from a report by Baharians and Schonthal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], in which they demonstrate endogenous PP2A protein levels decrease in the presence of increasing amounts of forcibly-expressed exogenous PP2A. Their report also provides evidence that this control is exerted at the translational level and does not involve regulation of transcription or RNA processing. Using a similar approach of analyzing mRNA association with ribosomes as a measure of translation efficiency, a similar level of translational control also appears to exist for PP1&#x003b1;. If mRNA association with ribosomes is truly a measure of translation efficiency, one conclusion from these data is that in doxycycline-induced cells, 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; RNA is more efficiently translated than endogenous PP1&#x003b1;. This would help to explain why we observed a decrease in endogenous PP1&#x003b1; protein expression in doxycycline-induced cells. Since we did not perform rigorous analyses on PP1&#x003b1; regulation of transcription or RNA processing, we cannot rule out the possibility that some level of transcriptional control also exists. Indeed, the abundance of endogenous PP1&#x003b1; RNA found in uninduced cells appears equal to or greater than the combined abundance of endogenous and 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1; RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), supporting the notion that some level of translational control may also exist.</p><p>These findings, provided by the development of this inducible PP1 expression system, will afford new research opportunities aimed towards addressing the question of how PP1 activity is regulated. This putative autoregulatory mechanism for the catalytic subunit may help to explain why the overall abundance of PP1 during the various phases of the cell cycle remains relatively constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Historically, regulation of PP1 catalytic activity has resulted from associated subunits inhibiting or targeting the catalytic subunit towards substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. While the PP1 catalytic subunit is not found alone in the cell, such unassociated catalytic subunits have been shown to be active, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although speculative, there may be a threshold amount of catalytic subunit <italic>in vivo </italic>above which associated proteins are limiting. Such a situation may compromise the ability of associated proteins to effectively regulate PP1 catalytic activity. To guard against this scenario, control over the amount of PP1 catalytic subunit present via an autoregulatory mechanism would be beneficial.</p><p>The data presented here validate a useful system with which to manipulate PP1 activity <italic>in vivo </italic>for the purpose of functional studies. Just as is the case for PP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], it seems clear that efficient overall increases in PP1 protein abundance may not be achieved due to a putative negative feed-back or autoregulatory mechanism. However, induced expression of exogenous PP1 which behaves identically to endogenous PP1 while remaining physically distinguishable can facilitate the use of mutants to address functional questions, particularly in the area of cell cycle regulation and tumor cell growth suppression. Indeed, the use of a constitutively active mutant of PP1 has already been shown to result in pRB-dependent G1 arrest in human cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Placing this mutant into the inducible expression system described here has the potential to down-regulate expression of wild-type endogenous PP1. Doing so in a timed, controlled manner will permit <italic>in vivo </italic>studies addressing PP1 function during discrete phases of the cell cycle, and will be the subject of future endeavors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tetracycline Induction System</title><p>The rabbit PP1&#x003b1; cDNA in pDR540 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] was ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to create a fusion encoding 6 histidines (6-His) followed by an epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from the <italic>Hemophilus influenza </italic>hemagglutinin protein (HA). The sequence and reading frame was validated by BigDye DNA sequencing (PE Applied Biosystems). The fusion gene was then cut from the 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;-pcDNA3 plasmid and ligated into pTEP4m, which contains a tetracycline response element for inducible expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and a hygromycin resistance gene for selection in eukaryotic cells (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). pUHD172-1neo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] encodes the reverse tetracycline transactivator protein fused with a nuclear localization signal (rtTA-nls).

The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 units/ml penicillin and 20 ug/ml streptomycin.

This mixture was diluted to 1 ml with Opti-mem and applied to cells in one well of 6-well tissue culture plates. After two hours, 1 ml of complete medium was added to each well. After twenty-four hours the medium was replaced with complete medium.</p><p>Transfection of UMUC3 cells with pUHD172-1neo was followed 48 hr later by selection using geneticin. Isolated colonies were obtained at 800 &#x003bc;g/ml. These cells were passaged and expanded before transfection with pBI-EGFP (Clontech), which contains the enhanced green fluorescent protein coding sequence under control of a bi-directional tetracycline response element. At the end of the 2 hr transfection (as described above) the medium was replaced with complete medium with and without doxycycline at 1 ug/ml final concentration. 24 hr later the cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. The presence of doxycycline dependent green fluorescence was indicative of stable transfection with pUHD172-1neo encoding the rtTA-nls protein and transient transfection with pBi-EGFP. Parallel cultures were then passaged and transfected with 6His-HA-PP1&#x003b1;-pTEP4m. Selection with hygromycin was begun 48 hr later. Isolated colonies were obtained at 100 ug/ml hygromycin and were passaged and diluted to extinction. Six cell lines, designated LLW02A through LLW02F, were established. The LLW02F cell line was used for all subsequent experiments. This choice was based on high levels of induced PP1&#x003b1; expression as assayed by immunoblotting.
