We show here that the MAPK downstream nuclear kinase MSK1 induces NF-&#x003ba;B p65 Ser276 phosphorylation upon IL-1&#x000df; treatment, which was inhibited in cells transfected with a MSK1 kinase-dead (KD) mutant compared to the WT control. In addition, we show by ChIP experiments that MSK1 as well as MAPK inhibition abolishes binding of p65, of its coactivator CBP, and of MSK1 itself to the &#x003ba;B intronic enhancer site of the SCF gene. We show that interaction between NF-&#x003ba;B and CBP is prevented in cells transfected by a p65 S276C mutant. Finally, we demonstrate that both transfections of MSK1-KD and MSK1 siRNA - but not the WT MSK1 or control siRNA - downregulate the expression of SCF induced by IL-1&#x000df;. Our study provides therefore a direct link between MSK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ser276 p65 of NF-&#x003ba;B, allowing its binding to the SCF intronic enhancer, and pathophysiological SCF expression in inflammation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) family is composed of homodimers and heterodimers of the Rel family proteins, including p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, p52 and p50 (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). The most abundant form of NF-&#x003ba;B is a heterodimer with two subunits: one p50 and one p65. NF-&#x003ba;B is bound to inhibitory I&#x003ba;B proteins in the cytoplasm. After stimulation by a variety of stimuli, NF-&#x003ba;B is released and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to its coactivators, mainly CBP (CREB-Binding Protein), and activates expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including the mast cell growth factor stem cell factor (SCF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-DaSilva1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is activated by phosphorylation, which plays a key role in the regulation of its transcriptional activity, and is associated with nuclear translocation, CBP recruitment and DNA-binding activity (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Chen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>).

To do so, we used the SCF gene, to which p65 binds in cells stimulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x000df;.

The first important finding of the present study is that this &#x003ba;B intronic enhancer site is occupied by NF-&#x003ba;B and its coactivator CBP upon IL-1&#x003b2;-treatment of primary human lung fibroblasts, and that MSK1 also co-immunoprecipitates at this site. This suggests formation of a transcription complex involving MSK1 at the SCF &#x003ba;B enhancer site in inflammatory conditions.

However, inhibition of p38 and ERK MAP kinases had no effect on p65 Ser536 phosphorylation.

The possibility that PKAc might phosphorylate p65 at Ser276 cannot totally be ruled out by our studies, since H89 also inhibits PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Davies1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason, we ascertained the role of MSK1 by transfection of a kinase-dead mutant of MSK1 (MSK1 KD), inducing inhibition of Ser276 phosphorylation in response to IL-1&#x003b2;, showing an important reduction (63&#x00025;) taking into account the transfection efficiency (70&#x00025;, data not shown) and the competition obtained (MSK1 KD <italic>vs</italic> endogenous MSK1).</p><p>Phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 (as well as the analogous site in c-Rel) is reported to disrupt the interaction between its C-terminal and N-terminal regions, thus unmasking an interaction site with the histone acetyl transferase CBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Zhong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Mosialos1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that p65-CBP interaction is directly dependent upon prior p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 by MSK1. This result conforts the finding that acetylation of p65 at Lys310 by CBP is secondary to Ser276 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Chen2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. This acetylation of p65 enhances its DNA-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Chen3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, acetylation of p50 and p52 by CBP is linked to DNA-binding at the iNOS and COX-2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Deng1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Deng2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Deng3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus we may postulate that NF-&#x003ba;B and CBP interaction with the SCF intronic enhancer is a direct consequence of Ser276 phosphorylation. This is parallel to reports that phosphorylation at Ser337 of the p50 subunit also controls DNA binding of p50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Hou1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Guan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, site-specific phosphorylation is reported to target NF-&#x003ba;B to a particular subset of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Anrather1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, S276A mutation of p65 inhibits a reporter gene harboring an IL-6-derived &#x003ba;B site (<named-content content-type="gene">GGGATTTTCC</named-content>), while it has no effect when a palindromic &#x003ba;B site derived from the p52/p100 promoter (<named-content content-type="gene">GGGAATTCCC</named-content>) is concerned. We here report that the <named-content content-type="gene">GGGAGCTCCC</named-content> &#x003ba;B site of the SCF gene is also dependent upon Ser276 p65 phosphorylation, and that this determines NF-&#x003ba;B binding.</p><p>MSK1 also promotes phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Thomson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Soloaga1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, depending on the gene, cell type and stimulus. We asked the question of the role of such MSK1-mediated chromatin modification in p65 DNA binding to the SCF gene, that would therefore affect the accessibility of the &#x003ba;B site. However, ChIP experiments show the absence of modification of H3 Ser10 phosphorylation when MSK1 or its upstream MAPK are inhibited. Since Duncan and collaborators also reported MSK1 not to phosphorylate histone H3 after TNF&#x003b1; treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004393-Duncan1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, we may submit that histone H3 phosphorylation is independent of the MSK1 pathway in inflammation. MSK1-mediated control of p65 binding to the SCF intronic enhancer is thus more likely to be due to Ser276 phosphorylation rather than chromatin remodelling.</p><p>Confirming this hypothesis, we finally demonstrate the direct involvement of MSK1-mediated p65 Ser276 phosphorylation in SCF expression. First, blocking the action of MSK1 by either a kinase-dead MSK1 mutant plasmid or anti-MSK1 siRNA leads to inhibition of IL-1&#x000df;-induced SCF expression. Second, SCF production is inhibited by mutation of the Ser276 to Cys. Both serve as the final demonstration that this Ser276 phosphorylation by MSK1 is a necessary requisite for SCF expression in inflammation.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose a model according to which MSK1 interacts with the enhanceosome and mediates both the binding of NF-&#x003ba;B to the SCF intronic enhancer and its interaction with its coactivator CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004393-g005">Figure 5</xref>). MSK1 may therefore be an interesting therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases, in view of its central role in NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><fig id="pone-0004393-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004393.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Pathway leading to SCF expression in primary human lung fibroblasts upon IL-1&#x003b2; treatment.</title><p>After treatment with IL-1&#x003b2;, both p38 and ERK MAPK activate MSK1 which phosphorylates nuclear p65 at Ser276.
