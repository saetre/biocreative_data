Previous studies have shown that tumorous tissues have higher 5&#x003b1;-reductase (5&#x003b1;R) and lower 3&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (3&#x003b1;-HSO) and 20&#x003b1;-HSO activities. The resulting higher levels of 5&#x003b1;-reduced progesterone metabolites such as 5&#x003b1;-pregnane-3,20-dione (5&#x003b1;P) in tumorous tissue promote cell proliferation and detachment, whereas the 4-pregnene metabolites, 4-pregnen-3&#x003b1;-ol-20-one (3&#x003b1;HP) and 4-pregnen-20&#x003b1;-ol-3-one (20&#x003b1;DHP), more prominent in normal tissue, have the opposite (anti-cancer-like) effects. The aim of this study was to determine if the differences in enzyme activities between tumorous and nontumorous breast tissues are associated with differences in progesterone metabolizing enzyme gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to compare relative expression (as a ratio of 18S rRNA) of 5&#x003b1;R type 1 (<italic>SRD5A1</italic>), 5&#x003b1;R type 2 (<italic>SRD5A2</italic>), 3&#x003b1;-HSO type 2 (<italic>AKR1C3</italic>), 3&#x003b1;-HSO type 3 (<italic>AKR1C2</italic>) and 20&#x003b1;-HSO (<italic>AKR1C1</italic>) mRNAs in paired (tumorous and nontumorous) breast tissues from 11 patients, and unpaired tumor tissues from 17 patients and normal tissues from 10 reduction mammoplasty samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Expression of 5&#x003b1;R1 and 5&#x003b1;R2 in 11/11 patients was higher (mean of 4.9- and 3.5-fold, respectively; p &#x0003c; 0.001) in the tumor as compared to the paired normal tissues. Conversely, expression of 3&#x003b1;-HSO2, 3&#x003b1;-HSO3 and 20&#x003b1;-HSO was higher (2.8-, 3.9- and 4.4-fold, respectively; p &#x0003c; 0.001) in normal than in tumor sample. The mean tumor:normal expression ratios for 5&#x003b1;R1 and 5&#x003b1;R2 were about 35&#x02013;85-fold higher than the tumor:normal expression ratios for the HSOs.

Expression of SRD5A1 (5&#x003b1;R1) and SRD5A2 (5&#x003b1;R2) is elevated, and expression of AKR1C1 (20&#x003b1;-HSO), AKR1C2 (3&#x003b1;-HSO3) and AKR1C3 (3&#x003b1;-HSO2) is reduced in tumorous as compared to normal breast tissue. The changes in progesterone metabolizing enzyme expression levels help to explain the increases in mitogen/metastasis inducing 5&#x003b1;P and decreases in mitogen/metastasis inhibiting 3&#x003b1;HP progesterone metabolites found in breast tumor tissues. Understanding what causes these changes in expression could help in designing protocols to prevent or reverse the changes in progesterone metabolism associated with breast cancer.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>In vitro </italic>metabolism studies have shown that mammary tissue from mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], cat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] can convert progesterone to metabolites whose formation requires the action of the enzymes, 5&#x003b1;-reductase (5&#x003b1;R), 3&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (3&#x003b1;-HSO) and 20&#x003b1;-HSO. Differences between normal and tumor mammary gland tissues in the progesterone metabolizing enzyme (PME) activities have been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our recent observations indicate that 5&#x003b1;-reduced metabolites (5&#x003b1;-pregnanes) are produced at a significantly higher rate in tumorous than in nontumorous human breast tissue, indicating increased 5&#x003b1;R activity in the carcinoma. Conversely, the activities of 3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO were higher in histologically non-tumorous breast tissues which produce more &#x003b4;-4-pregnenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>These observations are of particular interest because the 5&#x003b1;-pregnanes and 4-pregnenes have been demonstrated to exhibit opposing effects associated with breast neoplasia. Specifically, exposure of human breast cell lines to 5&#x003b1;-pregnanes results in increased proliferation and decreased attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], depolymerization of F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and decreases in adhesion plaque-associated vinculin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, exposure to the 4-pregnenes results, in general, in opposite (anti-cancer-like) effects by causing suppression of cell proliferation and detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additionally, specific high-affinity receptors for the 5&#x003b1;-pregnane, 5&#x003b1;-pregnane-3,20-dione (5&#x003b1;P) and the 4-pregnene, 3&#x003b1;-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3&#x003b1;HP), have been identified in the plasma membrane fractions but not in the intracellular compartments of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The plasma membrane-associated 5&#x003b1;P and 3&#x003b1;HP receptors are distinct from each other and from the classical intracellular androgen, estrogen, progesterone and corticosteroid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These results suggest important and distinct cancer regulating functions for endogenous progesterone metabolites and emphasize a potentially prominent role for the PMEs expressed in breast tissues.</p><p>We have recently also shown that 5&#x003b1;-reductase activity is higher, whereas 3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO activities are lower in the tumorigenic cell lines, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and T-47D, than in the nontumorigenic, MCF-10A, cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The differences in enzyme activities between the tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines are correlated with differences in levels of mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] of 5&#x003b1;-reductase type 1 (5&#x003b1;R1; <italic>SRD5A1</italic>), 20&#x003b1;-HSO (<italic>AKR1C1</italic>), 3&#x003b1;-HSO type 2 (3&#x003b1;-HSO2; <italic>AKR1C3</italic>) and 3&#x003b1;-HSO type 3 (3&#x003b1;-HSO3; <italic>AKR1C2</italic>). A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] also noted that 3&#x003b1;-HSO type 3 (AKR1C2) mRNA expression is lower in prostatic adenocarcinoma than in normal human prostate tissue.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest important autocrine/paracrine cancer regulating functions for progesterone metabolites and suggest regulatory roles for 5&#x003b1;R, 3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO activities in human breast cancer progression. The etiology of PME activity changes during breast carcinogenesis is not known. The objective of the current studies was to determine if PME gene expression levels have been altered in breast tumorigenesis. To this end, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to quantify expression levels of 5&#x003b1;R1, 5&#x003b1;R2, 20&#x003b1;-HSO, 3&#x003b1;-HSO2 and 3&#x003b1;-HSO3 in paired (tumorous and nontumorous) tissues from 11 patients, and unpaired tumor tissues from 17 patients and nontumorous breast tissues from 10 reduction mammoplasty samples. The results provide the first evidence that expression levels of SRD5A1/2 are elevated whereas those of AKR1-3 are markedly decreased in breast carcinoma. The findings suggest that selective changes in specific PME expression levels could lead to local increases in carcinoma-promoting 5&#x003b1;P and decreases in carcinoma-inhibiting 3&#x003b1;HP and 20&#x003b1;DHP in breast cancer tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Breast tissues</title><p>Tissues were obtained from Tissue and Archives Committee, Department of Pathology, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario. They were previously collected (1995&#x02013;1999) tissues that had been stored in liquid nitrogen freezers. The tissues were provided after being anonymized and their use for these studies was approved by the Interagency Advisory Panel on Research Ethics and the local Institutional Ethics Review Board. The tissues are numbered arbitrarily for convenience in these investigations. Paired samples were obtained from 11 patients and in each case consisted of a tissue sample from the tumor biopsy and a sample of tissue away from the tumor (nontumor tissue). Histological examination of the grossly normal breast tissue confirmed the absence of carcinoma or significant lymphocyte infiltration. Pathologists graded the tumors by the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) histological grading system as part of their routine evaluation. The degree of lymphocytic infiltration was evaluated separately using a semi-quantitative method. Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors were assayed in cytosols prepared from quick frozen tissues using quantitative enzyme immunoassay kits purchased from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> gives details of patients and tumor tissues of the paired samples. In addition, 17 tumor samples (without matching nontumor tissue) and 10 samples from reduction mammoplasty specimens were also examined for enzyme messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and reverse transcription</title><p>RNA isolation and reverse transcription (RT) was as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Briefly, the procedure was as follows. Total RNA was isolated from the tissues by homogenization in TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>reagent (Invitrogen) and extraction following the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to reverse transcription, RNA was treated with DNase I for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C using a DNA-<italic>free</italic>&#x02122; kit (Ambion). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was obtained from 2.0 &#x003bc;g of DNase treated total RNA using 200 U Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 &#x003bc;l following the manufacturers instructions. To exclude any amplification of genomic DNA, all experiments included conditions in which the reverse transcriptase enzyme was omitted. In addition, no template (NT) controls were run for both the RT and PCR stages for each of the primer sets and none showed any visible PCR product.</p></sec><sec><title>Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)</title><p>All PCR primers were purchased from Invitrogen Canada (Burlington, ON) and primer sequences, PCR conditions, PCR reaction kinetics and quantification were determined as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The conditions were as follows: 95&#x000b0;C denature for 4 minutes followed by cycling, each cycle with a 20 second denature at 94&#x000b0;C, a 30 second anneal at 62&#x000b0;C, and a 30 second extension at 72&#x000b0;C. Cycling was followed by a final extension for 4 minutes at 72&#x000b0;C. For each reaction an aliquot of cDNA was amplified in a 25 &#x003bc;l total volume using 1.25 U of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), 2 mM MgCl, 0.2 mM dNTP's, and 2 mM primer. Samples were amplified in separate reactions for 12 cycles with the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) primers, 27 cycles with the 5&#x003b1;R1, 20&#x003b1;-HSD, 3&#x003b1;-HSD1, 3&#x003b1;-HSD2 and 3&#x003b1;-HSD3 primers, and 33 cycles with the 5&#x003b1;R2 primers. Prior studies had shown that under these cycling conditions, quantification was linear over an 8-fold range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The PCR products were separated on 9% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. The bands were quantified by Quantity One 4.2.1 Gel Doc Software (BioRad Laboratories). The quantity of each band is expressed as total pixel value, based on intensity and number of pixels per band. Results are given as ratios of the total pixel value of the band of interest to the total pixel value of the 18S band. Values were obtained from the average of duplicate PCRs run on the same gel and assays were repeated three times for each gene, using a fresh cDNA sample each time.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Results are given as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Data were analyzed either by Student's t test for two columns or by ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test comparing all columns.

The ages of the women at the time of surgery ranged from 34 to 75 years. The tumorous tissues were diagnosed as infiltrating ductal carcinomas of no special type. They were graded by the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) histological grading system, whereby two carcinomas were Grade II/III and nine were III/III. Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor information was available for 10 of the tumor tissues. Eight tumor tissues were ER- and PR-negative, two were ER- and PR-positive, and one was ER-positive and PR-negative. ER and PR concentrations were graded as indicated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Two of the patients had axillary lymph nodes that contained metastases. On pathological examination, tumor was found to occupy from 25% &#x02013; 75% of the frozen tissue. Normal breast parenchyma occupied from 5% &#x02013; 15% of the normal breast sample with the bulk of the tissue composed of fibrous tissue and fat. Lymphocyte infiltration ranged from mild to heavy in the tumor samples and was essentially absent in the normal (nontumorous) tissues.</p><sec><title>Expression levels of progesterone metabolizing enzymes in paired tissues</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows that mRNA expression of 5&#x003b1;R1 (SRD5A1) mRNA, 5&#x003b1;R2 (SRD5A2) mRNA and 18S rRNA were detected as single bands (368 bp for 5&#x003b1;R1; 315 bp for 5&#x003b1;R2 and 131 bp for 18S) by our RT-PCR protocol.

Expression of 5&#x003b1;R1 by real-time measurement, was 18.5-, 1061- and 12.5-fold higher in tumor than in normal samples from #1, #7 and #8, respectively (compared to 3.3-, 22- and 8-fold higher, respectively, by the semi-quantitative method. 5&#x003b1;R2 expression was higher by 6.6-, 140- and 1.3-fold by real-time measurement, (compared to 1.8-, 8.8- and 1.2-fold higher by the semi-quantitative method) in tumor than normal samples of #1, #7 and #8, respectively. The real-time results confirmed the findings by the semi-quantitative method that 5&#x003b1;R mRNA expression levels are higher in tumor than in normal tissue. The differences between the two methods may be due to the fact that the real-time measurements are linear over a much wider range than the 8-fold limit of the semi-quantitative method. The real-time determinations suggest that the changes in progesterone metabolizing enzyme expression that accompany breast carcinoma may be even greater than indicated by the semi-quantitative results.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Unpaired tissues</title><p>The unpaired tissues consisted of breast carcinomas from 17 patients and normal (reduction mammoplasty) from 10 cases. The tumor tissues came from women whose ages at the time of surgery ranged from 48 to 91 years. Four of the tumor tissues were ER- and PR-negative, ten were ER-positive and PR-positive at varying receptor levels, and three were ER-positive and PR-negative. There were no evident relationships between ER/PR status and enzyme gene expression levels. Available SBR scores were Grade I for two tissues, Grade II for two tissues and Grade III for seven tissues. No apparent relationships between SBR scores and enzyme gene expression levels were detected. Of the ten samples of normal tissue three patients were just under 20 years, five were between 24 and 35 years and two were between 47 and 53 years of age. No ER or PR data were available for these tissues.</p><sec><title>Expression levels of progesterone metabolizing enzymes in unpaired tissues</title><p>Messenger RNA expression levels for progesterone metabolizing enzymes in tumor and reduction mammoplasty ('normal') tissues are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The calculations for expression levels of 5&#x003b1;R1, 20&#x003b1;-HSO, 3&#x003b1;-HSO3 and 3&#x003b1;-HSO2 are based on 27 PCR cycles. Expression levels of 5&#x003b1;R2 were considerably lower than expression of mRNA for the other enzymes studied, requiring 34 cycles instead of 27 to visualize in the linear calculation range. The average level of expression of 5&#x003b1;R1 mRNA was not significantly different between tumor and normal tissues. The average level of expression (mean &#x000b1; SEM) of 5&#x003b1;R2 mRNA was more than 2-fold higher (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in tumor (1.28 &#x000b1; 0.17) than in normal (0.604 &#x000b1; 0.12) tissues. The average level of expression of 20&#x003b1;-HSO mRNA was significantly lower (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in tumor (0.374 &#x000b1; 0.048) than in normal (1.942 &#x000b1; 0.691). The average level of expression of 3&#x003b1;-HSO3 mRNA was significantly lower (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in tumor (0.382 &#x000b1; 0.094) than in normal (1.793 &#x000b1; 0.641). The average level of expression of 3&#x003b1;-HSO2 mRNA was significantly lower (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in tumor (0.706 &#x000b1; 0.123) than in normal (1.639 &#x000b1; 0.399).</p><p>The 5&#x003b1;R1 expression level was compared with each of the HSO expression levels for each tissue and the mean ratios (5&#x003b1;R1/HSO) were significantly higher (p &#x0003c; 0.001 or p &#x0003c; 0.01) for tumor tissues than for normal tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The ratio of 5&#x003b1;R1:20&#x003b1;-HSO was greater than 1.0 in 17/17 tumor tissues (mean = 3.186; 95% CI = 2.285 and 4.086) and less than 1.0 in 6/10 normal tissues (mean = 0.867; 95% CI = 0.499 and 1.235). The ratio of 5&#x003b1;R1:3&#x003b1;-HSO3 was greater than 1.0 in 16/17 tumor tissues (mean = 4.732; 95% CI = 2.833 and 6.63) and less than 1.0 in 5/10 normal tissues (mean = 1.205; 95% CI = 0.432 and 1.978).

Similarly, in the non-paired tissues, 5&#x003b1;R2/HSO ratios were greater than 1.0 in tumor and less than 1.0 in normal tissues and the differences were significant at p &#x0003c; 0.001 (data not shown).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Metabolism studies have shown that mammary tissues from several species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] including human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and several human breast cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] exhibit 5&#x003b1;R, 3&#x003b1;-HSO, 3&#x003b2;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO progesterone metabolizing activities. Differences between tumorous and nontumorous breast tissue in terms of relative activities of 5&#x003b1;R, 3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Significantly higher levels of 5&#x003b1;-reduced progesterone metabolites (5&#x003b1;-pregnanes) and significantly lower levels of delta-4 metabolites (4-pregnenes) are produced in tumorous than in nontumorous human breast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Similarly, tumor-inducing breast cell lines produce significantly higher ratios of 5&#x003b1;-pregnanes:4-pregnenes than do nontumorigenic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the progesterone conversion pathway, the first 5&#x003b1;-reduced metabolite is 5&#x003b1;P, catalyzed by 5&#x003b1;-reductase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The two 4-pregnenes resulting from direct progesterone conversion are 4-pregnen-3&#x003b1;-ol-20-one (3&#x003b1;HP) and 4-pregnen-20&#x003b1;-ol-3-one (20&#x003b1;DHP), catalyzed by the actions of 3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The conversion to 5&#x003b1;P is irreversible. The conversions to 3&#x003b1;HP and 20&#x003b1;DHP are reversible and depend on the relative reductive or oxidative activities of each enzyme.</p><p>The potential significance for breast cancer of the changes in progesterone metabolizing enzyme activities is that the metabolites appear to be directly involved in promoting or inhibiting tumor growth in this tissue. The 5&#x003b1;-pregnane, 5&#x003b1;P, which is produced at higher levels in tumorous tissues, stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits cell anchorage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The action of the neoplasia-promoting 5&#x003b1;P involves novel, specific, high-affinity receptors in the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and results in marked alteration of the cell's cytoskeletal and adhesion complexes normally involved in cell replication and attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On the other hand, the 4-pregnene, 3&#x003b1;HP, which is produced at higher levels in the normal breast tissue, has the opposite effect by suppressing cell proliferation and detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] via separate and distinct membrane receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Changes in enzyme activity can result from changes in the milieu in which the enzymes operate (such as temperature and pH, and concentrations of cofactors, substrates, products, competitors, ions, phospholipids and other molecules). Changes can also occur because of changes in actual enzyme amounts due to changes in the expression of the mRNA coding for the enzyme. Since the progesterone metabolizing enzyme activity studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] on tumorous and nontumorous breast tissue were carried out <italic>in vitro </italic>in identical milieus, the observed differences can be more easily ascribed to differences in enzyme amounts resulting from altered expression. A recent study on breast cell lines has shown that differences in progesterone metabolizing enzyme activity can be correlated with changes in enzyme mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The present study indicates that changes in the mRNA expression of various progesterone metabolizing enzymes may be responsible for the previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] higher levels of 5&#x003b1;-pregnanes and lower levels of 3&#x003b1;- and/or 20&#x003b1;-hydroxy 4-pregnenes produced by tumorous human breast tissue.</p><sec><title>5&#x003b1;-reductase expression</title><p>The enzyme responsible for the conversion of 4-ene steroids to 5&#x003b1;-reduced steroids is 5&#x003b1;-reductase (5&#x003b1;R; EC 1.3.99.5).

Recently 5&#x003b1;R1 and 5&#x003b1;R2 have also been located in human breast carcinoma where they were studied in relation to 5&#x003b1;-reduction of testosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

Such an increase in expression of 5&#x003b1;R could account for the higher levels of progesterone 5&#x003b1; reduction in the tumorous portion of matched breast samples that resulted in significantly higher levels of 5&#x003b1;P production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In breast cell lines the higher 5&#x003b1;R activity level in the tumorigenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], appeared to be attributable to 5&#x003b1;R1 since its mRNA expression was several hundred fold greater than that of 5&#x003b1;R2; seven more PCR cycles were required for 5&#x003b1;R2 in order to show band intensity approximately equivalent to 5&#x003b1;R1. Moreover, 5&#x003b1;R1 mRNA expression was significantly greater, whereas 5&#x003b1;R2 mRNA expression was no higher, in tumorigenic than in nontumorigenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Similarly, in the present studies 33 cycles were required for 5&#x003b1;R2 in contrast to only 26 cycles for 5&#x003b1;R1 indicating that mRNA levels for 5&#x003b1;R1 greatly exceed those of 5&#x003b1;R2 in human breast tissue. It was also recently demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR that 5&#x003b1;R1 is the main isoform expressed in human breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Together the observations provide strong evidence that 5&#x003b1;R1 may be the primary 5&#x003b1;-reductase expressed in breast tissue. However, in contrast to prostate where no differences were found in 5&#x003b1;R2 expression between tumor and matched normal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] we saw significantly higher levels of expression of 5&#x003b1;R2 in tumor than in normal breast tissue in both the matched and unmatched breast samples. Therefore it is still possible that changes in 5&#x003b1;R2 mRNA expression have some relevance to progesterone metabolism in breast cancer.</p><p>In the unmatched samples the levels of 5&#x003b1;R1 expression were not significantly different between normal (mostly reduction mammoplasty) and tumor tissues. Normal samples required large amounts of tissue to obtain sufficient levels of RNA for PCR analysis. Also, the unmatched tissues had been collected separately and the records do not provide information to determine if storage factors such as interval between excision and freezing may have been different. Another important factor may be the difference in age between tumor and normal samples; eight of the normal samples were derived from premenopausal women, between the ages of 19 and 35, a time when levels of steroid hormones and enzymes vary markedly during the menstrual cycle. Further investigations will be required to resolve differences in 5&#x003b1;R expression at different ages and different stages of the cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase expression</title><p>Mammalian 3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO activities result in stereospecific and positional keto/hydroxy interconversions.

In a preliminary report in which tumorous tissue was compared to normal tissue in 24 paired cases, Stolz and co-workers, using real-time PCR, also observed that the expression of 20&#x003b1;-HSO (relative to RNase P) was significantly lower (&#x0003e;5-fold) in the tumor portion of the majority of the cases and nearly half of these also showed decreased 3&#x003b1;-HSO3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

The reduction in 3&#x003b1;-HSO mRNA expression may not be confined to breast cancer. In a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] it was demonstrated that 3&#x003b1;-HSO3 mRNA expression is also lower in tumor versus normal human prostate tissue samples.</p><p>The reduced expression of 3&#x003b1;(20&#x003b1;)-HSO isozymes and increased expression of 5&#x003b1;R isozymes in breast tumor reported here help to explain the lower and higher level of activity, respectively, of these enzymes observed in tumor versus paired normal breast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Similarly, tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, T-47D) also exhibited lower 3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO and higher 5&#x003b1;R expression than a non-tumorigenic (MCF-10A) cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and these differences in expression correlated with differences in respective enzyme activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Both in the tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and cell lines [unpublished], the differences in activity were reflected primarily in higher amounts of 5&#x003b1;P and lower amounts of 3&#x003b1;HP and 20&#x003b1;DHP produced in the neoplastic versus the normal condition.</p><p>Others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] have considered 3&#x003b1;- and 20&#x003b1;-reduction as catabolic pathways resulting in less active (or inactive) metabolites, thereby decreasing the amount of biologically active ligand available for androgen and progesterone receptor binding, respectively. Thus reduced expression of <italic>AKR1C2 </italic>in prostate cancer has been considered to be associated with reduced conversion of 5&#x003b1;-dihydrotestosterone to 5&#x003b1;-androstane-3&#x003b1;,17&#x003b2;-diol, thereby maintaining higher levels of 5&#x003b1;-dihydrotestosterone which is considered to have higher growth-promoting action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Similarly, conversion of progesterone to 20&#x003b1;DHP has been considered a means of decreasing the local progesterone concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Instead of viewing the enzymes as regulators of progesterone concentration and the progesterone metabolites as inactive by-products of this catabolism in breast tissue, we propose that the primary function of the enzymes is to regulate the relative levels of the active 5&#x003b1;-pregnane and 4-pregnene progesterone metabolites. At least two of these metabolites, 3&#x003b1;HP and 5&#x003b1;P, have been shown to have independent specific and opposing activity with respect to breast cell proliferation, adhesion and cell cytoskeletal components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, 3&#x003b1;HP and 5&#x003b1;P have separate specific membrane-associated receptors on mammary cells, which are distinct from estrogen, androgen, progesterone or corticosteroid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, 3&#x003b1;HP has been demonstrated to exhibit meiosis regulating activity in rat testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], inhibition of follicle-stimulating hormone release in pituitary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] via nongenomic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and analgesic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and anxiolytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] actions in the brain. It appears, therefore, appropriate to consider at least some of the progesterone metabolites produced in breast tissue as active independent hormones, potentially involved in regulating breast cancer.</p><p>5&#x003b1;-Reductase and reductive 3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO activities provide the major (if not exclusive) catabolic pathways of progesterone in breast tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The relative activities of these enzymes will determine the ratio of cancer-promoting 5&#x003b1;P with respect to cancer-inhibiting 3&#x003b1;HP and 20&#x003b1;DHP concentrations. The current findings of the decline in expression of the HSO isozymes in tumor tissue explain the lower levels of the cancer-inhibiting steroids in relation to the cancer-promoting 5&#x003b1;P. Increased expression in 5&#x003b1;R mRNA would further increase the ratio in favor of cancer-promoting progesterone metabolites. We have previously suggested that the change from normal to carcinoma and/or the promotion of the carcinoma may involve an increase in the local 5&#x003b1;-pregnane/4-pregnene ratio, in particular the 5&#x003b1;P/3&#x003b1;HP ratio. The current findings suggest that higher levels of 5&#x003b1;R expression and/or lower levels of 3&#x003b1;- and 20&#x003b1;-HSO expression in the tumor (as compared to the normal breast tissue) result in increases in local concentrations of cancer-promoting, 5&#x003b1;P, and simultaneous decreases in actively anti-neoplastic hormones such as 3&#x003b1;HP. The control of the expression level of individual progesterone metabolizing enzymes might therefore provide a mechanism of controlling breast cancer by controlling local concentrations of progesterone metabolites with opposite activities.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is known that the progesterone metabolite, 5&#x003b1;P, stimulates proliferation and detachment of breast cell lines, and thus potentially promotes mitogenesis and metastasis. The progesterone metabolites, 3&#x003b1;HP and 20&#x003b1;DHP, have the opposite effects by suppressing proliferation and detachment. Conversion of progesterone to 5&#x003b1;P is higher, whereas conversion to 3&#x003b1;HP and 20&#x003b1;DHP is lower in tumor than in normal breast tissue. Progesterone conversion to 5&#x003b1;P requires the action of 5&#x003b1;R (SRD5A) and conversion to 3&#x003b1;HP and 20&#x003b1;DHP requires the actions of AKR1C1-AKR1C3 (3&#x003b1;-HSO and 20&#x003b1;-HSO) isozymes. The results of this study show for the first time that expression of 5&#x003b1;R mRNA is significantly elevated whereas expression of AKR1C1-AKR1C3 mRNA is significantly decreased in tumor compared to normal breast tissue. The findings suggest that the shift in pattern of progesterone metabolism occurring in breast carcinoma may be due to altered expression levels of the progesterone metabolizing enzymes. Understanding what causes these changes in expression could help in designing protocols to prevent or reverse the changes in progesterone metabolism associated with breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AKR, Aldo-Keto Reductase; 3&#x003b1;-HSO, 3&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase; 20&#x003b1;-HSO, 20&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase; 5&#x003b1;R, 5&#x003b1;-reductase; 5&#x003b1;P, 5&#x003b1;-pregnane-3,20-dione; 3&#x003b1;HP, 3&#x003b1;-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one; 20&#x003b1;DHP, 20&#x003b1;-dihydroprogesterone or 20&#x003b1;-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JW conceived and coordinated the study, participated in its design, performed the statistical analyses and drafted the manuscript.
