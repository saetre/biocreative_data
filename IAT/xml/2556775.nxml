By day 6 after birth, however, a significant number of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs accumulated in the spleen and produced IL-12, which triggered the down-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression on Th1 cells, thus protecting them against IL-4&#x02013;driven apoptosis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: Ag, antigen; BFA, Brefeldin A; Fc&#x003b3;R, Fc &#x003b3; receptor; Tg, transgenic.</p></fn><fn><p>H.-H.

This unbalanced response may explain the susceptibility of neonates to microbial infections and allergic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Strategies aimed at balancing neonatal Th1 and Th2 responses may thus facilitate the development of effective vaccines against infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and treatments for allergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Recently, we and others have discovered that both Th1 and Th2 cells develop during the primary response to Ag in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). However, a second encounter with Ag gives rise to a strong Th2 response and a weak Th1 response.</p><p>Using OVA-specific TCR transgenic (Tg) DO11.10 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), we developed a neonate-to-neonate transfer system that allows us to track the fate of primary Th1 cells upon exposure to Ag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In this system, neonatal splenic T cells from 1-d-old DO11.10/scid mice are transferred into newborn (1-d-old) BALB/c mice, which are then challenged with Ag i.p. 2 wk later, primary T cell responses are evaluated in the spleen. Secondary responses are examined in this model by rechallenging the mice with Ag in CFA at 7 wk of age and analyzing T cell responses 10 d later. Using this model, we have shown that the lack of secondary Th1 responses stems from the apoptosis of Th1 cells driven by IL-4 produced by their Th2 counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In this system, IL-4 does not signal through the conventional type I IL-4 receptor (IL-4R&#x003b1;/&#x003b3;<sub>c</sub>) on Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Rather, primary exposure to Ag induces the up-regulation of the IL-13R&#x003b1;1 chain, which associates with IL-4R&#x003b1;, giving rise to an IL-4R&#x003b1;/IL-13R&#x003b1;1 heteroreceptor, or type II receptor, through which both IL-4 and IL-13 can signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). During in vitro recall or in vivo rechallenge with Ag, IL-4 from the Th2 cells utilizes the IL-4R&#x003b1;/IL-13R&#x003b1;1 heteroreceptor to drive apoptosis of Th1 cells, thus biasing the secondary immune response toward Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 in neonatal Th1 cells. Our data indicate that the delayed developmental maturation of a subset of DCs leads to a shortage in IL-12 production, allowing for up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression and its association with the IL-4R&#x003b1; chain. Indeed, we show that the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs accumulate to a significant level by day 6 after birth, a time point at which expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 decreases, leading to diminished Th1 cell apoptosis and the restoration of IFN-&#x003b3; production by Th1 cells upon secondary Ag challenge. Neutralization of endogenous IL-12 on day 6 restored IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression and apoptosis of neonatal Th1 cells, thus inhibiting secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses, and supplying exogenous IL-12 during exposure to Ag at birth decreased IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression and inhibited apoptosis of primary Th1 cells, allowing the generation of secondary Th1 responses. Consistent with this, the transfer of wild-type adult DCs into newborn mice that had previously received neonatal DO11.10 T cells inhibited the expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;1, leading to the survival of primary Th1 cells and the production of IFN-&#x003b3; during secondary Ag challenge. In contrast, the transfer of IL-12&#x02013;deficient DCs led to sustained IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression, Th1 cell apoptosis, and, thus, a lack of IFN-&#x003b3; production during the secondary response. Finally, transfer of IL-12<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>, but not IL-12&#x02013;deficient, adult CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs also inhibited IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression and Th1 cell apoptosis, and restored secondary IFN-&#x003b3; production by Th1 cells. The effect of transferring IL-12<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs was reversed if IL-12 was neutralized at the time of Ag exposure.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Day 6 after birth represents a turning point for the expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and the development of neonatal Th1 immunity</title><p>Previously, we developed a neonate-to-neonate TCR Tg T cell transfer system that was adapted to overcome the limitations associated with the small size of the newborn mouse and made tracking T cell fate possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In this system, neonatal (1-d-old) DO11.10 TCR Tg CD4 T cells that are specific for OVA 323&#x02013;339 peptide (designated OVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) are transferred into BALB/c newborns (1 d old), the recipients are exposed to Ag, and the T cells are traced with the TCR-OVA&#x02013;specific anticlonotypic antibody KJ1-26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) and analyzed for response to Ag. Also, as Ag we used Ig-OVA, an Ig chimera expressing OVA peptide within the heavy chain variable region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), for the purpose of avoiding the use of adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) and for optimization of peptide presentation by uptake through Fc &#x003b3; receptors (Fc&#x003b3;Rs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). As indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, neonatal DO11.10 T cells transferred to 1-d-old BALB/c mice and exposed to Ig-OVA do not produce IFN-&#x003b3; upon rechallenge with OVA peptide in CFA at adult stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). When the transfer used 8-wk-old adult instead of neonatal T cells, secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses developed. The lack of a secondary IFN-&#x003b3; response is because of the fact that neonatal Th1 cells undergo apoptosis upon reencounter with OVA peptide, as indicated by the substantial Annexin V staining relative to adult T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, if neonatal exposure to Ig-OVA occurs around day 6 after birth, the cells acquire the ability to develop secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses both in the spleen and lymph node upon rechallenge with OVA/CFA at the age of 7 wk (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Overall, neonates acquire the ability to develop Th1 secondary responses when the initial exposure to Ag occurs on or beyond day 6 after birth.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Neonates acquire the ability to develop secondary Th1 responses when the primary encounter with Ag occurs on or beyond day 6 after birth.</bold> Newborn BALB/c mice were given 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> neonatal or adult DO11.10 CD4 T cells and injected with 100 &#x003bc;g Ig-OVA in saline, and 2 wk later, the splenic cells (10<sup>6</sup> cells per well) were stimulated with 10 &#x003bc;M OVA peptide in vitro.

The data are representative of two experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052269f01"></graphic></fig><p>We have previously shown that exposure to Ig-OVA at the neonatal stage induces up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 on Th1 cells and that such a chain associates with IL-4R&#x003b1; to form an IL-4R&#x003b1;/IL-13R&#x003b1;1 heteroreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) through which both IL-4 and IL-13 can signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Also, neonatal exposure to Ig-OVA induces both Th1 and Th2 cells in the primary response, and upon rechallenge with OVA peptide the Th2 cells produce IL-4 that uses the IL-4R&#x003b1;/IL-13R&#x003b1;1 heteroreceptor on Th1 cells to signal for their death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Because restoration of secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses could occur when the primary exposure to Ig-OVA takes place around day 6 after birth, we sought to test whether at that point in time exposure to Ig-OVA no longer sustains up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression. Accordingly, 1-d-old BALB/c mice that had received neonatal DO11.10 T cells were given Ig-OVA on day 1, 2, 4, 6, or 10 after T cell transfer, and 2 wk later their splenic Th1 cells were isolated on the basis of IFN-&#x003b3; secretion and tested for IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA expression. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA was up-regulated when exposure to Ig-OVA took place on day 1, 2, or 4 after birth. However, a significant decrease occurred when the Ig-OVA was given on day 6 or 10 after birth. Densitometry analysis indicated that IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA went down from 260% of GADPH mRNA on day 2 to 10% on days 6 and 10, indicating an inability of the Th1 cells to up-regulate IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The decrease in IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA on day 6 after birth translates into reduction of cell-surface IL-13R&#x003b1;1 protein. Indeed, IL-13R&#x003b1;1 protein expression went down by 50% (from 91 to 41%) when exposure to Ag was performed on day 6 instead of day 1 after birth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of Th1 T cell lysates indicated similar results, as Il-13R&#x003b1;1 decreased by half upon Ag exposure on day 6 instead of day 1 after birth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). The control 1C5 CTLL-2 cells transfected with the <italic>IL-13R&#x003b1;1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) expressed IL-13R&#x003b1;1 protein, whereas the untransfected wild-type CTLL cells did not, indicating that the rabbit anti&#x02013;IL-13R&#x003b1;1 antiserum is specific for IL-13R&#x003b1;1 protein. Overall, IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA and protein expression decreased significantly when exposure to Ag was made on day 6 after birth.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Recovery of neonatal IFN-&#x003b3; response coincides with down-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression.</bold> Newborn BALB/c mice were given 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> purified neonatal CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DO11.10 T cells and injected i.p. with 60 &#x003bc;g/g Ig-OVA in saline at day 1, 2, 4, 6, or 10 after birth, and 2 wk later, the splenic cells (10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) were stimulated for 10 h with 10 &#x003bc;M OVA peptide.

In C, the cells were stained with KJ1-26 and rabbit anti&#x02013;IL-13R&#x003b1;1 antiserum (1:100 dilution), and Th1 cells were identified by staining for intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; with anti&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b3; antibody. Expression of surface IL-13R&#x003b1;1 was determined by flow cytometry on cells gated for KJ1-26 expression and intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; production. In D, Th1 cells were purified as in A, lysed using NP-40 detergent, and run on a 10% acrylamide gel. Transfer was made onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and IL-13R&#x003b1;1 protein was detected using rabbit anti&#x02013;IL-13R&#x003b1;1 antibodies (1:1,000 dilution). For control purposes, we used lysates from CTLL-2 cells transfected with a plasmid coding for cell-surface IL-13R&#x003b1;1 (reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) or wild-type untransfected CTLL-2 cells.

Indeed, when neonatal exposure to Ig-OVA was performed on day 6, the mice began to develop secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses when challenged with OVA peptide 2 mo later. Such IFN-&#x003b3; responses were even higher when the neonatal exposure to Ig-OVA took place on day 10 after birth. Overall, day 6 represents a time point at which exposure to Ag no longer up-regulates IL-13R&#x003b1;1, leading to the survival of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing cells and the development of neonatal Th1 immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Exogenous IL-12 given during exposure to Ag on the day of birth reduces up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 on primary neonatal Th1 cells and restores IFN-&#x003b3; secondary responses</title><p>Previously, it has been shown that neonates demonstrate a poor ability to produce IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), which justifies the lack of neonatal Th1 immunity because IL-12 is a key differentiation factor for Th1 cells. However, the primary response does indeed raise Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), suggesting that the lack of neonatal secondary Th1 immunity is not due solely to defective differentiation. Given that IL-12 was shown to restore neonatal secondary splenic Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), we thought that it may accomplish this effect by interfering with the up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression. To test this premise, newborn BALB/c mice were given neonatal DO11.10 T cells and were administered Ig-OVA together with rIL-12. 7 wk later, the animals were challenged with OVA peptide in CFA and their splenic secondary responses were analyzed. As seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, the mice given IL-12 developed IFN-&#x003b3; responses, whereas control animals not given IL-12 had no measurable IFN-&#x003b3; responses. In line with these results is the observation that the apoptosis of Th1 cells from IL-12&#x02013;recipient mice was significantly reduced relative to control animals not given IL-12 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). When the animals were evaluated for IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression 2 wk after exposure to Ig-OVA/IL-12 but before any rechallenge with OVA/CFA, the primary Th1 cells had significantly reduced IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA relative to mice given Ig-OVA but no IL-12, as measured by spot blot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and real-time PCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Again, when the cells were analyzed for IL-13R&#x003b1;1 protein, the supply of exogenous IL-12 together with Ig-OVA reduced IL-13R&#x003b1;1 protein expression from 84 to 41% when compared with cells from mice that did not receive IL-12.

Also, apoptosis of Th1 cells was more substantial in the mice given anti&#x02013;IL-12 antibody versus recipients of rat IgG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

It is thus possible that the lack of IL-12 in the neonates is caused by delayed developmental accumulation of DCs. To test this assumption, we enriched the neonates with splenic DCs from adult mice and tested them for rescue of primary neonatal Th1 cells from apoptosis and development of secondary Th1 IFN-&#x003b3; responses.

The splenic CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs comprise both CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).

Initially, we determined the kinetics of accumulation of various subsets of DCs in the splenic neonate between the day of birth and day 10 of age. As indicated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, most splenic CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs were negative for CD8&#x003b1; and CD4. However, by day 4 the number of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs rose to 11.2% among the total CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, whereas CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs made up 3.3% of total CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. By day 6, both subsets reached a number that was more or less similar to days 8 and 10, which ranged between 13 and 16% for CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and between 3.8 and 4.3% for CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These numbers are much lower than those observed in adult mice (40.4% for CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and 16% for CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs), indicating that developmental accumulation is not complete by day 10. In fact, CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, which make up a very small fraction of total adult CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, remain insignificant at day 10 of age. Because day 6 was a turning point for the development of Th1 secondary immunity and the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subsets have undergone a significant increase in number between birth and day 6, we tested both populations for reduction of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 up-regulation, inhibition of apoptosis of Th1 cells, and restoration of secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses. Accordingly, newborn BALB/c mice were transferred with 1-d-old DO11.10 T cells with the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> adult DC subset from either IL-12<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> or IL-12<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and were exposed to Ig-OVA. 2 wk later, Th1 cells were isolated and IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA expression on primary neonatal Th1 cells was evaluated by spot blot. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref> shows that up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression occurred when the mice received no DC transfer or transfer with IL-12<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs.

Given that isolation of the DC subsets at early neonatal age is not feasible because of low frequency, we opted to purify total CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, stimulate them with CpG, and test for intracellular IL-12 on gated DC subsets. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref> shows that on day 1 after birth most of the splenic DCs are CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, with almost no CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC subsets. By day 6, however, both CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC subsets reached significant frequency, as was shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. When tested for intracellular IL-12, 26% of the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> double-negative and most frequent subset produced IL-12 on day 1 after birth, and 6 d later 84% of the cells displayed IL-12 expression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). This points to a developmental influence on these DCs to produce IL-12 cytokine. As for the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs, like the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, there was no detectable IL-12 on day 1 but the majority of the cells available on day 6 produced IL-12 (84 and 97%, respectively; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, D and E</xref>). These results indicate that the limited availability of IL-12 on the day of birth is caused by delayed accumulation of the DC subsets in the spleen, together with a progressive ability to produce IL-12 cytokine.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>The limited availability of IL-12 during neonatal exposure to Ag is related to delayed accumulation in the spleen of the presenting CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subset.</bold> Newborn BALB/c mice were killed at the indicated day after birth, and splenic CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs were isolated on anti-CD11c microbeads.

Recent investigations indicated that both Th1 and Th2 cells develop in the neonatal primary response, but secondary encounter with Ag leads to death of the Th1 cells by apoptosis, hence the bias toward Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The death of Th1 cells stems from an up-regulation of the IL-13R&#x003b1;1 chain during neonatal exposure to Ag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Indeed, it was shown that the IL-13R&#x003b1;1 chain associates with IL-4R&#x003b1; to form an IL-4R&#x003b1;/IL-13R&#x003b1;1 heteroreceptor through which both IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines can signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). During rechallenge with Ag, IL-4 from the Th2 cells utilizes the IL-4R&#x003b1;/IL-13R&#x003b1;1 heteroreceptor and induces the death of Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In this paper, we show that day 6 after birth is a turning point at which exposure to Ag no longer results in secondary responses that are biased toward Th2 and secondary Th1 IFN-&#x003b3; responses emerge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These observations bode well with findings indicating that exposure to Ag at day 7 but not at day 3 become effective in inducing Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Interestingly, day 6 after birth also represents a turning point for the expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;1, as exposure to Ag at this age no longer up-regulates IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA or protein expression on Th1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We then set up experiments and investigated the mechanism underlying the restoration of neonatal Th1 secondary responses by day 6 Ag exposure. We have previously shown that IL-12 can rescue splenic Th1 cells and restore IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Given that the neonate displays an inability to produce significant IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), we thought that exposure to Ag within an environment where IL-12 is limited may be responsible for up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and the consequent death of Th1 cells. This assumption proved correct, as exogenous IL-12 given during Ag exposure on day 1 reduced IL-13R&#x003b1;1 mRNA and protein expression on primary Th1 cells, inhibited their apoptosis, and restored secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that the administration of anti&#x02013;IL-12 antibody during Ag exposure on day 6 after birth nullifies restoration of secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses, and this operates through the restitution of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 up-regulation and apoptosis of Th1 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>Given that DCs are the main producers of IL-12 and that the neonatal environment is composed of lower numbers of DCs relative to other APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), it is possible that the inability of the neonatal environment to provide significant IL-12 is related to the minimal number of Ag-presenting DCs available at day 1 after birth. In fact, when newborn mice were enriched with adult IL-12<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> splenic DCs, up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 on primary Th1 cells was minimal, apoptosis was significantly reduced, and secondary Th1 IFN-&#x003b3; responses were restored (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). IL-12<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs could not inhibit IL-13R&#x003b1;1 up-regulation or restore Th1 IFN-&#x003b3; responses. These observations, together with the day 6&#x02013;acquired neonatal transition to secondary Th1 responses, suggest that developmental accumulation of DCs could be responsible for the bias of neonatal immunity toward Th2. Given that distinct subsets of DCs can perform different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), delayed developmental accumulation of a specific subset of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs over time could orchestrate the Th2 bias of neonatal immunity. Analysis of DC ontogeny in the neonate mouse indicated that although CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs were present at a significant number on the day of birth, the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subsets began to accumulate in the spleen by day 4 and reached a significant percentage by day 6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). A small population of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs that is present in adult mice was not detected by day 10 after birth. Thus, these observations suggested that it is the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and/or the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subset that might be responsible for the acquired ability of the neonate to develop secondary Th1 responses when exposure to Ag is performed on day 6 after birth. In fact, when the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, but not the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, subset was transferred to newborns on the day of birth during exposure to Ag, the primary Th1 cells displayed significantly reduced IL-13R&#x003b1;1 expression, resisted apoptosis, and developed secondary IFN-&#x003b3; responses when the animals were rechallenged with OVA as adults (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Transfer of IL-12<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs was not able to overturn IL-13R&#x003b1;1 up-regulation or restore IFN-&#x003b3; secondary Th1 responses, indicating that the subset presents Ag and produces the IL-12 needed to counter IL-13R&#x003b1;1 up-regulation. Moreover, investigation of the frequency of the DC subsets indicated that a minimal number of the presenting CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subset is present in the spleen on the day of birth. At best, these cells could produce IL-12 at a limited rate, like the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> double-negative DC subset (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), but this would be insufficient to counter IL-13R&#x003b1;1 up-regulation. By day 6, the frequency of the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subset increased because of significant accumulation of this subset (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In addition, most of the cells produced IL-12, leading to inhibition of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 up-regulation, diminished apoptosis of primary Th1 cells, and development of secondary Th1 responses.</p><p>Collectively, these observations indicate that delayed developmental maturation of a subset of DCs operates the Th2 bias of neonatal immunity. In particular, our data suggest that minimal production of IL-12 in early neonatal life because of delayed accumulation of the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subset leads to up-regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 on primary Th1 cells. This chain associates with IL-4R&#x003b1; and forms an IL-4R&#x003b1;/IL-13R&#x003b1;1 heteroreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). IL-4 from the Th2 cells used this receptor to drive apoptosis of Th1 cells, leading to a lack of secondary Th1 immunity, and hence the bias to Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). These observations agree with previous papers showing a delayed developmental accumulation of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). What this study adds is that a specific subset is responsible for Ag presentation and IL-12 production, and it ties the regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 to such IL-12 and the developmental maturation of the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subset during the neonatal period. Also, we demonstrate that sufficient accumulation of the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subset by day 6 after birth represents a turning point to down-regulate IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and sustain the transition for Th1 responses. These previously unrecognized findings highlight the mechanism underlying the bias of neonatal immunity toward Th2 cells and provide useful information for the development of pediatric vaccines and reagents against allergies in infants and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>BALB/c (H-2<sup>d</sup>) mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley and were used as hosts for the adoptive transfer of T cells.

Expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 chain mRNA was assessed in neonatal Th1 cells. &#x003b2;-actin was included to serve as a normalizer. The oligonucleotides used as specific primers were as follows: sense, (IL-13R&#x003b1;1) 5&#x02032;-GCACAGAGTATAGGTAAGGAGCAA-3&#x02032; and (&#x003b2;-actin) 5&#x02032;-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3&#x02032;; and antisense, (IL-13R&#x003b1;1) 5&#x02032;-ACAAAGACTGGAATGGTGAGTAAC-3&#x02032; and (&#x003b2;-actin) 5&#x02032;-CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT-3&#x02032;. Real-time PCR was performed on a Smart Cycler (Cepheid), and the results were analyzed by the comparative C<sub>T</sub> method described by the Smart Cycler software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grants RO1AI48541 and R21AI062796 (to H.
