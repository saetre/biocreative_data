Scoliosis, in particular, is highly prevalent in the human population, with prevalence estimates ranging from 1.4&#x00025; to 20&#x00025;, depending on the ages surveyed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Biot1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Perennou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The many forms of scoliosis are generally distinguished by age of onset. Congenital scoliosis is usually caused by abnormal vertebral development <italic>in utero</italic>. In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), vertebrae are formed normally and spinal deformity begins during adolescence, probably reflecting abnormalities in muscle and ligament growth. Finally, degenerative scoliosis is found in aging adults and can be caused by changes in vertebral body structure due to fracture, as well as alterations in surrounding musculature and ligaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Daffner1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The human vertebral column comprises mineralized vertebrae each separated by an unmineralized cushion called the intervertebral disc. The vertebral column is derived from the notochord, a stiff rod-shaped structure that serves as an axial support for the developing embryo. In mammals, a portion of the notochord is maintained throughout life in the center of the intervertebral discs, the nucleus pulposus. Two of the main components of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs are collagens and proteoglycans. Collagens provide tensile strength, serve as a scaffold for other extracellular matrix molecules such as proteoglycans, and provide a template for mineral deposition. Proteoglycans hold water and thus provide resistance to compressive forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Fenq1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Guiot1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Collagens are extracellular matrix proteins characterized by domains consisting of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats in which glycine is in every third position and Xaa and Yaa can be a variety of amino acids but, most commonly, are proline and 4-hydroxyproline, respectively. There are five classes of collagens, encoded by more than 42 genes that generate the chains of some 28 types of collagens in five major classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Myllyharju1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The fibril-forming collagens (types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII) have been studied most extensively due to their abundance and links to human disease. With the exception of the most recently identified types XXIV and XXVII, mutations in fibrillar collagen genes have been shown to give rise to genetic disorders. Mutations in these genes are responsible for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, forms of chondrodysplasias and forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Myllyharju1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Types XXIV and XXVII collagen, which cluster into a separate evolutionary clade, share characteristics that distinguish them from the classical fibrillar collagens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Pace1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-BootHandford1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These features include a globular N-propeptide domain lacking a minor triple helix and a triple helical domain of 997 amino acids that is shorter than the 1014&#x02013;1029 amino acids for classical fibrillar collagens. The helical domain also contains two short interruptions of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats. Since interruptions in the helical domain of the classical fibrillar collagens are disease-causing, this suggests that types XXIV and XXVII collagen function in a manner distinct from that of the classical fibrillar collagens. No function has been described for either collagen belonging to this clade.</p><p>In this study, we identified two genes for type XXVII collagen in zebrafish, <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic>, corresponding to a single gene in humans. Both <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> are expressed in the notochord and cartilage elements. Embryos deficient in <italic>col27a1a</italic> have delayed vertebral mineralization, form dysmorphic vertebrae, and develop scoliotic vertebral curves. Simultaneous knockdown with individually sub-effective doses of <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> also results in formation of dysmorphic vertebrae, delayed mineralization, and the development of scoliosis, indicating that they both play important roles in notochord and vertebral development. Our results indicate a key role for type XXVII collagen function in the notochord and suggest that human disease phenotypes that include significant scoliosis are candidates for mutations in <italic>COL27A1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fish Stocks</title><p>Zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> were from in-crosses of a wild-type stock, WT (WA), which is itself derived each generation by intercrossing the inbred mapping strains AB<sup>wp</sup> and wik.

The earliest signs of a notochord defect include buckling of the notochord sheath, abnormal accumulation of protein in the notochord, and a delay in vertebral mineralization.</p><p>As shown previously for mouse <italic>Col27a1</italic>, zebrafish <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> were expressed in cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Pace1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies of mouse also showed expression of <italic>Col27a1</italic> in presumptive vertebrae but notochord expression was not analyzed. Here we have shown expression of <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> in the notochord at early stages. To address the function of type XXVII collagen, we used a morpholino knockdown strategy. While rescue of the morpholino phenotype was not possible owing to the large sizes of these collagen transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Eisen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, the specificity of our morpholino effects are supported by the use of low combined doses that did not individually cause defects, and by the failure of p53 knockdown to rescue the observed phenotypes.</p><p>The structure of the notochord is characterized by a row of large, vacuolated cells that exert pressure on a thick collagenous sheath to form a type of hydrostatic skeleton in the embryo and young larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Adams1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Buckling of the notochord sheath in <italic>col27a1a</italic> morphants and <italic>col27a1a</italic>/<italic>col27a1b</italic> double morphants suggests that knockdown of <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> results in a weak sheath that is unable to withstand the force generated by the cells within the notochord. Distinct scoliotic curves are formed preferentially at the distal tip of the notochord, and excess protein is deposited at sites of curve formation. The vertebrae mineralize around these abnormal protein deposits, which may explain the severe structural alterations we observed. Previous work demonstrated that type XXVII collagen accumulates at the site of cartilage to bone transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Hjorten1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, consistent with the role in mineralization postulated here.</p><p>We have shown that embryos deficient in <italic>col27a1a</italic> mineralize vertebrae more slowly than control siblings, indicating a role for this locus in promoting mineralization during normal development. Our analyses showed a similar delay of mineralization&#x02014;as well as notochord curvature and vertebral malformations&#x02014;in double morphants for <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic>, after combined injection of low doses of translation-blocking morpholinos that did not, individually, yield overt morphological defects. By contrast, mineralization was accelerated in embryos injected with <italic>col27a1b</italic> translation-blocking morpholino alone. These alternative outcomes may reflect biochemical interactions between the protein products of the <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> loci. The mature collagen molecule comprises three collagen chains, and we expect that the protein products of <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> can form either homotrimers or heterotrimers having different consequences for mineralization rate. Thus, differences in the absolute abundance of the two protein products, the ratios of homotrimers to heterotrimers, or the ratios of different heterotrimer species all could affect mineralization outcome. We speculate that lower expression of <italic>col27a1b</italic> compared to <italic>col27a1a</italic>, the absence of morphological defects in <italic>col27a1b</italic> single morphants, and the presence of a novel third interruption in the triple helix in the inferred protein product of <italic>col27a1b</italic> may together reflect its incipient non-functionalization, following duplication of an ancestral <italic>col27a1</italic> locus. Given the likelihood of <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> interactions, the accelerated mineralization upon knock-down of <italic>col27a1b</italic> alone may indicate that its gene product now interferes weakly with the mineralization process, the precise timing of which presumably depends on a specific balance of <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> homotrimers and heterotrimers.</p><p>Unlike most reported morphant phenotypes, the <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> morphant phenotype is not clearly apparent until the morpholino is no longer active. This suggests that <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> are required during early development and are critical for formation of later structures. Similar early embryonic requirements for the development of later adult form have been demonstrated in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Budi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Kimmel2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Deposition of type XXVII collagen in the matrix may serve as a signal for synthesis of other proteins critical for later stages of notochord development. Alternatively, early depletion of <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> may alter early notochord structure at a level that we have not been able to detect, changing later protein interactions and affecting notochord development. We favor this hypothesis since early buckling of the notochord suggests a mechanical weakening of the notochord sheath. We speculate that when pressures applied by rapid growth or movement during the larval period are applied to the weakened sheath, it buckles, causing the notochord to curve.</p><p>A guppy model of scoliosis has been characterized and many zebrafish notochord mutants have also been identified, indicating that scoliosis is not restricted to humans or other ambulatory animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Gorman1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Gorman2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> morphant appears to most closely resemble a group of zebrafish notochord mutants characterized by a folded notochord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Stemple1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This group includes mutants with mutations in <italic>col8a1</italic> (type VIII collagen) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Gansner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>knypek</italic> (a heparan sulfate proteoglycan) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Topczewski1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and <italic>trilobite</italic>, which encodes a transmembrane protein involved in canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Jessen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations in <italic>trilobite</italic> and <italic>knypek</italic> have been linked to defects in convergence and extension movements during gastrulation while <italic>col8a1</italic> mutants show disruption of the fibrillar layer in the notochord sheath and protein aggregation in notochord cells. In contrast to the <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> morphants, the <italic>col8a1</italic> mutant shows notochord defects by 24 hpf and the notochord straightens by 3 dpf (pleiotropic defects would prevent analysis of a late phenotype) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Stemple1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This implies different requirements for notochord sheath structure during different developmental stages and suggests that there remains much to learn about the notochord sheath and its roles across stages. Inhibition or knockdown of lysyl oxidases, enzymes that cross-link collagens within the extracellular matrix, also result in an undulating notochord phenotype, confirming an important role for collagens and their related enzymes in notochord development and structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Anderson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Reynaud1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, lysyl oxidases are copper-dependent enzymes, and mutation of a copper transporting ATPase in a background of copper-deficiency results in post-embryonic vertebral defects similar to those described here for <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> morphants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Madsen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As nearly all fibrillar collagens are linked to human disease, we suspect that mutations in type XXVII collagen may also lead to disease. We previously sequenced <italic>COL27A1</italic> in patients with various chondrodysplasias, since mRNA and protein for type XXVII collagen were identified in cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Pace1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Hjorten1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we were unable to identify cartilage or other craniofacial defects in <italic>col27a1a</italic> and <italic>col27a1b</italic> zebrafish morphants at early or late stages, and our results suggest that the notochord is a key site of type XXVII collagen function. Analysis of the morphant phenotype as described in this study showed that zebrafish deficient in type XXVII collagen develop abnormal, dysmorphic vertebrae, indicating that the phenotype most closely resembles forms of congenital scoliosis. The genetic components of congenital scoliosis are largely unknown though mutations in the gene for Notch ligand delta-like 3 have been identified in a subset of individuals with vertebral segmentation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Bulman1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008481-Erol1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. There are many disorders characterized by congenital vertebral defects and mutations in <italic>COL27A1</italic> may play a role in the etiology of one or more of these disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of the Parichy lab for assistance with fish rearing.
